 NIGER
 Niger is ruled by an authoritarian military regime headed by
 General Ali Saibou, who took'power following the death of
 former President Seyni Kountche in November 1987. In 1989 the
 military remained firmly in control, but President Saibou
 promulgated a new Constitution, approved in a September 24,
 1989 referendum, which established a secular one-party state
 and replaced the Supreme Military Council with a joint
 civilian and military Superior Council of National Orientation
 as the nation's highest political body. Presidential and
 legislative elections in December 1989 offered voters only a
 yes or no choice on the nominees selected by the sole
 political party, the National Movement of the Development
 Society (MNSD).
 The Nigerien armed forces number about 2,600 members plus 800
 gendarmes (paramilitary police). Other security organizations
 are: the Directorate of State Security, which reports
 directly to the President; the National Police, which is
 responsible forlmaintaining public order and countering
 antigovernment activity; and a unit for presidential
 protection.
 Niger is one of the world's poorest countries. The economy is
 based on subsistence farming, livestock raising, and some of
 the world's largest uranium deposits. However, cycles of
 drought, desertification, a 3.1 percent population growth
 rate, and declining world demand for uranium since the early
 1980's have had a serious negative impact on the economy.
 Niger has a mixed economy with a number of government-owned
 enterprises and diverse private firms. The Government is
 attempting to reduce the number of these state firms and to
 encourage a greater role for private business.
 Basic human rights continued to be circumscribed in 1989, but
 there were significant advances, including the advent of a new
 Constitution and the release of almost all political
 prisoners. The new Constitution contains extensive guarantees
 of citizens' rights, including freedom of speech and press,
 which, if fully implemented, would represent a considerable
 step forward. However, significant restraints on freedom of
 speech and press remain.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions or
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reliable reports of systematic torture of
 prisoners or detainees in Niger. While occasional abuses by
 individual law enforcement or prison officers occur, the
 Government's policy banning physical abuse of prisoners and
 detainees appears to be applied in most cases. This
 
 
 262
 represents a significant improvement from the situation which
 prevailed prior to 1988. In two incidents in July 1989, law
 enforcement officers were punished for mistreatment of
 detainees. A total of five law enforcement officials were
 convicted and served 3-month jail terms each.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Article 84 of Niger's new Constitution specifically prohibits
 arbitrary detention, but its application in practice has yet
 to be tested. Police do not always need a warrant to arrest a
 suspect. Once an arrest is made, the law requires that the
 suspect be either charged or released within 48 hours. This
 period can be extended for an additional 48 hours by the
 public prosecutor, who is also the head of the judicial
 police. In practice, delays beyond those established periods
 occur, and prisoners often spend months in jail awaiting trial.
 Preventive detention is permitted under Nigerien law but must
 be ordered by an examining magistrate. Suspects are held in
 preventive detention for the duration of the magistrate's
 investigation of the case, which in some cases has taken as
 much as a year. Defendants are allowed access to a lawyer of
 their own choosing. There is a functioning system of bail for
 crimes carrying a penalty of less than 10 year's
 imprisonment. In 1989 President Saibou publicly called on
 judicial authorities to speed the process of bringing accused
 persons to trial.
 There were no reports of incommunicado detention. Also, there
 were no reports of arrest, detention, or punishment for
 expression of views critical of, or different from, those of
 the Government. As far as is known, there were no political
 detainees awaiting trial at the end of 1989. Exile is not
 used as a means of political control in Niger.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Niger's legal system is an amalgam of French, Islamic, and
 customary law. Civil and criminal cases not involving
 security-related acts are tried publicly. Defendants have the
 right to be present at their trials, to confront witnesses,
 and to present evidence. The new Constitution reaffirmed the
 judicial principle that the accused are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty. Defendants have the right to counsel at
 public expense if they are minors or if they are indigent and
 face the prospect of a sentence of 10 years or more. Both the
 defendant and the prosecutor can appeal verdicts, first to the
 Court of Appeals and then to the highest court, the State
 Court. Both courts are obliged to hear appeals. The Court of
 Appeals reviews both questions of fact and questions of law
 while the State Court limits its review to questions of law.
 Under the new Constitution, the Supreme Court, once
 established, will replace the State Court as the highest court
 and will review the decisions of the Court of Appeals.
 The Constitution calls for an independent judiciary but makes
 the President of the Republic, as Chief of the Executive
 Branch, the guarantor of this judicial independence. The
 President has the right of pardon in criminal cases and
 invoked this right on frequent occasions in recent years. At
 the village level, matters such as property disputes are
 frequently resolved by traditional courts.

 NIER
 In June 1985, the Kountche Government formed a special court
 to investigate Civil Service corruption. This court meets
 regularly and now only deals with embezzlement cases involving
 over $6,000. Another recent modification allows the accused
 to be released provisionally upon repayment of the sum
 embezzled.
 Security-related cases are tried in the State Security Court,
 which operates outside the normal legal framework. This
 Court, which has no permanent organization, was established by
 presidential decree in 1974. Its deliberations are held in
 secret. According to the Ministry of Justice, a military
 officer presides, but this Court includes civilian
 magistrates. It affords the defendant the same legal rights
 as he would receive in a criminal case, with the exception. of
 the right to a public trial. There were no known cases
 brought before this Court in 1989. Amnesty International, in
 its 1989 Report, criticized the Court's secrecy in retrying
 (at government Xequest) and convicting 19 persons (4 in
 absentia) in l9B8 for involvement in an unsuccessful coup
 attempt inOctober 1983. The Report concluded that a
 defendant's right to trial by an independent and impartial
 court had ngt been.respected.
 At the end of.1989, there were no political prisoners in
 Niger. On December 18, President Saibou released the last two
 prisoners incarcerated for participation in the 1983 coup
 attempt against former President Kountche.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The police need a search warrant- to enter homes except in
 cases involving major crimes, when they can enter at any time
 without a warrant. Search warrants do not permit searches
 between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. There is no forced
 membership in any political organization, including the one
 legal political party. Violations of privacy, such as.
 interference with correspondence, are illegal but are known to
 take place.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The new Nigerien Constitution affirms the citizen's right to
 freedom of opinion, thought, expression, press, publication,
 and publicity but does not specifically prohibit government
 action banning offensive material. President Saibou has said
 repeatedly in his public speeches that free expression of all
 viewpoints and political opinions will be allowed within the
 sole political movement, the MNSD. In practice, there are
 definite restrictions on freedom of speech and press. Major
 print and electronic media are government owned and
 controlled. Limited criticism of certain government officials
 and some policies is allowed, but attacks on the Chief of
 State, his major policies, or the legitimacy of the regime are
 not tolerated. As a practical matter, journalists are
 familiar with these guidelines, and there were no known cases
 of journalists being sanctioned in 1989.
 There were no reports in 1989 of censored or banned magazines
 or other publications. Foreign films are subject to
 censorship by the Ministry of Interior on grounds of public
 morality and political content.

 NIGER
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Niger is a one-party state which does not permit the assembly
 or establishment of rival political groups. Permits must be
 obtained from the Ministry of Interior or local police
 authorities for public gatherings. Permission is routinely
 granted only to recognized groups, e.g., trade unions and
 churches. The Government requires the registration of private
 associations with the Ministry of Interior and grants such
 registration only to organizations which operate within the
 framework of the Government's policy. Ethnic or racial
 associations as well as associations which the Government
 believes threaten national unity are prohibited.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is a secuiar state. while the population is over 90
 percent Muslim,-the Government permits the practice of other
 religious beliefs. Foreign missionaries can live, work, and
 travel in Niger but must obtain permission from the Ministry
 of Interior for all of their operations. Religious groups are
 allowed to maintain links with fellow believers in other
 countries. Religious groups may maintain places of worship,
 train clergy, publish religious material, provide religious
 education, and participate in charitable activities.
 The Government, concerned by the Islamic fundamentalist
 violence that erupts periodically in nearby northern Nigeria,
 monitors Muslim religious activity through the Islamic
 Association. This Association is funded by the Government and
 assists in an informal screening process of local religious
 leaders. Islamic services that go beyond strictly religious
 subjects are not permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger is closely monitored, although there was
 further relaxation during 1989. Police checks, often
 entailing thorough searches, take place upon entering or
 leaving major towns and cities. The former requirement for an
 exit visa to leave Niger has been abolished. Neither
 emigration nor repatriation are restricted. By law, married
 women must have the permission of their husbands to travel
 abroad.
 Niger is a party to the U.N. Convention and Protocol Relating
 to the Status of Refugees and has cooperated with the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees in handling the few registered
 refugees currently in Niger. There was no forced resettlement
 in 1989.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The armed forces, under President Saibou, continue to dominate
 the State leaving no realistic means for the citizens to
 change the Government. Niger's new Constitution calls for a
 one-party state and a strong presidency. Legislative and
 presidential elections are held every 5 and 7 years
 respectively. They offer voters only a yes or no option on a
 slate of candidates selected by the sole legal political body,
 
 
 NIGER
 the MNSD, created as part of Niger's return to constitutional
 government after 15 years of direct military rule.
 Other new institutions include the Superior Council of
 National Orientation (CSON) and a National'Executive Bureau
 (BEN). The President appoints most of the members of both the
 CSON and the BEN as well as all of the members of the
 Cabinet. The top three positions in the National Executive
 Bureau are held by military officers as are a third of the
 seats on the CSON. President Ali Saibou heads both the CSON
 and the BEN and appoints all regional governors, who are
 military officers. Through these new institutions, the former
 military regime hopes to improve consultation with, and
 participation by, civilians in government while protecting the
 politidal interests of the military and avoiding competition
 from alternative political organizations.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is cooperative in answering inquiries on the
 status of political prisoners of interest to international
 human rights groups. There are no domestic groups which
 monitor the human rights situation in Niger. Niger is not
 active in regional and international human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Four major ethnic groups, each with its own language, make up
 the bulk of the population. The two primarily nomadic groups,
 Tuaregs and Fulani (Peul), have less access to government
 services, partly because their transient lifestyles make it
 difficult for the Government to supply them with services.
 By tradition and practice, women occupy a subordinate place in
 Nigerien society. Males have considerable advantages in terms
 of education, employment, and property rights. In cases of
 divorce, custody of all children under 8 years of age is given
 to the husband.
 Conscious of the adverse situation of women, the Government
 has begun work on a new family code, tried to provide better
 employment opportunities to women, and supported a national
 women's association. Women are paid comparable wages to that
 of men and are active in the business community, although
 commerce is dominated by men. The first professional
 associations of women traders, educators, and bankers were
 formed in 1988. About one-third of Nigerien doctors are
 women, and many of the nation's magistrates are women. The
 Government continues to encourage family planning and in 1988
 formally legalized the use of contraceptives. Female genital
 mutilation (circumcision) occurs but is not believed to be
 widespread. It has not received extensive attention from the
 Government, but during 1989 government media covered in detail
 campaigns by the U.N. Children's Fund and the World Health
 Organization to abolish this practice.
 Violence against women and children, including wife beating,
 occurs, but the extent of the problem of violence is unknown.
 However, it is considered antisocial behavior in Nigerien
 society, and women often turn to both traditional and modern
 judicial authorities in cases of abuse. The new family code
 
 
 266
 NIGER
 now under preparation specifically addresses domestic violence
 and is reported to strengthen existing legal provisions in
 this area. In 1989 a Ministry of Women's and Social Affairs
 was created which has a broad mandate to improve the lot of
 women in society. The.Association of Nigerien Women focused
 on the topic of violence against women at several of its
 conferences, which received substantial publicity in the
 government media.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Approximately 90 percent of Niger's work force is employed in
 the rural, largely subsistence sector. In the small modern
 economy, workers have the right to establish and join trade
 unions, which are organized under an umbrella group, the
 National Union of Nigerien Workers (USTN). The USTN is
 nominally independent but is partially funded by the
 Government and is usually responsive to government policies.
 The USTN has an. observer in the MNSD but is not part of the
 party structure. The head of the USTN is elected by its
 members. The USTN represents about 30 percent of the
 approximately 60,000 salaried workers in Niger.
 Strikes in Niger are legal if conciliation and mediation
 procedures have been exhausted. During 1989 there were
 strikes by bank employees, miners, and airline employees, all
 of which were resolved by negotiation.
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and abides by its policy of having no formal
 affiliations outside the African continent.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is legally authorized, but the
 Government is deeply involved in the process. Individual
 unions are permitted to bargain for more favorable agreements
 at their work sites. The Government promotes voluntary
 worker-employer negotiations but does not sit at the
 bargaining table in private sector negotiations. If these
 negotiations fail, the Government becomes the arbitrator.
 There is a basic framework agreement which has been in force
 since 1972 between the USTN, employers, and the Government.
 The agreement covers wages and benefits and is extensively
 applied to all sectors of the urban wage economy. This
 agreement protects workers against antiunion discrimination.
 Labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country,
 and there are no export processing zones in Niger.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Niger's labor code prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 it is generally not practiced. The last reported instance of
 forced labor was during the 1985 drought emergency when
 displaced herders, primarily ethnic Tuaregs and Fulanis, were
 in some instances required to work on food-growing projects.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children between the ages of 12 and 18 may be employed, but
 there are strict provisions concerning the hours of employment
 
 
 267
 NIGER
 and types of employment for children in this age group. All
 labor provisions, including those concerning child labor, are
 applied in practice only in urban areas. In the subsistence
 agricultural sector, which employs-most Nigeriens, children
 work on family plots under conditions which are not in
 compliance with the provisions of the labor code. Education
 is by law free and compulsory from age 7. However, only about
 a quarter of Nigerien children of primary school age actually
 attend schools, with an even lower proportion attending middle
 school and high school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage for salaried workers is approximately
 $66 per'month. According to union officials, this wage is not
 sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their
 families. Because of the country's depressed economy, the
 Government has increased salaries by only 6 percent since
 1980, despite tfte rising cost of living.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours. However, according to the
 labor code, certain occupations requiring irregular hours are
 authorized longer workweeks, with a maximum of 72 hours. The
 labor code also provides occupational safety and health
 regulations which are enforced by the labor inspectors in the
 Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Professional Training.
 Because of staff shortages, this office focuses mainly on the
 mining, building, and industrial sectors for safety
 violations. According to a Ministry official, compliance is
 often difficult to enforce because of the attitude of the
 workers who are'relatively uneducated and are therefore not
 fully cognizant of the safety risks posed in their jobs. They
 often complain and refuse to wear protective clothing because
 of Niger's hot climate. For the most part, employers have
 been responsive in providing safety equipment.
