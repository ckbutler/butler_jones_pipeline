 IRAN*
 Iran is an Islamic republic under the leadership of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The
 formal system of government, based on a Constitution approved in 1980 by popular
 referendum and revised in July 1989, features a Parliament and a President elected
 from among multiple candidates by universal suffrage. However, all candidates
 must meet highly restrictive religious and political criteria imposed by the Council
 of Guardians, and as a result the choice offered to voters is narrow. The Govern-
 ment, dominated by a political elite composed of Shi'a Muslim clerics and of laymen
 allied with these clerics, attempts to impose its views of political and socioreligious
 orthodoxy. However, there remain significant factional differences on important eco-
 nomic and political issues.
 The Government continues to reinforce its hold on power through arrests, sum-
 mary trials and executions, and other forms of intimidation carried out by an exten-
 sive internal security system. The Revolutionary Guards and security forces operat-
 ing under the Ministry of Intelligence and Security and the Interior Ministry are
 known to make political arrests and commit other human rights abuses.
 Iran has a mixed economy. Although Islam guarantees the right to private owner-
 ship, the Government has nationalized the banks and owns several basic industries,
 including the petroleum and utilities sectors. Oil exports are the primary source of
 foreign exchange. The disruptions of the revolution, the destruction from the Iran-
 Iraq war, and government mismanagement have caused serious economic deteriora-
 tion. However, inflation has apparently been reduced from previous years, although
 it is thought to be still over 20 percent; about 30 percent of the work force is unem-
 played, and widespread corruption and black-market activities continue.
 There was no evidence of significant improvement in Iran's record as a major
 abuser of human rights. As in the past, the Government went to considerable
 lengths to conceal its abuses and continued to obstruct the activities of international
 human rights monitors. It is thus difficult to know precisely the details and num-
 bers of such abuses. Similarly, domestic elements that might monitor and report on
 the Government's practices are ruthlessly suppressed. Abuses continued to include
 denial of citizens' right to change their government; summary executions; wide-
 spread torture; arbitrary detentions; lack of fair trials; repression of the freedoms
 of speech, press, assembly, and association; systematic repression of the Baha'i reli-
 gious community; and severe restrictions on women's and worker rights. The Gov-
 ernment has not allowed Reynaldo Galindo-Pohl, the U.N. Special Representative on
 Human Rights, to revisit Iran since 1991 and did not implement the measures he
 recommended in his 1993 report.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGITS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Given the lack of basic procedural
 safeguards in political trials, most of the executions ordered each year in such cases
 amount to summary executions. Furthermore, the Government has repeatedly indi-
 cated in public statements that it equates active political opposition to Iran's Islamic
 revolution with terrorism.
 The Iranian press stopped reporting most executions in 1992, making it difficult
 to determine the number of people killed forplitical reasons in 1993, but it appears
 executions continue at their previous rate of several hundred a year. In September
 the U.N. Special Representative reported obtaining a copy of an Iranian government
 document showing that Iranian media had eliminated most coverage of executions
 in order to preempt the Special Representative's criticism. Reports from exiles and
 *Because of the absence of a United States Mission in Iran, this report draws heavily on unof-
 ficial sources.
 
 
 1177
 human rights monitoring groups indicate many of those executed for alleged crimi-
 nal offenses are in fact political dissidents.
 For example, Amnesty International (A) reported the execution during 1993 of
 Mohsen Mohammadi Sabet, who had been held incommunicado in Rasht prison
 since September or October 1992. The Government has refused to reply to AYs re-
 quests for information regarding the precise charges brought against Sabet. Accord-
 ing to Al, the legal proceedings in Sabet's case failed to meet minimum inter-
 national standards of fairness and impartiality.
 In addition, the Government continued to carry out political assassinations of its
 opponents residing abroad. On January 24, Turkish journalist Ugur Mumcu was
 killed in Ankara by a car bomb; an Iranian-backed Turkish group was believed re-
 sponsible. On March 16, Naghdi Mohammed Hussein, a leader of the opposition
 Mojahedin-e-Khalq, was assassinated in Rome. (Naghdis name was among those on
 a list of 32 Iranian oppositionists found in the possession of one of the suspects in
 the 1992 assassinations of Kurds in Berlin.) On March 18 three Iranian Baluchi
 insurgency leaders were murdered in Karachi. In June another Mojahedin-e-Khalq
 activist, Mohammed Hassan Arbab, was killed in Karachi along with a bystander-
 another bystander, a child, was seriously injured. In October an assailant wounded
 William Nygaard, the Norwegian translator of Salman Rushdie's book "The Satanic
 Verses." Investigators have not yet determined the motive for the assault.
 The Frenr, Government's investigation into the assassination in August 1991 of
 former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar and his assistant continued; two sus-
 pects, Iranian government officials, were under arrest awaiting trial. In the case of
 the murder in Berlin of four Iranian Kurdish dissidents in 1992, a German prosecu-
 tor announced in May that Kazem Darabi, who is in a German prison awaiting trial
 for the killings, is an agent of the Iranian intelligence service.
 b. Disappearance.-No reliable information is available on the number of dis-
 appearances in 1993. Many families of executed political prisoners reportedly have
 not been informed officially of their relatives' deaths. In 1993 the Government again
 responded to many of the U.N. Special Representative's requests for information on
 specific prisoners by denying that it had any judicial record of them.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Them continued to be credible reports of the torture and ill- treatment of detainees.
 Common methods of torture are said to include suspension for long periods in con-
 torted positions, burning with cigarettes, and, most frequently, severe and repeated
 beatings with cables or other instruments on the back and on the soles of the feet.
 Prisoners are frequently held in solitary confinement or denied adequate rations or
 medical care as a way of forcing them to confess.
 The U.N. Special Representative reported in 1993 that the Government has taken
 no measures to establish legal or procedural safeguards against the torture of pris-
 oners. There were no reports of law enforcement personnel being held accountable
 for torture or other abuses. In 1992 the Government expelled workers of the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) who had been visiting detainees. The
 Government has still not permitted the ICRC to resume this activity in Iran. Infor-
 mation on prison conditions in 1993 was not available. However, prisoner protests
 against poor prison conditions in the past reportedly prompted beatings, denial of
 medical care, and, in some cases, execution.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile. -Arbitrary arrest and detention has been
 common in the past, but it is not known how many cases there were in 1993. It
 is known that some ersons were arrested on trumped-up criminal charges when
 their actual "offenses were political. The lack of fair trials and other procedural
 safeguards encourage such practices.
 BHaa'is continued to face arbitrary arrest and detention. The Government contin-
 ued its practice of detaining a small but relatively steady number of Baha'is at any
 one time.
 No judicial determination of the legality of detention exists in Iranian law, and
 there is reportedly no legal time limit on incommunicado detention. Suspects are
 held for questioning at local Revolutionary Guard offices or in jails.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There are essentially two different court systems.
 The civil courts deal with criminal offenses, and the revolutionary courts, estab-
 lished in 1979, try "political" offenses as well as cases involving narcotics trafficking
 and "crimes against God."
 In January the Special Representative reported that trials in Iran continue to fall
 far short of internationally accepted standards. Trials by revolutionary courts, espe-
 cially, cannot be considered fair or public. Some trials are conducted in secret. If
 the trial is staged publicly, it is generally because the prisoner has already been
 forced to confess to a crime. Persons tried by the revolutionary courts (including in
 drug trafficking cases) enjoy virtually no procedural or substantive safeguards. The
 
 
 1178
 
 accused are often indicted under broad and all-encompassing charges such as "moral
 corruption," "antirevolutionary behavior," and "siding with global arrogance." Trials
 lasting 5 minutes and less are common.
 The right to a defense counsel is theoretically provided for in Iranian law and in
 the Constitution, but in the revolutionary courts defendants are not known to have
 access to a lawyer; moreover, they are not able to call witnesses on their behalf or
 to appeal. Courts have failed to investigate allegations by defendants that they were
 subjected to torture during pretrial detention. ome persons have been imprisoned
 beyond the limit of their sentence and even executed after the formal expiration of
 their prison term.
 There was again no evidence in 1993 of any judicial reform that would bring Ira-
 nian courts into compliance with international standards; the Special Representa-
 tive noted in his January 1993 report that a new law on legal representation-
 which provides that any Muslim is eligible to represent the accused in court-does
 not in fact provide for qualified legal counsel.
 The judicial system is further weakened by the fact that revolutionary courts may
 consider cases formally under the jurisdiction of the civil and criminal courts. As-
 signment of cases to regular rather than revolutionary courts is haphazard and ap-
 parently occurs mainly when arrests are made by regular police. Revolutionary
 courts may also overturn the decisions of the civilian courts. The review authority
 of the Supreme Court is limited.
 For common criminal offenses, many elements of the prerevolutionary judicial sys-
 tem survive, and the accused often have the right to a public trial with benefit of
 lawyers of their own choosing. Even this judiciary is not fully independent, however.
 Many of the former judges were retired after the revolution, and new judges were
 selected. One criterion for new judges is grounding in Islamic law; political accept-
 ability is a requirement for any government position. According to the New York-
 based Lawyers Committee for Human.Rights, the 1982 Law on the Qualifications
 for the Appointment of Judges discriminates on the grounds of religion, sex, and po-
 litical opinion, while at the same time permitting the appointment of judges and
 prosecutors who have no legal training or experience. Some judges reportedly prefer
 to base their judgments on the guidance of religious scholars rather than on the law.
 Because the Government continues to block the activities of international human
 rights observers, no reliable estimate is available on the number of political pris-
 oners, but knowledgeable sources estimate them in the thousands.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government rejects the Western distinction between a public sphere which the State
 may control and a sphere of private life (religion, culture, thought, and private be-
 havior) which the State may not properly control. Before 1982, authorities entered
 homes and offices, wiretapped telephones, and opened mail. These activities are re-
 portedly less common now.
 Special Revolutionary Guard units and security forces check on social activities.
 Women whose clothing does not completely cover the hair and all of the body except
 hands and face, or who wear makeup, are subject to arrest (see also Section 5).
 Crackdowns often result in widespread harassment of women in the streets. Men
 have also periodically been required to dress "modestly." During the spring and
 summer of 1993, both official and self-appointed enforcers campaigned against insuf-
 ficiently modest dress and even sunglasses. For example, the commander of the law
 enforcement forces in Tehran stated that 802 men and women were detained from
 June 16 through 23 for various dress code violations in Tehran.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-iAccording to the Constitution, "publications and
 the press may express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic prin-
 ciples, or are detrimental to public rights." In practice, most publications are con-
 trolled by the Government; independent publishers run the risk not only of press
 shutdowns, pressure from the Government newsprint monopoly, and confiscation of
 publications and equipment, but of arrest and summary punishment if they are
 overly critical of the Government. The editor and two employees of the magazine
 Farad were jailed in 1992 for publishing a cartoon which the authorities deemed in-
 sulting to the late Ayatollah Khomeini. In October after the cartoonist, Manoucher
 Karimzadeh, completed his sentence, the Supreme Court ruled that his punishment
 had been insufficient and sentenced him to an additional 10 years' imprisonment.
 In August Revolutionary Guards detained the publisher of the radical daily
 Salam, Musavi Kho'iniha, as well as the newspaper's chief editor, 'Abbas 'Abdi. The
 detentions were apparently in retaliation for criticism of the judicial authorities.
 Both men were freed on bail after the newspaper printed a retraction of its criti-
 cism. In September authorities detained Mehdi Nasiri, editor of the Tehran daily
 
 
 1179
 Keyhan, after the newspaper printed criticism of Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Yazdi,
 chief of the judiciary. Nasiri was released on bail after several days in detention but
 still faces a trial before a special "press jury" on charges of slander. In October Colo-
 nel Nasrullah Tavakoli, a retired army officer, was arrested and placed in incommu-
 nicado detention, apparently for writing a series of open letters critical of the cur-
 rent Government.
 All books must be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance for
 review before they may be published. Publishers, authors, and printers also engage
 in substantial self-censorship before submitting books to the Ministry in an effort
 to avoid the substantial penalties, including economic losses, incurred when books
 are rejected. Iranian authorities have interpreted broadly their authority to censor
 on religious grounds, including official acceptance of the February 1989 religious de-
 cree condeming British author Salman Rushdie to death for his book The Satanic
 Verses." On each anniversary of the decree since 1992, a group of exiled Iranian
 writers has signed a public condemnation of the decree; the Iranian Government
 has respondedby banning the writings of the authors signing the condemnation. By
 mid-1993, the Government had banned the works of 162 such signatories.
 Newspapers, which are usually associated with various government factions, re-
 flect a variety of viewpoints. Generally, newspapers can and do criticize government
 policies and officials both in their reporting and editorials. They are forbidden, how-
 ever, to criticize the concept of the islamic republic or to promote ethnic minority
 rights. Nevertheless, some independent publishers out of favor with the Government
 continue to survive, and some books and pamphlets critical of the Government are
 published without reprisal. Foreign books, newspapers, and magazines may be im-
 ported only after they have been reviewed by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and
 Guidance.
 All broadcasting facilities are government owned, and the content of their broad-
 casting reflects the political and socioreligious ideology of the Government.
 Although restrictions on academic freedom have been eased somewhat, course
 content is still monitored and there is little genuine critical discussion of issues. In-
 formers are said to be common on campus and in the classroom. Admission to uni-
 versities is politicized; all applicants must pass "character tests" in which officials
 review applicants' background and ideology with the students' hometown religious
 authorities and neighborhood groups. This process serves to exclude from univer-
 sities and the professions those who are critical of the Government's revolutionary
 ideology. To achieve tenure, professors reportedly must cooperate with government
 security agencies over a period of years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution permits un-
 armed assemblies and marches "provided they do not violate the principles of
 Islam." In practice, the only ones permitted are those sponsored by the Government,
 such as Friday prayers and parades and demonstrations on official occasions. Ac-
 cording to opposition sources, a student protest in March at Beheshti high school
 in west Tehran was crushed by antiriot police units who arrested approximately 80
 students.
 The Constitution also allows the formation of political parties, groups, and profes-
 sional associations, as well as Islamic and some minority religious associations, pro-
 vided they do not violate the principles of "freedom, sovereignty, (and) national
 unity" or question Islam or the Islamic Republic. In practice, most independent or-
 ganizations have either been banned, co-opted by the Government, or are moribund.
 The authorities continued to harass the Freedom Movement, founded in 1961 and
 declared illegal in 1991, ta  in its telephones, opening its mail, and subjecting its
 members to intimidation. Whi e the Freedom Movement participated in the first
 parliamentary election after the revolution, it has been prevented from doing so in
 all subsequent elections.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--The state religion is Islam, and religion is almost insepa-
 rable from government in Iran. The President and many other top officials are
 mullahs (Islamic clergymen), as are the Speaker of the Parliament and many of the
 parliamentary deputies.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims. Aside from slightly over
 I percent who are non-Muslims (Baha'is, Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews), the
 rest are Sunni Muslims. The Sunnis are mostly Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans, Baluch,
 and other ethnic minorities whose political influence is very limited. The Constitu-
 tion declares that "the official religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed is
 Ja'fari Shi'ism," but it also states that "other Islamic denominations shall enjoy
 complete respect."
 The small Christian. Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic religion of Iran)
 populations are concentrated mainly in urban areas. The Constitution recognizes
 their religions, and they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in the Par-
 
 
 1180
 
 liament. They are permitted to practice their religions, to instruct their children,
 and-although with a great deal of disruptive interference-to maintain schools.
 Nevertheless, official harassment is commonplace. In June the U.N. Committee on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights observed that the U.N. Special Representa-
 tive's report "confirm(ed) the broad consensus that there has been practically no
 progress in ensuring greater respect and protection for the rights of the non-Muslim
 religious communities7 in Iran.
 Mehdi Debadi, a Christian convert from Islam arrested in 1983, was held in pris-
 on until December 1993, when Christian missionary groups reported that a court
 in Sari sentenced him to death for apostasy. Following international appeals on his
 behalf, Debadj was released in January 1994. According to the Government, his case
 is still "under investigation."
 The Government continues to discriminate against the Baha'i community, Iran's
 largest non-Muslim minority (300,000 to 350,000 members). The Baha'i religion is
 considered a "misguided sect" by the authorities. It is not officially recognized, and
 Baha'is may not teach their faith.
 In 1993 Tehran municipal authorities built a cultural center on the site of a
 Baha'i cemetery. Immediately after the 1978-1979 revolution, the cemetery's mark-
 ers were removed (some reportedly were auctioned off), and the site was turned into
 a park. The new construction in 1993 involved excavations that reportedly dese-
 crated Baha'i graves. The U.S. and other governments condemned the desecration
 and called on Iran to halt the project. There is no indication, however, that the Ira-
 nian authorities stopped the construction.
 The treatment of aha'is varies somewhat, depending on the jurisdiction; in other
 places, Baha'is were still able to bury their dead in Baha'i cemeteries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Iranians may travel to any part of Iran, although there have been re-
 strictions on travel to Kurdish areas at times of heavy fighting. Persons may change
 their place of residence without obtaining permission. According to the Government,
 approximately 3 million refugees, primarily Afghans but also Kurdish and Shi'a ref-
 ugees displaced from Iraq in the aftermath of the Gulf war, remained in Iran in
 mid-1993.
 Males of draft age are not issued exit permits except for approved courses of
 study, and Iranians who are suspect politically, such as some retired military offi-
 cers and high-level public officials under the former regime, are not able to leave
 the country. Some Iranians, particularly those whose skills are in short supply and
 who were educated at government expense, have had to post bonds to obtain exit
 permits. There was no evidence that this situation improved in 1993.
 Iranian Jews are permitted to obtain passports andto travel (including to Israel)
 but they are normally denied the multiple-exit permits given to most Iranians and
 must make a new application (with another fee) for each planned trip. Permission
 is not normally granted for all members of a Jewish family to travel outside Iran
 at the same time.
 The Government actively encourages the many thousands of skilled Iranians liv-
 ing abroad to return to help rebuild the country. Of those who have returned in re-
 cent years, a number have been able to pursue, through the Iranian judicial system,
 the restoration of their properties. However, many expes complain that formal legai
 guarantees of their safety have not yet been provided, and, as a result, many remain
 reluctant to return.
 There are some categories of persons who may be in danger if they return to Iran.
 Some of those with close ties to the former regime, draft evaders, and those who
 departed the country illegally face possible arrest upon their return. Members of or
 sympathizers with the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran or the Communist
 Tudeh Party, both opposition groups banned by the Government are subject to im-
 prisonment and torture or even execution should they return. in his 1993 report,
 the Special Representative recounted several cases of exiles and Baha'is who were
 harassed after returning to Iran. Nevertheless, immediate relatives of persons want-
 ed by the Government are often able to live in Iran, travel abroad, and return with-
 out undue difficulty.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped "not valid for emigration, " but the
 Government does not make a clear distinction between legal residence in another
 country and emigration. According to the regulations, Iranians with a legal resi-
 dence outside Iran may be issued passports and advance exit permits by the Iranian
 embassy, consulate, or interests section in their country of residence. The Govern-
 ment does not recognize dual nationality and considers Iranian-born U.S. citizens
 to be Iranians unless they formally renounce their Iranian citizenship in accordance
 with Iranian law. There have been many instances in which Iranian authorities
 have confiscated the passports of dual nationals.
 
 
 1181
 The Government of Iran and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) estimate there were approximately 2.1 million Afghan refugees in Iran in
 mid-1993. The majority of these refugees have been integrated into Iranian life. The
 remainder live either seminomadic lives or reside in government settlements in
 central and eastern Iran. The Government provided assistance to those refugees.
 The UNHCR is supervising the repatriation of Afghan refugees to Afghanistan.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Iranian citizens do not enjoy the right to change their government peacefully. Iran
 is ruled by a group of religious leaders (mullahs) and their lay associates who share
 a belief in the legitimacy of a theocratic state based on Ayatollah Khomeini's inter-
 pretation of Shi'a Islam.
 The revolutionary Government has held elections at fairly regular intervals for
 president, Parliament deputies, members of the Assembly of Experts (responsible for
 *hoosing the Revolutionary Leader's succe sor) and members of local government
 councils. Presidential elections were held in June, resulting in the reelection vf
 Hoijat ol-Eslam Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Voting is by universal suffrage of
 everyone age 15 and older and is by secret ballot. All candidates must be approved
 by the Council of Guardians, however, and only those meeting the Council's vaguely
 described political and religious criteria may run. In practice, only supporters of the
 theocratic state are accepted, and even clerics are often disqualified if their positions
 vary from the official line.
 A few political parties have been licensed following the Ministry of Interior's an-
 nouncement in December 1988 that political parties would be allowed to form, pro-
 vided they met the Government's religious and political criteria.
 The Constitution provides for an independent Parliament, which exists to a large
 degree in practice. While Parliament deputies are typically allied with various pow-
 erful political and religious officials, they may spea and vote independently and
 may shift from one faction to another. Vigorous parliamentary debates-normally
 covered extensively in the press--cover a wide variety of issues. Harsh criticism of
 government officials is often heard in these debates, and, in some cases, laws pro-
 posed by the executive branch have been voted down.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed of 12 members:
 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by the Leader, and 6 lay members well grounded
 in Islamic law who are nominated by the head of the judiciary, subject to the Par-
 liament's approval. The Council of Guardians must certify all bills passed by the
 Parliament as being in accordance with Islamic law and the Constitution. If bills
 fail to be certified, they are sent back to the Parliament for revision. The Council
 of Guardians can and does reject important bills and portions of bills passed by the
 Parliament. The Council for the Discernment of Expediency, a body created in 1988,
 resolves those legislative issues on which the Parliament and Council of Guardians
 disagree. Approximately 4 percent of Parliament members are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Iranian organizations that attempt to speak out on human rights, such as the
 Freedom Movement and the Association for the Protection of Liberties and Human
 Rights, face severe harassment by the Government. In the past, the Government
 generally has been uncooperative with foreign human rights groups, whether gov-
 ernment sponsored or independent, regarding their activities as interference in the
 country's internal affairs.
 The U.N. Special Representative has not been able to visit Iran since his third
 visit in 1991; by the end of 1993, the Iranian Government had not replied to his
 repeated requests to return to Iran. At the United Nations, Iran continued its ef-
 forts to restrict the Special Representative's mandate.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Women.-The discrimination that women have traditionally faced in Iranian soci-
 ety has increased since the revolution. Ultraconservative dress, entirely hiding the
 hair and all of the body except the face and hands, is a requirement for all women,
 regardless of their religion, national origin or citizenship. Women have been har-
 assed, detained, or physically attacked if they appeared in public in clothing that
 official or self-appointed guardians of public morality deemed insufficiently modest.
 Enforcement of these rules has varied considerably since Ayatollah Khomeini's
 death in 1989; there was a widespread surge in enforcement during 1993 (see Sec-
 tion 1.f). According to press reports, a teenaged girl was accident-;lly shot in Tehran
 in late August after being stopped on the street by a police conscript for breaking
 the Islamic dress code.
 
 
 1182
 Although violence against women is known to occur, little is known about its ex-
 tent. Abuse within the family is considered a private matter in this conservative so-
 ciety and is seldom discussed publicly. There are no official statistics on the subject.
 In the past, there have been credible reports of the torture and execution of women
 detainees.
 Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to divorce their husbands,
 and regulations promulgated in 1984 substantially broadened the number of
 grounds for which a woman may seek divorce. A husband may obtain a divorce
 without stating a reason or going to court. In December 1992 the Council for the
 Discernment of Expediency reversed itself and ratified a bill already passed by the
 Parliament which added somewhat to a divorced woman's right to financial support
 from her ex-husband. It is not clear yet whether this adjustment has had any im-
 pact in practice.
 Children.-Iranian law includes provisions that prohibit the use of child labor in
 industry (see section 6.d.) No information was available on the enforcement of these
 statutes.
 Religious Minorities.-The Christian Jewish Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination in a number of areas
 particularly with respect to employment, education, public accommodations, and
 property ownership. In 1993 non-Muslim owners of restaurants were required to
 post a distinctive notice in the windows of their establishments.
 Muslims who have converted to Christianity are similarly discriminated against.
 University applicants are required to pass an examination in Islamic theology. This
 has the effect of limiting most religious minorities' access to higher education, al-
 though all students must receive instruction on Islam regardless of their religion.
 Applicants for public sector employment are similarly screened for adherence to
 standards of Islamic orthodoxy, with much the same effect. Religious minorities
 have also suffered discrimination in the legal system, receiving lower awards in in-
 jury and death lawsuits and suffering heavier punishments than those imposed on
 Muslims. Although Sunnis have encountered religious discrimination on the local
 level, the Government has tried to reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 The Government has stated that it will protect the "social and legal rights" of Ba-
 ha'is as "normal citizens," but in practice there is widespread persecution and dis-
 crimination in many areas of public life. Baha'i marriages are not recognized, and
 Baha'is are forbidden to participate in social welfare organizations.
 In 1993 the Special Representative reported obLaining reliable information on an
 internal Iranian government directive setting out policy on the Baha'is. In the direc-
 tive, dated February 1992, the Supreme Revolutionary Council instructed govern-
 ment agencies to block the progress and development of the Baha'i community;
 expel from the universities students identified as Baha'is; seek to cut the Baha'is'
 links outside Iran; restrict employment for those who identify themselves as Baha'is;
 and deny Baha'is "positions of influence," including in the education sector. The
 Government claims the policy directive is a forgery; it appears, however, to reflect
 accurately current government practice.
 The Government continued to return some of the property of individual Baha'is
 that it had previously confiscated, although the amount represents a small fraction
 of the total seized. Property of the community, su~ch as places of worship, remains
 confiscated. Most Baha is are now able to obtain food ration booklets. Bahai chil-
 dren are now permitted to attend grade school and high school but are generally
 not permitted to attend college or be employed on college faculties. A small number
 of Baha'is were permitted to leave the country. While some Baha'i's have been is-
 sued passports, the majority of such applications are denied.
 Some Baha'is continue to be denied public sector (and often private sector) em-
 ployment on account of their religion; in a number of cases, ration cards have been
 denied on the same grounds. Thousands of Baha'is dismissed from government jobs
 in the early 1980's receive no unemployment benefits and have been required to
 repay the Government for salaries or pensions received from the first day of employ-
 ment. Those unable to do so face prison sentences.
 d. People with Disabilities.-There is no information available on government pol-
 icy with respect to people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Article 131 of the Labor Code grants workers and
 employers alike the right to form and join their own organizations. In practice, how-
 ever, there are no real labor unions in Iran. A national organization known as the
 Worker's House, founded in 1982 as the labor wing of the now defunct Islamic Re-
 publican Party, is the only authorized national labor organization with nominal
 claims to represent all Iranian workers. It works closely with the workplace Islamic
 
 
 1183
 councils that exist in many Iranian enterprises. The Workers' House is largely a
 conduit of government influence and control, not a trade union founded by workers
 to represent their interests.
 The officially sanctioned Islamic labor councils also function as instruments of
 government influence and not as bodies created and controlled by workers to ad-
 vance their own interests, although the councils have frequently been able to block
 layoffs or the firing of workers.
 A network of guild unions operates on a regional basis. These guild unions issue
 vocational licenses, fund financial cooperatives to assist members, and help workers
 to find jobs. The guild unions operate with the backing of the Government.
 According to opposition sources, there were several protests and strikes during the
 sprg, including a strike involving thousands of workers at a tractor factory in
 ariz, a walkout to protest nonpayment of salaries at a government sugar factory
 in western Iran, and strikes in textile factories in northern Iran and near Tehran.
 In the past the Government has not tolerated any strike deemed to be at odds with
 its economic and labor policies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize independently and bargain collectively cannot be documented. It is not known
 whether  abor legislation and practice in the export processing zones differ in any
 significant respect from the law and practice in the rest of the country. No informa-
 tion is available on mechanisms used to set wages.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Section 273 of the Iranian Penal
 Code provides that any person who does not have definite means of subsistence and
 who, through laziness or negligence, does not look for work may be obliged by the
 Government to take suitable employment. This provision has been frequently criti-
 cized by the International Labor Organization (ILO) as contravening ILO Conven-
 tion 29 on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-lranian labor law, which exempts
 agriculture, domestic servce, family businesses, and, to some extent, other small
 businesses, forbids employment of minors under 15 years of age (compulsory edu-
 cation extends throuh age 11) and places special restrictions on the employment
 of minors under 18.  a adion, women and minors may not be used for hard labor
 or, in general, for night work. Information on the extent to which these regulations
 are enforced by the Labor Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labor and So-
 cial Affairs and the local authorities is not available.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code empowers the Supreme Labor
 Council to set minimum wage levels each year determined by industrial sector and
 region. It is not known if minimum wage levels are in fact issued annually or if the
 La or Ministry's inspectors enforce their application. The Labor Code stipulates that
 the minimum wage should be sufficient to meet the living expenses of a family and
 should take into account the announced rate of inflation. Information on the share
 of the working population covered by the minimum wage legislation or the share
 of the work force receiving a decent wage is not available.
 Labor law establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum (except for over-
 time at premium rates), with 1 day of rest (normally Friday) per week as well as
 at least 12 days per year of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays.
 According to the Labor Code, a Supreme Safety Council, chaired by the Labor
 Minister or his representative, is responsible for promoting workplace safety and
 health and issuing occupational safety and health regulations and codes of practice.
 The Council has reportedly issued 28 safety directives. The Supreme Safety Council
 is also supposed to oversee the activities of the safety committees that have report-
 edly been established in about 3,000 enterprises employing more than 10 persons.
 It is not known how well the Labor Ministry's inspectors enforce the safety and
 health legislation and regulations nor whether industrial accident rates are com-
 piled and show positive trends (Iran does not furnish this data to the ILO for publi-
 cation in its Year Book of Labor Statistics).
 Given the large segments of the economy exempted from the labor law, the State's
 still unresolved administrative disorganization resulting from the revolution, the ef-
 fects of the war with Iraq, and the general lack of effective labor unions, it is un-
 clear to what extent the provisions of Iran's labor law affect most of the labor force.
 The ILO has long been concerned with official discrimination in employment
 against adherents of the Baha'i religion.
