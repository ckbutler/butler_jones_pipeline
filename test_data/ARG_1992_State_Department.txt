 ARGENTINA
 Ar~entina is a federal, constitutional democracy with a President, elected through
 an efectoral college for a single 6-year term, a bicameral legislature, and an inde-
 pendent judiciary. The executive traditionally is the dominant branch at the Federal
 level. Since the end of military rule in 1983 there have been two national elections
 and numerous midterm elections for Congress and provincial governments. Justi-
 cialist (Peronist) President Carlos Saul Menem makd the halfway point in his
 term in 1992.
 The President is the constitutional Commander-in-Chief, while a civilian Defense
 Minister oversees the armed forces, which underwent significant reduction and or-
 ganizational reform in 1992. According to figures from the US. Arms Control and
 Disarmament Agency total military expenditures in 1989 were about $1.8 billion.
 Government plans call for reduced numbers of armed forces personnel and no real
 increases in the current military budget level. There were no instances of military
 insubordination against constitutional authority in 1992. The Federal Police report
 to the Interior Minister, the Border Police and the Coast Guard to the Defense Min-
 ister. and provincial police are responsible to provincial governors. Police were re-
 sponsible for a number of human rights abuses during the year.
 Argentina has a mixed agricultural, industrial, and service economy that is strug-
 ling to overcome low levels of investment in recent years, high production and mar.
 ketmng costs, the failure to seek foreign markets, and a lack of international competi-
 tiveness. T  Menem Government undertook an aggressive reform   program to re-
 duce and rationalize the public sector, deregulate many sectors of the economy, and
 open the economy to international competition. Argentina's external public debt of
 $82 billion is still significant, but in 1992 the Government reached an agreement
 with its official creditors in the Paris Club and completed negotiation of a Brady
 Plan restructuring of its debt with its international commercial creditrs.
 The Argentine    nstitutionrovides a wide range of freedoms and guarantees.
 Nevereless, institutional weaknesses and the lega  of prior authoritarian govern-
 ments sometimes result in the Government's failure both to protect individual rights
 strictly and to condemn those who violate them. The number of reported human
 rights abuses has declined in recent years. However, during 1992 there continued
 to be credible charges of torture and extrajudicial killing by the police, governmental
 attempts to infringe on freedom of expression, and the failure of some courts to act
 impartially and expeditiously. There were also incidents of discrimination against
 the Jewish community.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extraijudicial Killing.-There were no credible reports of po-
 litically motivated killings carried out by government forces in 1992.
 However, allegations arose in 1992 that two 1991 killing may have been politi-
 cally motivated.Family members and colleagues of Radical arty Provincial Deputy
 Regino Maders charged that his death was the result of his investigation into al-
 leged corruption in privatizing a public utility. The killing of a utility company em-
 ployee 1 month after Mader's dieath was also alleged to be connected. Maders' family
 members and others involved in the corruption investigation claimed to have re-
 ceived telephone threats in relation to the reopening of the Maders case. The federal
 judge in charge of the new investigation that followed the allegations had not an-
 nounced the results of his inquiry by year's end.
 The investigation into the cover-up charges arising from the September 1990 rape
 and murder of Maria Sledad Morales continued The orignal suspect, Guillermo
 Luque, was freed by a federal court on January 6, 1993. At the same time, the court
 ordered the arrest of another suspect, Luis Tula.
 There continued to be credible reports of extrajudicial killings as a result of the
 frequent use of excessive force, torture or weapons by the police. Respected human
 rights organizations rep ort that police often used deadly force without sufficient
 cause. For example, Luis Ernesto Guevosoli was detained by the police in January
 for illegal gambling. Four days later his body was delivered to his family with the
 explanation that he had diedof acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The
 family opened the coffin and found he had been mutilated- one eye was cut, an ear
 sliced off, and his fingers amputated. A local judge ordered an investigation. At
 year's end there were no reports of a resolution to this inquiry.
 In another instance, Oscar Roberto Valez was detained by p.lice on suspicion of
 rape. The family reported that when they went to visit him in jail he had been badly
 beaten. The police later delivered his body to the family-, a leading human rights
 
 
 323
 organization reported that his skull was crushed, three fingers were broken, his
 knees destroyed and his testicles burned. The local criminal judge listed the cause
 of death as suicide. At year's end no action had yet been taken by the authorities
 in this case. There were numerous other instances of extrajudicial killings during
 the year.
 b. Disappearance.-There was one unresolved disappearance which may have
 been directly attributable to the police or armed forces. in 1992. Pablo Cristian
 Guardati was allegedly abducted by four policemen in Mendoza province in May. On
 December 22, Guardati's body was found in a group of five other bodies which were
 about to be cremated. Guardatrs mother identified her son's body despite its ad-
 vanced state of deterioration. A Judge cancelled the cremation and genetic tests will
 be run on the body to confirm the mother's identification. A forensic examination
 will also be conducted to try and determine the cause of death. A witness in the
 case testified that she was also kidnaped in August by two policemen and that she
 had seen Guardati, alive and wounded, 73 day's after his disa pe  . A Mendoza
 juge ortered he arrest of the four suspects m September, charging mem with e
 kidnaping and disappearance. At year's end they were in detention pending the out-
 come of the judge's investigation.
 There was s.ignificant progress in 1992 on disappeared persons, with the partial
 resolution of the situation of the children of persons who disappeared during the
 1976-83 military dictatorship and who were adopted by other families. This was
 made possible by the patient work of -he Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo"
 group and the technique of cross-generational genetic analyis. In July 1992 Presi-
 dent Menem received the group for the first time and agreed to create a special com-
 mission to deal with the problem of the children of disappeared persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Dejrading Tretment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and the Criminal Code provides penalties for tor-
 ture which are siinlar to those for homicide, 8 to 15 years in prison. Nevertheless,
 police brutality--smetimes ending in death or disappearane as noted above, other
 times limited to physical abuse--is a continuing and seriou  problem, particularly
 with regard to young men and teenage boys. As noted in Section ia. impunity of
 the polie and intimidation of the judiary ontinued to besa problem.Prosecutions,
 however, are becoming more common. In September a judge in San Juan province
 sentenced three policemen to life "mprisonment for trtu ring and killing a witness
 in a homicide case in 1990. Similarly  in Augusta federal prosecuting attorney re-
 quested life imprisonment for three (ordoba prvinc police officers who allegedly
 tortured and killed Oscar Mario Sargiotti in September 1990.
 The exessive use of police force, especially against young people in greater Bue-
 nos Aires prompted the formation of a "Commission of Relatives of Victims of Insti-
 tutional Violence." The group, which monitors and denounces cases of police vio-
 lence, especially against young people and including abuse, torture, murder and rob-
 bery, met with members of the Chamber of Deputies in July to present their case.
 Then-Interior Minister Manzano also received the group, and promised to inves-
 tigate the 40 or more concrete cases of police abuse documented by the Commission.
 He also agreed to upgrade the office in the ministry that deals with denunciations
 of official abuse to that of subsecretariat.
 In the wake of these growing protests against police violence in greater Buenos
 Aires, in September the government of Buenos Aires province announced the firing
 of 800 police officers charged with various crimes or official misconduct. The provin-
 cial Security Secretary told the press that the measure was justified by the low level
 of public confidence in the integrity of the provincial police. At the same time he
 announced a 10 to 15 percent salary increase for those remaining on the force.
 Prisons are overcrowded, with poor medical facilities and a reported inadequacy
 of food.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although Argentina's Penal Code con-
 tains explicit protections of individual rights and places limits on police arrest and
 investigatory powers, these are not always observed nor are meaningful sanctions
 imposed upon those who violate them. Most instances of abuse or torture continue
 to occur during the early period of detention.
 Involuntary exile for political reasons is not permitted by law nor is it practiced
 in fact.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial.-Argentina's judicial system, while independent
 and impartial, is slow and cumbersome in practice. President Menem's appointment
 of four additional members to the Supreme Court in 1989 and his subsequent ap-
 pointment of another justice to replace a retiree prompted charges of potential exec-
 utive branch influence in court decisions. The Constitution and Penal Code call for
 trials before panels of judges and for appellate review of all judicial rulings. Judges
 render verdicts on the basis of written evidence. Many of those who are eventually
 
 
 324
 
 convicted serve very short sentences, basically time served. In contrast, those even.
 tually declared innocent who have not been allowed provisional liberty often need-
 lessly suffer long periods of incarceration prior to acquittal. The right to bail is pro-
 vided by law and recognized in practice.
 In September the Congress passed legislation implementing trials at the Federal
 level based on oral testimony for penal offenses.  me provinces already have in
 place oral trial procedures for penal cases. The Government has begun training and
 infrastructure development for this new system of federal justice, but budgetary
 problems and longstanding institutional interests must be overcome before the sys-
 tem of trials based on oral testimony takes root.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not normally intrude into the private lives of individuals, in ac-
 cordance with constitutional provisions. There continued to be credible reports about
 the tapping of telephone lines by state security personnel, but these complaints di-
 minished somewhat in 1992. .
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres.-The vigor and openness of the Argentine press
 increased in 1992, particularly the media's denunciation of official corruption. In
 late September, the International Press Society gave Argentina "good marks" for
 freedom of expression. The National Editors and Publishers Association (ADEPA),
 however, is more critical and continues to play an effective watch-dog role. The Con-
 gress has taken significant steps toward implementing measures that will enhance
 established press freedoms.
 Problem areas remain, nevertheless, particularly the use of a statute penalizing
 offenses gainst the dignity of a public official. The Government invoked this statute
 on several occasions against its critics. In June Congress began consideration of a
 law to eliminate the crime of offending the dignity of a public official, and in mid-
 July President Menem submitted a draft law that would eliminate the offense, call-
 ing it contradictory to the principles of a democratic society. ADEPA seconded the
 initiative, and on September 4 it was approved by a unanimous voice vote, without
 debate, by the Chamber of Deputies. At the en   of he year Senate consideration
 was pending.
 Prior censorship also became an issue in 1992. A portion of political humorist Tato
 Bores' May 10 teevision program criticizing Federal Judge Maria Servini de Cubria
 was censored by a court prior to airing as injurious to the judge's honor. Judge
 Servini de Cubria, who initiated the legal action, was accused of coverinq up charges
 of narcotics-related money laundering by the family of President Menem a estranged
 wife. Bores and the television station appealed to the court to lift the ban, arguing
 that prior censorship violated the Constitution and the American Convention on
 Human Rights. ABEPA called for revocation of the measure; Congress held hearings
 to determine if charges should be brought against the judges who ordered the cen-
 sorship. In September the Supreme Court revoked the censorship order and allowed
 the station to broadcast the deleted portion of the program.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution and laws of
 Argentina provide for the freedom of groups and political parties to assemble and
 demonstrate. Labor unions, retirees, public school teachers, and others held large
 public rallies, often to protest government policies, without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for free exercise of religion but
 gives the Roman Catholic Church a privileged position in society. Only a Roman
 Catholic may be elected President and many institutions are in practice closed to
 persons of other religions. Missionaries are free to proselytize in Argentina, and the
 number of Protestant sects has grown. The influx of Protestant sects and their suc-
 cess at proselytizing has given rise to efforts to control their activities. To date some
 3,000 different sects have been registered in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
 Worship, or, as educational or civic foundations, in other ministries. As a result, in
 August the Catholic Church proposed tightening the current laws governing reg-
 istration of sects. A bill incorporating many of the Church's proposals went to Con-
 gress in August.
 Various manifestations of anti-Semitism continue to be a serious problem in Ar-
 gentina. Anonymous anti-Semitic pamphlets appear from time to time. In August
 a local television station in Misiones province aired a program which seemed to
 apologize for the Holocaust and vindicate the Hitler regime. A Jewish student in a
 technical training school in La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires province, was bru-
 tally beaten by other students in May. He was forced by his tormenters to recite
 the Lord's Prayer while swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans were painted on the
 school walls. Certain institutions such as the armed Forces, the courts, and the For-
 
 
 325
 eign Ministry, as well as many private organizations, have few if any Jewish mem-
 bet.
 In late 1991, police arrested a man trying to smuggle four bombs into the Jewish
 cemetery in Ciudadela, in greater Buenos Aires. In April a group of people fired on
 the gates of the Jewish cemetery in Bereastepui, which in 1991 was e scene of
 anti-Semitic destruction of tombs. Also in April, 15 tombs in the Jewish cemetery
 in Mar del Plata were sacked. The Mar del Plata cemetery was again desecrated
 in July, when three tombs were destroyed, and again in September when a dozen
 or so tombs were destroyed and swastikas were painted on them. Te Government
 is swift to condemn such actions and to order apropriate investigations, but by
 year's end none of the perpetrators had been ap  en "d.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Fo    Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-nternational and internal travel as well as emigration remain unre-
 stricted. Eight Cubans, several of whom were members of a visiting dance troo,
 were granted political asylum in 1992. In June the Government granted amnesty
 to some 300,000 illegal residents, mostly Chileans, Paraguayans, and Bolivians. It
 also announced its willingness to accept immigrants from Eastern Europe and the
 former U.S.S.R., but conditioned that offer on assurances of financing from inter-
 national organizations for resettlement costs.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since September 1983, Argentina has held several national elections to choose
 federal, provincial, and local officials. These elections were generally free, fair, and
 democratic, with universal obligatory                 full spectrum of poitics
 from left to right is represented in the political system, the Justiciait Party (PJ)
 and the Radical Civic Union (UCR) hold the great majority of seats in the national
 Congress. A number of smaller provincial parties hold sway in several provinces,
 also sending representatives to Congress.
 A 1991 law passed by the Congress mandates that 30 percent of the candidates
 on national, provincial, and municipal ballots be women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights organizations operate openly although financing their ac-
 tivities has become difficult Tor some, and the scope of their activities has begun to
 change with the diminution of some kinds of human rights problems. The Govern-
 ment has cooperated with requests for human rights information from all areas and
 individuals.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Sex, Race, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on the above criteria. Overt manifesta-
 tions of such discrimination are relatively infrequent.
 Nevertheless, Argentine women and some minorities, particularly Jews and recent
 immigrants from Korea and other Asian countries, sometimes face manifestations
 of discrimination rooted in historical and sociocultural patterns. However, the Presi-
 dent of the Justicialist bloc of Deputies in the Chamber of Deputies is Jewish, as
 is the newly appointed mayor of the federal capital of Buenos Aires. Jews are well
 representedin industrial, business, and professional circles. Violence against women
 and sexual harassment received less media attention than in the recent past, but
 remain serious problems in Argentina. However, the Government undertook no ini-
 tiatives to deal with the problem beyond the appointment by President Menem of
 a group of women advisors to the Cabinet in September.
 Argentina's indigenous peoples, believed to number well below 100,000, are
 grouped into several local and national confederations that have little political
 power or influence.
 The Constitution and laws allow for full participation in the nation's political
 process, regardless of ethnic background or origin. There is no evidence of any sys-
 tematic attempt to abridge these rights by the national or local governments, nor
 by private groups or individuals.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The labor movement, now concentrated in a single
 General Labor Confederation (CGT), represents about one-third of the work force
 and remains an important political and economic force. The CGrs power, however,
 has waned considerably. In the 3-plus years of the Menem Government through De-
 cember 1992 the CGT staged only one general work stoppage, despite considerable
 unhappiness over concrete issues such as wages, and socialsecurity reform. This
 forbearance was due in part to the ideological affinity of the CGT for the ruling
 
 
 326
 
 Justicialist party, and in part to labor's recognition that the Government's economic
 reform program is producing tangible, positive results.
 Unions have the right to strike, subject to compulsory conciliation and arbitration
 by the Labor Ministry. Some unions, particularly the metallurgical workers, teach-
 ers and bank workers, exercised that right frequently in 1992 with little or no offi-
 cial interference.
 Trade unions are free to associate internationally, and many Argentine worker or-
 ganizations are active in international trade union groups.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectivey.-Federal labor law and regula-
 tions apply uniformly throughout the country. Antiunion discrimination is prohib-
 ited by law, and well-developed mechanisms are in place and functioning to resolve
 complaints. Some provinces provide rights and obligations that go beyond those pro-
 vided by federal law. Labor and management are legally subject to a binding collec-
 tive bargaining process which sets basic wage levels on an industry-wide basis. The
 State's role in this process is now limited to ratifying these agreements to give them
 legal status.
 On another front, the Government proposed, but at year's end had not sent to
 Congress, legislation centralizing government control over payroll deductions for
 union social welfare funds and allowing union members free choice in selecting
 health care programs from among existing welfare funds and private health care
 maintenance plans. The authors of the proposal justify it in the light of the inability
 of many union-controlled funds to provide adequate health care to their members
 for a complex set of reasons dating back to the period during which the unions and
 the welfare funds were quashed by the military government of 1976-83. They also
 defend the proposal in terms of providing[ free choice to union members, part of the
 philosophy of deregulation and privatization of the economy. The CGT, reflecting al-
 most universal union repudiation of the proposal, managed to force the Government
 to retract many of the points contemplated in the reform, but the issue is still the
 object of intense debate.
 There are no officially designated export processing zones in Argentina.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and is not known to be practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children.-Employment of children under
 14 years of age, except within the family, is prohibited. Minors aged 14 and 15 may
 work in restricted types of employment, but not more than 6 hours a day or 35
 hours a week. The same law applies to minors 16 to 18 years of age, although excep-
 tions are allowed. Violators are tried before appropriate courts, but due to the reduc-
 tion in most families' earning power, these restrictions are probably honored more
 in the breach than in the observance.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The official minimum wage falls well below the
 amount required to support a family of four, which recent official estimates put at
 about $12,000 a year. The maximum work day is eight hours; the work week is 48
 hours. Premiums are paid for work beyond those limits, which is increasingly the
 case as workers seek to augment inadequate basic salaries by undertaking overtime
 work. Rules governing vacations and maternity and sick leave are comparable to or
 better than those that prevail in western industrialized nations, and are generally
 observed.
 Federally-legislated occupational health and safety standards are also comparable
 to those of industrialized nations, but the federal Government and many provincial
 governments lack the human and economic resources to enforce these standards, de-
 spite union vigilance against violations. As a result industrial pollution has become
 an increasingly serious problem and worker lawsuits provoked by on the job injuries
 and job-related disability have become a major industry. A large number of people,
 including children, are employed in small, owner-operated enterprises where it is
 difficult lor the Government to enforce workers' rights and health and safety stand-
 ards.
