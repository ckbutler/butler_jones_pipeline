 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is one of the few functioning multi-party democ-
 racies in Africa. Respect for human rights is guaranteed
 in the constitution and observed in practice. The Gambia
 is a strong backer of U.S. initiatives to establish major-
 ity rule in southern Africa, and is a firm supporter of
 our human rights policies. In Africa, in regional organ-
 izations such as the OAU and the Commonwealth, and in the
 United Nations, The Gambia has been in the forefront of
 those nations insisting on respect for human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no evidence of torture in The Gambia.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There is no such punishment in The Gambia, nor are there any
 reports of arbitrary deprivation of life.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There have been no instances of arbitrary arrest or impri-
 ment.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are guaranteed by law and provided in
 practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The home is inviolable, both in law and in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 All government policies are tailored to respond to the
 needs of the poor.  In this rural, agricultural nation
 with a small population and limited resources, the needs
 of the poor are the major focus of government activity.
 
 
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Gambia's record and practice respecting these rights
 rank among the best in the world.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions whatsoever on these freedoms.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is full freedom, under the law and in practice, to
 participate in the political process. The nation's elec-
 tion of April 4-5, 1977 was hotly and openly contested by
 the four Gambian political parties. Opposing political
 views are broadcast and published freely. There is uni-
 versal adult suffrage.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 There has never been to our knowledge an allegation of
 human rights violations in The Gambia or a request by any
 international body to inspect or investigate human rights
 conditions in The Gambia. The government would be likely
 to respond affirmatively to any reasonable request of this
 kind.
