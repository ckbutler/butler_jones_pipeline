 JORDAN
 According to the 1952 Constitution, Jordan is a hereditary monarchy in which the
 King forms and dismisses governments, may dissolve Parliament, and is the ulti-
 mate arbiter of domestic and foreign policy. In practice, the King sets the broad pa-
 rameters of foreign and domestic policy while the Prime Minister and the Council
 of Ministers exercise management of daily affairs. The Parliament--cnsisting of a
 40-member Senate whose members are appointed by the King and an 80-member
 lower house whose members are elected-is seeking to assert greater influence over
 policy.
 The General Intelligence Directorate (GID) and the Public Security Directorate
 (PSD) have broad responsibility for internal security and wide powers to monitor
 segments of the population thought to pose a threat to the security of the regime.
 Although martia law directives were revoked in 1991, important elements of mar-
 tial law, such as the broad scope of police powers remain operative until new laws
 are enacted. According to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total
 military expenditures for 1989 were $548 million. There should be a modest in-
 crease in 1993 to pay for a smaller but more expensive all-volunteer force and for
 the replacement of equipment.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with government participation in key sectors, in-
 cluding industrial production, transportation, and communications. Although the
 country has few natural resources and one of the highest population growth rates
 in the world, the economy showed surprising strength in 1992, considering that the
 Gulf Cooperation Council states had stopped all financial aid over Jordan's stance
 during the Gulf war. Until the war, Jordan was highly dependent on foreign assist-
 ance and remittances from its nationals abroad. Moreover, Jordanian exports to
 ofIr, a major tradin.g partner, were reduced mostly to food and medicine as a result
 U.N. sanctions. It is estimated that unemployment dropped from above 20 percent
 in January to 14 percent by October, while Jordan's gross domestic product grew
 substantially and its inflation rate moderated.
 The political liberalization begun in 1989 was carried a step further in 1992 with
 the legalization of political parties, and a royal decree issued in November an-
 nounced the release of all prisoners convicted of crimes committed in the pursuit
 of political aims. Nevertheless, citizens still do not have the right to change their
 government. Other continuing human rights problems included the broad scope of
 police powers, abuse of prisoners, prolonged detention without charge, lack of fair
 trial in some security cases, official discrimination against adherents of the Baha'i
 faith, and restrictions on women's rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killns
 b   ioappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Government denies that torture occurs and cites the legal code which
 calls for the humane treatment of prisoners, physical abuse of prisoners during in-
 terrogation and detention continues to occur. Lawyers often do not receive access
 to their clients in cases allegedly involving state security, and this lack of access
 makes confirmation of abuse in specific cases difficult.
 Jordan has ratified the U.N. Convention Against Torture. The government gives
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) full access to detainees. How-
 ever, in August 1992, the Public Freedom Committee of the lower house of Par-
 liament issued a report charging the Government with human rights violations, in-
 cluding torture. The Prim Minster denied the charges and challenged the Public
 Freedom Committee to cite specific cases. The report was not released to the public,
 so independent observers were unable to verify the Committee's charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Most persons are arrested and held in
 accordance with the Criminal Code, which requires filing of formal charges within
 10 days. This period of detention may be extended if a court approves the Prosecutor
 
 
 1031
 General's renewable request for 10-day extensions. The Ministry of Justice is re-
 sponsible for monitoring cases to ensure that persons are charged on a timely basis.
 A new Defense Law, approved in early 1992, provides for monthly judicial review
 of detentions.
 The above notwithstanding, the practice of prolonged detention without charge
 continued in 1992, especially in "security" cases. After obtaining an arrest warrant,
 the GiD detained persons without formal charges or trial for indeterminate periods.
 Governors may order arrest and detention, under a law authorizing them to do so
 in order to prevent crime.
 Several Islamists were detained in 1992 for acts construed by the Government as
 potentially threatening to public or state security: violent intimidation of secular
 Jordanians, antiregime sermons in mosques, and the distribution of inflammatory
 leaflets. In these eases detainees were released without dhsrge after varying periods
 of detention by the GID.
 Two Isamist Members of Parliament were tried and found guilty in November of
 membership in an illegal Isamic militant group (The Vanguard of the Islamic
 Youth), aiming to overrow Jordan's Constituti, a attempting to disrupt Jordan's
 relations with raq, unlawful possession of explosives and automatic weapons, using
 slanderous expressions against Members of Parliament, and slandering the dignity
 of the King. They were handcuffed during detention, and the Government denied
 them private consultations with defense counsel and hearings within the initial 10-
 day arraignment period. The two were among those included in a general pardon
 announced in November.
 The Constitution prohibits the exiling of Jordanian citizens, and the Government
 does not engage in the practice.
 e. Denial- of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system consists of civilian courts,
 which hear most criminal cases; the Appeals Court; the State Security Court, which
 replaced the Martial Law Court in 1991; religious courts; and special courts, includ-
 ingone which deals exclusively with disputes involving government agencies.
 In the civilian courts, trials are open, except in a few ases such as those involv-
 ing sexual offenses. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty and are
 entitled to counsel, to question witnesses, and to choose whether to testify. Defend-
 ants facing the death penalty or life imprisonment must have legal counsel; if they
 cannot afford counsel, or do not wish to be represented by counsl, the Government
 must appoint one. Decisions may be appealed to the Appeals Court. Religous courts
 have jurisdiction over such family matters as marriage and divorce. The Shari'a
 Court handles all family and religious cases involving Mulims. Religious courts
 handle similar matters for members of the main Christian sects (Greek Orthodox,
 Catholic, and Protestant courts). Shari'a laws are generally applied in matters of in-
 heritance, regardless of the religion of those involved. There have been a few in-
 stances in which inheritance matters involving Christian families were settled ac-
 cording to Christian tradition.
 Observers have expressed concern about the impartiality of the judiciary, citing
 low judicial salaries and strong tribal affiliations as undermining the court ystem.
 The State Security Court comprises three civilian judges and two military judges.
 State Security Court procedures give rise to concern because of the routine denial
 of private unimpeded acess to lawyers in the pretrial period and the absence of the
 right of appeal consistent with international standards for a fair trial. A State Secu-
 rity Court sentence of death or imprisonment of more than 10 years must be re-
 viewed by the Court of Cassation (the highest court) within 30 days. The Cassation
 Court will not review the facts of the case or the decision but only whether the court
 roerly applied the law. The State Security Court is theoretically open to the pub.
 itledtin practice, most courtroom seats are reserved for official guests andenour-
 nalits. The lower house of Parliament passed on December 20 a drat State ecu-
 rity Court law which would, ifassd by the Senate and promulgated by the King,
 Security      decisions to an appellate body apinted by the
 Prime Minister. Tht body wuld have civilian or military jud  or  th.
 Claiming that no one is currently serving a prison term solely for political views,
 the Government denies that it holds any political prisoners. Before King Hussein's
 hneral amnesty in November, there were approximately 100 prisoners who had
 en convicted in military courts of crimes committed in pursuit of political aims;
 the charges in these ases included arms possession and terrorism, but in at least
 some of these ases the legal proceedings did not meet international standards for
 fair trial because of the State Security Court's denial of unimpeded aces to law-
 yersin the pretrial period and the absence of the right of appeal. Following the
 King's amnesty, about 50 prisoners who had been convicted in military courts re-
 mained in captivity.
 
 
 1032
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Current
 law stipulates that search warrants must be issued by the Prosecutor General or
 a judge for searches of premises, except in cases involving security matters. Security
 personnel reportedly monitor telephones, read correspondence, and engage in sur-
 veillance. These practices are legal according to Jordanian law but are not believed
 to be widespread.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-In principle, the Constitution provides for free-
 dom of speech and the press, and Jordanians freeyexpress wide-ranglg Opinions
 includin criticism of the Government. However,  e Government exercises limited
 censorship of the local media by pressuring news editors to change or omit coverage
 which the Government finds em arrassing or contrary to what it perceives to be
 Jordan's interests. Often however the print and broadcast media censor themselves
 without specific ] romptig from the Government because of fear of the authorities.
 The Parliament is also sensitive to public censure and as an institution has been
 quick to sue critics for slander.
 The Government continues to hold from 40- to 90-percent ownership in the three
 main newspapers, and editorial opinion in these papers generally reflects the gov-
 ernment view. A drat press law being debated in Parliament calls for the govern-
 ment to reduce its ownership share to 30 percent. The Government owns and runs
 the broadcast media. Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available, and
 there have been no reports of Jordanian censorship of the foreign press. Western
 cable television, such as the Cable News Network (CNN), is increasingly available,
 without government interference, through satellite links.
 A draft press law currently under consideration would deprive journalists of the
 right to keep sources secret under some circumstances and would require journalists
 to be licensed by the Jordan Press Association. It also prohibits any insult to the
 royal family or heads of states of "Arab or Muslim or friendly" nations and contains
 language stipulating respect for "freedom and national responsibility." The draft
 press law is seen as companion legislation to the political parties law enacted in Au-
 gust (see Section 2.b.) because it authorizes the parties to publish newspapers.
 Academic freedom is respected. In August the Public Freedom Committee of the
 lower house of Parliament issued a report alleging that the Government had banned
 some employees from government positions because of their political views. The
 Prime Minister denied the charges, although in practice dismissals on this basis do
 occur occasionally.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public demonstrations require
 permits, which have been readily granted for peaceful protests since the beginning
 ofplitical liberalization in 1989.
 Political parties were legalized in October. Many political parties-notably the Is-
 lamic Action Front and several centrist parties--had already begun organizing, and
 over 70 parties have declared their intention to organize. The political parties law
 is designed to prohibit the formation of parties based exclusively on one ethnic or
 religious group, although Islamist parties or parties appealing almost exclusively to
 one or the other of Jordan's ethnic communities appear to be forming.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Under the Constitution, Islam is the state religion, and
 over 90 percent of Jordanians are Muslim. The Government adheres to the constitu-
 tional guarantee of freedom of worship, and followers of most religions experience
 no governmental persecution. Religious groups must be registered and recognized by
 the Government in order to manage property and administer schools. Non-Muslim
 sects are not allowed to proselytize among Muslims, but Muslims are allowed to con-
 vert.
 The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a religion, and the small
 Baha'i community continues to encounter discrimination (see Section 5).
 Several other religious groups are not officially recognized by the Government but
 are able to meet without harassment: Jehovah's Witnesses, the United Pentecostal
 Church, the Church of Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Movement within the country is restricted only in military areas. Mar-
 ried women must have the written approval of their husbands to obtain passports
 for foreign travel.
 Passport renewals for citizens residing in Jordan require clearance from the po-
 lice. Palestinians residing in the East Bank may obtain 5-year passports while Pal-
 estinians residing in the West Bank may obtain 2-year passports. Jordan also
 grants some Palestinians of Gazan origin 2-year passports regardless of where they
 live. The Interior Ministry routinely grants permits for travel between the East
 Bank and the Israeli-occupied territories and neighboring states.
 
 
 1033
 Repatriation problems for Palestinian refugees in Jordan were compounded by the
 influx of what the Government claims were 300,000 returnees (the actual number
 may have been substantially lower) from the Gulf states after the Gulf war--the
 majority from Kuwait. Jordan's registered Palestinian refugee population was
 1,001,000 persons, 220,000 of whom resided in Jordan's 10 official and 3 unofficial
 refugee camps run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The
 Gulf war added about 7,000 new students to UNRWA schools and 160,000 to govern-
 ment schools.
 Jordan acknowledged that 120,000 Ira9i refugees moved into Jordan in the
 months after Iraqi travel restrictions were lifted in May 1991. The International Or-
 ganization for Migration (IOM) estimates that 20,000 to 25,000 Iraqi refugees cur-
 rently reside in Jordan, but unofficial estimates ran e well over 100,000. Jordan has
 granted full citizenship to all Palestinians who fledto the East Bank following the
 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars. This amounted to a refugee population exceeding
 its own indigenous population at the time. All Palestinian refugees residing in Jor-
 dan prior to August 1988 have the unrestricted right to live, work, and own prop-
 erty in Jordan.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Jordanian citizens may elect municipal officials and members of the Chamber of
 Deputies but are not ultimately free to change their system of government or its
 leaders. Executive and legislative powers are constitutionally vested in the King,
 who rules with the assistance of an appointed Council of Mimsters. The Parliament
 is composed of an appointed Senate and an elected lower house. The Parliament is
 overshadowed by the executive branch but has the right to approve, reject, or amend
 laws proposed by the Council of Ministers. According to the Constitution, the Par-
 liament has the right to approve or reject treaties and agreements with a majority
 vote. The King may also propose extraordinary sessions of Parliament and postpone
 sessions up to 60 day-e proposed an extraordinary session in July and August
 1992 and postponed a session rom October 1 to December 1. The King must ap-
 prove all laws, which are then put into effect by royal decree. The formation of polit-
 ical parties was legalized in October (see Section 2.b.). Ten parties had appid for
 recognition by the end of the year and many more were preparing to apply. Of the
 10,5 parties were recognized, including the Islamic Action Front. Two parties (the
 Jordanian Communist Party and the Ba'ath Socialist Party) were denied recognition
 on the grounds that their platforms contradicted the Constitution and the political
 parties law. Explaining the denial, the Interior Minister noted that communism is
 atheistic and thus unconstitutional, since Islam is the state religion, and that politi-
 cal platforms based on socialism and communism contradict the constitutional guar-
 antees ofproperty ownership. Banned parties have 30 days to appeal to the Higher
 Court of Justice.
 According to government figures, Bedouin tribes constitute approximately 36 per.
 cent of the population. These tribes participate freely in the political system.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human and women's rights organizations pursue changes in the laws
 through contact with Parliament and the GovernmentAmnesty International (AI)
 delegations made three highly publicized visits to Jordan in 1992. In November, 18
 Jordanian human rights groups were consolidated into a Jordanian chapter of Al.
 The Arab Organization for Human Rights has an office in Amman and has publicly
 and privately raised several controversial cases with the Government. The Jordan
 Bar Association also raises human rights concerns with regard to laws and proce-
 dures, as well as with individual cases. The ICRC operates freely in Jordan and is
 given access to both detainees and prison facilities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a religion. Unless the com-
 munity is granted such recognition as a result of a current court case, it will have
 to continue to register property in the names of individual members. There is official
 discrimination based on ethnicity, sex, or religion. Many Palestinians experience dis-
 proportionate scrutiny in taxation and discrimination in the awarding of university
 scholarships and government and military jobs, especially at the senior levels.
 Women experience legal discrimination regarding pension and social security ben-
 efits, inheritance, and divorce. However, Parliament effectively blocked Islamists
 from enacting further legislation discriminating against women in the 1992 sessions
 of Parliament, withholding action on a draft law on civil status which governs mat-
 ters of divorce, marriage, custody of children, and polygamy.
 
 
 1034
 Under Shari'a law, which applies to all Jordanian citizens in inheritance matters,
 a female heir's inheritance is only half that of male heirs. The son is required to
 use his inheritance to support his mother and unmarried sisters, while a daughter
 is free to retain her inheritance for herself. In practice, non-Muslim women occa-
 sionally have been able to obtain rulings based upon their own religious laws. The
 divorce law allows men to obtain a divorce more easily than women, but men may
 have to pay considerable compensation based on the original marriage contract. A
 woman whose husband takes additional wives may seek and obtain a divorce under
 Shari'a law. The law grants women equal pay for equal work, but in practice the
 law is sometimes ignored and women are paid less. Tradition also constrains wom-
 en's freedoms, particularly the entry of women into professional and academic
 realms.
 Nevertheless, some women have successfully entered the fields of engineering,
 medicine, and law, and women's issues are receiving increasing attention in the
 media and at symposia. Women's groups stress that the problem is not only one of
 laws but also of social constraints, including women's unawareness of their rights
 or unwillingness to assert these rights. A broad-based business and professional
 women's club gives seminars on women's rights and is beginning to assist women
 in establishing small businesses, but overall change in women's status has been
 minimal.
 The Koran allows a husband to discipline his wife, which some men apparently
 interpret as a license to discipline with force. Sources in the medical field say that,
 while they know wife beating occurs, family and cultural norms constrain the victim
 from seeking medical or legal help and prevent any realistic quantification of the
 extent of abuse. The issue is considered a private one by the police and the judici-
 ary. In addition, public discourse rarely focuses on incidents of child abuse, although
 a well-publicized press story in the spring prvoked a brief discussion of the prob-
 lem. Wife beating is technically grounds for divorce, but the husband may dem-
 onstrate in court that the beating occurred because the wife is irreligious or did not
 obey him. It is within the discretion of the judge to deny a divorce in such cases.
 Baha'is suffer various forms of discrimination. An October 1991 government de-
 cree requires all students to be classified on student identification documents as ei-
 ther Chitian" or "Muslim." Previously, Baha'i students were permitted to be so
 identified. A further stipulation requires that Baha'is take national postsecondary
 examinations on Islam, unlike Christian religious minorities who take examinations
 on Christianity. The Baha'i community is too small to sustain its own court, and
 Baha'is' family legal matters, including marriage, must be handled in the Shari'a
 courts. Most flaha is are unwilling to be married in these courts.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All nongovernmental workers, except foreigners,
 have the legal right to form and join trade unions. Workers in some government-
 owned companies, such as the air lines, are also allowed to form unions. Jordanian
 labor unions are apolitical. Union leaders are elected by secret ballot for 1-year
 terms. The Jordan Federation of Trade Unions (JFTU) comprises 17 unions; unions
 are not required to belong to the Federation, but at the present time all unions are
 members of the Federation. Union officials estimate that some 25 percent of workers
 are unionized. All unions must register with the Government. Government influence
 over the JFTU decreased following political liberalization in 1989, but the JFTU is
 not totally independent. Labor laws forbid strikes if an arbitration committee has
 been appointed by the Government to end the dispute. If arbitration fails, the mat-
 ter is referred to an industrial tribunal, a formal, independent body made up of
 judges appointed by the Ministry of Labor. The judges sit in individual cases and
 the tribunal's decisions are binding, although both parties to a dispute must agree
 to have the tribunal hear their case before it can be considered. Strikes are not per-
 mitted during the arbitration or during the. tribunal's deliberations. Government
 employees, who make up roughly half of the work force, are barred from striking.
 Unions are free to affiliate and participate in international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions in Jordan have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. JFTU member unions regularly engage
 in collective bargaining with employers. Negotiations cover a wide range of issues,
 including salaries, safety standards, and working conditions. In its 1992 report,
 however, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE)
 repeated earlier requests that the Government enact specific provisions and sanc-
 tions against employer interference in the affairs of worker organizations and ex-
 tend coverage of the law to domestic servants and agricultural workers.
 
 
 1035
 The Constitution bars antiunion discrimination. Allegations of such discrimination
 may be taken to the Ministry of Labor, which on occasion has ordered the reinstate-
 ment of employees discharged because of their union activities.
 Duty-free trade zones, in Aqaba and Zarqa, are governed by the same labor provi-
 sions that apply countrywide. Private sector workers employed in these zones are
 part of a national union and are thus allowed to organize and bargain collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Compulsory labor is forbidden by
 the Constitution, except in a state of emergency such as war or natural disaster,
 and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The labor laws forbid children
 under age 16 from working except in the case of professional apprentices, who are
 allowed to leave the standard education track and begin part-time (6 hours per day,
 no night shift) training at age 13. Ministry of Labor inspection teams attempt to
 enforce these laws. In practice, some underage children work, primarily in family
 businesses. Despite compulsory education, a small number of chlren in more re-
 mote areas are kept from school-by their parents in order to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no nationwide legally mandated mini-
 mum wage, but the Government periodically prepares and adjusts a minimum wage
 schedule for various trades, based on recommendations of an advisory panel com-
 posed of representatives of workers, employers, and the Government. Unskilled
 workers earning the lowest scheduled wage face increasing difficulties earning
 enoughi to providesa family a decent living by local standards.
 Laws mandate maximum work hours and paid leave: workers are not supposed
 to work mre than 48 hours per week (64 hours for hotel, restaurant, and cinema
 employees), and may not work more than 16 hours in any continuous period or more
 than 60 hours overtime per month. Employees are entitled to ,1 day off each week.
 The Labor Ministry maintains a goup of full-time inspectos to oversee occupa-
 tional health and safety standards. A parliamentary committee works with the Min-
 istry to monitor conditions in the workplace. Jordanian law specifies a number of
 health and safety requirements for workers, including standards for bathrooms,
 drinking water, and safety and first aid equipment. The Government appears to ad-
 minister and enforce its labor laws fairly, but the deployment of to few inspectors
 hinders its effectiveness. The ILO, again in 1992, expressed the hope that a draft
 labor code under consideration by the Council of Ministers will confer on labor in-
 spectors the power to make or to have made, orders having immediate force and
 impose an obligation to notify the Labor Inspectorate of industrial accidents and oc-
 cupational diseases.
