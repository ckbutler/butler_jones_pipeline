 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland, a neutral and democratic country, attaches vital
 importance to the observance and maintenance of human rights.
 The Swiss Confederation has an internationally renowned human
 rights record. It is well known for its generous assistance to
 refugees, and it is the headquarters site for important worldwide
 organizations concerned with humanitarian affairs, notably the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN Economic and
 Social Council (ECOSOC), and the International Red Cross. The
 Swiss Government recently presided over efforts to update the
 Geneva Convention at the Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirm-
 ation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable
 in Armed Conflicts.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The fairly equitable distribution of the national income,
 and the substantial sums spent on welfare by private
 industry in this capitalistic society explain the fact that
 public expenditures for social purposes are lower in Switz-
 erland than in many other European countries.
 3. Respect for Civil and-Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Switzerland is a party to the European Convention on Human
 Rights. Switzerland prides itself on being a country of
 absolute religious tolerance, and religious groups have a
 right to the protection of the state against the domination
 of any other religious community. There are no restrictions
 on political expression or association except those placed
 on groups considered a potential threat to the Confederation.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of domestic and foreign travel, and of
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy. Legisiative
 power is vested in a bicameral legislature elected by universal
 suffrage. Women were granted the federal franchise in 1971,
 and in most cantons they enjoy the same voting privileges as
 men.
 Although women were enfranchised on the federal level in 1971,
 Switzerland has not been able to ratify the UN Human Rights
 Convention, because women in the small half-canton of Appenzell-
 Innerrhoden, who comprise 2 per cent of the total Swiss female
 population, have not yet been granted full citizen's rights.
 There is full freedom of labor to organize.
 4.  Govertimeit Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests during the postwar period for out-
 side investigations of Switzerland's human rights.
