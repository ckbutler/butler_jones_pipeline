 MONGOLIA
 The Mongolian People's Republic (MPR), is a highly centralized
 Communist state in which the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
 Party (MPRP), the Mongolian Communist party, is the only
 political party permitted to function. Since achieving power
 in the 1920's, the MPRP has continued Mongolia's long
 tradition of authoritarian rule. The leadership of the
 country is vested in the Politburo of the MPRP Central
 Committee headed by Jambyn Batmonkh. Nominally, the Great
 People's Hural, or National Assembly, enacts the basic laws of
 the country. It meets for 3 days once each year. Between
 sessions, the Presidium and the Council of Ministers (Cabinet)
 issue decrees and executive orders.
 The Mongolian State is modeled on the Soviet system, and, with
 approximately four Soviet military divisions stationed there,
 Moscow's political influence is great. Mongolian leaders
 state that the country is instituting its own version of
 perestroika (restructuring), but to date there seems to be no
 visible effect on the political or economic system.
 Mongolian economic life is dominated by the U.S.S.R. and
 shaped by its trade with the Soviet bloc; approximately 95
 percent of its foreign trade is conducted with the Soviet
 Union and Eastern Europe. Soviet involvement in the economy
 is primarily focused on mining and concentration of nonferrous
 metals that are subsequently shipped to the U.S.S.R. for
 processing. However, despite increasing industrialization and
 urbanization, a majority of the population is engaged in
 agricultural pursuits, with an emphasis on livestock raising
 and associated light industry.
 The United States and Mongolia established diplomatic
 relations on January 27, 1987, and the U.S. Embassy opened
 formally in September 1988. At this stage, the body of
 reliable information concerning government control or
 treatment of Mongolian citizens remains small. There are no
 known domestic opposition groups, and emigres are few. In the
 past, much of the available information has come from the
 Mongolian Government itself. The few resident diplomats and
 most visitors to Mongolia spend the majority of their time in
 the capital, but with government permission may travel to
 other parts of the country.
 Individual civil and political liberties are highly
 restricted. Though the numbers are increasing, few Mongolians
 are authorized to travel outside Soviet bloc countries.
 Political opposition to the MPRP is not permitted. Freedoms
 assured to the individual under the Mongolian Constitution,
 including speech, religion, demonstration, and assembly, can
 be exercised only to "develop and consolidate the state system
 of the Mongolian People's Republic."

 MONGOLIA
 c. Torture and Other Ciuel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Information is unavailable.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The extent of arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile is unknown.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair-Public Trial
 Current civil and criminal codes stipulate the right of the
 accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and public trial
 "except as stipulated by law." Closed proceedings are
 permitted in the case of crimes against the State. The civil
 code focuses on this category of crimes. A comprehensive
 review of the legal code is currently underway.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is
 provided for in the Constitution, but little is known about
 the application of these rights by the authorities. Travel
 and job and residence changes are decided by the State. The
 State decides work assignments on the basis of work skills,
 level of education, and loyalty to the Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech but limits
 this freedom by specifying that the exercise of individual
 rights must be to "develop and consolidate the state system of
 the MPR." Actions deemed by the MPRP to fall outside this
 guideline may result in arrest and detention. According to
 Freedom House, civil liberties are denied. Fundamental public
 criticism of the Government is not tolerated. Control of
 political and social conduct is exercised through vsrious
 party and government organizations, including the Ministry of
 Public Security and che local militia. Citizen volunteer
 committees work with the militia to monitor social and
 political conduct at the neighborhood level.
 Public criticism is permitted in certain areas and on topics
 approved by the Government, although this is often ritualistic
 in nature. Letters published in the official press are a form
 of managed criticism permitted by the Government. The press
 serves largely as a propaganda tool, to provide government-
 approved information to the populace. Representatives of
 non-Communist foreign media are able to travel to Mongolia,
 provided their trips are approved. Academic and artistic life
 also is controlled in accordance with government policy.
 Information flow is tightly monitored. Mongolian citizens
 have little access to books, periodicals, or newspapers not
 printed in Communist countries, but there are signs the
 Government is permitting more exposure to some Western plays
 and literature.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of demonstration and assembly are provided for in the
 Constitution, but in practice only government-authorized
 organizations may assemble, and permitted demonstrations are
 carefully orchestrated by government authorities.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to.
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government controls religious activity through the Office
 of Religious Affairs attached to the Council of Ministers.
 This office works in close consultation with the showcase
 Gandan monastery--the only monastery permitted to function.
 The monastery houses approximately 200 monks. All other
 monasteries have been closed since the 1930's. As a result,
 Lamaist Buddhism, which was a central force in Mongolian life
 prior to the establishment of the Communist Government, noL
 longer plays a significant part in the lives of most
 Mongolians. However, rural people reportedly retain many
 Buddhist beliefs privately. Vestiges of shamanism also remain.
 In addition to the 200 monks at Gandan monastery, there are
 reports of another 100 itinerant monks--loosely affiliated
 with Gandan. Gandan monastery also runs a nominal religious
 school on an extremely small scale--perhaps only two or three
 new students each year. Mongolians who visit the Gandan
 Monastery for worship are mostly of the older generation. Two
 other monasteries are currently being restored as museums.
 There are no mosques for the traditionally Islamic Kazakh
 minority of 80,000 in western Mongolia. This group has been
 permitted to retain cultural customs based on religious
 background such as dress.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of travel and of residence'is tightly controlled by
 the Government. Until recent years, few Mongolians traveled
 abroad, even to the Soviet Union. Foreign travel usually has
 been permitted only for official purposes, but government-
 sponsored education abroad has become increasingly common. In
 recent years, as many as 40,000 Mongolian youths have gone to
 various places in the Soviet Union yearly for specialized
 training programs. There has also been an increase in the
 number of senior scholars pursuing extended study abroad,
 although most foreign travel remains restricted to Soviet bloc
 countries. Though overall figures remain small, increasing
 numbers of Mongolians are permitted travel to the West for
 official, academic, or cultural purposes. There is no known
 routine emigration from Mongolia.
 All Mongolians over age 16 must have internal passports and
 must obtain permission from the Security Bureau in order to
 travel within the country. Changes of residence or employment
 must be approved by the Security Bureau and must accord with
 central planning goals.
 Although the 1960 Constitution assures the right "to reside in
 the territory of the MPR" to foreign citizens, Mongolian
 authorities in May 1983 began a systematic expulsion of the
 6,000 to 7,000 ethnic Chinese. Most of the affected persons
 resided in and around Ulaanbaatar and the families of many of
 
 
 884
 MONGOLIA
 them had been living and working in Mongolia for several
 generations. The Mongolian authorities claimed the expellees
 had no formal occupation or did not abide by Mongolian law or
 both. In line with the improvement of Sino-Mongolian
 relations in recent years, Mongolia stopped the arbitrary
 expulsion of ethnic Chinese in 1985; today Mongolia's Chinese
 population numbers less than 2,000. Increasingly the
 Mongolians are permitted to visit and be visited by ethnic
 ,Mongolian relatives whose homes are in China. A bilateral
 consular treaty regarding treatment of their nationals was
 signed by Mongolia and China in July 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government.
 The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) has a
 monopoly on political power, and there is no institutionalized
 mechanism by which the citizenry as a whole can effect
 transitions in leadership or changes in government. The MPRP
 is established on the Soviet model with a narrow pyramid of
 power topped by General Secretary Batmonkh. Lower-ranking
 members of the MPRP have very limited ability to influence the
 decisions of their superiors. Elections are held at regular
 intervals, but only one candidate is listed for each office,
 so the choice is to vote for the candidate or cross the name
 out. The 1986 election to the Great People's Hural brought
 into office a large group of younger officials in their 40's.
 In the 1986 election, 69.2 percent of all the deputies were
 elected to the Great Hural for the first time. Many elections
 reportedly result in a 99.9 percent turnout, and the sole
 candidate regularly receives the entire vote.
 From 1951 to 1986, the number of female deputies elected to
 the Great Hural, which has 370 deputies, increased from 51 to
 92. In 1987 elections to local Hurals, 33.9 percent of the
 15,967 deputies elected were women. Few women occupy
 positions of responsibility in the Government or in party
 structures, although women have served on the Presidium, the
 acting legislative body between sessions of the Great Hural.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Mongolia acceded to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights in 1976. There is no known organization
 dedicated to the protection of human rights in Mongolia.
 There is no known request by an international human rights
 group to investigate alleged human rights violations in
 Mongolia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There appears to be little discrimination in education on the
 basis of race, sex, or religion.
 Universal franchise and equal rights for women are official
 policy. According to government statistics, the percentage of
 women in the work force rose from 30 to 48.5 percent between
 1960 and 1984. Women constitute about 30 percent of the MPRP
 membership and 49.8 percent of trade union membership. Women
 also hold high professional positions in institutions such as
 schools, research centers, and hospitals.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to organize professional associations and trade
 unions is provided for in the Constitution, but it is
 government controlled and directed. It is not known how such
 organizations work in practice and whether trade unions have a
 right to strike. According to Freedom House, all worker
 committees are extensions of the MPRP. In the opini6n of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), constitutional
 provisions imply that no mass organizations, particularly
 trade unions, have any possibility of working outside the
 party framework. The ILO also notes that the Mongolian Labor
 Code effectively prevents the formation of any independent
 trade union organizations. All unions are grouped in the
 Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions (CCMTU) which itself
 is an extension of the MPRP. The CCMTU is affiliated with the
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no specific provision for collective bargaining in
 the labor law. However, local worker committees and people's
 courts are empowered by the law to form "Commissions for Labor
 Disputes" to settle labor grievances. Trade union council
 representatives and enterprise managers are represented
 equally on these commissions. It is not known how these
 commissions function in actual practice.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Whether forced labor is practiced is not known. Prisoners are
 routinely assigned to varyina work details or projects
 according to a prison work plan.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law proscribes work for children under age 16, although
 those aged 15 may work if allowed to by the local trade union
 committee. Those under 18 are statutorily prohibited from
 doing arduous work or from working in dangerous areas such as
 mining. The workday is prescribed as 8 hours for adults, 7
 hours for those aged 16 to 18, and 6 hours for those aged 15.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Mongolian Labor Law sets a minimum work age and maximum
 work hours for all workers and exhorts state enterprises to
 observe work safety requirements. The Labor Law provides that
 "the monthly earnings of a worker or employee may not be lower
 than the minimum amount of earnings established by the
 state." No information is available on the implementation of
 the labor law in this area.
