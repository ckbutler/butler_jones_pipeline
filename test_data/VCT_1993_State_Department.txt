 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 A member of the Commonwealth of Nations, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is
 a parliamentary democracy. After defeating the incumbent St. Vincent Labour Party
 in 1984 elections, Prime Minister James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Party
 won all 15 parliamentary seats in general elections held in May 1989. Although
 some concern was voiced about the resulting absence of any parliamentary opposi-
 tion, the elections were judged to be free and fair. New elections are to be held by
 August 1994.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the country, includes a
 coast guard and a small Special Services Unit with some paramilitary training. The
 force is controlled by and responsive to the civilian government and generally main-
 tains standards of professionalism that place a high value on respect for human
 rights.

 St. Vincent has a young population, a high rate of illiteracy, and serious unem-
 ployment, possibly as high as 40 percent. The major export product is bananas,
 which also represents the major source of foreign exchange earnings. St. Vincent's
 efforts toward nontraditional economic diversification have met with some success
 in new agricultural products, tourism expansion, and in industrial sectors.
 The country's human rights problems continued to include police use of physical
 abuse to extract confessions and a backlog of cases in the overburdened court sys-
 tem.
 RESPECT POR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political killings and
 no reports of fatal shootings by the police in 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment, and there were no reports of such practices in 1993. How-
 ever, a very high percentage of convictions (estimated at 95 percent by the regional
 human rights group, Caribbean Rights) is based on confessions. This has led to cred-
 ible charges that physical abuse by law enforcement officials during incarceration
 is sometimes used to extract confessions.
 One case of police misconduct occurred in August 1992 when a female police con-
 stable was found guilty of assaulting four ward assistants in a hospital in
 Kingstown. The women were subjected to vaginal searches in response to a report
 of missing money by another hospital employee, then taken to a police station but
 never arrested or charged. This incident sparked a public outrage, and the constable
 was ordered to pay the complainants, which she did.
 Prison facilities are inadequate. Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions remain
 serious problems.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-According to the Constitution, persons
 detained for criminal offenses are entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time
 by an impartial court. The Government has made progress in addressing the prob-
 lem of slow administration of justice resulting from a backlog of cases. In 1993 the
 Government increased from two to four the number of magistrates in an attempt
 to reduce the backlog. The backlog at year's end was 21 cases; of over 300 people
 in jail, fewer than 20 were awaiting trial.
 Istances of arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile were not reported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for public trials before
 an independent and impartial court. Criminal defendants are entitled to select their
 own legal counsel. Indigent defendantsare provided with cout-appointed attorneys
 only when the defendant is charged with a capital offense. Defendants are presumed
 innocent until proven guilty an may appeal cases to a regional high court system
 and ultimately to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are no separate
 security or military court systems. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other government intrusions
 into the private life of individual citizens. In 1993 there were no reports of such
 abuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Seech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. There are two major newspapers and numerous smaller, partisan
 publications; all are privately owned, and most are openly critical of the Govern-
 ment's policies. In general, the Government does not censor or otherwise interfere
 with the operation of the press. In 1990, however, the Government withdrew its own
 advertisements and official notices from the country's leading newspaper to protest
 the paper's critical treatment of government officials. In 1988 the government-
 owned radio station canceled a program that the Government considered provoca-
 tive; the station, with the Government's approval, agreed late in 1989 to reinstate
 the program, but this has not been done to date. The Government supervises the
 content of the station's programming, a fact that is often noted by opposition politi-
 cal parties. While the opposition andhuman rights monitors also complain that they
 are denied equal access to radio airtime, St. Vincent's television station is privately
 owned, and its policies regarding coverage of opposition views and political matters
 in general are considered to be even-hanged.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.

 c. Freedom of Religion.-All religions are free to practice and proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-These rights are provided for by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Notwithstanding the New Democratic Party's clean sweep of all 15 parliamentary
 seats in the May 1989 elections, St. Vincent has a genuine multiparty political sys-
 tem, with three major parties. St. Vincent's parliamentary system is based on the
 Westminister model. However, the incumbent Governor General, supported by the
 Government, refused to appoint the two opposition members to the Senate as called
 for by the Constitution. He contended that because there is currently no parliamen-
 tary opposition and therefore no leader of the opposition, consultations concerning
 these appointments could not take place. Elections must be held at least ever 5
 years, by secret ballot, with universal suffrage. Opposition allegations of irregular-
 ities in some recent elections have not been substantiated.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often comment on human
 rights matters of local concern. The St. Vincent Human Rights Association, affiliated
 with the regional body Caribbean Rights, closely moniLors government and police ac-
 tivities, especially with respect to treatment of prisoners, publicizing any cases of
 abuse. In 1990 it published a booklet on the administration of justice which focused
 on the delays in the court system and offered a number of recommendations. The
 Government's response was to appoint an additional (part-time) judge.
 The Government is generally responsive to public and private inquiries about its
 human rights practices.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law regardless of race,
 sex, or religion, and the Government adheres to this provision.
 Women.-In 1989 the Government took a significant step forward in terms of
 wage scales for women by adopting a new minimum wage law calling for equal pay
 for equal work. The law went into effect during 1990. Violence against women oc-
 curs in St. Vincent, but the Government has failed to take steps to determine the
 seriousness of the problem. Penalties for violent crimes against women are identical
 to those involving acts of assault perpetrated against men. Depending on the mag-
 nitude of the offense and the age of the victim, the penalty for rape is generally 10
 or more years in prison. Although some victims -)f domestic violence such as wife
 beating are reluctant to press charges, women are increr.singly willing to report
 such incidents to the police and the National Council of Women. The Ministry of
 Education, Youth, and Women's Affairs has a women's desk which assists the Na-
 tional Council of Women with seminars, training progams, and public relations.
 Children.-During 1993 the Government ratified the U.N. Convention on the
 Rights of the Child. However, the Parliament has not yet passed laws to bring local
 statutes into compliance with the Convention. The Social Welfare Office is the gov-
 ernment agency responsible for monitoring and protecting the welfare of children.
 The police are the enforcement arm-all reports of child abuse made to the Social
 Welfare Office are referred to the police for action. Marion House, a social services
 agency established by the Catholic Church in 1989, provides counseling and therapy
 services. Its director says that, while the reported level of cases has increased, it
 is difficult to determine whether this reflects more incidents or increased awareness
 leading to more reporting. She contends that the problem of child abuse is still
 underreported. The legal age of consent in St. Vincent is 15.
 People with Disabilities.-Fiscal considerations limit support for persons with dis-
 abilities. There is no specific legislation covering those with disabilities. Most se-
 verely handicapped people rarely leave their house because of the poor road system
 and lack of affordable wheelchairs. The Government partially supports a school for
 the disabled which has two branches. A separate, small rehabilitation center treats
 about five persons daily.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By law, Vincentians have the right to form unions,
 organize employees, and strike; these rights are generally respected in practice.
 However, there is no legislation for compulsory recognition of trade unions. Unions
 are independent of the Government and of political parties. Somewhat more than
 10 percent of the labor force is unionized, and no new unions were formed in 1993.
 
 
 There were no major strikes in 1993. Unions are free to form federations and to af-
 filiate with international labor bodies, and they do so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no legal obstacles
 to organizing unions; however, employers are not legally bound to recognize a par-
 ticular union as an exclusive bargaining agent. Some companies offer packages of
 benefits with terms of employment better than, or comparable to, what a union can
 normally obtain through negotiations. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by
 employers against union members and organizers. Generally effective mechanisms
 exist for resolving complaints. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination
 can be prosecuted for firing workers without cause (including for participation in
 union activities), and workers must be reinstated.
 There are no export processing zones in St. Vincent.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law sets the minimum work-
 ing age at 16, although a worker must be 18 to receive a national insurance card.
 This provision, monitored and enforced by the labor inspectfon office of the Ministry
 of Labour, is generally respected in practice. There is no known child labor except
 for children working on family-owned banana plantations, particularly during har-
 vest time.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are set by law and were last
 promulgated in 1989. They vary by sector and type of work and are specified for
 several skilled categories, including attendants, packers, cleaners, porters, watch-
 men clerks, etc. In agriculture the wage for workers provided shelter is $0.82
 (EC$2.25) per hour; skilled industrial workers earn $7.36 (EC$20) per day, and un-
 skilled workers earn $3.68 (EC$10) per day. In many sectors the minimum wage
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for workers and their families,
 but most workers earn more than the minimum. There is no legislation concerning
 the length of the workweek; however, the general practice is to work 40 hours in
 5 days. Workers are guaranteed a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks.
 According to the Ministry of Labour, legislation concerning occupational safety
 and health is outdated. The most recent legislation, the Factories Act of 1955, has
 some regulations concerning only factories, but enforcement of these regulations is
 ineffective due to a lack of inspectors.
