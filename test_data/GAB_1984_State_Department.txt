 GABON
 Gabon is a developing country with a single-party political
 system in which effective political power is concentrated in
 the Presidency. This office has been held since 1967 by
 President Omar Bongo, who was reconfirmed in office in 1973 and
 1979 in uncontested elections. A March 1983 amendment to the
 constitution of the country's only legal political party
 restricts candidacy in future presidential elections to the
 "Secretary General-Founder of the Democratic Party of Gabon,,
 thus reserving presidential candidacy for the current
 incumbent, President Bongo. In practice presidential power is
 somewhat limited by the increasing complexity of government and
 the diffusion of power through a 54-member Cabinet headed by a
 Prime Minister.
 A 93-member National Assembly elected from slates chosen by the
 single party meets regularly, but it has little real power.
 While opposition parties are not permitted, there have been
 cases in past years where local or parliamentary elections were
 contested and won by party members who were not supported by
 the party hierarchy.
 The country's Constitution guarantees protection of the
 individual and respect for the integrity of the person. While
 there have been reports of isolated exceptions, these rights
 are generally respected in practice. A legal system based upon
 French civil law, customary law, and the 1961 Constitution
 functions fairly effectively. Political rights, however, are
 not guaranteed under the Constitution, and active political
 opposition is not permitted. Public criticism of particular
 government actions and policies is allowed and occurs with some
 regularity within the context of the single party, although
 direct attacks on the President are prohibited.
 There is no evidence of systematic police or other repression
 of the population. The security forces are divided into
 several distinct and autonomous groups of varying
 effectiveness. While two or three of the services have an
 internal political intelligence role, the security forces do
 not as a rule interfere in the daily life of the population.
 Although still a developing country, Gabon has the highest per
 capita income ($4000) in sub-Saharan Africa due to its
 important petroleum and mineral resources and relatively small
 population. Economic performance has also benefited from
 long-standing government policies supporting private enterprise
 and encouraging foreign investment. While income distribution
 is skewed in favor of the modern urban sector as opposed to the
 traditional, agricultural sector, most Gabonese have benefited
 in some measure from the country's strong economy.
 There was no significant change in the human rights situation
 in Gabon in 1984. An estimated 14 - 20 persons are imprisoned
 for opposition political activity.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 .Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings or summary executions.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known or reported cases of abductions or
 hostage-taking by government or non-government groups. The
 authorities are sometimes slow to advise the families of
 accused criminals or detainees who are arrested, but there has
 been no evidence of attempts to suppress news of an arrest.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 A 1984 Amnesty International report contained allegations of
 torture of some political prisoners. No other such reports
 have been received. The political opposition group, the
 Movement for National Recovery (Morena), based in Paris, has
 alleged that several people detained in the Libreville prison
 on political charges have been mistreated or kept in degrading
 conditions. There are other reports, however, that virtually
 all prisoners are allowed family visits, and family members
 report no serious mistreatment. Amnesty's 1984 report also
 mentions allegations that some prisoners, both criminal and
 political, were held in chains for considerable periods as a
 form of punishment. Police are believed to be rough but not
 brutal in their treatment of suspected criminals. Prison
 conditions are harsh.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In Gabon, *acts against the security of the state" and
 "actions against the chief of state,' which can include
 advocating a multiparty system, are punishable crimes.
 Approximately 10 members or alleged members of the Morena
 opposition group are currently in prison on such charges; most
 were detained for several months before being brought to trial
 in 1982 and 1983. There have been no reports of detention
 without trial of persons accused of violations of criminal
 law. Gabonese law, amended in September 1983 and ratified by
 the National Assembly early in 1984, provides for up to six
 months of 'preventive detention', on a judge's order, of
 suspected criminals. Previously, there was no upper limit.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In 1983 four political dissidents were given non-public
 trials, with defense attorneys present, and sentenced to
 four-year prison terms. Their trial contrasted with the
 November 1982 public proceedings, with representatives of the
 international press and Amnesty International present, at
 which 29 dissidents were given prison sentences of from one to
 20 years; the period of pre-trial detention from December 1981
 to November 1982 was credited against the sentences, leading
 to the early release of five prisoners with sentences of
 eighteen months or less. (Seven more were released in March
 1983, when President Bongo reduced all sentences by five
 years. For the 17 remaining of the original group, sentences
 
 
 122
 GABON
 were reduced another five years in 1984; one more prisoner was
 then released. Nine prisoners were granted conditional
 release by presidential decree during December 1984.) There
 have been a few reports that the number of persons in prison
 for political opposition may be around 20, but firm
 information is available only on the 17 Morena members who
 were tried and initially sentenced to 4 to 20 years. The
 longest sentences have now been reduced to 10 years.
 Following the most recent release of prisoners, there are now
 believed to be no more than 7 of the Morena prisoners still
 incarcerated. Their crimes were printing and distribution of
 anti-government tracts, and allegedly encouraging the
 Government of France to use its influence in Gabon to bring
 about a multiparty political system. No political trials were
 reported in 1984.
 Gabon's Constitution specifies that the President has the
 authority to appoint, transfer, and dismiss judicial
 officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There has been no evidence of significant abuses by the
 Government in this area. The various police and security
 units monitor dissident political activity and do have the
 capability to monitor telephone conversations, but
 interference in the daily life of the populace is relatively
 rare.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are certain limits on these rights in Gabon: no direct
 public criticism of President Bongo is permitted, and no
 advocacy of a multiparty political system by the media or
 individuals is tolerated. The country's single daily
 newspaper, which is government-owned, regularly prints columns
 attacking alleged inefficiency or corruption in various
 government offices. Foreign magazines and newspapers, notably
 French publications and magazines printed elsewhere in Africa,
 which sometimes criticize the President and the one-party
 system, generally circulate freely in Gabon, although
 occasional issues of particular publications are seized by the
 police. Journalists are considered to be state employees and
 are expected to expound on themes as directed by the
 Government.
 The policies of the Government have been debated in public
 forums in the past. The President and his key ministers have
 submitted to lively direct questioning on television on
 domestic policy issues such as education, public housing, and
 transportation. However, these discussions and debates were
 not continued during 1984.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political activity outside the Democratic Party of Gabon is
 illegal. The Government does not interfere in other
 non-political organizations which individuals may wish to
 form. In some sectors, for example, sports clubs and social
 service organizations, there are national programs under
 government auspices, which dominate the scheduling of
 
 
 123
 GABON
 competitions and other activities, but diverse private groups
 and events sponsored by private companies also exist.
 All labor union activity is under the government-sponsored
 Gabonese Labor Confederation. This organization is closely
 tied to the*governing political structure and serves to
 represent the interests of workers in a national collective
 bargaining process, by sector, which is convened by government
 decree. This bargaining process determines salary levels
 throughout Gabon, which then must be approved by the
 Government. Petroleum sector employees have organized wildcat
 strikes successfully in the past to obtain wage increases and
 other objectives. Government employees are not permitted to
 belong to unions. The Gabonese Labor Confederation is a
 member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 The collective convention on labor, negotiated by the labor
 confederation and national employers over the course of
 several years, entered into force in 1983. It prescribes
 workers benefits and working conditions by sector. Based on
 this code, workers individually or collectively may in theory
 and do in practice take complaints of labor code violations to
 arbitration, and, if unsuccessful, may and have appealed to
 the national courts. Labor courts, which had fallen into
 disuse, are presently being resuscitated by the Government to
 improve the labor conciliation process.
 An estimated 65,000 foreign workers, many of them contract
 employees, are subject to minimum protection by the Government
 and may be fired or expelled to make place for unemployed
 nationals.
 In 1984 the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee
 on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations cited
 Gabon for violation of ILO Convention No. 87, involving
 workers' right to organize. The basis for this citation is
 Gabonese legislation making membership in the sole trade union
 confederation mandatory.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Gabonese Constitution guarantees the free practice of
 religion, and religious freedom and tolerance. Proselytizing
 has sometimes been discouraged. Christian, Muslim and animist
 religions, nonetheless, all flourish in Gabon, and public
 worship is unrestricted. A number of different religious
 groups operate schools. There is no political or economic
 discrimination because of religious preference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country, foreign travel, and return to
 Gabon are normally not restricted by the Government.
 Government employees, however, must obtain permission to
 travel abroad and private citizens must obtain exit permits.
 Since mid-1983, the Government has slightly tightened
 restrictions on the entry and resettlement of refugees, but
 many individuals who have a "well-founded fear of persecution'
 in their country of origin have been given permission to stay
 in Gabon; they come from a variety of countries, including
 those with which Gabon has friendly bilateral relations.
 There have been no reported cases of involuntary repatriation,
 and those refugees who wish to repatriate voluntarily are
 allowed to do so.

 GABON
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Gabon is governed by a centralized, single-party regime in
 which President Omar Bongo exercises most but not all
 effective power. Major political and economic decisions are
 made by the President, usually in consultation with cabinet
 members. This group of 54 includes representatives of all the
 country's major ethnic, geographic, and political groupings.
 Gabon's varied interest groups are thus given access to
 political patronage. The Fang, an ethnic group comprising 40
 percent of the population, feel themselves to be
 underrepresented. Fear of Fang dominance by the remaining 60
 percent has contributed to the President's political control.
 The need to maintain the balance of interests represents,
 therefore, the major check on presidential power. The very
 size and complexity of the government structure is another.
 Opposition political parties are not permitted. Membership in
 the single political party is open to all Gabonese but is not
 required. Elections below the presidential level are
 sometimes contested, but all candidates must be approved by
 the Democratic Party of Gabon.
 Women enjoy full legal rights in Gabon, although their
 influence and overall participation in government is limited
 by cultural factors. The Gabonese legal system contains many
 statutes providing specific rights and protection to women,
 but most are probably unaware of these provisions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 President Bongo has invited representatives of Amnesty
 International and other human rights organizations to visit
 Gabon. An Amnesty International representative from Senegal
 was present in 1982 for the major human rights-related event
 in recent years, the public trial of the Morena dissidents.
 The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has had a
 refugee office in Gabon, but its functions have been assumed
 by the United Nations Development Program, since the number of
 refugees from Equatorial Guinea has dropped substantially.
 In its 1984 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the continued imprisonment of 18 prisoners of
 conscience, 17 of whom were sentenced to long prison terms in
 the dissidents' trials. Amnesty argued that the court
 proceedings did not conform to recognized international
 standards. A special report on the trials issued in 1984
 renewed and detailed Amnesty criticism. This report was
 rebutted in Gabon's press. Freedom House rates Gabon "not
 free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Gabon is a developing country which as a result of significant
 petroleum and mineral resources and a population of only one
 million has one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa --
 about $4000 in 1982. Gabon has enjoyed substantial economic
 growth over the past 10 years, helped in part by the
 Government's policy of supporting private enterprise and
 encouraging foreign investment. However, economic growth has
 
 
 GABON
 stagnated over the last three years due to the depressed state
 of world markets for Gabon's principal exports. In spite of
 its good economic record, Gabon faces the problem common in
 developing countries of trying to integrate the modern sector
 of the economy with the traditional sector based on
 semi-subsistence agriculture. Income distribution is skewed
 in favor of the roughly 50 percent of the population who live
 in the modern urban sector. The Government is attempting to
 ensure further economic growth and a more equitable
 distribution of national income through a program of
 investment in education, social services, infrastructure, and
 agriculture. Access to the Government's social programs is
 open to all Gabonese citizens on a non-discriminatory basis.
 The right of both men and women to hold private property is
 spelled out in the Constitution and is in practice fully
 protected. Pay scales are relatively high by African
 standards with the minimum wage at about $125 per month.
 There is little unemployment among Gabonese wishing to enter
 the wage economy. Some unemployment exists among recent
 baccalaureate and university graduates.
 According to the World Bank, life expectancy at birth rose
 from 40.2 in 1970 to 50 years in 1984. Estimates of infant
 mortality have varied widely. The World Bank statistics for
 1984 of 162 per 1000 indicate a slight decrease from 1983.
 The large majority of the population has access to maternity
 clinics and basic health facilities. A World Bank estimate of
 the ratio of available calorie supply to nutritional
 requirements was 103.76 percent in 1977. There has been no
 evidence of significant malnutrition due to inadequate food
 supplies, but lack of knowledge of good nutritional practices
 for children in the traditional sector remains a problem. The
 World Bank in 1980 gave the primary school enrollment ratio as
 100.66 percent. The Government has made school attendance
 compulsory and nearly all primary school-aged children are
 believed to be attending school.
 In recent years, women have begun to play an increasing role
 in the economic, political, and cultural life of the country,
 particularly in the urban areas. The Government and party
 have become more sensitized to women's issues, and
 newly-created government and party institutions are actively
 promoting women's rights. The Ministry of Women's Affairs in
 1984 commanded additional resources, including the creation of
 a national commission for the promotion of women. The
 Ministry's action program is still largely at the planning
 stage, although an effort is under way to determine women's
 needs and aspirations in the traditional agricultural sector.
 The party's women's union is active in organizing women's
 cultural presentations throughout the country. Although no
 women are found among the top 40 full government ministers,
 four women occupy cabinet level positions as secretaries of
 state, and nine others occupy junior minister positions.
 Women are particularly active in the judiciary.
