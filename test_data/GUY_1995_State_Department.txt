 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations
 and the Caribbean Community (Caricom), is a small, multiracial, developing nation
 with a unicameral Parliament chosen by direct election in a multiparty political sys-
 tem. Dr. Cheddi Jagan, leader of the party with a plurality of seats in Parliament,
 is Executive President. The President appoints a Prime Minister and other Cabinet
 Ministers. Local and international observers generally agreed that the 1992 general
 elections were free and fair.
 The Guyana Defence Force (GDF) and the Guyana Police Force (GPF) comprise
 the security forces, which are subordinate to the civilian government. The GDF is
 a small, professional military organization of less than 2,000 uniformed personnel
 which has only a limited role in law enforcement. The GPF has primary responsibil-
 ity for maintaining law and order throughout Guyana. The GPF has historically
 been underpaid and undertrained. There have been allegations of GPF abuse of au-
 thority and excessive use of force.
 The economy depends on agriculture, fisheries, forestry and mining, with sugar,
 rice, bauxite, and gold the major export earners. The estimated growth rate for 1995
 is 6.3 percent, with per capita gross domestic product estimated at $632. The econ-
 omy suffers from high external debt, shortages of skilled labor, and a deteriorating
 infrastructure.
 Human rights problems continued to include police abuse of detainees and pris-
 oners, allegations of extrajudicial killings, severe delays in the inefficient judicial
 system, poor prison conditions, societal violence against women and children, and
 discrimination against women and indigenous Amerindians. The authorities im-
 proved police traming, however, police abuses were often committed with impunity,
 and the Police Complaints Authority was largely ineffective because it lacks inde-
 pendent power. There are still some limitations on worker rights, but political con-
 trol of union activity continued to diminish.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There were allegations that police killed criminal suspects under questionable cir-
 cumstances. Police authorities state that such cases are investigated and that those
 policemen who act unlawfully are dismissed or prosecuted. However, critics claim
 the authorities do not sufficiently investigate and prosecute the police officers re-
 sponsible.
 In March the Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) called for the establish-
 ment of a commission of inquiry on police use of force and brutality, because of what
 it described as several "disturbing tendencies": a sense of impunity from prosecution
 (for brutality, drugs, and other corruption); an unwillingness to prosecute police for
 criminal offenses; use of deadly force against alleged criminal suspects; and failure
 of the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) to respond adequately to grievances
 against the police. The GHBRA and local press reports highlighted a number of cases.
 In February Amnesty International reported a case of police brutality and ill
 treatment against residents of Cane Grove during a police antinarcotics campaign
 in June 1994. Police allegedly beat Zabeeda Hussein in her home when she at-
 tempted to protect her crippled husband from a beating. She later claimed that they
 hit her in the stomach, causing a miscarriage of pregnancy. Rohan Sing, who also
 claimed police beat him, was seen covered in blood while in police custody. Amnesty
 International also raised the case of Shivnarine and Ramchen Dalchand, whom po-
 lice allegedly beat and arrested in August 1994. Four days later, Shivnarine
 
 
 435
 
 Dalchand drowned while attempting to escape from a police boat, according to po-
 lice. Autopsy reports later revealed that there was no water in his lun  and that
 his body s owe 13 external and 4 internal injuries. A government pathologist ruled
 that Daichand died of "pulmonary edema." The Director of Public Prosecution inves-
 tigated the case and referred it to the coroner for an inquest. A report of the results
 of-the coroner's inquest has not been released.
 In June police killed ex-soldier and career criminal Wayne Bancroft. Bancroft
 served 3 years in the Mazaruni Prison from 1992. He required hospitalization three
 times while in prison due to alleged beatings. He claimed that after his release po-
 lice frequently harassed and fired shots at him. He fled to French Guiana in Janu-
 ary but was deported in February. Upon his return to Guyana, he was arrested and
 held for several days. He claimed that police extorted $10,000 from him to avoid fur-
 ther arrests. On June 1, police chased Bancroft whom eyewitnesses claim volun-
 tarily came out of the building in which he took refuge with his hands raised to
 surrender to the police. Police shot Bancroft; upon arrival at the hospital where he
 was pronounced dead, officers claimed he was 'Michael Craig," a wanted criminal.
 Although witnesses reported that Bancroft was unarmed, the police said he was a
 wanted suspect who was fatally shot while advancing toward them with a knife in
 his hand after his partner fired shots at policemen.
 In July police shot Orin Garraway in the head after a chase in a Georgetown
 neighborhood and took him to the hospital in critical condition. He was allegedly
 a wanted criminal and a friend of Wayne Bancroft. According to police, he ran when
 challenged by a police patrol. Police pursued him and during a confrontation and
 scuffle, police shot him when he pulled a gun and threatened one of the policemen.
 However, according to a number of reported eyewitness accounts, Garraway ran
 from officers who had weapons drawn, and was shot in the head at point blank
 range after he had fallen during the chase. A police investigation was conducted and
 resulted in a declaration that Garraway was shot after he drew his firearm. The
 Director of Public Prosecution called for an inquest, but by year's end it had not
 b n August polie shot and klled Simon Joseph, a fish vendor. He was not a sus-
 pect wanted biy the poie. The Working Peoples' Alliance (WPA) alleged that he was
 socializing with friends in a yard between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 n.m. when police offi-
 cers accosted him. Witnesses claim that when he questioned the police order to come
 with them, he was shot in the back and died later at the Georgetown Hospital. This
 case is under investigation by the police.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.,
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, the GHRA and the press reported a
 number of serious incidents of police brutality.
 In August after a cyanide-polluted flow from a major gold mining operation spilled
 into the river Essequibo, police used excessive force to break up a protest dem-
 onstration around the Pariament building. Two women associate  with the Work-
 ing People's Alliance were allegedly assaulted by the police. Dow, a former elections
 commissioner, claimed that plice roughed her up, kicked her, and threw her into
 the back seat of their vehicle. She alleged that later they threw her from the car
 to the pavement. De Souza claimed that she was nearly run over by a police vehicle
 and otherwise intimidated by officers. The WPA threatened to file a lawsuit against
 the police, but on November 24 charges against De Souza were dropped and the
 matter settled without litigation.
 In September the local press reported that Chief Magistrate K. Juman Yassin or-
 dered a drug prisoner-Wilfred Scipio-taken to a doctor and a medical certificate
 produced. Scipio alleged that police severely beat him which caused a severed vein
 and serious bleeding. He said that he received no medical attention and was forced
 to sleep on a bare concrete floor for 8 days after his arrest prior to his appearance
 in court. When asked by the magistrate why he had not been brought to court ear-
 lier, Scipio said that he was too sick to move; the police, however, countered that
 their investigation was not complete. The magistrate ordered a change of police de-
 tention faciities after Scipio expressed fear of returning to his former place of cus-
 oeme confessions have been thrown out of court on the grounds that they were
 coerced. Chief Justice Cecil Kennard, at a conference of magistrates in September,
 expressed his concern that police prosecutors depend too heavily on the confessions
 of defendants in court proceedings. He felt that in many cases, confessions are not
 always good evidence of guilt. He cautioned magistrates that they must ensure that
 they are fully satisfied that confessions presented to them for evidence in trials were
 free and voluntary and not forced via intimidation or other means. Such statements,
 he said, should not automatically be admitted as evidence in criminal trials.
 
 
 There were continuing reports of police officers' involvement in criminal activity,
 including extortion, intimidation, and assault, although the number of reports of
 such charges continue to decline.
 Citizens complained that members of the special police impact group engage in
 intimidation and rough physical treatment of detainees and suspects. In June Dr.
 Iughley Hanoman, (a ruling party member of Parliament) alleged that impact pa-
 tro police "manhandled" him, threw him into a police van, threatened him with in-
 carceration at a local lock-up, refused him a hone call to his lawyer, insulted him
 with racial slurs, and generally intimidated him. The impact officers took him to
 jail and later released rim on $3,000 bail, after intervention by the acting police
 commissioner. Dr. Hanoman was not charged with a crime, and afterward report-
 edly said that he now understood the accusations of police harassment and abuse
 of power.
 There is no independent body charged with looking into complaints of police bru-
 tality or abuse. The Ombudsman lacks the authority to look into allegations of po-
 lice misconduct. Such cases are heard by the Police Complaints Authority; however,
 the PCA has no power to interview police officers or witnesses and must rely on ma-
 terial submitted by the police. The PCA refers cases of alleged abuse to the Police
 Commissioner. Investigations of such charges appear to be perfunctory and rarely
 result in serious disciplinary action. Officers charged as a result of complaints to
 the PCA are routinely suspended for a few days and sometimes fined, but are rarely
 jailed. In essence, the police force is responsible for investigating itself.
 Some of Guyana's prisons continue to be severely overcrowded. The GHRA re-
 ported that there were over 900 prisoners in a space originally intended for 300
 (later upgraded to accommodate 553) at the Camp Street prison in Georgetown. Cor-
 rections authorities admit that the average population at Camp Street prison has
 been about 806 prisoners. Prisons officials claim that Camp Street is the only prison
 that is overpopulated. After a prison break in October at Lusignan, when scores of
 prisoners escaped into surrounding communities, the GHRA claimed that the num-
 ber at that prison was excessive as well.
 The severe overcrowding at Camp Street prison is blamed on the law courts and
 recent sentencing guidelines that require mandatory prison sentences of 3 to 5 years
 for narcotics possession. Most of the prisoners were convicted on narcotics charges
 involving small amounts of marijuana.
 The GHRA cited poor diet, inadequate medical attention, underpaid and poorly
 trained staff, and lengthy trial delays as problems facing the prison system. Local
 press sources report that due to overcrowding, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted
 diseases including HIV/AIDS, and other health problems are rising, posing serious
 public health risks for inmates when they are freed and return to their commu-
 nities. Additionally, due to restricted budgets and other limitations, the large influx
 of prisoners in recent periods reduces efforts directed at rehabilitation and training.
 Groups concerned with prison conditions report there is often poor sanitation and
 inadequate access to proper medical care, particularly at police station holding fa-
 cilities. The East La Pemtence police station, where women prisoners are held until
 sentencing, is below standard compared to other prisons in the country. Intended
 as a temporary holding place before sentencing prisoners, the station has become
 a long-term home for many women whose cases are held up in the overburdened
 judicial system. The Government did appoint a GHRA member to the- prison visiting
 committee.
 As another example, the Brickdam police station holding facility, a temporary de-
 tention center for about 50 male prisoners, is overcrowded, damp, dimly lit, and foul
 smelling. It has 14 cells about 5- by 8-feet in area, no beds, no wash basins, no fur-
 niture and no utensils. Each cell has up to five persons, but no toilets; inmates must
 be escorted by staff members outside of the cells to use holes in the floor for toilets.
 Inmates sleep on the bare concrete floor, damp with urine and water.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 may be deprived of personal liberty except as authorized by law and requires judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention, a mandate that was generally re-
 spected in practice.
 Arrest does not require a warrant issued by a court official, only an assessment
 of guilt by the police officer. The law requires that a person arrested and held for
 more than 24 hours be brought before a court to be charged. Chief Magistrate K.
 Juman Yassin publicly complained that suspects are often detained for more than
 24 hours but never charged. Bail is generally available except in capital cases. In
 narcotics cases, magistrates have some limited discretion in granting bail before
 trial but must send all persons convicted on narcotics charges to custody, even if
 an appeal is pending.
 Exile is not practiced.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary which is generally the case in practice. The local court system is composed
 of a High (Supreme) Court, a national Cout of Appeals, and a system of magistrate
 courts which have branches in the various regions and departments of the country.
 Magistrates are members of the civil service and are trained lawyers. The m     -
 istrate courts deal with both criminal and civil matters. The Ministry of Legal  -
 fairs headed by the Attorney General represents the State and plays the role of
 state prosecutor. It also supervises the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution.
 The Constitution provides that anyone charged with a criminal offense has the
 right to a hearing by a court of law, and this right is respected in practice. Guyana
 has a functioning bail system. Defendants are granted public trials, and appeal may
 be made to higher courts.
 In the past some members of the opposition to the previous People's National
 Congress (PNC) governments expressed concern over court rulings in libel suits
 brought by government officials as well as other governmental use of the courts to
 harass political opponents. The judiciary now exerts greater independence due to
 the freer political atmosphere which has developed in the country since 1985. The
 present Government made no attempt to use the courts to intimidate the opposition.
 Delays in judicial proceedings are often caused by shortages of trained court ad-
 ministrative personnel and magistrates, inadequate resources, low salaries, and the
 slowness of police in preparing cases for trial. The inefficiency of the judicial system
 is so great as to undermine due process. Prisoners are often detained 3 or 4 years
 awaiting trial. Appeals of some murder cases have been delayed for several years.
 Trial postpnements are routinely granted to both the defense and the prosecution.
 Althdough the law recognizes the right to legal counsel, in practice, with the excep-
 tion of capital crimes, it has been limited to those who can afford to pay. An alter-
 native surfaced in March 1994 with the new legal aid clinic. The Government pro-
 vided a small cash grant for the clinic as well as the services of a lawyer from the
 Attorney General's office. Initially, due to budget constraints, the clinic limited its
 activities to civil cases in Georgetown. As the clinic has become more widely used,
 and another attorney was added to the staff, criminal cases related to the civil cases
 (assault as part of a divorce case for example) have been pursued. Apart from these
 efforts, virtually no lawyers work pro bono in criminal cases. Defendants in murder
 cases are assigned an attorney by the court. The Guyana Association of Women
 Lawyers provides free legal services for civil cases only.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Pivacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects the right to privacy. The laws requiring judicially is-
 sued warrants for searches were generally respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitutional provision for freedom of
 speech is generally respected, and citizens may freely criticize their government and
 its policies.                        I
 As in 1993, there were credible charges that high government officials pressured
 foreign investors to cancel contracts with a consultant who was a former PNC gov-
 ernment official. On another occasion, there were credible charges that a govern-
 ment official restricted freedom of speech and freedom of the press by intervening
 in the employment contract of a local businessman who does editorialcommenta_
 on a news program which is sometimes critical of the Government. Government offi-
 cials pressured a foreign investor to force its consultant to stop editorializing on the
 news and in any other public forum, or to cancel the contract.
 The indepenent Stabrek News continued to publish seven times a week with
 one weekly regional edition. Independent and opposition newspapers frequently
 criticized the Government in editorials and satirized it in cartoons.
 The government-owned Guyana Broadcasting Corporation operates Guyana Tele-
 vision and one radio station (with two separate programs), which provide relatively
 evenhanded reporting on local events. Guyana has no private radio stations, but
 does have eight private television stations in Georgetown and four in outlying areas.
 Two of the private stations produce newscasts which are often critical of the overn-
 ment, and a third produces general public affairsprogrammingwhich addresses is-
 sues of local interest and is considered to be more favorable to the Government.
 In past years, the Government exercised varying degrees of control over the media
 through ownership of what had been the countrs oiy daily news apr (The Guy-
 ana Chronicle), the communications agency, the radio station, and the issuance of
 import licenses for newsprint and printing presses. The Government's role in the
 media has since declined with the proliferation of television stations, lack of a Min-
 ister of Information, and the existence of an independent daily newspaper.
 
 
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Public Order Act requires
 police permits for mass political meetings. The Police Commissioner has the author-
 ity to refuse permission for a ublic meeting at his discretion and without expla-
 nation. There was no evidence that he used this authority for political purposes. Yo-
 litical parties and other groups held public meet and and rallies throughout the
 country without hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Members of all faiths are allowed to wor-
 ship freely. Guyanese practice a wide variety of religions, the major faiths being
 Christiamity, Hinduism, and Islam. There are no restrictions on foreign religious
 groups proselytizing in Guyana.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within Guyana.
 Travel to Amerindian areas requires government permission, the result of a law dat-
 in from colonial times designed to protect the indigenous people from exploitation.
 Prior to the 1992 elections, the GIRA, opposition politicians, and some clergy con-
 tended that permits were sometimes denied to missionaries and non-PNC politicians
 and that the regulations were used to maintain PNC influence among the
 Amerindians. In practice, however, most people travel throughout these areas with-
 out regard to the formality of a permit. Citizens are free to travel abroad, to emi-
 grate, and to return.
 The Government does not have any fixed policy on refugee or asylum applications.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee
 status; however, government policy remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Guyana has a unicameral Parliament which is chosen by direct election in a
 multiparty political system based on proportional representation. The leader of the
 party which obtains a plurality of seats in Parliament during national elections is
 sworn in as Executive President. The President appoints a Cabinet, headed by a
 Prime Minister, which together with the President exercises executive power.
 Citizens are free to join or support political parties of their choice. The 1992 gen-
 eral election, considered free and fair by foreign observers, brought the major oppo-
 sition party to power. Despite constitutional provisions, elections were still not held
 on schedule or m a consistent manner. The general election was delayed from 1990
 to October 1992; municipal elections, scheduled for December 1992, were delayed
 until October 1994. Any citizen 18 years or older can register to vote, and about 80
 percent of those registered cast votes in the 1992 election.
 No progress was made on reforming or replacing the Constitution, which grants
 extensive powers to the President. Constitutional reform requires a two-thirds ma-
 jority in Parliament, which can only be achieved through the cooperation of the rul-
 ing party and the opposition.
 There are no legal impediments to participation of women or minorities in the po-
 litical process, but historically neither women nor Amerindians were encouraged to
 participate, other than by voting. The Cabinet includes three women, two persons
 of Portuguese descent, one of Chinese origin, nine of East Indian extraction, four
 Afro-Guyanese, and one Amerindian. The 73-member Parliament includes 11
 women and 8 Amerindians, representing both major parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Guyana Human Rights Association, the most active local human rights group,
 functioned without government interference. The GHRA is a nongovernmental orga-
 nization formed in 1979 with the participation of trade unions, professional organi-
 zations, various ethnic groups, and churches. It issues periodic press releases and
 publishes an annual report on human rights in Guyana. The Government made no
 public statements in response to either GHRA or foreign human rights reports.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution provides fundamental rights for all persons regardless
 of race, sex, religion or national origin, the Government does not always observe this
 in practice.
 Women.-Violence against women, including domestic violence, is a significant
 problem. Wife beating, rape, and incest are common. Lawyers said that more vic-
 tims are reporting these crimes to the authorities although there is still a social
 stigma attached to it. Victims of such abuse who do seek redress from the police
 and the courts often suffer social retribution and additional harassment from the
 
 
 authorities charged with pursuing their complaints. Because of their economic cir-
 cumstances and the lack of any family shelters or other place of solace, victims of
 domestic violence are often trapped in their homes with their abusers. A women's
 organization has begun a crisis hotline and is in the process of refurbishing an exist-
 ing building to be used as a shelter for women suffering physical abuse.
 The 1990 Equal Rights Act was meant to end sex discrimination, but the failure
 to include a specific definition of discrimination rendered the act unenforceable.
 There is no legal protection against widespread sexual harassment in the workplace,
 and dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy is common and not illegal. In December
 1994, credible charges of sexual harassment were brought against a prominent busi-
 nessman. The case was dismissed and the perpetrator fined one Guyanese dollar in
 damages.
 A 1988 government-sponsored constitutional amendment rendered the equal pay
 provision unenforceable except in cases in which equal pay for equal work is pro-
 vided for by specific statute. No such statutes have been enacted.
 Other legislation passed by Parliament in 1990 protects women's property rights
 under common law marriage, entitling a woman who separates or divorces to one-
 half of the couple's property if she had been working and one-third of the property
 if she had been a housewife. However, divorce by consent remains illegal, and there
 are unequal prvisions regarding adultery as grounds for divorce. The legislation
 also gave authority to the courts to overturn a man's will in the event it did not
 provide for the wife.
 Ther ae few organizations, other than those sponsored by political parties, that
 focus primarily on women's rights. Two exceptions are the Guyana chapter of the
 Caribbean Association for Feminist Research and Action and the National Women's
 Rights Campaign, which opened a counseling center for victims of violent relation-
 shis i ea~y1993.
 (YhildrenAn estimated 65 to 86 percent of the population lives in poverty, and
 children are more severely affected than any other group. The severe deterioration
 of the public education and health care systems has stunted children's futures and
 often cut short their lives. For many children, health care has beome unaffordable.
 Children are often denied access to education because their families cannot afford
 school fees or because their families need the children to contribute to running the
 household by working or providing child care for other children.
 The worst effects on children's lives come from migration. More than 3 percent
 of the population emigrates every year in search of a brighter economic future. As
 parents miIrate they often leave behind their children toe raised by other family
 members, friends, or by other children. Nearly 1 per~cent of Guyana's households are
 headed by children under the as of 14.
 Media reports of rape and incest have increased, indicating that violence against
 children is a significant and reoccurring problem. The administration of justice for
 children is characterized by a punitive legal system which does not take into ac-
 count the needs of children fleeing sexual, physical, or emotional abuse.
 A committee headed by First Lady Janet Jagan and several Government Min-
 isters drated a national program for action on children, but the Government's abil-
 ity to improve the lot of children suffering sexual, physical, or emotional abuse de-
 pends on budgetary considerations.
 People With Disabilities.-The lack of appropriate infrastructu re to provide access
 to both public and private fcilities makes it very difficult to employ the disabled
 outside theirhomes. There is no law mandating provision of access or people with
 disabilities.
 Guyana has several special schools and training centers for the disabled, but like
 the rest of the educational system thes  e understaffed and in severe disrepair.
 Indigenous People.-Guyana has a small Amerindian population, composed of
 nine tribal groups, most living in reservations and villages in remote parts of the
 interior. Their standard of living is much lower than that of most Guyanese, and
 their ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and
 the allocation of natural resources is limited.
 Amerindian life is regulated by the Amerindian Act, legislation dating from colo-
 nial times designed to protect indigenous people from exploitation. The Act gives the
 Government the power to determine who is an Amerindian and what is an Amer-
 indian community, to appoint Amerindian leaders, and to annul decisions made by
 Amerindian councils. It also prohibits the sale of alcohol to Amerindians and re-
 quires government permission before any Amerindian can accept formal employ-
 ment, though these proevisions generally are not enforced. oth individuals and
 Amerindian grups remain free to criticize the Government.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Longstanding ethnic tensions, primarily be-
 tween Guyanese of African and East Indian descent, continued to influence Guyk-
 
 
 440
 nese society and political life. The civil service and defense and police forces are
 overwhelmingly staffed by Afro-Guyanese. Recruitment efforts targeted at Indo-Guy-
 anese candidates for the uniformed services generally have met with an
 unenthusiastic response, with most qualified Indo-Guyanese candidates opting for a
 business or professional career over military, police, or public service. The chief of
 staff of the Guyana Defence Force is Indo-Guyanese and there are other Indo-Guya.
 nese officers in both the GDF and the police force.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of association
 and specifically enumerates a worker's right to "form or belong to trade unions." The
 law does not require employers to recognize a union in the workplace, even if a large
 majority of workers have indicated their desire to be represented by a union.
 Most union members work in the public sector and in state-owned enterprises. Or-
 ganized labor freely associates in one major national federation, the Guyana Trades
 Union Congress (TUC) which is composed of 22 unions. There is a tradition of close
 ties between the trade union movement and political parties.
 Historically, the two major political parties wielded significant influence over the
 leadership of several unions, and trade union officials often served in dual roles as
 party officials. Although this still occurs, it is less common.
 Workers have a generally recognized right to strike, but the law nominally forbids
 public employees providing essential services from striking. A procedure exists for
 the review of their grievances by a tribunal appointed b the Minister of Labour.
 Most strikes in 1995 were illegal, i.e., the union leadership did not approve them
 or they did not meet the requirements specified in collective bargaining agreements.
 Unions and their federations freely maintain relations with recognized Caribbean
 and international trade union and professional groups. All three of the major inter-
 national trade union federations have affiliates in Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-Public and private sector em-
 ployees possess and utilize the generally accepted right to organize and to bargain
 ollectively. The Ministry of Labour certifies all collective bargaining agreements
 and has never refused to do so. This right in not codified, however, and employers
 ame not legally required to recognize unions or bargain with them.
 Individual unions directly negotiate ollective bagining status, pursuant to the
 gulation which required that a ollective bargaining be nego-
 th ae TUC. Unions are dissatisfied with the provision granting the
 Ministr of Finance veto power over wage contracts negotiated by other ministries.
 The Chief Labour Officer and the sta of the Ministry of Labour provide consulta-
 tion, enforcement, and conciliation services. The Ministry has a backlog of cases,
 compounded by insufficient manpower and transportation, which severely limit the
 Ministry's ability to function.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it occurs.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Factories Act and the Em-
 ployment of Young Persons and Children Act set out minimum age requirements
 for employment. Legally, no person under age 14 may be employed in any industrial
 undertaking, and no person under age 16 may be employed at night, except under
 regulated circumstances. The law permits children under age 14 to be employed
 only in enterprises in which members of the same family are employed. Poverty-
 stricken young children work, and it is common throughout the country to see very
 young children engaged in street trading. While cognizant of the situation, the Min-
 istry of Labour does not employ sufficient inspectors to enforce existing laws effec-
 tively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labour Act and the Wages Councils Act
 allow the Labour Ministry to set minimum wages for various categories of private
 employers. The Government raised official minimum wages by 16 percent in Janu-
 ary which set the minimum wage for workers at $46.04 (G$6,353) per month. Both
 the legal minimum wage for the private sector and the public sector minimum wage
 are insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a family. There is no en-
 forcement mechanism, and unorganized workers, particularly women and children,
 are frequently paid less than what is legally required.
 The Shops Act and the Factories Act set hours of employment, which vary by in-
 dustry and sector. In general, work in excess of an 8-hour day or a 44-hour week
 requires payment of an overtime rate. However, if the initial contract stipulates a
 48-hour workweek, then the overtime rate only applies for hours worked in excess
 of 48 hours. The law does not provide for at least a 24-hour rest period.
 
 
 441
 The Factories Act also sets forth workplace safety and health standards. The Oc-
 cupation Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of Labour is charged with con-
 ducting factory inspections and investigating complaints of substandard workplace
 conditions. As with its other responsibilities, inadequate resources prevented the
 Ministry from effectively carrying out this function. Workers cannot remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardizing continued employment.
\
