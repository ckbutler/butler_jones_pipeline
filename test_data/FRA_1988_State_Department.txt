 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional provisions
 for human rights, freely functioning political parties, and
 regular elections. Voter participation (with universal
 suffrage) is high. Elections at the local as well as national
 level are occasions for ideological and topical debate.
 France has a highly developed industrial economy with a
 mixture of public and private enterprises. The Government has
 decided to halt the previous government's policy of
 denationalizing key industries, banks, and certain services.
 The Government also has said that there will be no new
 nationalizations.
 French authorities respect human rights and civil liberties
 and have taken steps to protect the rights of minority
 groups. A firm counterterrorist policy has helped to reduce,
 but has not eliminated, violent incidents perpetrated by small
 extremist groups. The promotion of human rights is also a
 principal tenet of French foreign policy. French leaders
 speak out frequently on worldwide abuses of human rights and
 often refer to the protection of these rights within France.
 The nation's overall human rights record is excellent. At
 midyear, following national elections, the new Government
 named a cabinet-level Secretary of State for Humanitarian
 Action who reports directly to the Prime Minister and is
 responsible for promoting human rights in France and assisting
 the Foreign Ministry in international negotiations on human
 rights issues. Also since 1988, a cabinet-level Minister
 Delegate for Foreign Affairs has had specific responsibility
 for international human rights matters. In 1989 the
 bicentennial of the French Revolution and its Universal
 Declaration of the Rights of Man will be widely celebrated in
 France.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The overall incidence of terrorism in France continued to
 decline during 1988. Corsican separatists killed a policeman
 early in the year, but an effective response by French
 internal security forces has since reduced the level: of
 violence on the island. The police also dealt severe blows to
 the small French Basque separatist movement, and judicial
 authorities prosecuted members of the leftist Action Directe
 group, which has been largely quiescent since 1987. Middle
 East spillover terrorism in France was all but absent during
 1988; the major international terrorist incident was the
 assassination in March of the Paris representative of the
 African National Congress. French police are investigating
 the incident but so far have not turned up any conclusive
 evidence.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that French security services have
 engaged in abduction or secret arrests.

 FRANCE
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 France does not condone or practice torture or cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment. However, there were
 several documented cases of police brutality, including the
 beating of one arrested American citizen. According to
 official statements, judicial authorities disciplined police
 officers in some cases and dismissed the allegations as
 unfounded in others.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 French law guarantees freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus
 in the French legal system, but there is a limit of 2 days--
 4 in drug and terrorist cases--before a suspect must be
 transferred to a magistrate for investigation.
 The judiciary plays a determining role in the detention
 process. Government authority to hold a person beyond the
 prescribed periods is severely restricted, and such detention
 must be ordered by the competent court.
 The Chirac Government--which left power in May 1988--pursued
 its policy, initiated in 1986, of expelling to Spain certain
 Basque separatist activists suspected of participating in, or
 providing logistical support, for the Spanish Basque terrorist
 organization, Basque Fatherland and Freedom. The Government
 used a 1945 legal procedure called "absolute emergency," under
 which it can expel without legal proceedings foreigners
 suspected of posing a threat to the security of the State.
 In general, the Government still sets great store by France's
 tradition as a refuge for victims of political and religious
 persecution.
 There is no provision for exiling persons. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Suspects have the right to legal
 counsel as soon as their cases are transferred from the police
 to the magistrate. For misdemeanors, pretrial confinement is
 limited normally to 4 months, with extensions in special
 circumstances of approximately 8 to 12 months. However, in
 drug cases (all of which are handled by the courts as
 misdemeanors), pretrial confinement may be unlimited. For
 felonies, pretrial confinement is not limited. French law
 provides for the right of appeal, except in jury trials of
 felony cases. An appeal to the Cour de Cassation is possible
 in felony cases, but this court rules only on procedure. No
 appeal that involves review of the facts of the case is
 possible.
 Trials in France are normally open and public, but provisions
 exist for the defense to request a closed proceeding. The
 press has free access to records of court proceedings,
 although under French law the prosecutor may not disclose
 information about cases being tried or investigated. There is
 no evidence that the authorities detain any person for
 political reasons.
 
 
 1053
 FRANCE
 Pending completion of legislative reforms, legal proceedings
 have been suspended against persons whose requests for
 conscientious objector status were rejected. There are still
 some persons, however, serving prison terms imposed prior to
 1983 by the now defunct Permanent Tribunals of the Armed
 Forces because they did not present such requests and refused
 military service.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from invasion of privacy is guaranteed by French law,
 and this freedom is respected in practice. The search of a
 private residence requires a search warrant and must take
 place between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. except in special
 circumstances, such as drug cases, when the search may be
 undertaken at any time. Telephone conversations may be
 monitored in conjunction with criminal proceedings with a
 court order and in national security cases with administrative
 approval from the agency conducting the investigation.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Newspapers and magazines are free from government
 control and present views ranging across the political
 spectrum. There are two state-owned and three Jxrivate
 television networks, in addition to private cabFle channels.
 Private radio stations have operated in France since 1983.
 Hundreds are now on the air and offer a wide array of
 independent, uncensored programming.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is widely
 respected in France, although--except for a specific reference
 to trade unions--it is not mentioned in the Constitution.
 Groups wishing to organize public meetings, protest marches,
 or demonstrations must obtain a permit from the local
 authorities. Permits are routinely granted for both political
 and apolitical gatherings. Private associations, whether
 political or apolitical, must register with the prefecture in
 the department in which they are established, but they do not
 require the prefecture's authorization to exist. Such
 registration is considered routine in France. Informal
 associations, such as those without officers, bylaws, or dues,
 need not register.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest religious group in
 France. Separation of church and state is guaranteed by law.
 All religious groups function freely without persecution.
 Despite strong initial public opposition to proposed
 legislation regarding private (largely Catholic) schools, the
 Government in 1984-85 succeeded in passing compromise
 educational reform measures which allow public authorities
 some influence in private school personnel practices. Private
 and parochial schools receive substantial subsidies from the
 Ministry of National Education.

 FRANCE
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 French law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. Arriving refugees,
 intending emigrants, and intending repatriates can undertake
 foreign travel and, in most instances, return to France.
 France has an extensive record of refugee aid and resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 before the law, without regard to origin, race, or religion.
 All French citizens of both sexes who have reached majority
 may vote, except for most convicted criminals, bankrupt
 persons, and persons certified to be mentally incompetent.
 These provisions are fully respected in practice.
 A wide variety of political parties compete freely in
 elections. In addition to national, presidential, and
 legislative elections, there are regularly scheduled local
 elections. For several years, the Government has been
 transferring selected powers from the executive branch to
 locally elected assemblies. Many special interest
 groups--business, labor, veterans, consumer advocates,
 ecologists, and others--organize freely and regularly support
 candidates for elective office.
 With regard to the French overseas territory of New Caledonia,
 representatives of the ethnic Melanesians and European
 settlers met in Paris with French officials and reached an
 accord which,.among other things, called for a referendum in
 New Caledonia in 1998 on whether the territory should remain a
 part of France or become independent. The French Government
 submitted the accord to French voters in a referendum in
 November. Those who went to the polls overwhelmingly approved
 the accord, and a French statute embodying the result became
 law. However, low voter turnout and rejection of the accord
 by European voters in New Caledonia left doubts about the
 law's eventual implementation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 France has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 area. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty
 International and the International Federation for Human
 Rights, operate freely in France.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The authorities do not condone discrimination based on race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. While
 isolated incidents of racial, religious, or political
 discrimination occur, particularly against the large immigrant
 community of Arabs and Africans, authorities consistently
 condemn such incidents. Food, shelter, health care, and
 education are available to all inhabitants.
 Women have equal status under the law but are engaged in
 continuing efforts to maintain and strengthen their rights. A
 cabinet-level Secretary of State for Women's Rights, appointed
 
 
 1055
 FRANCE
 in 1988, operates under direct supervision of the Prime
 Minister. The Government also has taken steps to close
 loopholes in French legislation on sex discrimination in the
 workplace and to eliminate sexist advertising. In 1985 it
 passed legislation to ensure more equality in marriage rights.
 Local programs to integrate women into the labor market have
 been implemented. In nonagricultural employment, women's
 average wage rates in 1986 amounted to 74.9 percent of those
 of men.
 The rights of linguistic and ethnic minorities are protected,
 whether in metropolitan France or in overseas territories
 subject to French authority. The right of immigrants legally
 admitted to France to coexist peacefully without assimilating
 completely into French culture is recognized. 'Legislation has
 been passed simplifying the expulsion of illegal immigrants
 and tightening immigration procedures. In metropolitan
 France, authorities have vigorously sought to apprehend
 extreme rightwing gangs that perpetrated several assaults
 against members of minority groups, mainly Arabs, in 1987. In
 New Caledonia, deep-rooted antagonisms between ethnic
 communities continue to exist, but the 1988 accord between
 ethnic Melanesians and European settlers on the the status of
 the territory offers renewed hope for peace.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constituticn affirms the principle of freedom of labor
 union association, the right to a job, the right of equal
 opportunity for education and training, social security, and
 workers' participation in the operation of the enterprise in
 which they are employed.
 Although only one-fifth of the work force is unionized, trade
 unions exercise significant economic and political influence.
 They participate actively in numerous tripartite (government,
 employer, and worker) bodies dealing with social matters,
 including labor courts and the Economic and Social Council, a
 constitutionally mandated consultative body. All unions are
 technically independent of the political parties, but many
 leaders of France's largest union, the General Confederation
 of Labor, belong to the Communist Party. (The General
 Secretary traditionally is a member of the Communist Party
 Political Bureau.) Leaders of most other unions are
 members of one or another faction of the Socialist Party,
 although members of other parties are also active in the labor
 movement. All unions and employer associations are active in
 the International Labor Organization and other international
 organizations, including all three world trade union
 confederations.
 French workers are free to strike, with a few minor exceptions
 in cases where strikes are determined to be a threat to public
 safety.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the right to organize and bargain collectively.
 The principle of free collective bargaining was reestablished
 after World War II by a law of 1950, with separate statutes
 applying to public enterprises. The legislation, as amended
 in 1971 and 1978, encourages collective bargaining at the
 national, regional, local, or plant level. It sets procedures
 
 
 1056
 FRANCE
 for dealing with labor disputes and defines two forms of
 collective contracts--extendable and ordinary. Amendments
 added in 1982 require at least annual bargaining on wages,
 hours, and working conditions at both plant and industry
 levels. France has no export processing zones, and labor law
 and practice are uniform throughout the country.
 The Government encourages management and labor organizations
 to negotiate on issues important to public policy--such as
 adjustment plans for dislocated workers, training, retraining,
 unemployment compensation, and supplementary retirement
 schemes. The "social partners" sometimes invite the
 Government to participate in these negotiations, particularly
 if legislation will be needed for implementation or if public
 financing is involved.
 The 1950 law sets forth procedures for resolving labor-
 management disputes. These are frequently arbitrated by labor
 inspectors. Conciliation boards, composed mainly of
 management and labor representatives, have proved ineffective.
 The higher court of arbitration is rarely used. Mediation of
 wage issues at the national, regional, and local levels has
 been more successful. Outside mediators, drawn from the upper
 ranks of the civil service, impose solutions that are binding,
 unless formally rejected by either side within 8 days. In
 1987 some 969,063 man-days of work were lost in France because
 of strikes, 7 percent less than in 1986.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in France.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 With a few minor exceptions for those enrolled in recognized
 apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Certain categories of work considered to be
 arduous and night work (10 p.m. to 5 a.m.) may not be
 performed by persons under the age of 18 or by women in
 manufacturing, mining, the public sector, unions, and
 nonprofit organizations--with the exception of women with
 managerial responsibilities. This prohibition does not apply
 to women in commercial establishments, entertainment, or the
 health sector, since no heavy manual labor is involved.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 France has a minimum wage of about $4.45 an hour which is
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living. The
 standard workweek is 39 hours, and overtime is controlled. In
 general terms, French labor legislation and practice,
 including that pertaining to occupational safety and health,
 are fully comparable to those in other industrialized market
 economy countries. The minimum wage is somewhat less in the
 overseas departments, and not all social legislation applies
 in overseas territories.
