 KIRIBATI
 The nation of Kiribati comprises some 72,500 people occupying
 33 small islands widely scattered across 3.5 million square
 kilometers of the central Pacific. The nation's population is
 primarily Micronesian, with a significant remainder of
 Polynesian'origin. Kiribati gained full independence from the
 United Kingdom in 1979 and became a republic within the
 Commonwealth of Nations. It has a nationally elected president
 and legislative assembly, with 39 members elected by universal
 suffrage and 2 ex-officio members. Local affairs are handled
 in a manner similar to that followed in New England town
 meetings.
 The only security apparatus is a small police force,
 responsible to and effectively controlled by civilian authority.
 The economy is very small; most people are engaged in
 subsistence agriculture and fishing. The islands' isolation
 andmeager resources, including poor soil and limited arable
 land, severely limit prospects for economic development.
 Kiribati society is egalitarian, democratic, and respectful of
 human rights. There were no reports of specific human rights
 abuses in 1991, but in the traditional culture women have
 occupied a subordinate role, with limits on job opportunities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances, and no evidence of people being
 abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely detained.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and inhuman or degrading punishment or other such
 treatment are forbidden by the Constitution, and there were no
 reported instances of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Constitutional safeguards against arbitrary arrest and
 detention are observed in practice. There is no exile,
 internal or external.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is assured by law and observed
 in practice. The Constitution provides that an accused person
 be informed of the nature of the offense for which charged and
 be provided adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense.
 The right to confront witnesses, present evidence, and appeal
 convictions is enshrined in law. Procedural safeguards are
 based on English common law and are generally similar to those
 in Western democracies. The judiciary is independent and free
 of governmental interference. Kiribati has no political
 prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The privacy of the home is protected in law and respected by
 the Government. There is no arbitrary intrusion by the State
 or political organizations into the private life of the
 individual. Membership in political organizations is entirely
 voluntary.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for in the Constitution
 and observed in practice. Kiribati's radio station and only
 newspaper are government owned, but offer a variety of views.
 Churches publish newsletters and other periodicals. Academic
 freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, including the right to form or belong to
 associations for the advancement or protection of the group's
 interests. There are no significant restrictions in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Complete freedom of religion prevails in Kiribati. There is no
 state or preferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek
 converts and actively do so.
 d. Freedom of-Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad.
 There are no restrictions on repatriation. Kiribati has no
 refugees or displaced persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is chosen by the people in free and open
 elections. Executive authority is exercised by the President,
 who is elected by the people. No less than three and no more
 than four presidential candidates are nominated by the elected
 House of Assembly from among its members. Under the
 Constitution, the President is limited to three terms. Thus,
 President Tabai, who had been in power since independence in
 1979, was required to step down in 1991. He was succeeded by
 his former vice president, Teatao Teannaki.
 There is no tradition of formally organized parties in
 Kiribati. However, elections do bring about coalitions of
 various interest groups, around specific issues. For example,
 the 1991 election campaign saw the emergence of several such
 interest groups, referred to by the following names: the
 Christian Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the National
 Progressive Party, and the New Movement Party. These groups do
 not seem to have any durable distinguishing characteristics and
 they have, as yet, no party headquarters, formal platforms, or
 party structures.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Government and no known requests for
 investigations. There are no restrictions on the formation of
 local nongovernmental organizations that concern themselves
 with human rights but to date none has been formed. The
 Government has not taken an active interest in international
 human rights matters. Kiribati is not a member of the United
 Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race,
 creed, national. origin, or sex. There were no reports of
 discrimination in the provision of social services by the
 Government. Kiribati has no significant discrimination based
 on race, religion, language, or social status. Kiribati
 society, being fundamentally egalitarian, does not have the
 privileged chiefly class of some other Pacific island societies.
 The traditional culture, in which males are dominant, has been
 an impediment to women taking a more active role in the
 economy. This is slowly changing, and more women are finding
 work in unskilled and semiskilled occupations. Women have full
 -and equal access to education. Statistics on the participation
 of women in the work force and comparative wages are
 unavailable. Women have full rights of ownership and
 inheritance of property. Violence against women does not
 appear to be a major problem in this isolated, rural society.
 Rape is a crime under the law and the law is enforced when
 charges are brought to court. To-the extent that it exists,
 wife beating is dealt with informally and in a traditional way;
 frequently communal pressure is brought to bear.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Freedom of association is provided for in the Constitution.
 Workers are free to organize unions and choose their own
 representatives. Over 90 percent of the work force is occupied
 in fishing or subsistence farming, but in the small wage sector
 Kiribati has a relatively strong and effective trade union
 movement. The Government does not control or restrict unions.
 In 1982 the seven trade unions registered in Kiribati merged to
 form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress (KTUC). It has
 approximately 2,500 members, most of them drawn from the public
 service.. The KTUC is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 The right to strike is provided for by law. However, strikes
 are rare; the last one having taken place in 1980. This is
 probably due to the small size of the cash economy.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is provided for in legislation under the
 Industrial Relations Code. Government wage setting is the rule
 in the large public sector; however, in a few statutory bodies
 and government-owned companies, employees may negotiate about
 wages and other conditions. In the private sector, employees
 
 
 886
 KIRIBATI
 may negotiate about wages with employers. Negotiations are
 generally nonconfrontational in keeping with Kiribati
 tradition. There have been no reports of antiunion
 discrimination. Mechanisms exist, however, for resolving any
 complaints of antiunion discrimination. Kiribati has no export
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Kiribati. Both are
 prohibited under the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Kiribati law prohibits the employment of children under age
 14. Children aged 15 are prohibited from industrial employment
 and employment aboard ships. Children are rarely employed
 outside the traditional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Although legislation authorizing the Government to set minimum
 wages exists, it has not yet been implemented. There is no
 legislatively prescribed workweek. Government is the major
 employer in the cash economy.
 Employment laws provide rudimentary health and safety standards
 for the workplace. Employers, for example, must provide an
 adequate supply of clean water for workers and must ensure the
 existence of sanitary toilet facilities. Employers are liable
 for the expenses of workers injured on the job. The
 Government's ability to enforce employment laws is constrained
 by a lack of qualified enforcement personnel, a lack it is
 attempting to remedy by improvements in training of the
 relevant personnel. Women may not work at night except under
 specified circumstances (generally in service jobs such as
 hotel clerks).
