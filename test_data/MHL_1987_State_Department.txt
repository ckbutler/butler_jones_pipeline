 THE MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands is a nation of 31
 low-lying-coral atolls scattered over 750,000 square miles of
 the Central Pacific, comprising a-total land area of about 70
 square miles. The population, of Micronesian origin, is
 estimated at 37,000 people, two-thirds of whom are concentrated
 on Majuro and Kwajalein atolls. The Marshall Islands
 constituted a-district in a United Nations Trust Territory
 administered by the United States from 1947 to 1986. On
 October 21, 1986, the Republic of the Marshall Islands became
 a sovereign, self-governing nation under a Compact of Free
 Association with the United States.
 Political legitimacy in the Marshall Islands rests on the
 popular wi:ll expressed by majority vote in accordance with a
 constitution that is a unique blend of American and British
 precepts. 'Theexecutive branch of the government consists of
 a president and his- appointed -cabinet, all of whom are elected
 members of the legislature. The legislature consists of a
 parliament, known as the Nitijela, and a Council of Chiefs
 (Iroij), the latter serving largely a consultative function.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the
 United States, coconut oil and copra exports, limited tourism,
 and the fishing industry. No human rights abuses were
 reported-in 1987.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 gender, race, color, language, religion, political or other
 opinion, national or social origin, place of birth, family
 status, or descent. While this equal protection and freedom
 from discrimination clause is generally observed in practice,
 the traditional male dominance has hampered women from taking
 a more active role in the political and economic life of the
 country. This is changing slowly and an increasing number of
 women are finding jobs in the skilled, semiskilled, and social
 occupations.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 While there is a minimum wage law, there is as yet no
 legislation on health, occupational safety, or child labor. A
 draft labor law has been prepared for submission to the
 legislature.
