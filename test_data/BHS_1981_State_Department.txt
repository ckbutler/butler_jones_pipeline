 THE BAHAMAS
 
 The Bahamas is a democracy. Its political and legal
 traditions are similar to those of Great Britain and
 the United States. The governmental structure is
 patterned after that of Great Britain, with a prime
 minister, a cabinet, a parliament, an independent
 judiciary and national and local elections.
 The Bahamas has a dominant political party, the Progres-
 sive Liberal Party (PLP), which won independence for
 the country in 1973 without violence. Before indepen-
 dence the same party led the country for seven years
 of internal self-government. It has grown stronger
 over the years and now holds 31 of the 38 seats in
 parliament. Two small opposition parties to the right
 of the PLP, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and
 the Free National Movement (FNM), hold the other seven
 seats. Two minor parties, the Workers Party and Vanguard,
 are on the left, but have no seats. The PLP has used
 its authority and power of office to strengthen its
 political position and, conversely, to weaken the
 opposition through selective political appointments.
 The Bahamas continues to be tested by the arrival
 of illegal aliens, principally Haitians, but has for
 the most part maintained a reasonable, humane approach
 in dealing with the problem. However, the Bahamas'
 insistence upon its sovereign right to repatriate
 illegal aliens to their country of origin resulted
 in two 1980 incidents in which the Bahamas used
 non-lethal force in the arrest of approximately 400
 illegal Haitians. Over half of those arrested were
 later released by the court. The result of this incident
 was the de facto suspension of the 1978 Bahamas/Haiti
 repatriation agreement. The government of Haiti protested
 the Bahamian action and claimed that the agreement
 provided only for voluntary repatriation of individuals.
 This impasse has not been resolved to date.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the constitution, and there
 are no reports that it is practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
 is also prohibited by the constitution. There continue
 to be occasional reports that the police use excessive
 force when making arrests. The judiciary has reprimanded
 police officers when allegations appear to have been
 well-founded. Capital punishment is permitted by
 law, and three persons were executed for homicide
 in 1980 and one in 1981. Corporal punishment is not
 administered. Detention and prison facilities are
 austere. The downtown Nassau holding cells where
 persons can be confined 48 hours or more while awaiting
 preliminary hearing, are small, crowded and unsanitary.

 Separate prisons for men and women are also located
 in Nassau. The men's prison is currently overcrowded.
 It is now being upgraded and enlarged. The similar
 women's institution appears to be less austere and
 more modern. There are no reports of mistreatment
 at either prison facility.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reported cases of abduction, secret
 arrests or clandestine detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited under
 the constitution. There are no reports of political
 prisoners.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials, defendants' right to counsel,
 free access, and an independent judiciary are guaranteed
 under the constitution. There are no military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is safeguarded by custom, law
 and tradition. The constitution permits searches
 to occur only with a warrant issued by a court. There
 are no reports that this protection is violated in
 practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 There is full freedom in all of these areas. Labor
 unions are active and are free to organize, assemble,
 bargain and strike.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 While there is full freedom of movement, travel, emigra-
 tion and repatriation, a particular problem of continuing
 and serious concern for the government is that of
 Haitian immigrants. There are an estimated 12,000
 to 20,000 illegal Haitians now residing in the Bahamas.
 In 1978 the Bahamian and Haitian governments signed
 a repatriation agreement to assist the Bahamas to
 cope with this problem. However, after two incidents
 in 1980 in which the Bahamas forcibly arrested more
 than 400 illegal Haitians, the agreement was indefinitely
 suspended due to Haitian government protests and its
 claim that under the agreement repatriations should
 be voluntary.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political process is open to all sectors of the
 society, notwithstanding the transfer of political
 power from the white elite to a black majority. Bahamian
 whites continue to play'an active role in the political
 process, both elective and appointive. White Bahamians
 hold high-level civil service and political posts,
 including four seats in parliament. Legally and in
 practice, women enjoy equal status. Several political
 
 
 339
 offices, including that of president of. the senate,
 are held by women. Women are represented in the profes-
 sional and private sectors. The president of the
 chamber of commerce, for instance, is a woman.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Participation by the Bahamas in international organiza-
 tions and activities is limited by its representational
 resources. There have been no requests to investigate
 human rights conditions in the Bahamas.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Although the Bahamas is made up of some 700 islands,
 only ten have populations of any size, and of these,
 two, New Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama Island,
 contain over 70 percent of the population. Most economic
 and cultural activities take place on these two islands.
 Partly due to this, the other islands, particularly
 those in the southern region, have suffered depopulation
 over the years as individuals have moved to the two
 major centers of activity. The government is seeking
 through various programs to revitalize the family
 islands (those other than New Providence and Grand
 Bahama) and discourage this urban drift. Programs
 emanating from the ministry of agriculture seek to
 encourage agriculture and fishing opportunities.
 The ministry of tourism is attempting to locate new
 tourist facilities in the family islands rather than
 on New Providence and Grand Bahama; and the ministries
 of health and education are both seeking to strengthen
 their programs in these areas. The government is
 also working out a system of local government, rather
 than the present commissioner system, which is directed
 from Nassau. Taken together, these programs are designed
 to generate growth and prosperity over the next decade
 in the previously isolated and neglected family islands.
 According to World Bank statistics, the Bahamas has
 seen marked improvement in health conditions during
 the decade of the 1970s. Life expectancy at birth
 rose from 65.7 at the beginning of the decade to 69.0
 by 1979. During the same period, the infant mortality
 rate dropped from 36.4 per 1,000 live births to 24.7.
 Between 1970 and 1979, the population growth rate
 dropped from 4.5 percent to 3.1 percent. Statistics
 indicate that 65 percent of the population has access
 to safe water, 100 percent in urban areas and approxi-
 mately 15 percent in rural areas. The World Bank
 statistics show that the percent of calorie supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements was 101 percent in 1970. This was reduced
 to 96 percent by 1979. In recognition of this deteriora-
 tion, the ministry of education has just launched
 a multi-million dollar school lunch program. This
 program will ensure that children receive at least
 one hot meal each day.
 In addition to 860 hospital beds, and ministry of
 health doctors who make regular trips to the family
 islands, middle class Bahamians have easy access to
 medical treatment in the United States. Restructuring
 of education is continuing. The government is placing
 new emphasis on technical and vocational training,
 
 
 340
 since many skilled jobs in the economy are performed
 by foreigners due to the lack of sufficient numbers
 of trained Bahamians. While literacy rates have remained
 constant at 93 percent over the past decade, shortages
 of teachers, equipment and supplies, as well as the
 deterioration of many schools, have resulted in a
 weakening of quality education in the public school
 system. The government has reemphasized education,
 and a new minister is introducing a wide range of
 programs intended to upgrade services. The adjusted
 primary school enrollment ratio stood at 99.0 in 1979.
 Per capita GNP was estimated by the World Bank at
 $2,030 in 1970 and $2,750 in 1979. Since no national
 accounts are kept, these figures are only rough estimates.
 Inflation over the same period was as much as 100
 percent in some areas. Coupled with inflationary
 pressures has been the large increase in the labor
 force. Estimates now put unemployment at approximately
 30 percent for Bahamians between 16 and 24 years of
 age. The social results of this unemployment are
 serious. Some of the unemployed have apparently turned
 to crime and drug smuggling. Others are supported
 by their families. Despite these problems in the
 economy, however, 60 percent of Bahamians would be
 considered middle class.
 The government is trying by a number of programs to
 reduce unemployment. The most important effort is
 its attempt to create a significant number of new
 jobs in tourism, through both private and public invest-
 ment, and to develop opportunities in agriculture,
 fishing and the construction industry.
