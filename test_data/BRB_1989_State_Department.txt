 BARBADOS
 Barbados is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and a
 constitutional democracy with a multiparty, parliamentary form
 of government on the Westminster model. Its House of Assembly
 is the third oldest elected body in the Western Hemisphere.
 Barbadians recognize the Queen of England as Head of State;
 she is represented by an appointed Governor General. The
 Prime Minister is the head of government and governs with an
 appointed Cabinet.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining
 public order; it respects constitutional and legal guarantees
 of human rights. Police morale is good, and public respect
 for the police force is high. The small volunteer Barbado3
 Defence Force is responsible for national security, but is
 used for public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other
 specific need.
 The country's economy, based on tourism, light manufacturing,
 services, and sugar, is highly susceptible to external
 economic developments. Nevertheless, the economy has
 registered positive growth for the past several years, led by
 the tourism and construction sectors.
 Barbados has a long record of respecting human rights. There
 was no change in that record during 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There- were no reports of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reports in 1989 of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. These provisions are respected in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and
 attorneys have ready access to their clients. Exile is not
 used as a punishment or means of political control.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal
 offenses be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Government
 provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts
 
 
 467
 independently and is free of intervention from other branches
 of government. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere arbitrarily in the private
 lives of its citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires warrants to be
 issued before privately owned property may be entered and
 searched. The Government neither censors mail nor restricts
 the receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and
 these rights are respected in practice. There are five radio
 stations, two of which are government owned. CBC television
 service (the sole television station) is government owned.
 Though CBC is not independent of government control, views
 opposing government policies are regularly reported, though
 opposition political figures occasionally claim their
 positions are slighted or ignored. There are two independent
 daily newspapers in which opposing political views are
 presented. The Government regularly comes under attack in the
 newspapers and on two popular daily call-in radio programs.
 Barbados hosts the Cave Hill campus of the University of the
 West Indies, and academicians across the political spectrum
 express their views freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government observes the constitutional guarantees of
 peaceful assembly and private association. Permits are
 required for public demonstrations, and they are routinely
 granted. Political parties, trade associations, and private
 organizations function and hold meetings and rallies without
 government hindrance.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and
 Methodist faiths have traditionally predominated, there are
 numerous other active religious denominations and
 organizations throughout the country. Foreign missionaries of
 various faiths proselytize freely. The Caribbean Conference
 of Churches is headquartered in'Barbados and publishes its
 materials there.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados, and
 leave and enter the country without restriction, rights
 provided for in the Constitution. Barbados has a small number
 of applicants for admission as refugees; their applications
 are processed on a case-by-case basis.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have this right in law affd exercise it in practice.
 Political parties freely compete in fair elections by secret
 ballot at least every 5 years. There are no impediments to
 participation in the political process, and all Barbadians
 over age 18 may vote. The present Democratic Labour Party
 (DLP) Government won the May 1986 election, taking 24 of the
 27 seats and replacing the incumbent Barbados Labor Party
 (BLP) government. A small Marxist party, the Workers Party of
 Barbados, was formed in 1985, but has attracted little
 support. It participated marginally in the 1986 election and
 holds no parliamentary seats. In 1989 four DLP Members of
 Parliament resigned from the party and formed the National
 Democratic Party, replacing the BLP as the official opposition
 by virtue of its four seats in Parliament. A Cabinet of
 Ministers, appointed by the Prime'Minister, exercises
 executive power.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no reports of human right violations in Barbados
 during 1989, and hUman rights groups have not requested any
 such investigations. The Government publicly advocates
 strengthening the human rights machinery of the United Nations
 and the Organization of American States, as well as more
 investigations into alleged violations of human rights in
 other countries and the increased use of fact-finding or
 observer teams to monitor controversial political and
 electoral situations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law,
 regardless of race, religion, or sex. These provisions are
 respected in practice. Women form a large percentage of heads
 of household in Barbados and are not discriminated against in
 public housing and other social welfare programs. Compulsory
 education through the secondary level is enforced uniformly.
 Barbados is a signatory of the 1979 Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
 Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and
 are well represented at all levels in both the public and
 private sectors. Women's rights groups exist; they are
 devoted primarily to promoting women's participation in the
 professions and, to a lesser extent, to safeguarding legal
 rights of illegitimate children.
 The Government has not singled out violence against women as a
 particular or acute social problem, and this assessment that
 violence against women is not characteristic of Barbadian
 society is supported by female private sector lawyers who are
 active in women's issues, with the Attorney General's office,
 and with the president of the National Association of Women.
 Criminal penalties for violent crimes are the same regardless
 of sex of offender or victim. Penalties for simple assault
 are minimal for first offenders, usually a small fine. For
 repeat offenders or those with a history of violent acts, jail
 sentences are usually imposed. In cases of domestic violence,
 courts also typically issue restraining orders if requested by
 the victim, the breach of which is punished by a jail

 BARBADOS
 sentence. The penalty for rape is imprisonment for up to 14
 years. In 1989 there were a number of cases in the local
 courts of domestic violence involving assault or wounding,
 although women's rights groups point out that there is still
 some reluctance on the part of victims to report such
 incidents. New legislation is under consideration by the
 Government which would change trial procedures in rape cases
 to provide additional protection for the privacy of the victim.
 Section 6 Worker Rights"
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to form and belong to trade unions and
 to strike, and freely exercise these rights. There are two
 major unions and several smaller ones, representing various
 sectors of labor. The largest union, the Barbados Worker's
 Union (BWU), is historically closely associated with the
 governing DLP (BWU officers hold three elected parliamentary
 seats and the appointed post of President of the Senate), but
 the union is not controlled by the party or Government. Trade
 unionists' personal and property rights are given full
 protection under law. There were no major strikes or other
 industrial actions in 1989, but unions have resorted to
 strikes in recent years. Strikes are illegal in public
 services. Barbadian trade unions are free to affiliate to
 trade union internationals and are active in a variety of
 regional and international labor organizations. Barbados is a
 member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and has
 ratified ILO conventions 87 and 98 dealing with freedom of
 association and collective bargaining.
 b. The Right To Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The rights to organize and to bargain collectively are
 provided by law and respected in practice. Over 20 percent of
 the working population is organized, and wages and working
 conditions are negotiated through the collective bargaining
 process. Employers have no legal obligation to recognize
 unions but most do when a majority of their employees are
 organized. Workers who may be subject to antiunion
 discrimination have recourse to the Department of Labor, whose
 chief labor officer conducts inquiries. There are no
 manufacturing or special areas where collective bargaining
 rights are legally or administratively impaired. Barbados has
 a number of export processing zones; none of these are closed
 to union organizers, and there do not appear to be any
 informal strictures on unionization.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum working age of 16 in Barbados is generally
 observed. Minimum age limitations are reinforced by
 compulsory primary and secondary education policies.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The standard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and workers are
 guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave. Minimum
 wages for specified categories of workers are administratively
 
 
 470
 BARBADOS
 established and enforced by law. The minimum wage for shop
 -assistants (entry level.commercial workers), $75 per week, is
 marginally sufficient to meet minimum living standards; most
 employees-earn more. All workers'are covered by unemployment
 benefits legislation, and by national insurance (social
 security) legislation. A comprehensive government-sponsored
 health program offers subsidized treatment and medication.
 Legally mandated health and safety standards are enforced by
 the Department of Labor, and are in keeping with normal
 standards.
