 MALAWI
 The Republic of Malawi held its first democratic, multiparty elections since inde-
 pendence in May 1994. President Bakii Muluzi principally relies on the ruling Unit-
 ed Democratic Front (UDF), which holds 82 of the 177 seats in the National Assem-
 bly. The opposition Malawi Conress Party (MCP), formerly the sole legal party,
 holds 52 seats. The Aliane for Democracy (AFORD) spit over the UDF-AFORD
 coalition and the continued presence of AFORD Members of Parliament (MP) in the
 Cabinet, reducing AFORD's number of MP's to 27. Six former AFORD MPs and one
 former MCP MP sit as independents. Both the MCP and AFORD opposition alleged
 government corruption; AFORD also protested Muluzi's appointment of AFORD
 members as ministers without consulting with the party leadership. In July the
 MCP and AFORD withdrew from the National Assembly, arguably depriving that
 body of its quorum. The parties referred the political impasse to the judiciary for
 resolution. The judiciary has demonstrated independence in several high profile po-
 litical cases, although there are frequent, but unproven, allegations that its deci-
 sions result from political bias or bribery.
 The National Police, headed by the Inspector General of Police under the Ministry
 of Home Affairs, is responsible for internal security. Although the army is apolitical,
 the police occasionally called on the army for support. While violence and common
 crime have become frequent, there was no indication of organized activity in Malawi
 or abroad by remnants of the Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP), formerly the MCPIs
 paramilitary wing. Despite notable improvements, there continued to be credible al-
 legations of human rights abuses by the police.
 Small, densely populated, and landlocked, Malawi's economy is predominately ag-
 ricultural. Over 85 percent of the population derives its income from agriculture. To-
 bacco remains the primary foreign exchange earner, other cash crops include tea,
 coffee, and sugar. Foreign aid remains a critical source of income. The Government
 continued to extend market pricing in the agrcultural sector and began privatizing
 the ownership of public enterprises. The high inflation that has plagued Malawi for
 several years abated toward the end of 1996, following the country's first good rainy
 season in several years. The economy was expected to grow by 11 percent in real
 terms. Per capita income is below $200. Wealth remains concentrated in the hands
 of a small elite, many of whom remain aloof from national politics.

 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but serious
 problems remained. The police continued to abuse detainees and to use excessive
 force in handling criminal suspects. There were instances of deaths of detainees
 while in, or shortly after release from, police custody. In implementing reforms the
 Inspector General of Police stressed public accountability and transparency. Prison
 conditions remained poor. Lengthy pretrial detention, the inefficient and under-
 staffed judicial system, and limited resources called into question the ability of de-
 fendants to receive a timely and, in some cases, a fair trial. High levels of crime
 prompted angry mobs to summarily execute alleged criminals.
 The Government remained in control of the broadcast content of the nation's radio
 stations. It delayed consideration of proposed legislation on the reform of the Ma-
 lawi Broadcasting Corporation and did not issue any new broadcasting licenses. By
 contrast the print media continued to report freely. The Human Rights Commission
 mandated by the Constitution to explore human rights violations was established
 but made very little progress. Women continued to experience severe societal dis-
 crimination, and violence against women and children remained a prblem. The
 Government has taken steps to assist disadvantaged women in its economic develop-
 ment programs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-There were incidents of deaths of
 detainees while in, or shortly after release from, police custody. Most serious were
 the March 5 deaths from suffocation in severely overcrowded cells of 17 prisoners.
 The Government and police responded to this incident of police negligence by
 promptly laying out the facts of the incident. Although the police normally do not
 issue statements on deaths in custody, the Inspector General released on March 7
 a statement to the press describing this incident and announcing an inquiry. A pres-
 idential inquiry as well as a joint Inspectorate of Prisons/Human Rights Commission
 inquiry were subsequently announced on March 7 and 8. (Of the three, only the
 Inspectorate/Human Rights Commission inquiry eventually delivered its report. The
 report acknowledged the full cooperation and helpful assistance of the Inspector
 General, who made witnesses and records available.) The station officer and officer
 in charge were indicted, and the prison officials on duty were suspended on March
 8. During the course of the inquiry, the Inspector General of Police ;nformed the
 Inspectrate/Human Rights Commission that an internal inspectorate had been es-
 tablished to address these and other issues. During a September followup visit, the
 Insorate of Prisons noted that many of the recommended improvements to the
 facllity had been carried out and that prison recordkeeping was much improved.
 The inquest into the April 1995 shooting of former Army Commander Manken
 Chigawa revealed not only sketchy police investigation into his death, but serious
 inconsistencies between police and witness accounts of the deaths while in police
 custody of his two alleged killers. These accounts and the apparent attempts by
 some police subordinates to hide deaths or incidents of mistreatment prompted the
 Inspector General to establish the internal inspectorate to address issues of police
 misconduct.
 Frustrated by inadequate law enforcement and rising crime, angry mobs some-
 times resorted to vigilante justice in beating, stoning, or burning suspected crimi-
 nals to death. The Government made no discernible effort to punish individuals who
 carried out these abuses.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Crue, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits trure and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment. Although that provision is  nerally respected, the Inspectrate of Prisons, an
 investigative body mandated by  e Constitution, confirmed that the police contin-
 ued to physically abuse detainees. However, the incidence of abuse has dropped.
 While higher ranking officials demonstrated familiarity with new standards for the
 humane treatment of prisoners, their subordinates commonly employed unaccept-
 able techniques. According to an October Inspectrate of Prisons report, unaccept-
 able techniques included beatings, whippings, dog attacks, knifings, and the inten-
 tional deprivation of food, water, toilet facilities, and medical care to force confes-
 sions. These abuses are sometimes hidden by keeping a prisoner in police custody
 until wounds heal before turning the prisoner over to the prison system for remand.
 The mistreatment is partly due to the mistaken belief of many police officers that
 the law requires them to present a case (not just charges) to the court within 48
 hours of arrest. The Government also sought community involvement in its com-
 prehensive reform of the police.
 
 
 Prison conditions remained poor. Overcrowding, inadequate nutrition, and sub-
 standard sanitation and health facilities remained serious problems. While not kept
 in separate facilities, women are segregated within the prison compound and tended
 by female guards. The Inspectorate of Prisons and local organizations monitor police
 behavior and prison conditions without government interference.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law permits the accused to challenge
 the legality of detention, to have access to legal counsel, and to be released or in-
 formed of charges by a court of law within 48 hours. In an effort to comply with
 the 48-hour rule, police occasionally resorted to beatings in order to extract informa-
 tion necessary to their case. In cases where the court determines that a defendant
 cannot afford to supply his own counsel, legal services are supposed to be provided
 by the Government. With few persons able to afford legal counsel, the countiy's four
 public defenders were not sufficient to meet the needs of indigent detainees. Bail
 is frequently granted to reduce prison overcrowding. Its use often bears only a tenu-
 ous relation to the merits of an individual's situation. September statistics indicate
 that approximately 35 percent of the 4,887 prison inmates are detainees awaiting
 trial.
 On August 29, William Phakamisa and two others were arrested for allegedly con-
 spiring to kill key government and UDF officials. Police officials subsequently told
 his family that Phakamisa had been released from custody when in fact he was
 being held incommunicado at police facilities. Phakamisa claimed that the detention
 was intended to extract his cooperation in implicating opposition leaders in a plot.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control. However, against the directive
 of its own High Court, the Government acquiesced in the exile to Malawi of Zam-
 bian political dissidents.
 e.Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary dem-
 onstrated a high degree-of independence from elected officials in several high profile
 political cases. Allegations that individual judges were corrupt or politically biased
 were common but unproven.
 The Constitution provides for a High Court, a Supreme Court of Appeal, and sub-
 ordinate magistrate courts. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President and con-
 irmed by the National Assembly. Other justices are appointed by the President fol-
 lowing a recommendation by the Judicial Service Commission. All justices are ap-
 pointed until the age of "65 and may be removed only for reasons of incompetence
 or misbehavior, as determined by a majority in Pariament and the President.
 By law defendants have the right to a public trial but not to a trial by jury. In
 dealing with murder cases, the High Court nevertheless used juries of seven persons
 from the defendant's home district. Defendants are also entitled to an attorney, the
 right to adduce and challenge evidence and witnesses, and the right of appeal. How-
 ever, the judiciary's budgetr and administrative problems effectively denied expe-
 ditious trials for many defendants. No murder trials by jury have been conducted
 before the High Court since December 1995. Nevertheless, prisoner deaths and the
 release of those held on the basis of weak evidence decreased the backlog of homi-
 cide cases.
 The judicial system is also handicapped by serious weaknesses, including poor
 record keeping, shortage of trained personnel, and a heavy caseload. Traditional
 court judges, absorbed into the magistrate court system, received training to ac-
 quaint them with court procedure and the body of law they are now expected to ad-
 minister.
 Many of the country's old repressive laws were superseded by the new Constitu-
 tion. The High Court overturned old laws that were in conflict with the Constitu-
 tion. In consultation with nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) and par-
 liamentarians, the Law Commissioner undertook to clarify ambiguities in the Con-
 stitution and to bring legislation on women into compliance with new constitutional
 standards.
 Juvenile offenders have special rights under the Constitution, including the right
 to be separated in custody from adults, to be treated in a manner that accounts for
 age and the possibility for rehabilitation, and to be exempted from the punishment
 of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspond ence.--Govern-
 ment authorities generally respected the constitutional right to privacy regarding
 person, family, home, and private communications. However, army and police forces,
 in carrying out sweeps for illegal weapons, did not obtain search warrants as re-
 quired byIaw. Postal authorities have apparently eased their past practice of open-
 ing and inspecting private correspondence.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The new Constitution superseded old laws re-
 stricting the press and now provides for freedoms of speech and press. The Govern-
 ment generly respected these rights in practice. The Government also generally
 tolerated the broad spectrum of political and ideological opinion presented in the
 country's two dozen newspapers. However, media representatives complained about
 government secrecy and periodic verbal threats aginst members of the press by
 government officials. In May the Government launched its own official weeky news-
 paper.
 Malawi has two radio stations. A small private station broadcasts only religious
 programming and is not permitted to broadcast news. State-owned Malawi Broad-
 casting Corporation (MB), however, is the most important medium for reaching the
 public. MBC programming was dominated by reporting_ on the activities of senior
 government figures and official government positions. Parties and groups opposed
 to the Government largely were denied access to the broadcast media. MBC report-
 ers were disciplined or fired for their reporting on opposition parties. News stories
 were pulled in midbradcast and press conferences heavily edited to avoid politically
 sensitive material. MBC refused to air aiid public announcements of Ia or union
 events. The Government effectively blocked consideration of legislation to make
 MBC a more independent public broadcasting entity and continued to deny applica-
 tions to establish new private radio stations.
 There were no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government respects these rights in
 practice. Authorities routinely granted official permits, which are required by law
 for large meetings. The Government requires organizations, including political par-
 ties, to register with the Registrar General in the Ministry of Justice. Despite fre-
 quent lengthy delays, there were no reports of groups being denied registration.
 c. Freedom of Relgion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Religious groups must register with the
 Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens have freedom of movement and residence within the country,
 and the right to leave and return. The National Assembly took the final steps to
 lift the remaining restrictions on where Asians, whether citizens or not, could reside
 and work. To date there has been little movement by Asians and other expatriates
 from cities and towns to rural areas.
 The Government cooperated with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in managing the refugee community. According to the
 UNHCR, Malawi now hosts approximately 1,500 refugees. There were 200 new
 cases im Deember alone, primarily due the crisis in the Great Lakes region of Afri-
 ca. This influx had not diminished by year's end. A pproximately 1 million refugees
 from Mozambique left Malawi in 1995. Although the Government grants refugee
 status, it does not accept refugees for resettlement and does not permit them to
 work or study. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where
 they feared persecution. Approximately 1,500 refugees, primarily from Somalia and
 the Great Lakes region, are housed at Malawi's Refugee Center. Asylum applicants
 are granted hearings to make their case for refugee status. Although there were no
 reports of bona fide refugees seeking first asylum being turned away, NGO sources
 have expressed concern that some of those found not to be bona fide refugees-pri-
 marily Zaireans-were rejected because of poor quality translation or ambiguous
 questions that trapped or misled otherwise qualified refugees. The Government is
 increasingly wary of those who travel long distances to seek asylum in Malawi. For-
 eign Minster George Ntafu, responding to reports of a Great Lakes refugee trek to
 Malawi, declared in December that the refugees would not be permitted into the
 country. In that month, nine Rwandan refugees were intercepted and returned to
 Tanzania after illegally crossing into Malawi, but hundreds more have succeeded in
 making their way into the refugee camp.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are generally able to exercise this constitutional right. Malawi has uni-
 versal suffrage for citizens 18 years of age and older. There were allegations of vote
 buying, intimidation, and the misuse of government assets during by-elections,
 which were common practices under the Banda regime. In one case where voters
 were permitted to cast ballots despite allegedly selling or losing their registration
 cards, the Electoral Commission determined that the violation did not affect the out-
 come of the election and declined to strike down the election result.
 
 
 166
 President Muluzi, Vice President Justin Malewezi, and a 25-member Cabinet ex-
 ercise executive authority. The Second Vice Presidency remains vacant following the
 resignation of Chakufwa Chihana and the collapse of the UDF-AFORD coalition.
 While the executive and the legislature were elected in free, democratic elections,
 the executive in fact exerted considerable influence over the legislature. Local elec-
 tions have been postponed due to a lack of funds, effectively preventing the citizenry
 from selecting new local leadership. However, in November the Minister of Local Af-
 fairs reaffirmed the Government s commitment to the ongoing reorganization of
 local government structures. Although the Government does not prevent the oper-
 ation of opposition political parties, the parties have alleged that the Government
 utilizes bribery and other inducements to encourage opposition party divisions and
 defections of key personnel to the UDF.
 There are no laws that restrict the participation of women or minorities in the
 political process. In practice, however, there are very few women in prominent gov-
 ernment positions. Only two ministers and two deputy ministers are women, and
 there are nine women in the National Assembly. Despite the small number of fe-
 male parliamentarians, the parliamentary women s caucus has worked effectively
 with the Law Reform Commissioner on draft legislation to bring the law into com-
 pliance with constitutional guarantees protecting women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights groups operated without
 government restriction, training civic educators, advocating changes to existing laws
 and cultural practices, and investigating and publishing their findings on human
 rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their
 views.
 The Ombudsman, mandated by the Constitution to investigate and take legal ac-
 tion against government officials responsible for human rights violations and other
 abuses, began functioning. However, the Ombudsman's freedom of action was cir-
 cumscribed by legislation that requires a warrant and a 3-day waiting period to gain
 access to certain government records. The Constitution also provides for a National
 Compensation Tribunal (NCT) to entertain claims of criminal and civil liability
 against the former government. As of September the NCT had awarded nearly
 $200,000 to 200 claimants. Other large sums were disbursed to settle non-NCT law-
 suits against the Government for similar human rights violations. However, the
 prominence of many of both the NCT and non-NCT recipients raised concerns of fa-
 voritism. With two members named, the constitutionally mandated Human Rights
 Commission, also entrusted with monitoring and protecting against violations of
 constitutional rights, had barely begun to function by year's end and awaits further
 legislation on membership and procedures.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically provides for equal rights for women; forbids discrimi-
 nation based on language, culture, or religion; and generally provides every citizen
 the right to equality and recognition before the law.In practice the capacity of gov-
 ernment institutions to assure equal rights for all citizens is limited.
 Women.-Spousal abuse, especially wife beating, is common. Malawian society has
 begun to take problems of violence against women more seriously. The press pub-
 lished more frequent accounts of rape and abuse, and the judiciary imposed heavier
 penalties on those convicted of rape. However, domestic violence is not discussed
 openly by women, reportedly even among themselves, and there are no confidential
 shelters or facilities for treatment of women who suffer physical or sexual abuse.
 Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes.
 Under the new Constitution, women have the right to full and equal protection
 by law and may not be discriminated against on the basis of their sex or marital
 status. In practice, however, discrimination against women is pervasive, and women
 do not have opportunities equal to those available to men. Women, especially in
 rural areas, historically have been unable to complete even a primary education and
 are therefore at a serious disadvantage in the job market. Women often do not have
 equal access to legal and financial assistance, and wives are often victims of dis-
 criminatry inheritance practices in which the majority of the estate is taken unlaw-
 fully by the deceased husband's family. Women are usually at a disadvantage in
 marriage, family, and property rights but have begun to speak out against abuse
 and discrimination. The Law Reform Commissioner took steps to bring legislation
 on women into compliance with new constitutional standards see Section i.e.).
 
 
 167
 The Government addresses women's concerns through the Ministry of Women and
 Children Affairs and Community Development. The National Commission on
 Women in Development (NCWID) coordinates Government and NGO activities.
 After the President remarked that he wished to appoint more women but did not
 know of suitable candidates, the NGO Women's Voice prepared a book for him con-
 taining resumes of 250 prominent women. The book subsequently served as a source
 for recent appointments to boards of parastatal (state-owned) organizations.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for equal treatment for children under the
 law, and the Government greatly increased spending on children's health and wel-
 fare. The Government has established free primary education for all children, al-
 though education is not compulsory. A few charitable organizations attempted to re-
 duce the number of child beggars in urban areas and find alternative care for them.
 The problem of street children worsened as the number of orphans whose parents
 died from HIV/AIDS increased.
 There are societal patterns of abuse of children. A few small ethnic groups prac-
 tice female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. The media
 have also begun to report on the sexualabuse of chldren, especially in relation to
 traditional practices of initiation. While still shrouded in secrecy, emerging data on
 rites to initiate girls into their future adult roles suggest that abusive practices are
 widespread and more damaging than previously believed. Also, the common belief
 that sex with children reduces the risk of AIDS contributes to the sexual abuse of
 minors.
 People With Disabilities-The Government has not mandated accessibility to
 buildings and services for the disabled, but one of the national goals listed in the
 new Constitution is to support the disabled through greater access to public places,
 fair opportunities in employment, and full participation in all spheres of society.
 Special schools and training centers, which assist individuals with disabilities, and
 several self-supporting businesses run by and for the disabled have existed for some
 time.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities-Malawians of African heritage are members
 of indigenous tribes and are not discriminated against by government or society. Al-
 though former restrictions on where Asians could live and work are now unconstitu-
 tional, only a few Asians tested the new policy (see Section 2.d.).
 The Government considered various proposals on temporary employment permits
 for expatriates but has yet to clarify its policy and procedures. The Government's
 decision not to automatically renew the permits caused concern and sometimes
 hardship to businessmen, teachers, health workers, and missionaries. Business resi-
 dence permits are readily granted to new investors.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assodation.-Although signed into law in June, the Labour Rela-
 tions Act of 1996 did not enter into force. Thus, labor issues continue to be covered
 by the old legislation. Workers have the legal right to form and join trade unions,
 but unions must register with the Ministry of Labour and Manpower Development
 (MOLMD). Unionization is on the rise, but resistance on the part of many employers
 remained. Army personnel and police may not belong to trade unions, but other civil
 servants are allowed to form unions. There were 13 registered trade unions. Given
 the low percent of the work force in the formal sector (about 12 percent), plus the
 lack of awareness of worker rights and union benefits, only a minuscule percent of
 the work force are union members. Statistics on the numbers of union members are
 not available. Unions are independent of the Government, parties, and other politi-
 cal forces. Although there are no restrictions on the number of union federations,
 Malawi has only one, the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU). All unions are
 affiliated with it. According to the MOLMD, there are no unusually difficult reg-
 istration procedures that would prevent a trade union from registering.
 Members of registered unions in "essential services" have the right to strike after
 having carried out prescribed procedures. Essential services are nowhere specified;
 they are determined by the Minister of Labour. The Trade Union Act requires that
 labor disputes in essential services be reported in writing to the Minister of Labour,
 who then attempts to negotiate a settlement. He may refer the case to a tribunal
 within 28 days of receiving the dispute report if it is not possible to reconcile the
 parties. The law implies that if a trade dispute has gone through this process, and
 if it has not been resolved or referred to a tribunal, workers in essential services
 may strike. There were a handful of strikes, with no clear agreement on which
 strikes were legal. As the Trade Union Act requires that unions must approve
 strikes by secret ballot, all the strikes may have been illegal.
 
 
 The laws do not specifically prohibit retaliation against strikers. There is no pro-
 hibition on actions against unions that are not legally registered. Arbitration rulings
 are legally enforceable.
 Unions may form or join federations and affiliate with international organizations
 with government permission.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize. The right to bargain collectively, although practiced, is only implied and not
 ex ressly protected by law.
 he Ministy of Labour sets minimum wage rates based on recommendations of
 the Tripartite Wages Advisory Board.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, but there are no effec-
 tive mechanisms for resolving complaints, and there is no legal requirement that
 employers reinstate workers dismissed because of union activities.
 In August 1995, Parliament approved legislation to establish six export processing
 zones (EP's); four were operational by year's end. The full range of labor legislation
 applies to the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The new Constitution prohibits
 forced labor, and such labor is not employed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution defines children
 as those under the age of 16 years and prohibits the employment of children in work
 that is hazardous, harmful, industrial, or interferes with their education. However,
 while primary education is now free and universal, it is not compulsory. Enforce-
 ment by police and labor inspectors in the MOLMD is not effective because of budg-
 etary constraints. There is significant child labor on tobacco and tea estates, subsist-
 ence farms, and in domestic service. There is no special legal restriction on chil-
 dren's daytime work hours.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are two legislated minimum wage rates,
 but the administratively set minimum wages are insufficient to support a worker
 and family. Wage earners tend to supplement their incomes through farming activi-
 ties carried out through the extended family network. The urban minimum wage
 is roughly $0.78 (MK11.85) per day, including $0.08 for rent; in all other areas it
 is roughly $0.56 (MK8.50) per day, including $0.07 for rent. The MOLMD is unable
 effectively to enforce the minimum wage. The prescribed minimum wages are large-
 ly irrelevant for the great majority of citizens who earn their livelihood outside the
 formal wage sector.
 The maximum legal workweek is 48 hours, with a mandatory weekly 24-hour rest
 period. The laws require payment for overtime work and prohibit excessive compul-
 sory overtime. However, labor inspections are more the exception than the rule, and
 the statutory restrictions are frequently violated.
 The Workers' Compensation Act includes extensive occupational health and safety
 standards. Enforcement of these standards by the MOLMD is erratic, and workers--
 particularly in industrial jobs--often work without basic safety clothing and equip-
 ment. MOLMD officials say that workers have the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment. However,
 given the low level of education of most workers and the high level of unemploy-
 ment, they are unlikely to exercise this right. Workers dismissed for fiing com-
 plaints about workplace conditions can theoretically file a complaint with the near-
 est labor office or sue the employer for wrongful dismissal.
