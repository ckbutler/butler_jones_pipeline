 URUGUAY
 Until the early 1970s, Uruguay enjoyed an excellent
 international reputation because of its tradition of
 democratic government and advanced social policies.
 Beginning in the the mid-1960s Uruguayan democratic
 institutions came under attack from the Tupamaros, a
 Marxist-oriented urban terrorist group. The Tupanaros'
 early reformist pretensions soon degenerated into
 terrorism marked by a campaign of assassinations,
 kidnappings, bombings, and other acts of violence
 openly commi tted to the destruction of Uruguayan
 institutions.
 Civil institutions had great difficulty in coping
 with this intense attack. The National Security Law
 passed in early 1972 and subsequent legislation
 suspended or curbed guarantees of a number of
 individual liberties, expanded police and military
 powers to contend with subversion, and shifted
 responsibility for national security cases from
 civilian to military courts. The law provided for
 a civil rights watchdog role for the Congress.
 Increasing disagreement between the legislative branch
 and the armed forces over the conduct of the anti-
 terrorist campaign (which included killings, torture
 and arbitrary arrests) led to closure of the elected
 Congress in June 1973. The trend after June 1973 was
 toward de facto military rule. The constitutionally-
 elected president remained in office and governed by
 decree in cooperation with the armed forces until he
 was ousted by the military in June 1976. Today the
 armed forces exercise political control in Uruguay.

 With democratic institutions largely in suspense since
 June 1973, the anti-terrorist campaign has been conducted
 with little regard for individual rights. The current
 government's program has included suppression of
 political activities, suspension of political parties
 "proscription" of hundreds of democratic political
 leaders, severe restriction of freedom of expression,
 loss of independence of the judiciary and intimidation
 of the legal profession, mistreatment of political
 detainees during interrogation and large numbers of
 detentions on political grounds.
 The principal reason given by the Government for
 continued authoritarian rule has been the search for
 "subversives." The 1972-73 campaign against the Tupamaros,
 which resulted in their virtual elimination by the end
 of 1974, was followed by a lull in counterterrorist
 activity. A second and more intense wave of security
 arrests began in 1975 and crested in about mid-1977.
 The latter campaign concentrated on Communists and
 other far-left activists, of whom many were apparently
 arrested for participating in- political activities
 which were constitutionally protected when carried
 out. Others arrested, including lawyers, journalists,
 labor leaders and educators, had little known connection
 with political movements. During this period, criticism
 of Uruguay's continued suppression of basic human
 rights and its use of torture in the name of combatting
 subversion became widespread. Although the Uruguayan
 Government has consistently denied that torture and
 other inhumane practices are officially condoned,
 it has failed to make its case convincingly and has
 kept some internationally respected organizations
 from investigating these charges.
 Although the authoritarian system remained in place
 during 1978, there was a decline in reports of new
 detentions and mistreatment. Civil and military
 authorities have continued to reiterate the pledge
 originally made in August 1977, that constitutional
 
 
 335
 order and civilian rule will be restored in 1981
 following a presidential election in which there is
 to be a single candidate acceptable to the military.
 Participation by some leaders of the traditional
 parties may be restricted.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture was used extensively in the campaign against
 the Tupamaro terrorists and the later roundup of Communist
 party members, leftists, and other political opponents.
 There is evidence to indicate that torture was still
 being widely used through 1977 in the interrogation
 stage. Only a few instances of torture were credibly
 reported in 1978. Reports indicate that the Uruguayans
 have taken internal measures designed to stop
 the use of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Intimidation of detainees through psychological abuse
 during interrogations is still routine. Prisoners
 detained by the military authorities have often
 been isolated, hooded, threatened, kept standing for
 extended periods and confined in areas kept constantly
 illuminated. During the past year the police were
 ordered to halt such practices and this order is
 apparently being respected. There has been no
 confirmation whether similar orders were given to the
 military.
 Prisoners are kept incommunicado during the investi-
 gation phase. Although this may last a few days or
 several months, the trend in 1978 was toward shorter
 periods of detention. No notice of their arrest,
 whereabouts or state of health is provided to family
 members. This period during which prisoners are
 kept incommunicado accounts for most reports of dis-
 appearances. Once the investigation is completed and
 
 
 the case is referred to a military judge for a pre-
 liminary hearing, treatment improves iarkedly. Recently,
 more rapid judicial processing has made possible
 swifter notification to families of detainees,
 and earlier access to legal counsel. Conditions
 of detention appear to be somewhat better for political
 detainees than the treatment accorded common criminals.
 Supervision is strict but prisoners are not mistreated
 by guards.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus and other constitutional guarantees
 against arbitrary detention were suspended by the
 National Security Law of 1972 and the Emergency
 Security Measures of 1973, which authorized the
 military to arrest and try persons suspected of
 "subversive activities" Remaining institutional
 safeguards against abuses were nullified with the
 military's seizure of power in 1973. The definition
 of subversive activity has been expanded to include
 offenses such as "undermining the morale of military
 forces" and "disrespect to military authorities".
 Uruguayan Government statistics released during 1978
 indicate that some 5700 persons had been turned over
 to the military justice system since its inception
 in April 1972. This corresponds closely to estimates
 of 5,000-6,000 political detainees frequently cited
 by Amnesty International. Of this number, the
 Government claims that over 1,200 were subsequently
 freed without trial, and almost 2,900 others freed
 by judicial order for various reasons (an unknown
 number of them conditionally), thus leaving about
 800 detainees currently under the jurisdiction
 of military courts awaiting trial and another
 800 serving sentence. An unknown number of persons
 perhaps 100 -- are also detained without formal
 charges under authority of emergency security
 measures. Thus, the estimated current Uruguayan
 political prisoner population is about 1,700 including
 at least 300 who have been sentenced for major crimes
 such as murder, armed robbery, and kidnapping. An
 additional number of individuals have been detained
 for questioning and short periods of detention during
 the year and then released.
 
 
 In December, members of the Uruguayan Security Forces
 were reliably reported to have participated in the
 abduction of two Uruguayan United Nations-sponsored
 refugees (and two children) in Brazil and their
 subsequent forcible return to Uruguay.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Uruguayan court system under both the ordinary
 penal code (OPC) and the military penal code (MPC)
 relies almost exclusively on written proceedings in
 pretrial investigation, arraignment, trial, and
 sentencing. Charges of terrorism, subversion, non-
 violent political offenses, and other "crimes against
 the nation" are subject to adjudication under the
 MPC. Confessional evidence, frequently obtained under
 severe physical and psychological pressure, has been
 the basis for almost all convictions for national
 security offenses. It is not unusual for a judge, (civil
 or military) %Yho decides on the basis of written briefs,
 to confront the accused only on arraignment and when
 sentencing. The evidence, arguments and records of such
 proceedings under OPC and HPC are closed to the public
 and the press, although the NPC appeals process provides
 for a public hearing.
 While criminal justice has not been subject to con-
 troversy, standards governing admissibility of evidence,
 especially confessional evidence, are less rigorous
 under the MPC than under the OPC and attorneys
 have generally less opportunity for an effective
 defense. Emergency security-measures require
 that detainees be turned over to a military judge
 within ten days. In practice, however, there are
 lengthy delays both in informing the accused of
 precise charges and in commencing judicial
 proceedings (the OPC requires a formal charge
 within 24 hours and the initiation of proceedings
 within 48). In recent months, Uruguayan authorities
 have taken steps to speed the work of the military
 court system.
 
 
 338
 Attorneys are not permitted access to their clients
 during pre-trial investigation (under either the
 MPC or OPC). Once the accused is turned over to
 a military judge for possible arraignment, lawyers
 are pernitted access to their clients only in
 the presence of the authorities. (Lawyers see
 clients in private under the OPC.)
 Persons detained under the military justice system
 sometimes continue to be held or are rearrested
 on new charges after completing their sentence.
 e. Invasion of the Hone
 Under the current emergency security measures,
 guarantees of inviolability of the home of persons
 suspected of terrorism, subversion, or other crimes
 against the nation are suspended, although they still
 are respected in non-security cases. Wholesale raids
 as in the Tupamaro period and the subsequent round-ups,
 have subsided. Invasions of homes by security forces
 are now infrequent and reportedly do not involve
 looting or other abuses.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the
 Fulfillment of Such Vital Needs as Food,
 Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Per capita income for this generally middle-class
 country is about $1,390, high for the region.
 Mortality rates and other health indices continue
 to be favorable. Despite inflation, occasional
 shortages and a continuing reduction of real income,
 the majority of the population is well fed. There
 are various government-sponsored community feeding
 programs for the poor. Housing is generally
 adequate and the government has allocated
 substantial resources to subsidized housing for
 the middle and lower classes. Health care is
 accessible-to the entire population, free to the
 poor (with nominal costs for others). Likewise,
 public educational opportunities through the
 university level are accessible to the entire
 population.
 
 
 339
 Development priorities in recent years have focussed
 on agriculture and industry, whose past stagnation
 has made it increasingly difficult to sustain income
 levels and social programs. Uruguay's recent austerity
 program, involving far reaching budgetary and tax
 measures, has been accomplished at a social cost which
 lower income groups are least able to bear. However,
 Uruguay continues to be a basically middle class country.
 Although Government corruption is not widespread, there
 have been unconfirmed allegations of corrupt practices
 by individual officials, some of them prominent.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press
 Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of the press continues to be very restricted,
 although in the last few months of 1978 authorities
 displayed a growing tolerance for controversial
 news and more liberal editorial comment on hitherto
 forbidden topics such as constitutional, judicial
 and political-party reform. Critical discussion
 of Uruguayan Government actions, limited primarily
 to the economic sphere, is still cautious and
 restrained. No unfavorable comment on the Armed
 Forces is tolerated. The media operates under a
 system of self-censorship with guidelines established
 by the authorities. Under the Emergency Security
 Measure, no discussion of the Government's anti-
 subversive activities is permitted beyond official
 releases.
 A provincial newspaper which had criticized the
 government was closed by local decree in November
 1978. No other major official actions against the
 press were recorded in 1978, although temporary
 closings and expulsions occurred in previous years.
 There were continuing but less frequent instances
 of threatened sanctions and other official pressures
 such as withholding of official advertising. On
 occasion, hastily imposed sanctions have been
 reversed.
 
 
 340
 The Government normally respects constitutional
 guarantees of religious freedom. There have been
 conflicts over political issues between the Govern-
 ment and liberal church-affiliated groups and, more
 recently, forced dismissals of teachers in church-run
 and other private schools.
 Freedom of assembly, although still controlled, is
 now somewhat lessseverely restricted than in 1977.
 Political meetings are prohibited although the
 traditional, non-Marxist parties have sponsored a
 few memorial events without incurring reprisals.
 Meetings and the election of officers of all clubs
 and organizations require advance approval by security
 authorities. However, obviously non-political activities
 are generally conducted without interference.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There are no general restrictions on freedom of move-
 ment within Uruguay, foreign travel or emigration.
 However, the government has normally denied political
 detainees their constitutional right to leave the
 country rather than serve sentences. Foreign travel,
 emigration, and the renewal of passports for citizens
 living overseas, have also been denied to persons
 suspected of past or present "undesirable association."
 c. Freedom to participate in the Political
 Process
 Freedom to participate in an open political process
 does not now exist. Institutional Act. No. 4 has
 deprived thousands of persons, including several
 hundred acknowledged leaders of the traditional
 political parties, of their political rights for
 up to 15 years. While the political parties' head-
 quarters remain open and the parties retain elected
 officers, they are not permitted to engage in political,
 activity.
 
 
 341
 Although most women remain in the home, they enjoy
 more independence than women in many other Latin
 American countries. Many attend universities and
 pursue careers.
 All Marxist-controlled labor unions were dissolved
 in 1973 and activities of remaining unions severely
 curtailed. Official approval was required for all
 meetings, agendas and the election of officers.
 Organizing activity and collective bargaining were
 severely restricted and the right to strike
 effectively suspended. In January 1978 the govern-
 rent announced its intention to prepare legislation
 liberalizing the conduct of trade union activity.
 In June a series of "guidelines" for this legis-
 lation was announced and an expert drafting
 committee appointed. According to official spokes-
 men, the law will become effective in 1979. Mean-
 while, authorities are permitting increased train-
 ing and organizational activity.
 Institutional Act No. 7, adopted in July 1977, gives
 the Governmen-t sweeping authority to discharge public
 employees, previously guaranteed virtually permanent
 job security. Although designed allegedly to increase
 efficiency in the public sector, the Act has also been
 used to purge employees suspected of subversive political
 beliefs, often on the basis of flimsy evidence.
 Estimates of its impact vary widely, but hundreds
 have been fired, many of them in the educational
 system.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 Official Uruguayan attitudes toward investigation
 of alleged human rights violations have varied
 considerably. In 1974, Amnesty International and
 the International Commission of Jurists were
 permitted to make a joint on-site investigation.
 Until 1976, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross was able to visit prisoners. However, the
 Government then came to view the activities of all
 
 
 342
 international human rights groups as inimical to
 its interests and adopted a hostile attitude toward
 then. Two on-site investigations by the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), the most recent in 1977,
 were exceptions. Hostility was particularly intense
 toward Pmnesty International and the Organization
 of American States Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights (IACR). The competence and responsibility
 of the latter were attacked despite the Commission's
 established role in the Inter-American system.
 During 1978, the Uruguayan Government adopted a more
 moderate attitude. It responded to inquiries made
 in the UN Human Rights Commission which has selected
 Uruguay for special study, and has continued to
 cooperate with the ILO.
 Discussions recently were opened with the International
 Committee of the Red Cross concerning possible
 resumption of its activities on behalf of prisoners.
 In March 1978, an office was opened to respond
 to unofficial foreign inquiries about detainees.
 A greater readiness to receive foreign private
 groups has been shown, most notably to an April
 1978 mission sponsored by the American Bar
 Association. ABA recommendations pointed out
 serious breaches in the rule of law, independence
 of the judiciary and legal profession, and protection
 of the rights of the accused. The Government's
 decision to publish these recommendations in the
 local press was evidence of a new openness, as
 was its commitment to the ABA mission to take
 positive measures, some of which have been realized,
 most notably in the area of prisoner releases and
 accelerated review of cases within the military
 justice system. A delegation from the National
 Academy of Science also visited Uruguay in 1978.
 However, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross has not yet resumed visits to Uruguayan
 detainees, and Uruguay continues to oppose
 scheduling a visit by the Inter-American Commission
 on Hunan Rights.
