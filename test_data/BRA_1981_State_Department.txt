 BRAZIL
 During his third year in office, President Joao Baptista
 de Oliveira Figueiredo continued to pursue and publicly
 reaffirm the political liberalization process which
 has provided for human rights advances in Brazil in
 the past few years. Direct elections of state governors
 and senators, restored by a 1980 constitutional amendment
 -- as well as congressional, state assembly and municipal
 elections -- are scheduled to take place in November
 1982. The Figueiredo administration continues to
 tolerate high levels of public criticism; however,
 continued serious economic problems (notably inflation,
 slower growth and income level disparities) still
 raise concerns in some quarters that expanded political
 and civil expression could enable dissident groups
 to exploit latent social tensions, especially as the
 elections draw nearer. A bomb explosion in Rio de
 Janeiro in April 1981, which killed one and maimed
 another member of the military, served as a focus
 for public questioning of the government's ability
 to control violence attributed to opponents of
 liberalization.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the penal code and has been
 condemned by the Brazilian government. There were
 no allegations of torture practiced by federal authorities
 during 1981. Such allegations are still made occasionally
 against local police.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of summary executions,
 and Brazilian law prohibits capital punishment during
 peacetime. There have been no reports of corporal
 punishment for crimes. As noted above, some local
 police are alleged to have abused prisoners and criminal
 suspects physically. Such practices are not officially
 condoned. Frequent press accounts have alleged non-
 official participation by local police officers in
 the so-called "death squad" killings (many of the
 victims were apparently petty criminals or involved
 in drug trafficking) in the impoverished suburbs of
 Rio de Janeiro. Government efforts to stop the killings
 have not had noticeable success. Detention facilities
 are overcrowded, and the level of prison health care,
 diet and sanitation is low. Officials point out that,
 as with other social services, the country lacks the
 resources to improve detention facilities. There
 are no legal distinctions in treatment of prisoners
 based on type of offense, class or sex.
 c.   Disappearances
 There have been no reports in 1981 of abduction, secret
 arrest, or clandestine detention. There have been
 no allegations of disappearances of Brazilians during
 1981.

 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus is constitutionally guaranteed and usually
 respected in practice. Courts are required to rule
 immediately on habeas corpus petitions. Brazilian
 law permits preventive detention in certain well-defined
 instances. In cases of offenses against the national
 security law, the accused may be kept in custody for
 30 days, renewable for a like period if authorized
 by competent judicial authority. In theevent of
 arrest, the law provides for immediate notification
 of a judical authority who must then determine legality
 of the arrest, set bail (if the offense permits it),
 and hear habeas corpus petitions.
 e.   Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Brazilian law entitles an accused person to a fair
 public trial. Trial by a single judge is the general
 practice, with jury trial required in cases of willful
 crimes against life. Defendants are entitled to counsel,
 which, if necessary, will be provided by the state.
 Brazilian law requires that defendents be made fully
 aware of the charges against them, and defendants
 and their lawyers are legally entitled to be informed
 of the evidence on which the charges are based.
 The Brazilian judicial system is constitutionally.
 an independent branch of government. The judicial
 system provides for a range of specialized courts
 to deal with specific types of activity -- i.e., criminal,
 civil, electoral, family and labor. The military
 court system, which is part of the judicial rather
 than executive branch, hears cases involving persons
 charged with offenses against the national security
 law or military institutions.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The Brazilian constitution provides for the inviolability
 of the home. No authority can legally enter a home
 without a warrant, except when it is believed that
 a crime is being committed or an accident has taken
 place. The Brazilian press has occasionally reported
 instances of illegal police entry.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees (with certain qualifications)
 all these civil liberties, which are widely exercised.
 There continues to be broad acceptance on the part
 of the government of public protest and dissent.
 There are no limitations on assemblies as long as
 these are not seen to threaten public order.
 Opposition viewpoints are freely ventilated. In the
 media there is public discussion and criticism of
 official policies and of the performance of government
 officials from the president on down. In the so-called
 alternative (mainly leftist) press, this criticism
 is often scathing and highly personal. The cases
 of two federal congressmen accused of libelous criticism
 of the president and the military establishment are
 still pending before the supreme court, and the accused
 
 
 364
 remain free. In December 1981, another congressman
 was convicted by the supreme military tribunal for
 making unsubstantiated accusations that three high-
 ranking army offficers were responsible for terrorist
 attempts on the country. He was sentenced to six
 months in prison and/or two years probation and declared
 ineligible for reelection in 1982.
 While no censorship exists, the print media are legally
 accountable for what they publish. Radio and television
 exercise some internal controls of their programming
 to avoid potential conflicts over content. There
 are few inhibitions on these media, however, and programming
 includes frequent comment on controversial social
 and political topics. There has been no government
 harassment or closing of the media. There is no censorship
 of books, although there have been some official moves
 to restrict the distribution of publications judged
 to be pornographic.
 Press accounts have alleged participation of government
 security forces officers in bombings of newsstands
 selling leftist publications early in 1981, but no
 arrests have been made or legal charges preferred
 for those acts. A bomb explosion which killed an
 army sergeant and critically wounded a captain in
 a car parked outside a leftist-sponsored concert/rally
 in Rio de Janeiro raised widespread speculation about
 involvement of government security forces in violence
 directed against leftist targets. The official inquiry
 into the case attributed the bombing to radical leftist
 organizations, but without specific accusation.
 There has been no reported interference with academic
 inquiry in the natural or social sciences or persecution
 of professional groups.
 Labor unions have the effective right to organize,
 negotiate and strike. However, strikes are not legally
 permitted in essential industries (which have been
 broadly defined), and unions are prohibited from engaging
 in partisan political activity. The government intervention
 in the Sao Bernardo metalworkers union, as a result
 of the 1980 strike which had been declared illegal,
 ended in the summer of 1981, and new union leaders
 have been elected. The government continued to demonstrate
 tolerance of labor activism in 1981, during which
 there were fewer strikes. There was no government
 interference in a labor conference in August 1981
 which was part of efforts to organize a central national
 labor confederation. A single labor federation purporting
 to represent all unionized workers would not be permitted
 by current labor legislation.
 The Sao Paulo area metalworkers strike of May 1980
 was ruled illegal by the local labor tribunal, and
 the leader of the strike, Luis Inacio da Silva, "Lula,"
 and ten other labor leaders were prosecuted under
 the national security law for "incitement to collective
 disobedience of the law." In February 1981 the eleven
 were convicted by a Sao Paulo military court; though
 the defendants boycotted the trial, the proceedings
 were open to the public and widely reported by both
 the national and international press. The defendants
 were freed pending appeal of their case, and in September
 the superior military tribunal in Brasilia ruled the
 strike leaders were wrongly tried and convicted, and
 the case was returned to the Sao Paulo military court
 for retrial. In November this court sentenced "Lula"
 to three and a half years in jail and gave the ten
 other labor leaders prison sentences ranging from
 two to three and a half years. All were freed on
 bond pending appeal.
 
 
 365
 Practice of religion is freely permitted. There is
 no state religion. Minority religions are not persecuted
 or harassed; adherence to a particular faith does
 not confer advantage or disadvantage in secular areas.
 In August 1981 the press gave wide attention to attacks
 by Brazilian crowds on houses occupied by followers
 of Reverend Sun Myung Moon, but such attacks were
 not officially condoned or inspired, and the government
 did provide protection. The government has initiated
 legal actions under the national security law against
 two French Roman Catholic priests for alleged illegal
 political acts.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country
 or on emigration or repatriation; nor are women or
 other groups subject to separate provisions in these
 areas. The foreigners law was revised in 1981 to
 clarify the conditions under which foreigners (particularly
 those with Brazilian spouses or children and clergy
 and missionaries) may remain in Brazil. Brazilian
 law provides for political asylum but is not precise
 on criteria.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The congress approved in November 1980 a government-
 sponsored constitutional amendment restoring direct
 gubernatorial elections and making all future senate
 elections direct. Municipal legislatures are popularly
 elected, as are mayors, except those in state capitals
 and "strategically located" cities who are appointed
 by state governors. Federal, congressional, state
 and municipal elections are scheduled for November
 1982. The holding of these elections has been reaffirmed
 publicly by government spokesmen and by President
 Figueiredo. However, on November 30 President Figueiredo
 sent congress a draft law which would require straight
 party ticket voting for all offices in the 1982 elections.
 Critics maintain that the bill would disadvantage
 smaller opposition political parties and thereby ensure
 the victory of the governing party and continued control
 by the government of the electoral college which will
 vote on Figueiredo's successor.
 Citizens are free to participate in government through
 suffrage, political party affiliation, membership
 in interest groups, direct approach to office holders,
 etc. All of these means are openly available; use
 of them varies with educational level, interest, physical
 proximity and other factors. Voting is secret and
 mandatory for adult literates; illiterates cannot
 vote. Opposition parties and groups, except for the
 Communist Party, which is illegal, operate freely
 and participate fully in the political process.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Brazilian government considers international
 organization investigation into alleged human rights
 violations as unwarranted Interference in Brazil's
 internal affairs, the federal government has not impeded
 visits by representatives of such organizations in
 recent years. No such visits to Brazil are known
 to have taken place in 1981.
 
 
 366
 Non-governmental Brazilian organizations such as the
 National Conference of Brazilian (Catholic) Bishops,
 the National Bar Association and its local chapters,
 the Brazilian Press Association, and local lay and
 church-sponsored "justice and peace" groups are able
 to investigate and publicize alleged human rights
 violations or institute legal proceedings to redress
 them.
 Brazil is a party to several United Nations human
 rights conventions including the conventions on
 genocide, racial discrimination, refugees and the
 political rights of married women. Brazil has not
 signed the Inter-American conventions on human rights.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 After a decade of impressively high growth rates,
 the Brazilian economy is in a period of adjustment.
 From an average annual growth rate of 11.5 percent
 during the pre-OPEC oil crisis period (1970-1974),
 growth dropped to an average 6.6 percent in the subsequent
 period (1975-1980). Real GDP growth in 1981 is expected
 to be below four percent, in contrast to 1980's eight
 percent growth. Real per capita income increased
 from $1,713 in 1978 to $1,995 in 1980.
 The economy continued to face several difficult problems
 in 1981. The emphasis in economic policy on reducing
 the trade deficit and inflation has led to diminished
 growth. Stable oil prices have helped these efforts,
 while the strengthening of the dollar and high international
 interest rates have had a negative impact. The 1981
 trade deficit will be sharply down from 1980's $2.9
 billion, with the possibility of a small surplus.
 Brazil's foreign debt will exceed $60 billion by the
 end of 1981. Inflation climbed from 77 percent in
 December 1979 to 110 percent in December 1980. Rates
 are now coming down slowly from a peak of 120 percent,
 with the prospect of a year-end 1981 rate close to
 100 percent.
 Seventy percent of Brazil's population lives within
 100 kilometers of the coast. Rural-to-urban migration
 is concentrating population increases in cities, where
 basic economic needs are more adequately met. Preliminary
 1980 census data indicate that the annual population
 growth rate for the past decade has been 2.5 percent,
 compared with 2.9 percent for the 1960-1970 decade.
 Population growth and migration complicated the government's
 ability to keep up with the expanded need for public
 health and social services.
 Income distribution is a domestic social problem,
 though evidence suggests that nearly all social strata
 have benefitted absolutely from the country's economic
 growth. According to government statistics, between
 1960 and 1976 the concentration of income in the richest
 ten percent of the population increased from 39.6
 to 59.4 percent, while the share received by the poorest
 50 percent fell from 17.4 to 13.5 percent. Regional
 income differences are marked, with the south-southeast
 -- containing slightly more than 50 percent of the
 population -- earning 82 percent of the income.
 
 
 367
 Life expectancy is officially estimated at 62.7 years.
 Nationally, infant mortality is 92 per li000 live
 births, but there are widespread regional differences.
 Health personnel and health facilities are concentrated
 in urban areas and the industrial southeast, which
 account for 80 percent of the physicians, 73 percent
 of the nursing personnel and 79 percent of the hospital
 beds. The government is attempting to improve safety
 and health conditions in the work place.
 Significant portions of the society lack some vital
 npeds -- nutrition, potable water, basic education
 and medical care. Illustrative of this are the findings
 of a 1980 Brazilian congressional inquiry which found
 that Brazil has two million abandoned children and
 18 to 25 million children without the basic necessities
 of life.
 Adult literacy was officially estimated in 1979 at
 75.7 percent (although some Brazilian educators believe
 this figure to be high). The Brazilian ministry of
 education estimates that some seven million school-
 age children are not being reached by the educational
 system.
 In the course of Brazil's rapid though uneven economic
 development, women have made progress in attaining
 equal status. Basic legal rights are guaranteed without
 regard to sex. In*Brazil's relatively affluent, economically
 and politically dynamic urban areas, women are becoming
 increasingly active in the professions, industry,
 education, the arts and the media as well as political
 life, including a small representation in the national
 congress. This level and this range of activities
 are much less in evidence in the rural, economically
 underdeveloped sectors of the country,*and especially
 in the northeast, where poverty and traditional attitudes
 constitute obstacles. Although a legal requirement,
 equal pay for equal work is not widely practiced.
 While the government is committed to improving living
 standards, the Figueiredo administration has made
 it clear that its immediate priorities are raising
 agricultural production and reducing inflation. The
 government has also indicated that fulfillment of
 economic and social objectives will be dependent,
 over the medium term, on resolving the balance of
 payments and energy problems.
 The country's estimated 200,000 Indians have suffered
 in recent decades from the gradual encroachment of
 Brazil's coastal-based population and from the
 government's efforts to promote economic development
 in the Amazon region and frontier areas where most
 Indians live. The increasing contact between Indians
 and newcomers has bred occasional conflict. The Figueiredo
 administration has renewed the government's commitment
 under the 1973 Indian statute to protect the Indian
 population, and the government's Indian Affairs Agency
 (FUNAI) has been charged under the law with the task
 of demarcating tribal lands, which would provide a
 greater measure of security for the Indians. In the
 face of more immediate priorities, however, FUNAI
 has remained an understaffed agency, and the demarcation
 has not been completed on schedule.
