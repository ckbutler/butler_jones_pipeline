 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti, a small resource-poor nation located at the southern
 end of the Red Sea, is a constitutional republic with a
 one-party system which has been led by President Hassan Gouled
 Aptidon since independence from France in 1977. By an
 unwritten arrangement, the President is a member of the
 politically dominant ethnic Somalis (Issa) while the Prime
 Minister is from the substantial minority Afar. There is also
 a sizable Arab community, mainly Yemenis, who have a prominent
 role in commerce. Cabinet positions are divided among the two
 dominant groups, but in reality the Issas control the civil
 service and the armed forces. Djibouti has a 65-member
 elected National Assembly. Since 1981, as part of the
 political balancing act, there is a single political party,
 the Rassemblement Populaire Pour Le Progres (RPP). An
 opposition party, the Mouvement Populaire De Liberation (MPL),
 was outlawed in 1981, following community violence.
 Djibouti's armed forces consist of a small army supplemented
 by a smaller navy and air wing. Located between two
 relatively giant neighbors on the Horn--both of whom have
 tribal affinities and potential irredentist claims--Djibouti
 has a vital, additional layer of security in a 1977 mutual
 defense agreement with France which ensures the continued
 presence of 5,000 French troops.
 Djibouti's economy rests on the activities of a large foreign
 expatr4ate community, the maritime and commercial activities
 of the Port of Djibouti, the airport, and the operation of the
 Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railroad. Recent economic stagnation has
 been compounded by the influx since the Ogaden War (1977-79)
 with Ethiopia of refugees, economic migrants, and victims of
 drought and famine, especially from Ethiopia. These large
 movements of peoples clearly have placed a heavy burden on the
 Djiboutian economy, notwithstanding the assistance of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other relief agencies. In addition to approximately 16,000
 registered refugees, there are unknown numbers (estimates run
 from 20,000 to 60,000) of illegal immigrants eking out an
 existence on the margins of the Djiboutian economy.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in
 ,,Djibouti in 1985, although of the 18 alleged members of the
 MPL arrested on returning to Djibouti from Ethiopia in
 December 1984, all were released in 1985. Despite one-party
 rule, the openness of the society creates an atmosphere in
 which most citizens feel free to pursue their livelihood
 without fear of government interference. Free enterprise is
 encouraged in Djibouti's service-oriented economy, and the
 right of private property and freedom of movement are
 generally respected. The legal system is still in its
 formative stages. On any topic not yet covered by Djiboutian
 legislation, the Napoleonic code, a product of the French
 colonial period, and, to an extent, the Islamic Shari'a
 generally apply. Women play a secondary role in public life.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There are no known incidents of killing for apparent political
 motives since Djibouti became independent in 1977.

 DJIBOUTI
 b. Disappearance
 There were no allegations of disappearance in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In the ethnically polarized environment of Djibouti, there are
 occasional allegations of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. For example, Amnesty International's
 1985 Report (covering 1984) mentioned one charge from 1983 and
 expressed concern over the alleged torture of nine persons
 suspected of belonging to the outlawed MPL. The nine had been
 detained in 1983 after returning from exile in Ethiopia. The
 Minister of Justice informed Amnesty International that the
 nine had been charged with offenses against state security,
 that normal judicial procedures had been followed, and that
 none of them had been tortured.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In November 1984, the Government announced the release of the
 nine Afar political prisoners. In December 1984, 18 more
 Afars were reportedly arrested for crossing the border from
 Ethiopia. These were allegedly former members of the M4PL who
 .where returning to Djibouti under the amnesty declared by the
 President. All were released in 1985.
 The current system of justice is a mixture of French and
 Islamic law. This mixture results in a hybrid legal system,
 based partly on the French Penal Code and partly on Issa
 tribal common law. The principle of habeas corpus does not
 exist. However on March 19, 1985, the Government issued a new
 decree limiting detention of all persons to 48 hours. At such
 time, the individual must be charged by the examining
 magistrate. Moreover, the prisoner is entitled to legal
 counsel and must be so informed. Although bail and personal
 recognizance are provided for, a judge may choose to hold any
 prisoner, who is charged without bail. Prosecutors are
 required, and generally do, file charges in an expedient
 fashion. Prison conditions are minimally adequate. Family
 members and counsel are permitted access to prisoners, and
 public health and medical services supervise health conditions
 in a generally competent manner. There is no forced labor in
 Djibouti.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the State Security Court, established to deal with crimes
 against the security of the state, and ordinary civil and
 criminal courts permit family members and counsel, though not
 the general public, to attend trials. The judiciary has
 remained largely independent of military and executive
 pressures.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Decree Law No. 8 of June 1980 states that government
 authorities "may not enter or remain in the domicile of a
 private individual without his consent and without a legal
 order," except, among other circumstances, when it is
 necessary to facilitate the prosecution of persons accused of
 crimes and when-the public order is seriously disturbed.
 There are reports of noncompliance with this statute.
 
 
 DJIBOUTI
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All Djiboutian media are government-owned and support the
 Government and its policies. Radio/TV Djibouti claims to
 receive only limited guidance from senior political levels on
 handling news it presents to the public. There is occasional
 criticism of the shortcomings of local institutions, some
 associated with key political and religious figures, and of
 corrupt and inefficient practices in the bureaucracy, but not
 of the central Government itself. There are occasional
 confiscations of foreign publications which contain commentary
 critical of the Government. The media usually do not carry
 stories of violence, crime, or ethnic disturbances.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings require a permit which may be denied for
 security reasons. The Government permits free association
 outside the political realm, and there are several independent
 social, religious, cultural, and commercial organizations.
 The right of labor to organize and strike exists, but only a
 small portion of the work force is unionized. Moreover, the
 Government has organized the single national labor federation,
 the Union Generale de Travailleurs Djiboutien (UGTD), and
 keeps it under its control, and through it, also controls the
 individual unions. Unions freely maintain relations with
 recognized international bodies in their fields. Temporary
 stoppages, usually protesting working conditions or
 dismissals, sometimes occur. Most large enterprises have
 affiliates of the UGTD. Employees are not required to join
 these unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Over 96 percent of the population is Muslim, but freedom of
 religious practice, publication, and association with
 coreligionists outside the country is unfettered for all
 religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians travel freely within and outside their country.
 Passports are generally freely available. There are no
 exchange controls. Djibouti has had a steady inflow of
 refugees, economic migrants, and famine victims in the past
 decade. As many as 40,000 displaced persons, mainly from
 Ethiopia, fled to Djibouti during the height (1977-79) of the
 armed conflict in the Ogaden region. Most of the refugees
 have received assistance from the international community in
 the refugee camps of Dikhil and Ali Sabieh. Several thousand
 more have spontaneously settled in the capital city. Refugees
 in the camps are restricted to them and are not able to move
 freely.
 On November 21, 1984, Djibouti, Ethiopia and the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) decided to
 terminate as of December 31,1984, the large scale repatriation
 program begun in 1983. Refugees wishing to return to Ethiopia
 after that date are processed case-by-case. According to the
 UNHCR, by December 1984 a total of 32,859 persolis had been
 registered as repatriates from Djibouti of whom 14,281 had
 
 
 93
 DJIBOUTI
 returned to Ethiopia in UNHCR organized rail moves, and 19,578
 had returned on their own.
 The Government has increasingly taken a firm stand in
 returning Ethiopians who do not qualify for refugee status.
 In August 1984, following a series of roundups, Djibouti
 deported several hundred persons to Ethiopia because,
 according to the Government, the deportees were illegal aliens
 whose presence had created tensions with native Djiboutians.
 Many of these tensions stem from ethnic difficulties involving
 Afar resentment at alleged discrimination in treatment of Afar
 versus Issa drought victims.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Djibouti is a one-party state whose leaders and candidates for
 Parliament are chosen by the leadership of the party, the
 Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progres (RPP). There is
 active competition within the party lists. The one-party
 system was instituted in 1981, and the Government subsequently
 detained leaders of the previous opposition party and
 dissidents allegedly attempting to encourage ethnic strife.
 Traditionally, the Djiboutian Government includes the ruling
 cabinet representatives of all the nation's important ethnic
 groups. However, some Afars complain that the country is run
 by and for the Issas, who dominate the Government, the armed
 forces, and the single party. Others complain that tribal and
 ethnic considerations inhibit appointment of competent
 administrators. While citizens are encouraged to become
 involved in politics and to vote, the party leadership,
 through a 14-member political bureau, carefully controls and
 directs all political activity and in 1982 selected the single
 slate of candidates for the National Assembly elections.
 There is no democratic or nonviolent means for citizens of
 Djibouti to change their Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 On at least six occasions since independence, most recently in
 August 1984, there have been foreign press and other reports
 alleging human rights violations by the Government. The
 Government has generally responded to such charges either by
 permitting an investigation, as by the UNHCR and Amnesty
 International in 1981, or by denial as mentioned in ic above.
 It expelled in December 1983 two members of an international
 fact-finding team sponsored by Cultural Survival, a nonprofit
 human rights organization, who were investigating reports of
 involuntary repatriation of refugees. Amnesty International,
 in its 1985 Report, expressed continuing concern about
 allegations of torture of detainees and the situation of
 Ethiopian refugees. Freedom House rated Djibouti "partly
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Djibouti is one of the world's poorest developing countries in
 terms of natural resources. Practically all commodities are
 imported. Its port is its primary asset along with an aging
 railway line to Addis Ababa. Djibouti's economy also depends
 heavily on a large French military and expatriate presence
 (over 10,000) and outside donor support, mainly from France
 and Saudi Arabia. Recently, the potential for a fishing
 
 
 94
 DJIBOUTI
 industry has been identified as well as for geothermal
 resources. While statistical data is either unavailable or
 conjectural, the per capita gross national product is
 estimated at between $310 and $450 per annum. A 1980 French
 study estimated that 47 percent of the population earned less
 than $130 annually. Almost one-third of the population lives
 a nomad's life of bare subsistence in the rural hinterlands of
 the republic. Djibouti's population is estimated at
 approximately 320,000 for a land surface of 9,000 square miles.
 The level of unemployment has been high since independence in
 1977. In 1980, the International Monetary Fund reported that
 over 50 percent of job seekers could not find work. In 1982,
 unemployment was estimated at 45 percent and underemployment
 at 33 percent of the work force. Since 1983, several factors
 have exacerbated this trend: the high growth rate (2.5
 percent) of the population; the influx of refugees and
 displaced persons; and the decline in French assistance and
 spending.
 The harsh, arid, blast furnace-like environment is a cause of
 low life expectancy in Djibouti. 1983 estimates put this
 figure at 48.1 years. Use of the khat plant is a very serious
 economic and social problem. According to a recent World
 Health Organization study, it is estimated that as many as 90
 percent of the men and 10 percent of the women use this
 drug--which, produced in neighboring Ethiopia, is consumed
 legally in Djibouti. Although an important source of taxes
 for the Government, khat represents both a serious drain of
 foreign exchange reserves (an estimated $15 million in 1985)
 and a drain on the regular users' disposable income (estimates
 run as high as 70 percent of monthly salary).
 Water is a scarce commodity and of poor quality in most of the
 country. There are no surface water sources. The Government
 has made efforts to truck water to remote areas of the
 country. Latest estimates (1980) indicate that about 45
 percent of the population receives safe water (50 percent in
 urban areas, 20 percent in rural areas).
 According to a 1980 World Bank report, the adult literacy rate
 (in the French language) was 17 percent. Primary school
 enrollment for 1984-85 was approximately 21,300, an increase
 of some 320 percent since independence. The high school
 enrollment increased from 3,000 to 9,000 over this period.
 This increase, with a concomitant rise in the number and
 quality of educational facilities, reflects the priority the
 Djiboutian Government gives to education.
 The country's nominal minimum wage is about $100 per month,
 although very few local workers are paid at this rate. The
 minimum age for employment of children is 14 and the standard
 of a 40-hour workweek is observed. Employers normally
 contribute an amount equal to 18 percent of each employee's
 salary to the Government's generous pension and medical
 insurance programs. Retirement is normally at 80 percent of
 salary after 15 years of employment with a minimum age of 50.
 Women in Djibouti enjoy a higher public status than in some
 other Islamic countries, but women's rights and family
 planning are not high priorities. Nomadic traditions
 involving female genital mutilation (particularly excision and
 infibulation) are quite prevalent in Djibouti. The President
 has recognized the key role of women in the small trade
 sector, and there is an active, local women's organization.
