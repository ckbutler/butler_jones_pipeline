 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is a parliamentary democracy in which constitutional powers are
 shared between President Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, an independent, and
 Prime Minister Carlos Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga, and his party, the Movement for
 Democracy (MPD). The MPD dominates the National Assembly in which only two
 of the four official political parties are represented.
 The Government controls the police, which have primary responsibility for main-
 tenance of law and order. There were no reported human rights abuses committed
 by security forces.
 Cape Verde has a market-based economy but little industry and few exploitable
 natural resourc es. The country has a long history of economically driven emigration,
 primarily to Western Europe and the United States, and receipts from Cape
 Verdeans abroad remain an important source of national income. Even in years of
 optimum rainfall, the country can produce food for only 25 percent of the population,
 resulting in a heavy reliance on international food aid.
 The principal human rights problems in 1994 continued to be societal discrimina-
 tion, domestic violence against women, and child abuse. The easing of political ten-
 sions has allowed authorities to begin bringing criminals to justice without fear of
 accusations of political motive. Individuals of all ethnic origin who had used political
 conflict as cover are now visibly pursued and arrested for violations of the law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of these abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law stipulates that authorities bring
 charges before a judge within 24 hours of arrest. Police may not make arrests with-
 
 
 out a court order unless a person is caught in the act of committing a felony. In
 exceptional cases, and with the concurrence of a court official, authorities may de-
 tain persons without charge for up to 5 days. These laws are observed in practice.
 The Ministry of Justice has 40 days to prepare for trial in state security cases,
 and may detain persons until trial or for a period not to exceed 1 year. There is
 a functioning system of bail.
 There were no reports of security detentions or forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the right to a fair
 trial. A judiciary independent of the executive branch generally provides due process
 rights, but there are serious delays owing to an understaffed judiciary (see below).
 The judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court and the regional courts.
 There are five Supreme Court judges, including one appointed by the President, one
 a ppointed by the National Assembly, and three appointed by the High Council of
 Magistrates. Judges are independent and may not belong to a political party.
 'efendants are presumed to be innocent; have the right to public, nonjury trial;
 to counsel; to p resent witnesses; and to appeal verdicts. Free counsel is provided for
 the indigent. Regional courts adjudicate minor disputes on the local level in rural
 areas. The Ministry of Justice and Labor appoints local judges, who are usually
 prominent local citizens. Defendants may appeal regional court decisions to the Su-
 preme Court.
 The right to an expeditious trial is constrained by a seriously overburdened judi-
 cial system. A backlog of cases routinely leads to trial delays of 6 months. There
 were no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitr "ary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, correspondence, and other
 means of communication, and the Government respects these rights in practice. The
 law requires a judicial warrant before homes may be searched.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom to ex-
 press ideas by words, images, or      an  re         d for freedom of the press
 without censorship. These freedoms are generally respected in practice.
 Journalists are independent of the Goveent and are not required to reveal
 their sources. However, self-censorship limits media criticism of the Government.
 Government officials use Cape Verde's strict libel laws to intimidate critics, as in
 a successful case against the government-owned Novo Jornal de Cabo Verde and in
 several pending cases against the independent A Semana. The Government may
 also demote or dismiss journalists in government enterprises who exceed the pre-
 ferred limits of criticism.
 Government authorization is not needed to establish newspapers, other publica-
 tions, or electronic media. There are independent, governmental and opposition
 media. The national radio station broadcasts live National Assembly sessions in
 their entirety. Independent newspapers also enjoy freedom of the press. In 1994 a
 bimonthly paper, Correio Quinze, was founded by supporters of a newly formed op-
 position group.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assciation.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association without authorization and without
 harassment by the authorities. Various groups exercised this right without govern-
 ment interference or objection. However, in April, a demonstration by high school
 students in Praia turned violent when squatters and other homeless persons who
 had been forced from illegally constructed housing joined the retest and injured
 two government employees while throwing stones and attacking uses and cars. The
 Government does not require permits for demonstrations. However, organizers must
 inform the authorities that a demonstration is planned.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of religion and
 the separation of church and state. It also prohibits the State from imposing reli-
 gious beliefs and practices. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens are free to travel and establish residence without government
 restrictions. The Constitution provides for repatriation, and the Government allows
 it in practice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right ow Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right in 1991, atter 15 years of one-party rule. An opposi-
 tion party won the country's irnst free legislative and presidential elections and
 peacefully assumed power. Promulgation of the new Constitution in 1992 consoli-
 dated this change. The Constitution provides   for separation of powers. Cabinet a -
 
 
 39
 isters are not required to be members of the National Assembly, but they are indi-
 vidually subject to parliamentary confirmation. Collectively, they must retain the
 support of a parliamentary majority. The President may dismiss the Government
 with the approval of the Council of the Republic, which is composed of the President
 of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the President of the Supreme Court,
 the Attorney General, the President of the Regional Affairs Council, and four pri-
 vate members. Referendums may be held under specified circumstances but may not
 challenge individual political rights and liberties or the right of opposition parties
 to exist and function freely. No referendums were held in 1994.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice regarding the rights of women or mi-
 norities to vote or to participate in the political process. Women hold 7.6 percent
 of the seats in Parliament and 2 of 13 cabinet ministers are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two private human rights groups in Cape Verde-the National Commis-
 sion of the Rights of Man and the Cape Verdean League for Human Rights. No
 major human rights organizations conducted investigations in Cape Verde during
 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, or social status.
 Women.-Women continue to face discrimination in several ways. Despite con-
 stitutional prohibitions against sex discrimination and provisions for full equality,
 including equal pay for eual work, traditional male-oriented values predominate.
 Women experience difficu ties in obtaining certain types of employment and are
 often paid less than men but are making modest inroads in the professions.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination against women in inheritance, family
 and custody matters. However, largely because of illiteracy, most women are un-
 aware of their rights. Women are often reluctant to seek redress of domestic dis-
 putes in the courts. The Organization of Cape Verdean Women alleges disparate
 treatment in inheritance matters despite laws calling for equal rights.
 Women comprise 38 percent of the work force, but make up more than half the
 workers in service and administrative positions. Employment opportunities for
 women have improved, as evidenced by the increasing presence of women in the
 uper echelons of government and among law and medical professionals.
 Domestic violence against women, including wife beating, remains common, par-
 ticularly in rural areas. Victims rarely report crimes such as rape and spousal abuse
 to the police. Neither the Government nor women's organizations have addressed di-
 rectly the issue of violence against women.
 Children.-Child abuse is a continuing problem. The Government mounted a pub-
 lic relations campaign to educate the public about the dangers of child abuse and
 the rights of children. The Government may remove children from their parents'
 homes and place them in an orphanage, if warranted. However, few cases of child
 abuse are prosecuted.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate access to public
 buildings or services for the disabled. It does provide transportation (a combination
 wheelchair and three-wheel motor scooter) for handicapped persons. Physically dis-
 abled persons are not subject to discrimination in employment or education.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Worker  e legally free to form and to join unions
 without government authorization or restriction. There are two umbrella union as-
 sociations: the Council of Free Labor Unions, formed after the change in government
 and composed of 11 unions with about 7,000 members, and the National Union of
 Cape Verdie Workers, formed by. the farmer riling party but operating independ-
 ently in 1994, composed of 13 unions with about 15,000 members. The Government
 does not interfere with the activities of these organizations, but bth suffer from a
 shortage of funds.
 The Constitution provides union members with the right to strike, and the Gov-
 ernment does not restrict this right. There were periodic strikes thrughout 1994.
 By law, an employer must rei nst ate a worker fired unjustly. Unions are free to affil-
 iate international  an  ave ties with African and international trade union organi-
 zations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bartain Colletively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize and operate without hindrance and to sign collective work con-
 tracts. Workers and management in the small private sector, as wefl as in the pub-
 
 
 40
 lic sector, reach agreement through collective bargaining. As the country's largest
 employer, the Governmentcontinues to play the dominant role by setting wages in
 the civil service. It does not fix wages for the private sector, but salary levels for
 civil servants provide the basis for wage negotiations in the private sector.
 A 1991 legislative decree bans antiunion discrimination by employers, with fines
 for offenders. There were no reported cases of such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is forbidden by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 14. The law prohibits children under 16 from working at mght, more
 than 7 hours per day, or in establishments where toxic products are produced, but
 the Government rarely enforces the law. In practice, the Ministry of Justice and
 Labor enforces minimum age laws with limited success, and only in the urban, for-
 mal sectors of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are no established minimum wage rates
 in the private sector. Large urban private employers link their minimum wage rates
 to those paid to civil servants, which for an entry level worker is $180 (15,000 escu-
 dos) per month. The majority of jobs pay wages insufficient to provide a worker and
 his family a decent standard of living; therefore, most workers also rely on second
 jobs, extended family help, and subsistence agriculture.
 The maximum legal workweek for adults is 44 hours. While large employers gen-
 erally respect these regulations, many domestic servants and rural workers work
 longer hours.
 The Director General of Labor conducts periodic inspections to enforce proper
 labor practices and imposes fines on private enterprises which are not in conformity
 with the law, but the Government does not systematically enforce labor laws and
 much of the labor force does not enjoy their protection. There are few industries that
 employ heavy or dangerous equipment, and work-related accidents are rare.
