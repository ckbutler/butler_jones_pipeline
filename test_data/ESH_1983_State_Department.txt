THE WESTERN SAHARA
 Since 1975, Moroccan administration has included portions of
 an area now divided into four provinces known as the Western
 Sahara. Morocco assumed administration in the area after the
 withdrawal of Spanish forces. Moroccan control encompassed the
 the entire territory including the southernmost portion of the
 Western Sahara in 1979 when Mauritania renounced its claims to
 the area and ceased administering the portion of the region
 over which its authority had been vested by the Madrid Accords
 of 1975.
 Municipal, provincial, and parliamentary elections were held in
 the Moroccan-controlled portion in 1977, at the same time that
 polling took place throughout Morocco. Full communal elections
 were held in Oued Ed Dahhab (the southern one-third of the
 Sahara) on May 8, 1981. By-elections were held on May 19,
 1981, with voter participation ranging from 76 to 93 percent.
 Moroccan Saharan incumbents of the 11 seats in the Parliament
 allotted to the Saharan provinces included two vice presidents
 of the Parliament. At least three other native Saharans sat in
 the Parliament, including its President. Saharans partici-
 pated, along with the population in Morocco, in the June 1983
 municipal elections.
 The royally appointed provincial governors of the Saharan
 provinces are all native Saharans. In consultation with the
 elected municipal and provincial councils, the four governors
 administer their provinces in the same manner as Morocco's 36
 provinces. Most village and civil servants are also locally
 recruited Saharans. A sizable portion of the Royal Armed
 Forces are stationed near Saharan towns but play no direct role
 in civil administration. The governors are con-
 cerned primarily with accelerating development of the infra-
 structure and delivery of social services. Large scale public
 works projects, concentrating on construction of schools and
 hospitals, expansion of public services, and upgrading
 generally a long impoverished area continue.
 A Consultative Council on the Sahara was elected in 1981. The
 Council, some of whose 80 members are women, first met in late
 1981 and continued to function in 1982 and 1983.
 Ultimate sovereignty over the Western Saharan region remains a
 subject of international dispute with on and off fighting
 between Moroccan forces and the Polisario, an organization
 whose members seek independence for the territory. At the June
 1981 Summit meeting of the O.A.U. in Nairobi, Morocco proposed
 that a referendum be held to decide the question. Two months
 later, at a subsequent O.A.U. meeting, specific measures seen
 as leading to a peaceful settlement of the Saharan problem were
 outlined by the member states. The O.A.U. summit in June 1983
 resolved that the referendum be held by December 1983. As of
 year's end, however, this referendum had not been held. An
 O.A.U. Committee continues to work on the implementation of the
 resolutions of the earlier summits which would also involve
 U.N. participation.

 In the portion of the Western Sahara effectively under Moroccan
 control, no reports of violations of human rights have been
 received in 1983. Although population centers are behind the
 "berm" (defensive barrier) and have been protected from attacks
 by Polisario troops by Moroccan military forces, the bulk of
 the Moroccan forces are in isolated locations defending the
 "berm" and do not interact directly with the population except
 as an economic force. The overall level of military activity
 in the Western Sahara had been in a lull through June 1983 but
 military action picked up considerably in the second half of
 1983. Some attacks by the Polisario have been carried beyond
 the territory in dispute and into internationally recognized
 Moroccan territory. Oppdrtunities for evaluating the human
 rights practices of the Polisario have not presented them-
 selves. There have, however, been frequent Moroccan allega-
 tions of Polisario human rights abuses, including illegal
 detention, impressment into military service, and general
 infringement of the human rights of inhabitants of the Sahara.
