 FIJI
 Fiji, a multiracial society of 686,000 citizens made up of
 indigenous Melanesians/Polynesians (43.4 percent), ethnic
 Indians (51 percent), and some Europeans, Chinese, and other
 Pacific Islanders (5.6 percent), has a multiparty
 parliamentary system inherited from the British colonial
 period. Its Constitution provides safeguards to protect
 traditional communal social systems, including landholding
 rights of the indigenous Fijians.
 The individual civil and political rights of Fiji's citizens
 are protected by law, a court system which functions both
 effectively and rapidly, a free press, strong democratic
 elections, and a government which supports cultural
 diversity. The integrity of the person is respected both in
 law and in practice.
 There were no significant changes in the status of human
 rights during 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political killing
 Politically motivated murders by the Government or opposition
 political organizations are unknown.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no disappearances nor is there any evidence of
 people being abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely
 detained.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture, prohibited by law under the Constitution, is not
 practiced. Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is illegal and neither condoned nor practiced.
 There are no summary executions. Treatment of prisoners is
 impartial and humane. In addition to constitutional
 prohibitions, Legal Notice No. 51 contains specific
 regulations on treatment, visiting rights, clothing, etc.,
 which are respected in practice. Prisons are overcrowded, but
 prisoners can serve their time and live outside the prison
 environment for the last 12 months of sentence and for any
 sentence of 12 months or less. Legislation also allows
 gainful employment, in addition to commitment to perform
 public work, while serving extramural sentences. Public
 defenders are available, and the Fiji Red Cross has access to
 detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas corpus-exists and is honored in practice, and there is
 no preventive detention. In addition to constitutional
 safeguards, Legal Notice No. 14 establishes detailed rules to
 be followed by the police during arrests. A suspect can be
 held without charge following arrest for a maximum of 24 hours.

 e. Denial of FaiL Public Trial
 Public trial is guaranteed by law and honored in practice.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel, and counselors have free
 access to defendants. Defendants are made fully aware of the
 charges brought against them, and they and their lawyers have
 access to the evidence on which charges are based. Fiji's
 courts are independent of executive or military control.
 There are no special courts and civilians are not tried by
 military courts. An ombudsman's office actively investigates
 complaints against the Government while protecting the
 identity of the complainant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is respected. Warrants issued by a
 magistrate are required for officials to enter a private
 residence. There is no arbitrary intrusion by the state or
 political organizations into the private life of the
 individual.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the Fiji
 Constitution and observed in practice. The only radio station
 is under the administration of an independent Broadcasting
 Commission and provides balanced coverage of the news in three
 languages. The press is free and private and not censored or
 controlled by the Government. However, Fiji inherited an
 ordinance from the Colonial Administration which allows the
 Government to order a correction in the press if the
 Government believes its position has been misrepresented.
 This ordinance, though very seldom used, is resented by the
 press since it requires giving equal space and equal placement
 to the Government's statement. There is no interference with
 academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no impediments to assembly or to freedom of
 association, although an ordinance requires obtairing a permit
 one week in advance of any picketing or public demonstration.
 Fiji has an active trade union movement, recognized by the
 Government, which has the right to organize, strike, bargain
 collectively, and lobby. Fiji's 50 trade unions have about
 45,000 members. Unions must give a 28-day notice of intent
 before going out on strike in the public sector. Fiji's
 largest trade union confederation is associated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 participates in the conferences of the International Labor
 Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are tolerated and allowed to practice their
 rites freely. There is no dominant religion in Fiji, nor is
 any singled out for discrimination. Evangelical religions are
 free to seek converts and actively do so.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Fiji citizens are free to travel anywhere within the
 country and abroad. There are no restrictions on
 repatriation. There are no displaced persons in Fiji.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Fiji's political structure is designed to accommodate the
 special interests of the ethnic Fijians and of the ethnic
 Indian community. Election to the House of Representatives is
 on the basis of communal and national rolls. House elections
 are free and democratic, and a multitude of parties contest
 the seats. In Fiji's most recent national elections in 1982,
 84.4 percent of the voting age population participated.
 Members of the Senate are appointed by the Fiji Council of
 Chiefs, the Prime Minister, and the leader of the opposition.
 Fiji's court system has tried, and in some cases convicted,
 individuals charged with voting fraud, including a member of
 the governing party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Fiji Government nor any known requests for
 investigations. Fiji's ombudsman investigates complaints
 against the Government while maintaining the confidentiality
 of the client. A free, independent, and competitive press
 also serves as a watchdog for human rights. There are no
 adverse consequences associated with actions of either of
 these institutions. The 1984 Amnesty International Report did
 not contain an entry on Fiji. Freedom House's 1984-85 report
 listed it as "free.-
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Fiji's economy is divided between a subsistence agricultural
 and a cash-based economy, the former characteristic of the
 outlying islands and the latter typical of the group's two
 main islands. Although the per capita gross national product
 (GNP) of Fiji is relatively high for a developing nation at
 $1,949.40 (World Bank figures for 1982), the country's wealth
 is not evenly distributed between the urban and rural sectors,
 a situation Fiji'A most recent development plan attempts to
 remedy. Fiji seeks to increase economic opportunities through
 regional planning and economic incentives. Its most recent
 development plan calls for increased attention to rural
 development problems and the commitment of resources to
 improve housing, nutrition, health services, and education in
 the rural areas. Private enterprise is encouraged, as is
 foreign investment.
 About 85 percent of the land in Fiji is owned communally by
 the indigenous Fijian people. Approximately six percent is
 government land, leaving less than 10 percent as freehold
 land. Communal and government lands can be leased but not
 sold; only freehold land can be purchased outright. The
 
 
 770
 FIJI
 arrangement regarding land ownership was instituted to protect
 the interests of indigenous Fijians from the more economically
 competitive Indo-Fijians, but some of the latter consider it
 discriminatory and an interference with their own freedom to
 develop. Some members of the Indian community also complain
 that it is difficult for them to obtain government-backed
 financing for investment projects.
 Indo-Fijians have generally experienced greater success in the
 pursuit of educational studies and in the accumulation of
 wealth through investment in private enterprise. Most
 businesses in Fiji are owned and operated by Indo-Fijians, and
 they are more heavily represented in the civil service. Some
 indigenous Fijians view the concentration of Indo-Fijians in
 business and government as discriminatory to their own racial
 group.
 The Government neither condones nor encourages sexual, racial,
 or religious discrimination. The Constitution states that
 *every person in Fiji is entitled to the fundamental rights
 and freedoms of the individual, that is to say, the right
 whatever his race, place of origin, political opinions, color,
 creed or sex..." Few women hold high-level economic or
 political positions, although one is the deputy leader of the
 opposition. There is a growing awareness among women of both
 the Fijian and Indian communities of their right to
 participate more actively in social and political endeavors
 outside their homes. Women in the rural areas continue to
 fill the traditional roles of village life. Tribal
 inheritance is usually based on a patriarchal system. Women
 can and do, however, inherit status as chiefs; Fiji's third
 highest ranking chief is a woman.
 Health care has been expanded with an emphasis on preventive
 medicine. Reflecting this expansion of medical services, life
 expectancy at birth has risen in the past two decades to 69.5
 years. Fiji's infant mortality rate declined from 36.6 per
 1000 in 1982 to 23.8 in 1984. In the last decade, the
 percentage of the total population with access to safe water
 rose from 47 to 69 percent and, in rural areas, the percentage
 of persons with access to safe water more than quadrupled,
 rising from 15 to 62 percent. Fiji's rich soil and tropical
 climate combine to give its people an adequate diet.
 Three quarters of the population can read and write, and
 almost every Fijian citizen is to some degree bilingual in
 English and either Fijian or Hindustani. Virtually all
 children of the primary age group are enrolled in school, as
 are 90 percent of secondary school-aged children. World Bank
 statistics on education in Fiji reveal no discrimination
 between sexes with regard to education.
