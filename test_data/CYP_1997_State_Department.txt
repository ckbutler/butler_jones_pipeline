 CYPRUS
 Prior to 1974, Cyprus experienced a long period of intercommunal strife between
 its Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. The island has been divided since the
 Turkish military intervention of 1974, following a coup d'etat directed from Greece.
 Since 1974 the southern part of the country has been under the control of the Gov-
 ernment of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part is ruled by a Turkish Cypriot
 administration. In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself the "Turkish Republic
 of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC "), which is recognized only by Turkey. The two parts
 are separated by a buffer zone patrolled by the United Nations Force in Cyprus
 (UNFICYP). A substantial number of Turkish troops remains on the island. In both
 the government-controlled areas and in the Turkish Cypriot community there is a
 generally strong regard for democratic principles. Glafcos Clerides was elected Presi-
 dent of the Republic of Cyprus in 1993; in 1995 Turkish Cypriots reelected Rauf
 Denktash as their leader.
 Police in the government-controlled areas and in the Turkish Cypriot community
 are responsible for law enforcement. Police forces operating in the government-con-
 trolled areas are under civilian control, while Turkish Cypriot police forces are di-
 rected by military authorities. In general the police forces of both sides respect the
 rule of law, but instances of police abuse of power continued.
 Both Cypriot economies operate on the basis of free market principles, although
 in each community there are significant administrative controls. The government-
 controlled part of the island has a robust, service-oriented economy, with a declining
 manufacturing base and a small agricultural sector. Tourism and trade generate 21
 percent of gross domestic product and employ 27 percent of the labor force. In 1996
 per capita income was approximately $13,580, inflation was 3 percent, and unem-
 ployment was 3.1 percent. Growth in 1996 slowed to 1.9 percent (from 6 percent in
 1995). The Turkish Cypriot economy, which relies heavily on subsidies from Turkey,
 is burdened by an overly large public sector. It, too, is basically service oriented, but
 has a relatively smaller tourism base and a larger agricultural sector. In 1996 per
 capita income in the north was approximately $3,450, and inflation was 87 percent.
 The economy in the north recorded negative growth of 1.1 percent in 1996 (after 2.7
 percent growth in 1995).
 The Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot authorities generally respect
 human rights norms and practices. Police brutality continued to be a problem; dis-
 
 
 1047
 
 crimination and violence against women also remained problems. Although the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities have taken some positive steps to improve the condi-
 tions of Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the territory under their control,
 the treatment of these groups still falls short of Turkish Cypriot obligations under
 the Vienna I agreement of 1975. The Turkish Cypriot authorities continued to im-
 pose restrictions on meetings between members of the two communities outside the
 United Nations-controlled buffer zone. They approved most applications for meet-
 ings in the buffer zone. Greek Cypriot women are still denied the right to pass citi-
 zenship to their children if they are married to foreign spouses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 Turkish Cypriot authorities have not conducted a credible .investigation of the
 1996 murder of a prominent leftist Turkish Cypriot journalist, Kutlu Adali, who had
 written articles critical of Turkey's role in the north and particularly on the role of
 the Turkish military and of policies which allowed large numbers of Turkish work-
 ers into the north.
 In August 1996, Turkish Cypriot civilian police killed a Greek Cypriot demonstra-
 tor who had entered the UN. buffer zone and participated in the beating death of
 another. There has not been any significant investigation by Turkish Cypriot au-
 thorities of the killings. The Government of Cyprus stated that it will press for legal
 action against the killers, and the victims' families have filed a case against Turkey
 at the European Commission of Human Rights.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus and the basic law governing the
 Turkish   yriot community specifically prohibit torture. The law in both commu-
 nities prvides for freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment. Respect is generally accorded to these prohibitions throughout the island.
 A series of allegations emerged of Cypriot police brutality against suspects in de-
 tention, mostly involving non-Cypriots. Turkish Cypriots allege that two Turkish
 Cypriots, arrested near the buffer zone by Greek Cypriot police in October on smug-
 gling charges, were tortured. However, U.N. officials who examined the two men
 found no evidence that supported their claims. Turkish Cypriot authorities also
 claimed that their arrest was a frameup. The men are scheduled for trial in January
 1998; they have had access to attorneys.
 Three high-ranking Greek Cypriot police officials were fired in 1996 after an inde-
 pendent commission concluded that torture was used systematically at a Limassol
 police station. The three regained their positions in December when the Supreme
 Court ruled that their firings were unconstitutional, although they were not exoner-
 ated. Official action is still pending against the Cypriot police involved in a 1995
 case of torture of a suspected Turkish Cypriot drug smuggler, Erkan Egmez. Egmez
 was released and has returned to the north.
 In July 1996, the European Commission of Human Rights decided that the rights
 of Lefteris Andronicou and Elsi Constantinou had been violated by the Cyprus gov-
 ernment in a botched hostage rescue attempt in 1993 during which they were killed.
 The Cypriot Government appealed the case to the European Court of Human
 Rights, which decided in October that excessive force was not used by Cypriot police
 in the rescue attempt and that no human rights violations had occurred.
 While there were no public allegations of police brutality in the Turkish Cypriot
 community, there are credible reports of pervasive police abuse of power and routine
 harsh treatment of detainees (see Section 1.d.).
 Prison conditions are generally adequate in both communities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Throughout Cyprus laws providing for
 freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention are respectedby the police. Judicially
 issued arrest warrants are required. No one may be detained for more than a day
 without referral of the case to the courts for extension of the period of detention.
 Most periods of investigative detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal
 charges are fied. Attorneys generally have access to detainees, and bail is per-
 mitted.
 Some abuses of power occur at the hands of the Turkish Cypriot police, generally
 at the time of arrest. Suspects often are not permitted to have their lawyers present
 when testimony is being taken, a right guaranteed under the Turkish Cypriot basic
 law. Suspects demanding the presence of a lawyer are routinely threatened with
 stiffer charges or even physically intimidated. A high percentage of convictions in
 
 
 1048
 
 the Turkish Cypriot community are obtained with confessions made during initial
 police interrogation under these conditions. There are also credible reports that po-
 lice routinely abuse their right to hold persons up to 24 hours before having to go
 before a judge. Police officers use this tactic against persons believed to have be-
 haved in a manner deemed insulting to the officer. The suspects are then released
 within 24 hours without charges having been filed.
 Exile is specifically prohibited by the Constitution and by the basic law governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community.
 e. Denial ofFair Public Trial.-The judiciary is legally independent of executive
 or military- influence in both communities. Cyprus inherited many elements of its
 legal system from the United Kingdom legal tradition, including thepresumption
 of innocence, the right to due process, and the right of appeal. Throu out Cyprus
 a-fair public trial is provided or in a  nd accorded in practice. Defendants have
 the right to be present at their trials, to be represented by counsel (at government
 expense for those who cannot afford one), to -confront witnesses, and to present evi-
 dence in their own defense. There are no special courts to try security or political
 -'offenses. On the-Turkish Cypriot side, civilians deemed to have violated military
 zones are subject to trial in a military court. These courts consist of one military
 and two civilian judges and a civilian prosecutor. Members of the Turkish Cypriot
 bar have complained that civilian judges tend to defer to their military colleagues
 in such hearings.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Famiy, Home, or Correspondence.-Both
 the Cyprus Constitution and the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriot commu-
 nity include provisions protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by
 the authorities. A judicial warrant is required for police to enter a private residence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press are provided
 for by law and are freely practiced throughout the island. The proliferation of party
 and independent newspapers and periodicals in beth communities enables ideas and
 arguments to circulate freely. Opposition papers frequently criticize the authorities.
 Several private television and" radio- stations in the Greek Cypriot community coi-
 p~te effectively with the government-controlled stations. Following passage of new
 egislation during theyear, Turkish Cypriot authorities no longerhave a monopoly
 over local radio and television. Three new, private radio stations are operating, in
 addition to. two smaller, university-run stations, and two private television stations
 areebroadcasting, with a'third planned. International broadcasts are available with-
 out interference throughout the island, including telecasts from Turkey and Greece.
 Some Turkish Cypriot journalists have complained about surveillance and intimi-
 dation. Turkish Cypriot authorities have not responded adequately to such allega-
 tions.
 Academic freedom is accorded wide respect throughout the island.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The freedom to associate, orga-
 nize, and hold meetings is proeted by-law and respeted in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion generally is respected in Cyprus. Al-
 though missionaries have the legal right to proselytize in oth communities, mis-
 sionary activities are closely monitored by the Greek Cypriot Orthodox Church and
 by  th Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cpriot authorities.
 Mormon missionaries in the Greek Cypriot community experienced increased har-
 assment during the year. Several anti-Mormon programs were aired on the Ortho-
 dox Church-owned television station. In April four missionaries were briefly de-
 tained by local police. In September Mormon missionaries in the major cities of
 Nicosia, Limassoel, and Larnaca were called to police offices and interrogated exten-
 sively about their religious beliefs and church membership. They were not alleged
 to have committed any crimes but were told that the Orthodox Church opposed their
 presence in Cyprus. When informed of these events, senior Cypriot police authorities
 expressed the-ir oncern and promised to investigate; they later said that the events
 had been the "freelance" work of individual police and that they would not happen
 again. No further incidents have been reported.
 In December two Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned for 16 and 18 months re-
 spectively for refusing to perform required military service. They also refused alter-
 native unarmed military service, which is available but requires an additional 10
 to 16 months of service.
 Turkish Cypriots residing in the southern part of the island and non-Muslims in
 the north are allowed to practice their religion. Restrictions on the right of Greek
 Cypriots resident in the north to visit Apostolos Andreas monastery have been
 eased. These Greek Cypriots, in groups of 20 or more, may now visit the monastery
 
 
 1049
 every Sunday and on religious holidays. An application to replace a retiring priest
 is still pending.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy freedom of movement with-
 in their respective areas. Until late December, Turkish Cypriot authorities approved
 most applications for bicommunal meetings in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone, but
 on December 27 they suspended all of these meetings pending a reevaluation of
 bicommunal activities. Turkish Cypriots, who apply for permission to visit the
 south, are required to justify their applications with formal invitations to events ar-
 ranged by individua   or organizations resident in the Greek Cypriot community.
 Many of these applications are denied, often without an official reason, as are many
 applications by Greek Cypriots from the south to visit the area under Turkish Cyp-
 not administration. Thebasis for most denials is clearly political and related to the
 state of intercommunal relations.
 Turkish Cypriot authorities usually grant the applications of Greek Cypriot resi-
 dents in the north to visit the government-controlled area. The limit on visits to the
 south is 15 days per month. The applicants must return within the designated pe-
 riod or risk losing their right to return and their property, although this rule is
 rarely enforced in practice. Turkish Cypriot authorities also permit close family rel-
 atives of Greek Cypriots resident in the north to visit twice per month (it was once
 per month until 1996) and allow one overnight stay per month. As in the past,
 Turkish Cypriot authorities permit school holiday visits by children under the ages
 of 16 (male) and 18 (female) residing in the government-controlled area. This year
 700 grown children and grandchildren of Greek Cypriots living in the north visited
 the north and stayed overnight during the Christmas and New Year holidays. Simi-
 lar restrictions exist for visits by Maronite residents of the north to the government-
 controlled area and visits by Maronites living in the south to Maronite villages in
 the north, but they are applied much more loosely than restrictions on Greek Cyp-
 riots, and Maronite travel is relatively free.
 The case of Eleni Foka, a Greek Cypriot teacher in the north, attracted consider-
 able public attention. Foka alleged that she had been mistreated by Turkish Cypriot
 authorities, and she destroyed her "TRNC" identity card. Later, she was denied per-
 mission by Turkish Cypriot authorities to travel to the government-controlled area
 for medical attention unless she renewed her identity card. After several months,
 Foka was permitted to come to the south for medical treatment, but she has not
 been able to return to the north. Her case remains under discussion by Greek and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. In the meantime, both Foka and a retiring Greek Cyp-
 riot teacher have been replaced in the north by new Greek Cypriot teachers.
 Previously, persons of Greek Cypriot or Armenian origin, or even persons having
 Greek or Armenian names, faced considerable difficulties entering the north. In
 1995 the Turkish Cypriots instituted a new policy under which third country nation-
 als of Greek Cypriot origin would be permitted to visit the Turkish Cypriot-con-
 trolled areas. However, implementation of the procedures remains inconsistent, and
 several persons entitled to cross under the new guidelines were denied permission.
 The Turkish Cypriot authorities since 1995 no longer require Greek Cypriots resi-
 dent in the north to obtain police permits for travel to Famagusta or Nicosia. Mem-
 bers of the Maronite community living in the north need permits to travel in the
 north. While most obtain them without difficulty, the permit process allows authori-
 ties to restrict the Maronites' movements should they so desire.
 The Republic of Cyprus authorities permit only day travel by tourists to the
 northern part of the island. They have declared that it is illegal to enter Cyprus
 except at authorized entry points in the south, effectively barring entry into the gov-
 ernment-controlled area by foreigners who have entered Cyprus from the north. As
 a rule, Turkish Cypriot authorities allow visits to the north by persons who initially
 enter Cyprus in the south, but they have denied entry to persons 'of Turkish Cypriot
 origin who enter Cyprus in the south. Following the 1994 murder of the director
 of a Greek Cypriot association supporting Kurds in Turkey, the Greek Cypriot au-
 thorities placed significantly tighter controls on the movement of Turkish Cypriots
 to the south. Institutions and individuals sponsoring visits of Turkish Cypriots to
 the government-controlled areas must notify the police in advance and provide them
 with an exact itinerary.
 Following agreement in April on reciprocal visits to religious sites, the Cyriot
 Government permitted over 400 Turkish Cypriots to make a pilgrimage to a Moslem
 shrine in the south, the first such visit since 1974. However, later in April, a Greek
 Cypriot group of approximately 600 persons did not make the reciprocal visit to an
 Orthodox monastery in the north because of Turkish Cypriot demands that 3 names
 on the list of visitors be removed. In August Turkish Cypriot authorities permitted
 unhindered passage of 650 Greek Cypriots to the monastery for an Orthodox holy
 
 
 1050
 day. In November another group of approximately 1,200 Greek Cypriots was allowed
 to visit the monastery.
 In December 1996 the European Court of Human Rights ruled 11 to 6 that Tur-
 key had committed a continuing violation of the rights of a Greek Cypriot woman
 by preventing her fromgoing toher property lecatedin northern Cyprus. The ruling
 realirmed the validity of property deeds issued prior to 1974. The Court also found
 in this case that "it was obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active
 duties in northern Cyprus that the Turkish army exercised effective overall control
 there. In the circumstances of the case, this entailed Turkey's responsibility for the
 olicies and actions of the TRNC.'" A hearing by the Court on compensation was
 held on November 27, and a ruling is expected in 1998.
 In a similar development, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that
 a complaint by the Government of Cyprus against Turkey was admissible. The com-
 plaint alleged that Turkey was responsible for the detention of persons missing
 since the 1974 conflict and for depriving Greek Cypriots from the northern part of
 Cyprus of the use of their lands. The Commission's procedural ruling made no judg-
 ment on the merits of the case.
 The authorities respect the right to travel abroad and to emigrate. Turkish Cyp-
 riots have difficulty traveling to most countries because travel documents issued by
 the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" are recognized only by Turkey. Most
 Turkish Cypriots resort to utilizing Turkish travel documents instead.
 Although asylum legislation remains pending in the legislature, the Government
 of Cyprus regularly grants de facto first asylum. Cases are referred to the local of-
 fice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for evalua-
 tion. There were approximately 70 such cases in 1997. If applicants are found to
 meet the criteria for refugee status, they are permitted to remain and are given
 temporary work permits. Applicants are not, however, generally granted permanent
 ,resettlement rights on the grounds that the Government already has-enough respon-
 sibilities in caring- for those displaced after the 1974 Turkish intervention. Appli-
 cants are permitted to remain until resettlement in a third country can be arranged.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they fear
 persecution. In bath the north and the south, cooperation with U.N. refugee authori-
 ties is excellent. UNHCR is not aware of any cases of asylum seekers in the north
 in recent years.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Multiparty political systems exist throughout Cyprus. Under the Republic's Con-
 stitution, political parties compete for popular support actively and without restric-
 tion. Suffrage is universal, and elections are held by secret ballot. Elections for the
 office of president are held every 5 years and for members of the House of Rep-
 resentatives every 5 years or less. The small Maronite, Armenian, and Latin com-
 munities elect nonvoting representatives from their respective communities, in addi-
 tion to voting in elections for voting members. Since- the breakdown in 1963 of
 bicommunal governing arrangements, and since the 1974 partition of the island,
 Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area are barred from voting
 there, although they may travel to the north to vote in elections.
 Turkish" Cypriots living in northern Cyprus elect a leader and a representative
 body every 5 years or less. In 1995 Turkish Cypriot voters elected Rauf Denktash
 as their leader in elections deemed by observers to be free and fair. Greek Cypriots
 and Maronites living in the north are barred by law from participating in Turkish
 Cypriot elections. They are eligible-t vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must trav-
 el to the south toexercise that right. They also may choose their own village offi-
 cials, but those elected are not recognized by the Government of Cyprus.
 -In both communities, women face no legal obstacles to participating in the politi-
 cal process. While clearly underrepresented in government, they hold some cabinet-
 level, judicial, and other senior positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are organizations in both parts of the island that consider themselves
 human rights groups, but they generally are concerned with alleged violations of the
 rights of their community's members by the other community. Groups with a broad
 human rights mission include organizations promoting awareness of domestic vio-
 lence and others concerned with alleged police brutality.
 There are no restrictions preventing the formation of human rights groups. Rep-
 resentatives of international human rights organizations have access throughout the
 island.
 
 
 1051
 The United Nations, through the autonomous tripartit6 (United Nations, Greek
 Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot) Committee on Missing persons in Cyprus (CMP), is at-
 tempting to resolve the missing persons dilemma that remained from the intercom-
 munal violence beginning in 1963-64 and the 1974 Turkish military intervention.
 However, the CMP has made little progress. On July 31, the leaders of the Greek
 and Turkish Cypriot communities agreed to collect and share information on miss-
 ing persons by the end of September, outside of the CMP process. Although there
 was ultimately no exchange of information in September, both sides stressed their
 willingness to implement the agreement as rapidly as possible, and the collection
 of data continues. Meanwhile, the United States continued its efforts to, ascertain
 the fate of five American citizens missing since 1974.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Legislation in both communities provides for protection against discrimination
 based on sex, religion, or national, racial, or ethnic origin. While such laws are gen-
 erally respected by each community, significant problems remain with the treatment
 of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north and, to a lesser extent, with
 the treatment of Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area.
 Women.-Spousal abuse in the Greek Cypriot community is receiving increasing
 attention, and the problem is believed to be significant. A 1994 law aimed at making
 spousal abuse easier to report and prosecute has had little effect because key provi-
 sions remain unfunded and unimplemented. Many suspected cases of domestic vio-
 lence do not reach the courts, largely because of family pressure and the wife's eco-
 nomic dependence on her husband. An organization formed to address the domestic
 abuse problem reports an increasing number of calls over its hot line, although defi-
 nite statistics on the number of incidents are not available. A shelter for battered
 women is scheduled to open in early 1998. Very few cases tried in the courts result
 in convictions. There is little public discussion of domestic violence in the Turkish
 Cypriot community, although a report issued by the Women's Research Center-de-
 scribed such violence as common. A women's shelter opened in 1994. -Domestic vio-
 lence cases are rare in the Turkish Cypriot legal system since they are often consid-
 ered a "family matter."
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status as men. How-
 ever, under current Turkish Cypriot law, the man is legalry considered the head of
 the family and can decide the family's place of residence and insist that his wife
 take his name. Turkish Cypriot women are not permitted to marry non-Moslem men
 in Cyprus, but can do so outside Cyprus and then return with their husbands and
 live in the north without difficulty. While legal provisions in both communities re-
 quiring equal pay for men and women performing the same job are effectively en-
 forced at the white collar level, Turkish Cypriot women employed in the agricultural
 and textile sectors routinely are paid less than their male counterparts.
 In the Greek Cypriot community, women face discrimination that denies them the
 ability to pass on citizenship to their children if they marry foreign spouses. Under
 existing law, only a Greek Cypriot male may transmit citizenship to his children
 automatically or obtain expeditious naturalization for his foreign spouse.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, women face discrimination in divorce proceed-
 ings with regard td property acquired during the marriage. Divorced women also
 face a pervasive problem of inadequate awards of child support or nonpayment of
 child support. Legal remedies are difficult to obtain or enforce.
 Republic of Cyprus law forbids forced prostitution. However, credible reports con-
 tinue that women, generally East Asian or Eastern European night club performers,
 are forced into prostitution in the Greek Cypriot community. To date there have
 been few arrests since the women, fearing retaliation by their employers and unable
 to support themselves, generally do not press charges. Two employers were con-
 victed early in the year on charges of forcing women into prostitution and were sen-
 tenced to jail terms of 6 and 10 months respectively. In the Turkish Cypriot commu-
 nity, there are an estimated 300 to 350 women, mostly from Eastern Europe, work-
 ing as prostitutes. These women often must surrender their passports to the club
 owners and sometimes are prohibited even from making private phone calls.
 Reports on the mistreatment of maids are frequent in the Greek Cypriot press.
 These reports usually involve allegations that maids, often from East or South Asia,
 have been treated inhumanely by their employers or fired without cause in violation
 of their contracts. Many women do not complain to the authorities, fearing retribu-
 tion from their employers. Those who do file charges run the risk of being fired and
 then deported.
 Children.-Both the Government and the Turkish Cypriot authorities dem-
 onstrate a strong commitment to children's welfare. There is no pattern of societal
 
 
 1052
 abuse of children nor any difference in the health care and educational opportunities
 available to boys and girls.
 People With Disabilities.-In Cyprus generally, disabled persons do not appear to
 be discriminated against in education or the provision of state services. In the Greek
 Cyriot community, disabled persons applying for a public sector position are enti-
 tle to preference if they are deemed able to perform the required duties and their
 qualifications equal those of other applicants. Legislation also mandates that new
 public buildings and tourist facilities provide access for the disabled. In the Turkish
 Cypriot community, regulations reqire businesses to employ 1 disabled person for
 every 25 positions they fill,although enforcement is inconsistent. While there is in-
 creasing awareness of the issue, the Turkish Cypriot community has not yet enacted
 legislation to mandate access for the disabled to public buildings and other facilities.
 National IRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Both the Government of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot administration have constitutional or legal bars against discrimina-
 tion. The basic agreement covering treatment of Greek Cypriots and Maronites liv-
 ing in the north and Turkish Cypriots living in the south remains the Vienna Ill
 agreement signed in 1975. This document provides for voluntary transfer of popu-
 lations, free and unhindered access by the UNFICYP to Greek Cypriots and
 . Maronites living in the north and Turkish Cypriots living in the south, and facilities
 for education, medical care, and religious worship.
 * UNFICYP access to Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north remains
 -limited. There are no Greek-language educational facilities for Greek Cypriot or
 Maronite children in the north' beyond elementary education, forcing parents in
 * many-instances to choose between -keeping their children with -them or sending
 them to the south for further-education (in which case they may no longer return
 permanently to the north). Greek Cypriots living in the north complain of lack of
 access to telephones and vandalism -of Orthodox churches. Despite recent improve-
 ments, Greek-Cypriots and Maronites living in the north are unable to move about
 freely (see Section 2.d.) and-to.change their housing at will. Maronites in the north
 also lack many public services available in most other Turkish Cypriot areas. In
 May the Rapporteur of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly visited
 Greek Gypriots living in the north. The Rapporteur, Andras Barsony, stated that
 the conditions he found among these Greek Cypriots were "appalling," although he
 -said there had been improvements since the previous year.
 Some Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area face difficulties
 in obtaining identification cards and other government documents, especially if they
 were born after 1974. Turkish Cypriots also appear to be subjected to harassment
 and surveillance by the Greek Cypriot police. One Turkish Cypriot man was mur-
 dered in the south in August by unknown assailants. While authorities in the north
 alleged the man was targeted because he was Turkish, the evidence suggests that
 he was involved in criminal gang activities that led to his killing. A number of Turk-
 ish Cypriots who worked in the government-controlled area but did not live there
 lost their jobs following the August 1996 killing of two Greek Cypriots in the buffer
 .zone. The Cyprus Government, which stated it could not guarantee the safety of the
 Turkish Cypriot workers, provided 6 months of unemployment benefits to those liv-
 n   nthe mixed Greek Cypriot-Turkish Cypriot village of Pyla, but no one has been
 rhrd.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except for members of the police and
 military forces, have the legal right to form and join trade unions of their own
 choosing without prior authorization. In the government-controlled area, police offi-
 cers also have the right to join associations that have the right to bargain collec-
 tively, although not to strike. More than 82 percent of the Greek Cypriot work force
 belongs to independent trade unions. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of Turkish
 Cypriot private sector workers and all public sector workers belong to labor unions.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, union officials have alleged that various firms
 have been successful in establishing "company" organizations and then applying
 pressure on workers to join these unions. Officials of independent labor unions also
 have accused the Turkish Cypriot authorities of creating rival public sector unions
 to weaken the independent unions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has
 not-yet acted on these complaints. There are no complaints outstanding against the
 Government of Cyprus.
 In both communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on public pol-
 icy issues affecting workers and maintain their independence from the authorities.
 Two of the major trade unions, one in each community, are closely affiliated with
 political parties. Both of the other major unions are independent.
 
 
 1053
 All workers have the right to strike, and several strikes, usually of short duration,
 occurred. In the northern part of the island, however, a court ruling from 1978 gives
 employers an unrestricted right to hire replacement workers in the event of a strike,
 thereby limiting the effectiveness of the right to strike. Authorities of both the
 Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities have the power to curtail strikes
 in what they deem to be "essential services," although this right is rarely used.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus are able to affiliate with international trade union
 organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade unions and confed-
 erations by law are free to organize and bargain collectively throughout Cyprus.
 This right is observed in practice in the government-controlled areas, and most
 wages and benefits are set by freely negotiated collective agreements. However,
 Greek Cypriot collective bargaining agreements are not legally enforceable. In the
 rare instances when such agreements are believed to have been infringed, the Min-
 istry of Labor investigates the claim. If the Ministry is unable to resolve the dispute,
 the union may call a strike to support its demands. In practice, however, such al-
 leged violations are extremely rare; there was only one strike during the year.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, where inflation exceeded 80 percent during
 the year, wage levels are reviewed twice a year for private sector workers and six
 times a year for public sector workers, and a corresponding cost-of-living raise is es-
 tablished. A special commission composed of five representatives each from orga-
 nized labor, employers, and the authorities conducts the review. Union leaders con-
 tend that private sector employers are able to discourage union activity because en-
 forcement of labor and occupational safety regulations is sporadic and penalties for
 antiunion practices are minimal. As in the Greek Cypriot community, parties to a
 dispute may request mediation by the authorities.
 Small export processing zones exist in Larnaca Port and Famagusta, but the laws
 governing working conditions and actual practice are the same as those outside the
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is prohibited by law, and this prohibition is gen-
 erally observed.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Laws pro-
 hibit forced and bonded child labor, and these laws are effectively enforced in both
 the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities (see Section 6.c.). In both com-
 munities, the minimum age for employment of children in an "industrial undertak-
 ing" is 16 years of age. Turkish Cypriots may be employed in apprentice positions
 at the age of 15. There are labor inspectors in both communities. However, in fam-
 ily-run shops it is common to see younger children working after school, and accord-
 ing to press reports, children as young as 11 or 12 years of age work in factories
 or orchards during their school holidays in the Turkish Cypriot community.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legislated minimum wage in the Greek
 Cypriot community, which is reviewed every year, is approximately $448 (236 Cy-
 prus pounds) per month for shop assistants, practical nurses, clerks, hairdressers,
 and nursery assistants. This amount is insufficient to provide an adequate living for
 a worker and family. All other occupations are covered under collective bargaining
 agreements between trade unions and employers within the same economic sector,
 and the wages set in these agreements are significantly higher than the legislated
 minimum wage. The legislated minimum wage in the Turkish Cypriot area, while
 subject to frequent review because of high inflation, was approximately $210 per
 month as of mid-year. This amount is not adequate to support a worker and family.
 Unskilled workers typically earn about $267 per month, which is barely adequate
 to support a family.
 A significant percentage of the labor force in the north consists of illegal workers,
 mostly from Turkey. According to some estimates, illegal workers constitute as
 much as 25 percent of the total work force there. There are frequent allegations that
 such workers are subject to mistreatment, including nonpayment of wages and
 threats of deportation.
 In the Greek Cypriot community, the standard workweek in the private sector
 averages of 39 hours for white-collar workers and 38 hours for blue-collar workers.
 In the public sector, it is 371/2 hours during the winter and 35 hours in the summer.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, the standard workweek is 38 hours in winter
 and 36 hours in summer. Labor inspectors effectively enforce these laws.
 Steps were taken during the year to improve health and safety standards in the
 workplace in the government-controlled area. On January 1, a law-took effect har-
 monizing health and safety standards with those in the European Union (EU). The
 new law incorporates EUprinciples and standards for health and safety in the
 workplace and complies fully with the ILO Convention of 1981 on occupational
 
 
 1054
 
 health and safety. A second law entered into effect on November 1, requiring em-
 ployers to provide liability insurance coverage for work-related injuries.
 Occupational safety and health regulations are administered at best sporadically
 in the Turkish Cypriot area. In both areas, factory inspectors process complaints
 and inspect businesses in order to ensure that occupational safety laws are ob-
 served. Turkish Cypriot workers who file complaints do not receive satisfactory legal
 protection and may face dismissal.
