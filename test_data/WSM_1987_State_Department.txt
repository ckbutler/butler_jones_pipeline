 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa, a small Pacific island country with a population
 of around 163,000, is located approximately 1,600 miles
 northeast of New Zealand. It received independence from that
 country in 1962 and still looks to it as a model for its
 democratic practices and educational system. On receiving
 independence, it adopted a constitution proclaiming the nation
 to be an independent and sovereign state based on "Christian
 principles, and Samoan customs and tradition." The
 Constitution established a parliamentary democracy on the
 Westminster model but with certain concessions to Samoan
 cultural practices. It provides for a Samoan head of state, a
 unicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, protection
 of Samoan land and traditional titles, and guarantees of
 fundamental rights and freedoms. Executive authority is
 vested in a head of state, with the Government administered by
 a cabinet consisting of a prime minister and eight ministers
 chosen by the prime minister. All legislation passed by the
 legislative assembly needs the approval of the head of state
 before it becomes law. The'present Head of State, Maliefoa
 Tanumafili II, holds the position for life. His successors
 will he elected by the legislative assembly for 5-year terms.
 The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian but
 uniquely Samoan. A proud people, Samoans believe that all
 Polynesian people-trace their origins to Samoa. Traditional
 authority is vested in the matai (village chief or selected
 leader of an extended family). Each extended family, or aiga,
 has at least one matai, who is appointed by consensus of the
 aiga. Ownership of land is legally vested in the matai. It
 is the mat-ails responsibility to direct the economic, social,
 and political affairs of the aiga. There are 362 villages in
 Western Samoa with a total of over 12,000 matai. Each village
 is governed by a Fono or council of matai, which can fine or
 otherwise punish offenses against village rules.
 The economy is primarily agricultural and beset by many-of the
 problems of a developing country. It is particularly
 susceptible to shifts in world prices for its export
 commodities, such as coconut oil. Western Samoa is heavily
 dependent on foreign aid, particularly from New Zealand.
 There were no significant human rights problems in 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing

 opposition political organizations, does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no instances of political disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are prohibited by law, and there have been no
 reports of such practices.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 There are no political prisoners. The Constitution prohibits
 forced labor and there are no reports of its practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Western Samoan law assures the right to a fair public trial,
 and this right is honored. All charges are stated formally
 and clearly. Defendants are entitled to counsel. There are
 no special courts to deal with political or security offenses,
 and the judiciary is independent of government interference or
 influence.  Decisions of village matai about customary law
 are not subject to judicial review, but arbitrary or excessive
 punishments would be difficult to enforce.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the privacy of the people and does not
 permit arbitrary interference with the family, home, or
 correspondence. Both law and local custom provide for
 protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property
 without substantive and procedural safeguards, including
 search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are fundamental parts of the
 Constitution. They are respected in law and practice. The
 press is independent of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly
 and the right to form associations and unions. There-are no
 significant restrictions. While trade unions have not emerged
 in the private sector, the public service has an employee
 association which engages in collective bargaining. The
 Government has permitted efforts to develop unions in the
 country, and the courts have upheld the rights to strike and
 to enter into collective bargaining.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is ensured in the Constitution, along with
 freedom of thought and conscience. Each person has the right
 to change religions or belief and to worship or teach religion
 alone or with others. There is no government-favored religion.
 Nearly 100 percent of the population is Christian.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no controls upon citizens of Western Samoa regarding
 internal movement or resettlement. Foreign travel is
 unrestricted, and the right to return guaranteed. There are
 no refugees from or in Western Samoa.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Power in Western Samoa is vested i-n the Prime Minister and the
 Legislative Assembly. Under the Constitution, the Assembly is
 elected every 3 years. Forty-five of its members are elected
 by the approximately 12,000 village chiefs (matai), and the
 other 2 seats are filled by elections among those citizens who
 are not Samoan by heritage. Although there is some pressure
 for popular elections, this concept is seen by many as
 conflicting with "Fa'a Samoa" (the Samoan way). The existing
 system is viewed as democratic, in that the matai traditionally
 consult with their extended families before making decisions
 such as choosing among candidates for the Assembly. The matai
 system is conservative but does allow for change. While
 Samoans must show respect and obedience to their matai in
 family and communal affairs, the matai have well-defined
 responsibilities which, if not met, can result in removal.
 Western Samoa has only the rudiments of political parties.
 The most prominent political organization, the Human Rights
 Protection Party (HRPP), was founded in 1982. Its founder,
 Va'ai Kolone, is currently Prime Minister. Although a second
 party, the Christian Democratic Party (CDP), was formed
 shortly before the elections of February 1985, the political
 process in Western Samoa remains very much a function of
 personality rather than party. In recent experience,
 elections have occurred more frequently than the prescribed
 3-year cycle, primarily as a result of votes of no confidence.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 in the absence of allegations of abuse of human rights in
 Western Samoa, no international or nongovernmental bodies have
 conducted investigations. There are no official or private
 human rights organizations in Western Samoa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Samoan politics and culture are the product of a heritage of
 chiefly privilege and power, and persons of good family have
 certain advantages. Women traditionally occupy a subordinate
 role, though there are numerous female matai and women serve
 as members of the Legislative Assembly. The functioning of
 the matai system, including the democratic consensus method of
 selecting the matai themselves, tends to work against
 discrimination.
 The Samoan Constitution makes speciai provision to preserve
 the political rights of non-Samoans. Persons'of mixed
 ancestry who are culturally Samoan are fully accepted and can
 attain positions of considerable wealth and influence.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and Regulations of 1973
 established for the private sector a 40-hour workweek and a
 minimum wage of $0.25 an hour. It is illegal to employ
 children under 15 years of age except in "safe and light
 work." The law also establishes certain rudimentary safety
 and health provisions, such as a requirement for fencing
 around dangerous machine parts. Independent observers report,
 
 
 841
 WESTERN SAMOA
 however, that the safety laws are not enforced except when
 accidents highlight noncompliance and that many agricultural
 workers, among others, are inadequately protected from
 pesticides and other hazards because of limited employer
 awareness of occupational hazards.- Government education
 programs are addressing these concerns. The law does not
 apply to service rendered to the matai, some of whom require
 children to work at what might be considered child labor.
 Government employees are covered under different, more
 stringent regulations, which are adequately enforced.
