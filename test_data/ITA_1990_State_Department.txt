 ITALY.
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a
 parliamentary system of government. Legislative power is
 invested in the Parliament, which is directly and freely
 elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Executive
 -authority is vested in the Council of Ministers. Italy has an
 independent judiciary. The Chief of State, the President, is
 elected by Parliament and representatives of Italy's 20
 regions.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and righthas remained at
 low levels in recent years, due to the effective work of
 police and magistrates and terrorism's overwhelming rejection,
 by the.people as a whole. Although terrorism has yet to be
 completely overcome, its considerable reduction has freed
 increased law enforcement resources for the struggle against
 organized crime, which remains a serious problem.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy, which is among the
 world's largest. The economy is characterized by sizable
 government ownership in the primary industrial sectors and by
 a private sector whose small and medium-sized companies are
 especially dynamic.
 The year 1990 saw an increased amount of attention to the
 problem of racism, primarily against third-world immigrants.
 The problems of violence against women and children also
 continued to be raised. Nevertheless, the human rights
 situation in general continues to be good, and the trend
 toward more openness in dealing with- sensitive human rights
 issues, which was noted in 1989, has continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including-
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Neither government forces nor legal opposition organizations
 engage in these kinds of killing, and there were nQne in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of politically motivated disappearance or
 kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture'is provided for by law and respected in
 practice. Cruel and degrading punishment is forbidden by law,
 and violations were rare. There were no allegations of
 ill-treatment of prisoners during 1990. In January Italy
 ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture and
 Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or-Punishment.
 Amnesty International's 1990 Report (covering 1989} noted that
 ill-treatment of criminal suspects in police custody was
 alleged throughout 1989; several judicial inquiries opened in
 previous years into such allegations made slow progress (See
 Section l.e.).

 ITALY
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police procedures are carefully controlled by law and judicial
 oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced. Anyone
 detained by the authorities must be charged within 48 hours.
 In normal criminal cases, the maximum permissible duration of
 pretrial detention varies according to the gravity of the
 crime. Under reforms passed in 1989, the maximum time that
 any person may be held in pretrial detention, even for the
 most serious crimes, is 4 years, with no more than 2 years at
 each step of the trial and during the long appeals process.
 The Government has, on an extraordinary basis, issued decrees
 extending this period by 6 months in the case of persons
 detained for Mafia-type organized crimes.
 Lengthy pretrial detention remains a problem in Italy. As a
 safeguard against abuse, "liberty tribunals" are empowered to
 review evidence in cases of persons awaiting trial and to
 decide whether continued detention is warranted. In order to
 relieve the overburdened Italian judicial system, Parliament
 in April passed an amnesty law that freed persons serving
 prison terms of 4 years or less in connection with certain
 minor offenses committed before October 24, 1989.
 Exile abroad as a form of punishment is unknown, although the
 authorities have required persons convicted of Mafia-type
 offenses to move their residence from one partof Italy to
 another, the so-called " internal exile."
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair, public trial is assured by law and observed in
 practice in almost all cases. Counsel is provided for the
 accused, free of charge, if necessary. Good-faith efforts are
 made to guarantee the due process rights set forth above.
 However, trial procedures can often be cumbersome, with the
 result that trials frequently last an inordinately long time.
 A trial of 15 law enforcement agents in connection with the
 death of a suspect in a Mafia-related case in Sicily began in
 Palermo in 1985. The trial was later transferred to
 Caltanissetta and ended in 1989 with most of the defendants
 convicted and given mild sentences. Both the State and the
 defendants appealed, and the case continues in Caltanissetta.
 An effort was made to streamline the process with the
 enactment of a revised Code of Criminal Procedure, which
 entered into force in late 1989. The revisions to the code
 provide for a more "adversarial" system designed to result in
 speedier trials. However, unfamiliarity with the new system
 on the part of judicial authorities, coupled with
 infrastructural and bureaucratic problems, has led to
 disappointing initial results.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive, and there are
 no political or segurity courts. All cases may be appealed to
 the highest appellate court, the Court of Cassation. While
 there are no political prisoners, the Ministry of Defense
 indicated in October that some 63 conscientious objectors, all
 of them members of the Jehovah's Witnesses, were tried by
 military tribunals for refusing to do their military service,
 and received sentences averaging about 1 year, which
 corresponds to the time draftees must serve in the military.
 Italian law provides for punishment of up to 2 years in such
 cases.

 ITALY
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The concept of the privacy of the home is legally safeguarded
 and respected by the authorities. Searches and electronic
 monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant and
 in carefully defined circumstances.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and a free press are assured under Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows expression of a wide
 spectrum of political views. Although there is no censorship,
 publications may be seized for violation of obscenity laws or
 for defamation of state institutions. These powers are seldom
 invoked.
 Government-run radio and television are politicized at the
 administrative, level but are open to widely differing views.
 A large number of.private television and radio stations have
 been broadcasting since the early 1980's to provide
 competition for the state-owned broadcasting system. Public
 and private stations air vigorous debates on political and
 social issues. A lively parliamentary debate over the issue
 of media regulation highlighted public concern over issues
 such as the amount ofcommercialprogramming in the media and
 the potential for monopolistic concentration of power on the
 part of private-media concerns.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens freely exercise their right of peaceful
 assembly, which is limited only when the Government considers
 national security or public safety endangered. Permits are
 not required for meetings, but organizers of public
 demonstrations must notify the police in advance.
 Professional and employer associations organize and represent
 their constituencies freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Persons are free to profess and practice any religious faith.
 All religions are free to organize and proselytize within the
 limits-imposed by the laws governing public order. The
 Government has reached agreements with some religious groups
 to define their rights and standing.
 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church are governed
 by a 1984 agreement (Concordat) between the Italian Government
 and the Holy See, ratified in 1985. The agreement, which
 replaced the Concordat of 1929, recognizes the rights and
 place of Catholicism but no longer accords it the status of a
 state religion. The Roman Catholic church continues
 informally to enjoy special standing in Italy because of the
 presence of the Vatican and because the overwhelming majority
 of Italians are, at least nominally, Roman Catholic. However,
 the Italian State no longer provides subsidy payments to the
 Church. Legislation enacted in 1990 provides that the Church
 and clergy be supported-by voluntary contributions.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in the public
 schools as an optional subject. The Ministry of Education has
 yet to. solve a controversy over the issue of whether students
 
 
 1196
 ITALY
 who choose not to enroll in a religion course must study
 another subject in school in its place. The Constitutional
 Court's advisory opinion is that it would violate the
 students' rights to force them to do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad. Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed the right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship for political reasons. Although it
 does not normally offer permanent resettlement to political
 refugees, Italy has provided temporary haven for many persons
 fleeing persecution who are eventually resettled in third
 countries. There were no cases of forced repatriation of
 political refugees in 1990.
 Beginning in June, approximately 4,500 Albanian refugees who
 fled their country passed through Italy. Of these, 863 chose
 to stay in Italy. The Italian Government undertook to
 facilitate their assimilation, and some regional governments
 are providing assistance for employment, housing, health care,
 vocational training, and education.
 On February 28, the Parliament enacted legislation permitting
 citizens of countries outside the European Community (EC) to
 regularize their residency status by June 28, 1990. According
 to data provided by the Ministry of Interior, out of
 approximately 1,170,000 non-EC immigrants, 650,000 had
 regularized their status prior to the enforcement of the new
 legislation; some 220,000 regularized their status between
 February and June 1990; and 300,000 failed to regularize their
 status.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Italy has a free and democratic parliamentary system.
 Although the Constitution outlaws the Fascist party, a wide
 range of organized and active political parties exists from
 the far left to the far right of the political spectrum.
 Election campaigns are free and open, and voting is by secret
 ballot. The two chambers of Parliament and regional,
 provincial, and municipal councils are elected at regular
 intervals. Opposition groups are active and are frequently
 able to alter or reject government policies. There are no
 restrictions in law to the participation of women in
 government and-politics. Political and social customs result,
 however, in a lower percentage of participation by women than
 by men.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental organizations are free to investigate
 conditions in Italy, attend trials, and publish their findings.
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely in
 Italy. The Government actively promotes human rights around
 the world and participates fully in various international
 human rights organizations.
 
 
 1197
 ITALY
 Section 5' Discrimination Based on Race, Sex,' Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 German speakers in the Alto Adige region bordering on Austria
 have claimed for many years that they were discriminated
 against on the basis of language, particularly in legal
 proceedings and in the schools, and a recently enacted package
 of reforms is aimed at providing further protection for them.
 Italian speakers have complained that the new concessions to
 the German-speaking minority have in fact resulted in reverse
 discrimination. Italian speakers, who are a minority in many
 parts of the region, have'claimed that they are discriminated
 against in obtaining housing and employment. The gradual
 out-migration of Italian speakers from the area will make the
 achievement of a balance between the two ethnic groups more
 difficult in the future.
 According to the human rights committee of the Italian Prime
 Ministry, there were no major race-related incidents in Italy
 during the first half of 1990. Nevertheless, the levels of
 intolerance by northern Italians toward their fellow citizens
 from the south, and intolerance by Italians in general toward
 North Africans residing and working in Italy and the
 population of Gypsy origin, have increased during the last
 year. The media have reported instances of non-EC immigrants
 being denied jobs, and of protests by Italians when non-EC
 immigrants were given housing in Italian neighborhoods. The
 Immigration Law of 1990, which permitted illegal immigrants to
 regularize their status, gave immigrant workers equal rights
 in housing but did not provide funds for their housing. There
 has been no amendment to an earlier law that states that
 non-Italian workers cannot aspire to permanent resident status
 or citizenship. Thus legal immigrant workers are denied
 employment by the state sector, which employs about 15 percent
 of the total work force.
 A phenomenon on the 1990 Italian political scene was that of
 the so-called local leagues, grass-roots political groupings
 which espouse separatist and nationalist themes, some of which
 are widely perceived to have racist overtones. For example,
 the Lombard League supports strict limits on third-world
 immigrants and on the rights and benefits which those
 immigrants enjoy once in Italy. It also favors greater
 autonomy from the poorer regions of southern Italy, which are
 viewed.as culturally and ethnically distinct and allegedly
 inhibit the economic growth and development of the more
 prosperous north. In 1990 local elections, the leagues took
 up to 20 percent of the vote in parts of northern Italy.
 While some argue that this is a protest vote against the
 entire Italian political system, the racist element in some of
 the leagues' objectives has attracted much public attention.
 Italian authorities have stepped up efforts to integrate the
 Gypsy population into Italian society. Local administrations
 and communities have shown greater sensitivity to the need to
 ensure equal treatment of those who belong to "nomadic"
 groups, Italian citizens for the most part, and a number of
 initiatives are awaiting implementation. Many Italians
 consider Gypsies responsible for increased criminal activity
 during 1990. Approximately 4,000 Gypsies reside in the
 greater Rome area. Most of them live in precarious health and
 hygienic conditions. Despite the availability of funds, the
 
 
 1198
 ITALY
 Rome city government has not succeeded in coordinating
 programs to accommodate the Gypsy population, partly due to
 the massive protests by Roman families opposed to the idea of
 Gypsies camping in or near their neighborhoods.
 No major anti-Semitic incidents were registered in Italy as of
 June, but sporadic wall graffiti praising the superiority of
 the "Aryan race" appeared throughout the main cities of the
 country.
 The condition of women in Italy has improved greatly over the
 past 20 years. Women participate freely in political and
 social life, but, despite legal guarantees, employers continue
 to favor men over women in filling jobs, particularly those
 with prospects for advancement to management, due in part to a
 very protective maternity leave law. As of 1990, women
 constituted some 34 percent of the total labor force. Most
 women are employed in the service sector, with lesser
 percentages in industry and in agriculture. Only 3.3 percent
 of Italian managerial positions are held by women.
 Since 1963 it has been illegal to dismiss a female employee
 within 1 year of her marriage date except "for cause." Women
 enjoy equal rights with men in marriage. In the event of
 divorce, a woman is entitled to a share of the survivor's
 pension and any inheritance in the event of the death of her
 ex-husband. The property of a married couple is considered
 community property unless husband and wife agree to keep their
 property divided. All assets acquired prior to marriage are
 exempt from the community property provision. A June decision
 of the Court of Cassation held that the economically weaker
 spouse in a divorce proceeding is not entitled to an amount of
 alimony that would allow the same standard of living which
 existed during the marriage, but only an amount necessary for
 adequate support.
 Violence against women and children continued to attract
 governmental and media attention during 1990. Demands by
 women's groups for stiffer penalties against rapists also
 continued. Media tension also focused on the subjects of wife
 beating and child abuse.
 Most important women's rights groups are affiliated with
 political parties, and Italy does not have any important
 national women's rights groups independent of political
 parties or trade unions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Workers' Statute of 1970 provides for the right to
 establish a trade union, to join a union, and to carry out
 union activities in the workplace. Trade unions are not
 government controlled, and the Constitution fully protects
 their right to strike, which is frequently exercised. In
 practice, the three major labor confederations have strong
 ideological ties to the three major political parties and
 administer certain social welfare services for the Government,
 which compensates them accordingly. Moreover, the Workers'
 Statute favors the three confederations to the extent that it
 is difficult for small unions, including the so-called "base
 committees" (COBAS), to obtain recognition. In 1990, however,
 one of the COBAS, the Locomotive Engineers, finally was
 recognized and seated at the bargaining table.
 
 
 1199
 ITALY
 There are.,no government statistics on the percentage of
 workers organized. The unions themselves claim 30 percent,
 but the true figure may be just half that, as they count
 retired workers and-other group not usually regarded as
 active in the work force. Although there were numerous
 strikes of short duration in 1990, the total number of hours
 lost was less than in 1989. For the first time, a law
 restricting the right to strike in essential public services
 was passed in 1990. Italian unions engage freely and-actively
 in international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize and bargain collectively is
 protected by the Constitution and is freely practiced
 throughout the country. Labor-management relations are
 governed by legislation, custom, collective bargaining
 agreements, and labor contracts. A key element of
 labor-management-government, cooperation affecting the
 industrial relations climate has been the 1986 agreement on
 indexing wages (scala mobile) to the cost of living every 6
 months. National collective bargaining agreements de facto
 apply to all workers regardless of union membership.
 Collective bargaining at the national level (involving the
 three confederations, the public and private employers'
 organizations and, where appropriate,, the Government) occurs
 irregularly and deals with issues of universal concern,
 particularly the system of wage indexation. Sectoral
 negotiations, involving national-level industrial unions and
 employers' organizations, typically occur three times a.year
 and cover all aspects of labor relations that apply to all
 workers, ;ihether unionized or-not. Voluntary, nonbinding
 mediation is provided by the Ministry of Labor and is often
 effective in bringing labor and management together.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers
 against union members and organizers. A new law in 1990
 encourages workers in small enterprises (i.e., less than 16
 employees) to join unions and requires "just cause" for
 dismissals from employment. Italy has no export processing
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor, which is prohibited by law, does
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under current legislation, no child under 15 years of age may
 be employed (with some specified exceptions). The Ministry of
 Labor, having consulted with the labor organizations, may, as
 an exception, authorize the employment on specific jobs of
 children over 12 years of age. The minimum age is 15 for men
 employed in dangerous, fatiguing, and unsanitary work, and 16
 for men employed underground; in quarries, mines, and tunnels
 without mechanical vehicles; in weight lifting and carrying;
 in loading and unloading sulphur ovens in Sicily; and in
 occupations harmful to the workers' morale. No worker under
 18 years may be employed in driving and pulling trucks and
 carriages, or in jobs for the manufacture, handling, and
 salvaging of explosives. Minimum age and compulsory education
 laws (through age 14) are effectively enforced.
 
 
 1200
 ITALY
 No women, regardless of age, are permitted to be employed
 underground, in quarries, mines, or tunnels. Only women over
 21 are allowed to work in dangerous, fatiguing, and unsanitary
 jobs, on the cleaning and servicing of engines, or on moving
 machinery.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum work and safety standards are established by law and
 buttressed and extended in collective labor contracts. The
 Basic Law of 1923 provides for a maximum workweek of 48
 hours--no more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day. The
 8-hour day may be exceeded for some special categories. Most
 collective labor agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour
 week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours per day or an average
 of 12 hours per week.
 There is no minimum wage set under Italian law; basic wages
 and salaries are set forth in collective labor agreements.
 National collective labor agreements contain minimum standards
 to which individual employment agreements must conform. In
 the absence of agreement between the parties, the courts may
 step in to determine fair wages on the basis of practice in
 related activities or related collective agreements.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for
 compensation for on-the-job injury are set forth in an
 extensive body of law and regulations. In most cases, these
 standards are exceeded in collective bargaining agreements.
 Enforcement of health and safety regulations is entrusted to
 labor inspectors, an autonomous group within the Labor
 Ministry who have the same status as judicial police officers.
 Inspectors make periodic visits to companies to ensure
 observance of safety regulations. Violators may be fined or
 even imprisoned. Trade unions also play an important role in
 reporting safety violations to inspectors.
 The number of deaths from on-the-job accidents continued to
 rise, totaling 3,542 in 1989. Part of the problem is an
 inadequate number of inspectors. Due to high unemployment,
 there is also pressure on workers to accept unsafe conditions
 as a necessary evil if they need jobs. There are many
 substandard workplaces in Italy, especially in the south.
