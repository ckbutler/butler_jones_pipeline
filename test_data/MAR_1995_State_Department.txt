 MOROCCO
 The Constitution of Morocco provides for a monarchy with a Parliament and an
 independent judiciary. However, ultimate authority rests with the King, who retains
 the discretion to terminate the tenure of any minister, dissolve the Parliament, and
 rule by decree. The present Parliament was created in 1993 through a two-stage
 process: the election of 222 deputies by direct universal suffrage and selection of the
 remaining 111 deputies by labor organizations and other constituency groups. As in
 1994, King Hassan again attempted to incorporate the legal opposition into the Gov-
 ernment; once again, the major political parties declined to participate without far-
 reaching political reforms. Ultimately, the King formed a government comprised
 largely of technocrats who, with some changes, remained in office throughout 1995.
 The securi ty apparatus comprises several overlapping police and paramilitary or-
 ganizations. The border police, the national security police, and the judicial police
 are departments of the Ministry of Interior, while the Royal Gndarmerie reports
 directly to the palace. Security force abuses continued, especially in cases involving
 perceived threats to state security, albeit less frequently than in previous years.
 Morocco has a mixed  pnomy based largely on arculture, fishng, light industry,
 phosphate mining, tourism, andremittances from Moroccans working abroad. Illegal
 cannabis production is also a significant economic factor. Morocco's record of gen-
 erally strong economic growth, accompanied by low inflation and low fiscal and ex-
 teral deficits, has been challenged in recent years by a series of debilitating
 droughts and a slowdown in reform. Because of a severe drought-the third in 4
 years--analysts believe that the economy may contract in 1995.

 The Government made substantial progress on several human rights fronts dur-
 ing the year including fewer egregious abuses. A number of dissidents living in self-
 imposed exile took advantage of an amnesty program to return home. Although no
 details have yet been made public, the King launched an initiative to increase effec-
 tiveness and reduce corruption in the judicial system.
 However, there were several problem areas. The Government at times acted to
 suspend its citizens' rights of dueprcess, speech, and association; credible reports
 persisted of disappearances and ofocasional physical abuse of detainees and pris-
 oners by the security forces; and state agents responsible for past and present
 human rights abuses have not been held accountable by the weak and malleable ju-
 diciary. Prison conditions remain harsh. The Government has not acted to end the
 plight of youn girls who work in exploitative domestic servitude. It also failed to
 make promis    canges in the manipulation-prone electoral system. Discrimination
 and domestic violence against women are common.
 Virtually all allegations of governmental human rights abuse involve the Ministry
 of Interior. The Ministry is responsible for the direction of most security forces; the
 conduct of elections including cooperation with the United Nations in a referendum
 on the Western Sahara; the appointment and training of many local officials; the
 allocation of local and regional budgets; the oversight of university campuses; and
 the licensing of associations and political parties. Less formally, the Ministry exerts
 substantial pressure on the judicial system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Although no deaths of persons in po-
 lice custody could be conclusively attributedto security force brutality, at least two
 deaths under questionable circumstances remain unresolved. On January 23,
 Hamza Daghdugh died while in custody at police headquarters in Tangiers. Accord-
 ing to police officials, Daghdugh committed suicide, a claim which his family re-
 jected.    dough had noknown political affiliations.
 In March Mustapha Benderweesh died while a prisoner at Sale Civil Prison. His
 family alleged that the death was a result of torture and demanded an investiga-
 tion, which according to independent reports has not been carried out.
 Durn the ear, human rights groups speculated that a legal action brought by
 the AmIly of Mustapha Hamzaoui, who died in jail in 1993 under suspicious cir-
 cumstances, would unlikely proceed to trial.
 The nonpartisan Moroccan Organization for Human Rights (OMDH) published a
 report in January that alleged that 17 deaths took place during the period 1989
 though 1993 under circumstances strongly suggestive of torture.No public inquest
 has been conducted into any of these cases.
 b. Disappearance.-The practice of the forced disappearance of persons opposed
 the Government and its policies dates back several decades. Many were members
 of the military who were implicated in attempts to overthrow the Government in
 1971 and 1972. Others were Sabrawis, the natives of the Western Sahara, or Moroc-
 cans who challenged the Government's claim to the Western Sahara. To this day,
 hundreds of Saharan and Moroccan families still do not have any information about
 their missing relatives, many of whom have not been heard from for over two dec-
 ades.
 The Government denies that it has knowledge about most of those still missing.
 However, in recent years it has quietly released over 200 of the disappeared. Local
 human rights monitors have concluded that many others died while imprisoned at
 the notorious Tazmamaart Prison (see Section 1.d.). The Government has acknowl-
 edged 34 of those deaths and has provided death certificates to the families of all
 but one.
 There were reports of over 20 disappearances in 1995. Most were Sahrawis who
 disappeared in May following demonstrations in Laayoune advocating independence
 for the Western Sahara. The disappeared were presumably arrested after the pro-
 tests, but the Government has not released any information about their location or
 status.
 Moreover, local human rights monitors reported that four Islamists, Abdelkader
 Jouti, Abdelhamid Sadik, Mohammed Yachouti, and Abderrahim Bouabid, dis-
 appeared between August 30 and September 18. Jouti reportedly had been sen-
 tenced to life in 1985, had fled the country, and returned to Morocco from exile after
 the amnesty (see Section 1.d.). The Government has denied having any information
 about these men, who have had no contact with their families.
 The Ministry of Human Rights, a government body, has sought to make an ac-
 counting of many of the disappeared. It published a list of over 140 disappearances.
 
 
 1229
 Minity officials report that approximately 38 percent of these cases have been re-
 solved, and remaining cases are still being investigated.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Morocco ratified the U.N. Convention Agaist Torture in 1993. The Government
 claims that the use of torture has been discontinued, but newspapers and other
 sources report that security forces occasionally torture detainees. The fact that de-
 tainees are not allowed to have contact with family or lawyers during the first 48
 hours of detention (see Section 1.d.), increases the likelihood of torture and other
 abuse.
 Acording to local human rights advocates, one of the problems in documenting
 torture and other abuses is the fact that autopsies are not routine but are only car-
 ried out on the request of the state prosecutor and on the order ofa judge. The lack
 of autopsies indicates that there is inadequate followup investigations into deaths
 in custody and of allegations of torture and abuse.
 Amnesty Inte _rational (l) re.ports .that le abused Kada Benameur, a trade
 umonist arrested in Mari whnle particiaigin a peaceful st~-in. Her requests for
 a medical examination were also denied, despite reports that she appeared at her
 trisi with bruises on her face and hands. Three Sabrawi youths claimed they were
 tortured during pretrial detention (see Section i.e.).
 In nonstate security cases, witnesses report that some police officers abuse detain-
 ees with impunity. Harsh treatment continues after conviction, with state-security
 risoners more likely to be victimized. Accordingto reliable reports, prison gu=ard
 have suspended prisoners from a wall for several days as punishment for discipli-
 na   transgressions.
 There were no deaths attributable to harsh prison conditions, due in part to im-
 provements undertaken over the last few years at the suggestion of the Royal Con-
 iultative Council on Human Rights. Despite these improvements, however prison
 conditions remain harsh. In January there was a violent uprising at Khe.nifr Civil
 Prison by prisoners protesting inhumane conditions at the facility. The uprising was
 quickly put down by security forces, and several prisoners were hospitalized. At th e
 hospital, they began a hunger strike to continue their protest against prison condi-
 tions. At least one prisoner died, although press reports did not specify the cause
 of death. The leaders of the uprising were sentenced to an additional 4 to 5 years
 inprison.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exi!_e.- Legal prvisions for due process have
 been revised extensively in recent years, but the authorities frequently ignore them.
 Although police usually make arrests in public, they sometimes refuse to identify
 themseves and d not always obtain warrants. The law requires that detainees be_
 brought before a judge within 48 hours-extendable to 96 hours upon app rval of
 the prosecutor-and rnformed of the pending charges. Incommunica o (ardeavue)
 detention is limited to 48 hours, with a one-time 24-hour extension at the prosecu-
 toris  cretion.
 Although the accused should be brought to trial within 2 months of arrest, pros-
 eoutors may order five additional extensions of pretrial detention of 2 months each.
 Detainees are denied counsel during the initial period of detention when abuse is
 most likely to take place. Counsel is allowed only after cross-examination, but many
 cases are resolved before reaching that stage.
 Seine members of the security forces, long accustomed to indefinite precharge ac-
 cess to detainees, continue to resist the new rules. Lawyers are not always informed
 of th    e eof detention and thus are unable to monitor ompliance with the garde-
 a-vue detention limits.
 The law provides for a limited system of bail, but it is rarely used. Nevertheless,
 the courts sometimes release defendants on their own recognizance. The law does
 not provide for habeas corpus or its equivalent. Under a separate cde of military
 justice military authorities may detain members of the military without warrants
 or public trial.
 the Government continued to pay a small monthly stipend to the 28 former pris-
 oners who survived 18 to 20 years in solitary conimement at Tazmamaart prison-
 without health care or sanitary facilities. The 28 are former military men who had
 been arrested in connection with the failed coup attempts in 1971 and 1972. After
 their release, the Government prohibited them from speaking out publicly about
 their detention. In exchange, the Government gave the 28 assurances that it would
 help them find jobs and reintegrate them into society.
 Despite government warning and harassment, some of the former inmates have
 spoken openly about their experiences. Ahmed Marzouki, the unofficial leader of the
 group, has demanded that the Government increase their stipend. Security ogicers
 arrested him in August and detained him for 2 days. Osensibly, Marzouki was
 picked up for having collaborated with French journalists, but no formal charges
 
 
 1230
 
 were filed against him. His arrest is seen by other former 'disappeareds" as a warn-
 ing against agitating too publicly for official recognition and recompense.
 For weeks following the May demonstrations in Laayoune, Western Sahara, the
 Government denied that the security forces had arrested any Sahrawis. However,
 the police had detained scores of Sahrawi youths and eight of them were ultimately
 brought to trial (see Section I.e.).
 Afer nearly 6 years of house arrest, Abdessalem Yassine, leader of the banned
 Islamist movement Justice and Charity, was released in December. No charges were
 ever filed against Yassine. Although nominally free, Yassine still lives under certain
 restrictions. He is not allowed to make "political speeches* in a mosque, nor may
 he speak in the name of his still illegal organization, or use his home as its head-
 quarters. To protest these restrictions, Yassme has refused to leave his house.
 There are no known instances of enforced exile, but many dissidents live abroad
 in self-imposed exile. In 1994 the Government, as part of a broad-based amnesty,
 decreed that any such citizens would be welcome to return after taking an oath ac-
 knowledging the legitimacy of the monarchy and the nation's claim to the Western
 Sahara. In 1995 the Government discontinued use of the oath. Several prominent
 dissidents took advantage of the amnesty to return home.
 In 1991 Abraham Serfaty, a member of the Moroccan Communist Party and a
 supporter of Saharan independence, was released after 17 years in prison. Upon his
 release, the Government declared that Serfaty was a Brazilian rather than aMoroc-
 can citizen and expelled him from the country. The decision, which is based on the
 fact that Serfaty's father was a naturalized Brazilian citizen, has been widely criti-
 cized by human rights goups, who consider Serfaty a Moroccan exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trio.-In theory there is a single court system for all
 nonmilitary matters, but family matters such as marriage, divorce, child support
 and custody, and inheritance are adjudicated by judges trained in Islamic law or
 Shari'a. Judges considering criminal cases or cases in non-family areas of civil law
 are generally trained in the French legal tradition. All judges trained in recent
 years are graduates of the National Institute for Judicial Studies (INEJ) where they
 undergo 2 years of study heavily focused on human rights and the rule of law. Vir-
 tually none are lawyers.
 In general, detainees are arraigned before a court of first instance. If the infrac-
 tion is minor and not contested, the judge may order the defendant released or im-
 pose a light sentence. If an investigation is required, the judge may release defend-
 ants on their own recognizance. Cases are often adjudicated on the basis of confes-
 sions, some of which, according to reliable sources, are obtained under duress.
 A  courts are subject to extrejudicial pressures. Salaries for both judges and their
 staffs are extremely modest; as a result, petty bribery has become a routine cost of
 court business. In many courts, especiafly in minor criminal cases, defendants or
 their families pay bribes to court officers and judges to secure a favorable disposi-
 tion.
 A more subtle but pervasive corruption derives from the judiciary's relationship
 with the Ministry of Interior. Judges work closely with the Ministrys network of
 local officials, or caids, who serve as members of the judicial police and often assume
 personal responsibility for the questioning of criminal detainees. They also fre-
 quently prepare the written summary of an arrest and subsequent interrogation.
 The summary is admissible in court and may be the only evidence introduced at
 trial effectively rendering it an instruction passed from the caid's office to the court.
 Credible sources report that judges who expect enhanced remuneration and career
 progression do not stray far from the caid's guidance. Attorneys report that newly
 appointed judges, despite their training, are even more willing to profit from this
 arrangement than their predecessors.
 The law does not distinguish political and security cases from common criminal
 cases. In serious state security cases, communications between the Ministry of Inte-
 rior and the court are more direct. At the Government's discretion, such cases may
 be brought before a specially constituted military tribunal. This court is subservient
 to other branches of the Government, notably the military and the Ministry of Inte-
 rior.
 Aside from external pressures, the court system is also subject to resource con-
 straints. Consequently, criminal defendants charged with less serious offenses often
 receive only cursory hearings, with judges relying on police reports to render deci-
 sions. Although the Government provides an attorney at public expense for serious
 crimes (i.e., when the offense carries a maximum sentence of over 5 years), ap-
 pointed attorneys often provide inadequate representation.
 Responding in part to international criticism, the Government has undertaken ju-
 dicial and legal reforms in recent years. In the spring, the King launched an initia-
 tive to enhance the independence and integrity of the judiciary. Although the Min-
 
 
 1231
 ister of Justice presented the King with the recommended changes in August, no
 details of the proposed reform had been made public by year's end.
 In June eigt Sahrawi youths were put on trial for participating in a demonstra-
 tion in Laayoune, Western Sahara, calling for Western Saharan independence. Al-
 though the eight were civilians, they were tried in a military court in a closed trial
 that reportedlyr lasted 3 hours over a 3-day period. The court found the eight guilty
 of treatening the security of the state" and sentenced them up to 20 years in pris-
 on. The sentences were later commuted to 1 year by the King. At the trial, the de-
 fendants claimed that they had been tortured during pretrial detention and de-
 manded medical examinations. According to witnesses, three of the defendants re-
 moved their shirts during a court recess, revealing long cuts across their backs. An-
 other was unable to walk and said police had pummeled his right foot during ques-
 tioning. The court denied their request for medical examinations.
 The Minister of Human Rights has acknowledged that there are "about a hun-
 dred" political prisoners. This total coincides with figures published by the Moroccan
 Organzation o Human Rights, which estimates that some 110 non-Sahrawi politi-
 cal prisoners remain in prison. Of these, some 60 are Islamists. Estimates of the
 number of persons in prson for advocating independence for the Western Sahara
 vary from none to 700.
 . Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation
 may take place without a search warrant issued in compliance with the law. The
 law stipulates that a search warrant may be issued by a prosecutor on good cause.
 This stipulation is not always observed, however, and there continue to be reports
 of illegal searches of the homes and offices of suspected political activists.
 Government security services monitor certain persons and organizations, both for-
 eign and Moroccan, including their telephones and mail. Government informers also
 monitor activities on university campuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression, press freedom is significantly restricted, though the limits are not
 clearly defined.
 The Government owns the official press agency, Maghreb Arab Press, and the Ar-
 abic daily, Al Anbaa." A 1958 decree grants the Government the authority to reg-
 ister and license domestic newspapers and journals. In practice, authorities use the
 licensing process to prevent the publication of materials that they believe cross the
  dof tolerable dissent. 0ending pubications may be declared a danger to
 state security, may be seized, and the publisher's license may be suspended and
 equipment destroyed.
 Article 55 of the Press Code empowers the Government to censor newspapers di-
 rectly by ordering them not to report on specific items or events. In most instances,
 government control of the media generally is exercised through directives and "guid-
 ance" from the Ministry of the Interior. Nonetheless, the Government generally tol-
 erates satirical and often stinging editorials in the opposition parties' dalies. Both
 law and tradition prohibit criticism on three topics: the monarchy, Morocco's claim
 to the Western Sahara; and the sanctity of Islam.
 Ministry of Interior agents review both domestic and foreign publications before
 they are distributed. To avoid the Government's attention and possible sanctions,
 the media regularly engage in self-censorship.
 There were encouraging signs durin the year that the Government would loosen
 press restrictions. A June issue of eMonde Diplomatique contained a controversial
 article written by a royal family member and printed without permission from the
 royal palace. In a departure from past practice, the Government did not obstruct
 the puVblication and distribution of the issue. Also in June, the Government did not
 impede the distribution of an issue of the French weekly magazine Jeune Afrique
 that contained a cover story critical of the King and Morocco's domestic "crisis."
 However, there were some notable instances of censorship. In January an issue
 of the French weekly Maroc Hebdo was seized by Ministry of Interior officials. The
 weekly apparently did not obtain permission from the palace before publishing a
 speech made by a royal family member at Princeton University. In  ovember au-
 thorities banned distribution of an issue of Jeune Afrique that contained an article
 describing the King's illness and its effect on the Moroccan political scene. Distribu-
 tion of the magazine was suspended indefinitely.
 A broadcaster for the independent television station 2M was reprimanded and
 threatened with legal action by the Ministry of Interior after he aired views ques-
 tioning the credibility of casualty figures provided by the Government following Au-
 gust floods in the south of Morocco.
 
 
 1232
 Humorist Ahmed Snoussi ("Bziz"), Morocco's best-known political satirist, has
 been banned from performing in several cities, including Marrakesh and Larache.
 The Minister of Human Rights has been quoted as saying that "politics is fine, and
 humor is fine, but an amalgam of the two is not permissible." Bziz continues to per-
 form at private gatherings, and audio cassettes of his performances are widely sold.
 The Uovernment owns the only television station receivable nationwide without
 decoder or satellite dish antennas. Dish antennas are available on the market and
 permit free access to a wide variety of foreign broadcasts.
 Morocco's sole private station can be received in most urban areas with the rental
 of an inexpensive decoder. Residents in the north can receive Spanish broadcasts
 with standard antennas. The Government does not impede the reception of foreign
 broadcasts.
 The universities enjoy relative academic freedom in most areas. The Ministry of
 Interior controls the curriculum in the faculty of Law and the hiring of instructors,
 as well as the physical plant, including residences, in all faculties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly and association, these rights are significantly limited
 by three decrees--dating from 1935, 1939, and 1958-that permit the Government
 to suppress even peaceful demonstrations and mass gatherings. Most conferences
 and demonstrations require the prior authorization of the Ministry of Interior, os-
 tensibly for security reasons.
 In May a peaceful demonstration calling for independence for the Western Sahara
 territory was broken up by security forces. Scores of protesters were arrested, and
 8 were tried and sentenced to 20 years in prison for threatening state security (see
 Section 1.d.).
 In September members of the Association of Unemployed University Graduates,
 an unofficial organization not sanctioned by the Government, demonstrated in El
 Jadida against high unemployment and alleged government inaction. Police broke
 up the demonstration, reportedly causing numerous injuries. Twenty-six of the dem-
 onstrators were originally sentenced to 6 months in prison, which was later over-
 turned upon appeal. After an 11-day sit-in in Rabat, the organization received prom-
 ises of meetings with government officials to find ways to solve their unemployment
 problem, but no promises of jobs.
 The right to form organizations is limited. Under a 1958 decree, persons wishing
 to create an organization must obtain the approval of the Ministry of the Interior
 before holding meetings. In practice, the Ministry uses this requirement to prevent
 persons suspected of advocating causes opposed by the Government from forming
 legal organizations. Islamist and leftist groups have the greatest difficulty in obtain-
 ing official approval, although there are 29 active Islamist groups. The Government
 has prohibited membership in two of these groups, Justice and Charity and Jama'a
 Islamia, due to their perceived anti-monarchy rhetoric. Political parties must also
 be approved by the Ministry of the Interior which uses this power to control partici-
 pation in the political process.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. Ninety-nine percent of Mo-
 roccans are Sunni Muslims, and the King bears the title "Commander of the Faith-
 ful." The Jewish community of approximately 6,000 is permitted to practice its faith,
 as is the somewhat larger foreign Christian community.
 The Ministry of Islamic Affairs monitors Friday mosque sermons and the Koranic
 schools to ensure the teaching of approved doctrine. The authorities sometimes sup-
 press the activities of Islamic fundamentalists, but generally tolerate activities lim-
 ited to the propa ation of Islam, education, and charity. Security forces commonly
 close mosques to the public shortly after Friday services to prevent use of the prem-
 ises for unauthorized political activity.
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of worship, only Islam  Christian-
 ity, and Judaism are tolerated in practice. The King has pronounced al other reli-
 gions to be heresies. The Baha'i community of 150-200 people has been forbidden
 to meet or hold communal activities since 1983. Islamic law and tradition call for
 strict punishment of any Muslim who converts to another faith. Any attempt to in-
 duce a Muslim to convert is similarly illegal. Foreign missionaries either limit their
 proselytizing to non-Muslims or conduct their work quietly.
 On January 9, the Government released Gilberto Orellan, a Salvadoran citizen,
 from prison, deported him, and banned him from reentering Morocco. Orellan was
 arrested in December 1994 and sentenced along with two Moroccan citizens for
 "preaching Christianity among Muslims." During their search of Orellan's residence,
 the police reportedly confiscated Bibles and Christian magazines.
 On September 15, a court sentenced Jama Alt Bakrim to 1 year in for disturbing
 the Islamic religion and breaking the fast during the Islamic holy month of Rama-
 
 
 1233
 dan. However, some observers alleged that Bakrim's actual offense is that he re-
 peatedly spoke about Christianity in public.
 On August 5, Mehdi Ksara, who was 88 years old at that time, was arrested and
 imprisoned along with three other Moroccan men on charges related to their prac-
 tice of Christianity. All four were released on August 17. Ksara was formerly a Mus-
 lim and reportedly converted to Christianity more than 60 years ago. The three
 other men are Fouad Jaafar, 27, Muhsin Ibrahim Bel Haj, 20, and Samir Ben All,
 24. One of the three was a Muslim who was reportedly arrested after the authorities
 discovered a Bible in his possession.
 In another case, an American family was detained by police for carrying banners
 with evangelical Christian slogans through the streets of Casablanca. On searching
 their residence, the police seized the evangelical materials. The family was quickly
 released and deported.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although freedom of movement is provided in the Constitution, in prac-
 tice security forces set up roadblocks throughout the country and stop traffic at will.
 In some regions the roadblocks have been maintained in the same places for years,
 creating what some characterize as internal frontiers. There were widespread com-
 plaints of police harassment and demands for monetary payments. Algerian nation-
 als are routinely stopped for questioning at each roadblock.
 In the Morocco-administered portion of the Western Sahara, movement is re-
 stricted in areas regarded as militarily sensitive.
 The Ministry of Interior restricts freedom to travel outside Morocco in certain cir-
 cumstances. OMDH, a human rights group, released a list of 42 people who have
 reportedly been denied passports. In response the Minister of Interior reportedly in-
 dicated that the Government has the right to deny a passport to whomever it wants.
 Some former political prisoners, after being issued passports, were denied exit at
 border points on the ostensible basis that government computers had not been
 changed to reflect their eligibility to leave. All civil servants must obtain written
 permission from their ministries to leave the country.
 In 1995 the Government acknowledged for the first time the right of women to
 obtain a passport and travel abroad independently. Previously, women were re-
 e to obtain the onsent of husbands or fathers before applying for a passport.
 Moroccans may not renounce their citizenship, but the King retains the power-
 rarely used-to revoke it. Tens of thousands of Moroccans hold more than one citi-
 zenship and travel on passports from two or more countries. While in Morocco they
 are regarded as Moroccan citizens. As a result, the Government has sometimes re-
 fused to recognize the right of foreign embassies to act on behalf of dual nationals
 or even to receive information concerning their arrest and imprisonment. Dual na-
 tionals also complain of harassment by immigration inspectors.
 The law encourages voluntary repatriation of Jews who have emigrated. Moroccan
 Jewish emigres, including those with Israeli citizenship, freely visit Morocco. The
 law also encourages the return of Sahrawis who have departed Morocco due to the
 conflict in the Western Sahara-provided they recognize the Government's claim to
 the region. The Government does not permit Saharan nationalists who have been
 released from prison to live in the disputed territory. The Government cooperates
 with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 Practically speaking, citizens do not have the right to change their national gov-
 ernment by democratic means. The King, as Head of State, appoints the Prime Min-
 ister, who is the titular head of government. The Parliament has the theoretical au-
 thority to effect change in the system of government, but has never exercised it.
 Moreover, the Constitution may not be changed without the King's approval. The
 Ministry of Interior appoints provincial governors and local caids. Municipal coun-
 cils are elected.
 Constitutional changes in 1992 authorized the Prime Minister to nominate all
 government ministers, but the King has the power to replace any minister at will.
 y significant surrender of power from the Crown to the Prime Minister's office
 was further diluted when the King transferred to the secretaries general, who serve
 at the King's pleasure, many of the powers previously vested in the ministers.
 Allegations of fraud and manipulation in the 1993 parliamentary election are still
 pendig before the Constitutional Council, the designated body adjudicating the dis-
 putes. Challenges have been filed for more than 100 of the 333 seats in Parliament.
 Although approximately 20 reelections have been ordered and carried out-often
 
 
 1234
 
 with new credible allegations of irregularity-human rights groups do not expect the
 Council to adjudicate the remaining cases.
 Eleven parties have members in-Parliament. As in 1994, a coalition of major par-
 ties again declined the King's invitation to accept ministerial posts-absent signifi-
 cant political and electoral reform. As a consequence, most present ministers are
 technocrats named by the King as caretakers pending the formation of a longer-
 term government.
 There are no women ministers, and there are only two women in parliament, both
 elected in 1993.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest gation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are three officially recognized nongovernmental human rights gups: the
 Moroccan Human Rights Organization, the Moroccan League for the Defense of
 Human Rights (LMDH), and the Moroccan Human Rights Association (AMDH). A
 fourth group, the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights (CDDH), was formed
 in 1992 by former AMDH members. LMDH, associated with the Istiqlal Party, and
 AMDH, associated with the Party of the Socialist Avant Garde, have formed a co-
 ordinating committee and generally issue joint communiques. The LMDH and the
 OMDH have participated in some activities of the Royal Consultative Council on
 Human Rights. However, the OMDH refuses to have any business dealings with
 current Minister of Human Rights.
 The Royal Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCDH), an advisory body to
 the King, exists in sometimes uneasy coordination with the Ministry of Human
 Rights, which was established by Parliament. While their common mission has in
 the past provoked an adversarial relationship, a clearer division of labor emerged
 last year with CCDH issuing advice on matters such as prison reform, and the Min-
 istry of Human Rights, exercising a principally executive role. CCDH was largely
 inactive throughout 1995.
 Amnesty International (AI) has local chapters in Casablanca, Rabat, and Marra-
 kech. These chapters participated in AI international letter campaigns outside Mo-
 rocco.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although Article 5 of the Constitution states that all citizens are equal, non-Mus-
 lims and women face discrimination in the law and in traditional practices.
 Women.-The law and social practice concerning violence against women reflects
 the importance society places on the honor of the family. The Criminal Code in-
 cludes severe punishment for men convicted of rape or violating a woman or a girl.
 The defendants in such cases bear the burden of proving their innocence. However,
 sexual assaults often go unreported because of the stigma attached to the loss of
 virginity. A rapist may be offered the opportunity to marry his victim in order to
 preserve the honor of the victim's family. The law is more lenient toward men with
 respect to crimes committed against their wives; for example, a light sentence or
 reprimand may be accorded a man who has murdered his wife after catching her
 in the act of adultery.
 The civil law status of women is governed by the Mouduwana, or Code of Per-
 sonal Status, which is based on Islamic law.
 Spousal violence is com mn. Although a battered wife has the right to complain
 to the police, as a practical matter she would do so only ifprepared to bring crimi-
 nal charges. Physical abuse is not a legal basis for divorce. Hence few victims report
 abuse to the authorities.
 Women suffer various forms of legal and cultural discrimination. Under the
 Criminal Code, women are generally accorded the same treatment as men, but this
 is not the case for family and estate law, which is based on the Malikite School of
 Islamic Law. Under this law, husbands may more easily divorce their wives than
 vice versa. Women inherit only half as much as male heirs. Moreover, even where
 the law guarantees equal status, cultural norms often prevent a woman from exer-
 cising those rights. When a woman inherits property, for example, male relatives
 may pressure her to relinquish her interest.
 In cases where a husband files for divorce without legal justification, the wife is
 entitled to unspecified allowance rights based on the husband's income. The law
 states that a woman must be informed of her husband's intention to divorce her or
 to marry another woman. However, the cases where women have the right to ask
 for a divorce are limited. Sometimes in asking for a divorce, women take the risk
 of losing the economic benefits included in the marriage contract. Due to these eco-
 nomic reasons, as well as to social stigma, women rare ly request a divorce.

 While many well-educated women pursue careers in law, medicine, education, and
 government service, few make it to the top echelons of their professions. Women
 comprise approximately 35 percent of the work force with the majority of them in
 the industrial, service, and teaching sectors. The illiteracy rate for women is 78 per-
 cent, compared to 51 percent for men.
 Women in rural areas suffer most from inequality. Rural women perform most
 hard physical labor, the rate of literacy, particularly in the countryside, is signifi-
 cantly lower for women than for men. Girls are much less likely to be sent to school
 than are boys. Women who do earn secondary school diplomas, however, have equal
 access to university training.
 Children.-The Government continued a campaign to vaccinate children against
 preventable disease. However, the Government has taken little action to end child
 labor (see Section 6.d.). Young girls in particular are exploited as domestic servants.
 Orphanages are often party to the practice of adoptive servitude, in which families
 adopt young girls who perform the duties of domestic servants in their new families.
 Credible reports of physical abuse are widespread. The practice is often rationalized
 as a 'better alternative" to keeping the girls in orphanages. It is ingrained in soci-
 ety, attracts little criticism, even from human rights groups, and is unregulated by
 the Government.
 Another problem facing orphans of both sexes is lack of civil status. Normally,
 men are registered at local government offices; their wives and unmarried children
 are included in this registration, which confers civil status. Civil status is necessary
 to obtain a birth certificate, passport, or marriage license. If a father does not reg-
 ister his child, the child is without civil status and the benefits of citizenship. It is
 possible for an individual to self-register, but the process is long and cumbersome.
 Religious Minorities.-Although there is no institutional discrimination against
 the country's small Jewish and Christian communities, Christians face legal pros-
 ecution if they engage in proselytizing (see Section 2.c.).
 People With Disabilities.-A high incidence of disabling disease, especially  o
 has produced a large population of disabled persons. While the Ministry of M  a
 Affairs contends that the Government endeavors to integrate the disabled into soci-
 ety, in practice this is let largely to private charities. However, charitable special
 education programs are priced beyond the reach of most families. Most typically,
 disabled persons survive by begging. The Government continued a pilot training
 program or the blind sponsored in part by a member of the royal family. There are
 no laws mandating physical changes to buildings to facilitate access by the disabled.
 National lRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution affins, and the Govern-
 ment respects, the legal equality of all citizens. The official language is Arabic. The
 languages of instruction and the news media are both Arabic and French. Science
 and technical curriculums are taught in French, thereby eliminating the large
 monolingual Arabic-speaking population from these programs. Educational reforms
 in the past decade have stressed the use of Arabic in secondary schools. Failure to
 similarly transform the university system has functionally disqualified many stu-
 dents, especially those from poorer homes where French training is not practicable,
 from higher education in lucrative fields.
 Some 60 percent of the population claim Berber heritage. Berber cultural groups
 contend that the three remaining Berber languages and Berber traditions are rap-
 idly being lost. Their repeated requests  the Palace to permit the teaching of Ber-
 ber languages in the schools have finally produced a royal decree to effect the nec-
 essary curriculum changes.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although workers are free to establish and join trade
 unions, the unions themselves are not completely free from government interference.
 Perhaps half a million of Morocco's 9 million workers are unionized in 17 trade
 union federations. Three federations dominate the labor scene: the Union Marocain
 de Travail (UMT), the Confederation Demcratique de Travail (CDT), and the Union
 Gnerale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). The UMT has no political affiliation,
 but the CDT is linked to the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and the UGTM to
 the Istiqlal Party.
 In practice, the internal intelligence services of the Ministry of Interior are be-
 lieved to have informants within the unions  who monitor union activities and the
 election of officers. Sometimes union officers are subject to government pressure.
 Union leadership does not always uphold the rights of members to select their own
 leaders. There has been no case of the rank and ifie voting out its current leadership
 and replacing it with another.

 Workers have the right to strike and do so. Work stoppages are normally intended
 to advertise grievances and last 24 hours or less. The spring saw a wave of limited
 duration strikes in schools, flour mills, banks, and the port of Casablanca.
 A strike by UMT unionists at a food processing plant in Sidi Slimane in March
 led to police intervention and the arrest of six unionists. Although three were quick-
 ly released, the other three, including Khadija Benameur, the woman who heads
 UMT Chapter Three, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 month to a
 year. Benameur was found guilty of "violating the sacred institutions of the State"
 and "interfering with the right to work," an article of the penal code frequently in-
 voked against strikers (see Section 1.c.).                     .     .      .
 In May a dispute over a holiday bonus for the 14,700 workers of the National
 Railroad turned into a 2-month work stoppage which severely disrupted train traffic
 in the country. It was the first time in at least 3 years that a maor Moroccan indus-
 t  was .affected by a strike featuring near-unversal worker participation.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is implied in the constitutional provisions on the right to strike
 and the right to join organizations. Trade union federations compete among them-
 selves to organize workers. Any group of eight workers may organize a umon and
 a worker may change union affiliation easily. A work site may contain several inde-
 pendent locals or locals affiliated with more than one labor federation.
 In general the Government ensures the observance of labor laws in larger compa-
 nies and in the public sector. In the informal economy, and in the textile and handi-
 crafts industries, both the Government and management routinely ignore labor laws
 and regulations. As a practical matter, unions have no judicial recourse to oblige
 the Government to enforce labor laws and regulations.
 The laws governing collective bargaining are inadequate. Collective bargaining
 has been a long standing tradition in some parts of the economy, but the practice
 is not spreading. The wages and conditions of employment of unionized workers are
 generally set in discussions between employer and worker representatives. However,
 wages for the vast majority of workers are unilaterally set by employers.
 Employers wishing to dismiss workers are required by law to notify the provncial
 governor through the labor inspector's office. In cases where employers plan to re-
 place dismissed workers, a government labor inspector provides replacements and
 mediates the cases of workers who protest their dismissal. Any worker dismissed
 for committing a serious infraction of work rules is entitled by law to a court hear-
 mthere is no law specifically prohibiting anti-union discrimination. Employers com-
 moniy dismiss workers for umon activities regarded as threatening to employer in-
 terests. The courts have the authority to reinstate such workers, but are unable to
 ensure that employers pay damages and back pay.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors serve as investigators and conciliators in labor dis-
 putes, but they are few in number and do not have the resources to investigate all
 cases. Unions have increasingly resorted to litigation to resolve labor disputes.
 The labor law applies equally to the small Tanger export zone. The proportion
 of unionized workers in the export zone is about the same as in the rest of the econ-
 omy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention 29, which was
 adopted by royal decree.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Abuse of the child labor laws is
 common. The law prohibits the employment or apprenticeship of any child under 12
 years of age. Education is compulsory for children between the ages of 7 and 13.
 Special regulations cover the employment of children between the ages of 12 and
 16. In practice, children are often apprenticed before age 12, particularly in the
 handicraft industry. The use of minors is common in the rug-making industry and
 also exists to some extent in the textile and leather goods industries. Children are
 also employed informally as domestics and usually receive little or no wages. Safety
 and health conditions as well as salaries in enterprises employing children are often
 substandard.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors are responsible for enforcing child labor regulations
 which are generally well observed in the industrialized, unionized sector of the econ-
 omy. However, the inspectors are not authorized to monitor the conditions of domes-
 tic servants.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is approximately $177
 (1510 dirhams) per month in the industrialized sector and approximately $8.65
 (73.60 dirhams) per day for agricultural workers. Neither provides a decent stand-
 
 
 1237
 ard of living for a worker and his family-even with government subsidies for food,
 diesel fuel, and public transportation. In many cases, several family members com-
 bine their income to support the family. Labor unions advocate an increase in the
 minimum wage to about $220 per month. Most workers in the industrial sector earn
 more than the minimum wage. They are generally paid between 13 and 16 months'
 salary, including bonuses, each year.
 The minimum wage is not enforced effectively in the informal and handicraft sec-
 tors, and even the Government pays less than the minimum wage to workers at the
 lowest civil service grades. To increase employment opportunities for recent grad-
 uates, the Government allows firms to hire them for a limited period at less than
 the minimum wage.
 The law provides for a 48-hour maximum workweek with not more than 10 hours
 any single day, premium pay for overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and
 minimum conditions for health and safety, including the prohibition on night work
 for women and minors. As with other regulations and laws, these are not univer-
 sally observed in the informal sector.
 Occupational health and safety standards are rudimentary, except for a prohibi-
 tion on the employment of women in certain dangerous occupations. Labor inspec-
 tors endeavor to monitor working conditions and accidents, but lack sufficient re-
 sources.
