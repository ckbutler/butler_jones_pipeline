 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 A member of the Commonwealth of Nations, St. Vincent and the
 Grenadines is a parliamentary democracy with an established
 tradition of respect for the rights of the individual. After
 defeating the incumbent St. Vincent Labor Party in 1984
 elections, James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Party won
 all 15 parliamentary seats in general elections held in May
 1989. Although some concern was voiced about the absence of
 any parliamentary opposition, the elections were judged to be
 free and fair.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the
 country, includes a coast guard and a small Special Service
 Unit-with some paramilitary training. The force is controlled
 by and responsive to the civilian Government and traditionally
 maintains standards of professionalism that place a high value
 on respect for human rights. In 1991, however, there was a
 public demand, led by the major opposition political party, for
 the resignation of Police Commissioner Toussaint, who was
 alleged to have been involved in various criminal activities.
 An official, one-man commission of inquiry was assigned by the
 Government to investigate allegations of corruption and other
 misconduct, but did not find any evidence against the
 Commissioner. On December 23, 1991, Prime Minister Mitchell
 announced the reinstatement of Commisioner Toussaint, but the
 issue remains controversial.
 St. Vincent has a young population, a relatively high rate of
 illiteracy, and serious unemployment, possibly as high as 35
 percent. St. Vincent's major export product is bananas, which
 also represents the major source of foreign exchange earnings.
 St. Vincent has embarked on a path of nontraditional economic
 diversification, with some success in new agricultural products
 and in industrial sectors.
 Citizens of St. Vincents have and exercised a wide range of
 freedoms and rights in 1991 although the administration of
 justice is weak, including the treatment of the prisoners by
 law enforcement officials'.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Human rights groups and the Vincentian media called for a
 further investigation into the June 27 shooting of a
 21-year-old man by police in St. Vincent's capital city of
 Kingstown. A coroner's inquest was held, but the jury ruled
 that it was misadventure on the part of the policeman, and that
 he was not guilty of criminal activity. This was not an
 isolated incident, as several people were killed by police in
 1991.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, and there were
 no reports of such practices in 1991.
 However, a very high percentage of convictions (estimated at 95
 percent by the regional group Caribbean Rights) are based on
 confessions in St. Vincent. This has led to credible charges
 that harsh treatment by law enforcement officials during
 incarceration is used to extract confessions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 According to the Constitutior., persons detained for'criminal
 offenses must be provided legal representation and have their
 cases reviewed promptly. However, there is a serious delay in
 hearing cases and a large backlog of cases pending, including
 preliminary inquiries, coroner's inquests, and appeals, This
 slow administration of justice is due to the presence of only
 one judge, plus one appointed on a part-time basis.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials before 'an
 independent and impartial court. Criminal defendants are
 entitled to select their own legal counsel; alternatively, if
 the defendant is indigent, counsel may be provided by the
 court. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty
 and may appeal cases to a. regional high court system and
 ultimately to the Privy Council in London. There are no
 separate security or military court systems.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or
 other government intrusions into the private life of individual
 citizens. In 1991 there were no reports of such abuses.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. There are two major newspapers and numerous smaller,
 partisan publications; all are privately owned, and most are
 openly critical of the Government's policies. In general, the
 Government does not censor or otherwise interfere with the
 operation of the press. In 1990, however, the Government
 withdrew its own advertisements and official notices from the
 country's leading newspaper to protest the newspaper's critical
 treatment of government officials. In 1988 the
 government-owned radio station canceled a program that the
 Government considered provocative; the station, with the
 Government's approval, agreed late in 1989 to reinstate the
 program, but, as of the end of 1991, the program had not been
 reinstated. The Government heavily supervises the content of
 the station's programming, a fact which is often noted by
 opposition political parties.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and are
 respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are free to practice and proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Notwithstanding the New Democratic Party's clean sweep of all
 15 parliamentary seats in the May 198S elections, St. Vincent
 has a genuine multiparty political system, with four active
 parties. In the previous election the opposition garnered over
 30 per cent of the total vote, but failed to earn a majority of
 votes in any single constituency, needed in order to win a
 seat. Although Prime Minister Mitchell's commanding majority
 and high visibility in society have obscured opposition
 political activity, there is nothing in legislation or practice
 to prevent a change in government to favor the opposition.
 Constitutionally, elections must be held at'least every 5
 years, by secret ballot, with universal suffrage.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often
 comment on human rights matters of local concern. The St.
 Vincent Human Rights Association closely monitors government
 and police activities, especially in the area of treatment of
 prisoners, publicizing any cases of abuse. In 1990 it
 published a booklet on the administration of justice in St.
 Vincent and the Grenadines which focused on the delay in the
 court system and offered a number of recommendations. The
 Government's response was to appoint-an additional (part-time)
 judge.
 The Government is generally responsive to public and private
 inquiries about its human rights practices.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under law
 regardless of race, sex, or religion, and the Government
 adheres to this provision. In 1989 the Government took a
 significant step forward in terms of wage scales for women by
 adopting a new minimum wage law calling for equal pay for equal
 work. The law went into effect during 1990.
 Violence against women occurs in St. Vincent, but there are no
 studies indicating its extent. Penalties for violent crimes
 against women are identical to those involving acts of assault
 perpetrated against men. For rape, depending on the magnitude
 of the offense and the age of the victim, the penalty is
 generally 10 or more years in prison. However, the House of
 Assembly in 1989 considered legislation specifically addressing
 
 
 735
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 penalties for violent acts against women, and subsequently
 agreed to.the imposition of more severe penalties for acts of
 domestic violence; while the legislation is still not
 officially approved, many provisions are in fact in force.
 Although some victims of domestic violence such as wife beating
 are reluctant to press charges, women are increasingly willing
 to report such incidents to the police and the National Council
 of Women. The Government's Ministry of Education, Youth, and
 Women's Affairs has a Women's Desk which assists the National
 Council of Women with seminars, training programs, and public
 relations.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By law, Vincentians have the right to form unions, organize
 employees, and strike; these rights are generally respected in
 practice. Unions are independent of the Government and of
 political parties. Somewhat more than 10 percent of the labor
 force is unionized. No new unions were formed in 1991. Unions
 are free to form federations and confederations and to
 affiliate with international labor bodies and do so.
 The only major strike during the year began in July when the
 National Workers' Movement (NWM) pressed for recognition at a
 hotel and construction company on Palm Island in the southern
 Grenadines. When faced with a lengthy strike by some 70
 long-time workers over dismissal of two employees, the American
 owner hired half the number to replace them, with written
 contracts and higher wages. Prime Minister Mitchell intervened
 in the dispute in October. The Labor Department mediated the
 dispute and supervised disbursement of severance payments to
 some workers. While the hotel management considers the case
 resolved, the NWM plans to initiate legal proceedings against
 the hotel for unfair dismissal.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no legal obstacles to organizing unions; however,
 employers are not legally bound to recognize a particular union
 as an exclusive bargaining agent. Some companies offer
 packages of benefits with terms of employment better or
 comparable to what a union can offer. The law prohibits
 antiunion discrimination by employers against union members and
 organizers. Generally effective mechanisms exist for resolving
 complaints. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law sets the minimum working age at 16, although a worker
 must be 18 to receive a national insurance card. This
 provision, monitored and enforced by the Ministry of Labor's
 Labor Inspection Office, is generally respected in practice.
 There are no known instances of child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislation concerning the length of the workweek;
 however, the general practice is to work 40 hours in 5 days.
 Workers are guaranteed a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks.

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 Minimum wages, which are set by law, vary by sector and type of
 work. In many sectors the minimum wage is not sufficient to
 provide a decent standard of living for workers and their
 families, but most workers earn more than the minimum.
 According to the Ministry of Labor, legislation concerning
 occupational safety and health is outdated. The Factories Act
 of 1955 has some regulations concerning only factories, but
 enforcement of these is ineffective due to a lack of
 inspectors.
