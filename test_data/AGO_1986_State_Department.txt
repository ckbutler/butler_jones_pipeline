 ANGOLA*
 The People's Republic of Angola, the regime established in
 Luanda upon the withdrawal of the Portuguese in 1975, is ruled
 by the only recognized political party, the Marxist-Leninist
 Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).
 President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is both Head of State and
 chief of the MPLA. His rule was reconfirmed by the MPLA's
 Second Party Congress in December 1985. All major policy
 decisions are made by a small elite in the MPLA, which also
 controls all means of mass communication. Open political
 dissension is not tolerated.
 Now in its lth year, the internal conflict between the
 Government and the main opposition force, the National Union
 for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), again dominated
 events in 1986. The extension of the war to new areas in the
 north and the undiminished intensity of the fighting in the
 south caused many hundreds of casualties on each side. Each
 side accused the other of killing civilians and committing
 atrocities. In addition, some 200,000 to 500,000 persons in
 central, eastern, and southern Angola have been displaced from
 their homes largely as a result of civil strife.
 A number of deaths also occurred in the course of hostilities
 between the Southwest Africa People's Organization (SWAPO--a
 Namibian resistance movement with bases in Angola) and South
 Africa, which controls the territory of Namibia on Angola's
 southern border. During 1986 South Africa conducted repeated
 cross-border raids into Angola, including a June 5 raid on the
 southern port of Namibe and almost continuous interventions in
 pursuit of SWAPO and in support of UNITA.
 The Angolan Government receives extensive military assistance
 from the Soviet Union--well over $4 billion since 1975--and in
 1986 Soviet advisers again played an important role in planning
 and directing military operations. An estimated 35,000 Cuban
 military personnel provide logistical support, training, and
 advice to government forces as well as garrison key strategic
 population and economic centers. The Angolan armed forces
 total approximately 100,000. UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi,
 apparently has the allegiance of a substantial portion of the
 population, especially among Angola's largest ethnic group the
 Ovimbundu, and controls the southeastern quarter of Angola's
 territory. UNITA has stated publicly that it favors a
 government of national unity and has not sought to establish an
 alternate government.
 The intensification of the fighting has devastated the
 country's infrastructure, forced a return to barter in some
 areas, and has led the Government to divert most of its assets
 to the military. Payments to the Soviet Bloc for military
 equipment and Cuban combat troops are a heavy burden on the
 economy. In addition, the low world market price of oil, the
 principal source of the Angolan Government's revenue as well as
 most of its foreign exchange, has exacerbated this serious
 economic situation. With the end of the drought, the
 production of food crops recovered somewhat in 1986, but the

 the People's Republic of Angola and thus has no diplomatic
 personnel in country to monitor human rights conditions or
 evaluate allegations of abuses.

 military conflict increasingly interfered with harvest and
 distribution efforts. Angola has had to import 80 percent of
 its food in recent years, at a cost of about $300 million a
 year. Oil production and exploration continued, with new
 discoveries reported in 1986 off the northwestern coast of
 Angola.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The escalation of the war in Angola has resulted in numerous
 allegations-.that government, UNITA, and South African forces
 have killed civilians and that the MPLA and UNITA have executed
 political prisoners. While it is difficult to substantiate the
 various claims and counterclaims, available evidence suggests
 that both government and UNITA forces have on occasion
 arbitrarily executed prisoners. The fighting has also resulted
 in hundreds of civilian deaths. Undoubtedly, some of these
 deaths were inadvertently caused by military operations, but
 others appear to have been deliberately perpetrated by opposing
 forces to intimidate civilian populations. The MPLA and UNITA
 have publicly and repeatedly accused each other of practicing
 terrorism against their respective opponents, including killing
 or maiming civilians. UNITA has charged that Cuban forces have
 also been involved in attacks on civilians. Civilians also
 have died as a result of guerrilla actions, such as attacks on
 ground transportation. There are no reliable casualty figures,
 but upwards of 10,000 persons may'have lost limbs as a result
 of indiscriminate mining.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information to confirm that abductions, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions are practiced by government
 security agencies, or by UNITA, although both sides have
 accused each other of such practices.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Allegations of torture and mistreatment made by both sides
 appear to have some basis in fact. But torture of opponents
 does not appear to be a systematic practice of either the
 Government or UNITA.
 Angolan prisons are overcrowded, with substandard diet and
 sanitation, but these conditions seem to reflect the poor state
 of the economy rather than deliberate maltreatment. There are
 some unconfirmed reports that foreigners are not well treated,
 but Americans who have been imprisoned in Angola appear to have
 been relatively well treated and to have had access to medical
 care.
 Prison authorities reportedly have wide latitude in the
 treatment of prisoners. Treatment of political prisoners at
 the prisons controlled by the Ministry of State Security is
 alleged to be harsher than treatment in the regular prisons.
 Mistreatment reportedly includes physical intimidation,
 including beatings and threats, and prolonged interrogation
 with the use of force. Prison visits appear to be arbitrarily
 
 
 ANGOLA
 restricted in many instances. Foreign advisers, including
 Cubans and East Germans, are involved in assisting Angolan
 state security services and may be involved in helping to run
 state security prisons. The Government continues to put
 captured UNITA supporters on public display.
 very limited information is available on the situation and
 administrative structure within UNITA-held areas. It is known,
 however, that UNITA holds a number of foreign and government
 prisoners, captured in the course of military operations, in
 makeshift facilities in its areas of control in southeastern
 Angola. There have been no reports that UNITA has mistreated
 its prisoners. During 1986 UNITA cooperated with the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in releasing
 foreign prisoners, including some 200 hostages taken in March.
 None of the released alleged mistreatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Two of the most persistently and frequently reported charges of
 human rights violations have been arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment without due process. Numerous reports allege that
 persons are arrested and imprisoned by the Government on
 suspicion or denunciation by others and, in some cases, held
 for years without being notified of the charges against them.
 In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International judged that there
 continue to be few safeguards against the arrest and detention
 of political suspects by Government security services.
 Under Angolan law, persons suspected of committing serious acts
 against the security of the state may be held by the Ministry
 of State Security without charge for an initial period of
 3 months, renewable for a further period of 3 months. Such
 detainees need not be presented to a judge within 48 hours of
 their arrest, as otherwise stipulated in the code of criminal
 procedure, and apparently have no right to challenge the
 grounds of their detention. After 6 months in detention
 without charge, the detainee must be informed of the
 accusations against him, with the state security service either
 informing the public prosecutor of the charges against the
 suspect or releasing him. Once the case is presented to the
 public prosecutor, there does not appear to be a specific time
 limit within which a suspect must be brought to trial, and many
 political detainees--the exact number is not known but may be
 at least several hundred--have been held for years without
 being tried.
 The deterioration of the security situation has contributed to
 the general deterioration of judicial safeguards and due
 process. The Government has established regional military
 councils throughout much of Angola. They are responsible
 directly to President Dos Santos and have broad authority to
 restrict the movement of pe6ple and goods, to requisition
 people and goods without compensation, and to try crimes
 against the security of the State. The Government has also
 created "people's vigilance brigades" for urban areas, whose
 powers are not clear but include general administration and
 'protecting the people and ensuring public order and stability."
 During 1986 both sides reportedly relied increasingly on forced
 conscription of young males for recruitment into the military
 forces. In 1984 the Angolan Government was cited by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) in Geneva for being in
 violation of ILO Convention 105, which prohibits forced labor.
 
 
 8
 ANGOLA
 The basis of this citation is Angolan legislation still in
 force providing for compulsory labor for breaches of labor
 discipline and participation in strikes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution states that no citizen shall be arrested and.
 brought to trial except under the terms of the law, and it
 guarantees the right of the accused to a defense. There is,
 however, insufficient evidence to determine to what extent
 these rights are observed in practice. Amnesty International
 expressed concern in its 1986 Report that trials of government
 opponents, notably in military tribunals, do not conform to
 internationally recognized trial standards. In particular,
 defendants reportedly were not given adequate opportunity to
 present their defense or appeal their cases. Judicial lines of
 authority are unclear, especially since the regional military
 councils have been given responsibility for the trial of
 offenses against the security of the State, including "economic
 crimes." It is not known which trials are open to the public
 and under what rules of procedure the various military and
 civilian courts operate. The Constitution provides for a
 People's Supreme Court, but its jurisdiction is not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 home and privacy of correspondence, the Government conducts
 arbitrary searches of homes, censors private correspondence,
 and monitors private communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression "in the
 context of the achievement of the basic objectives of the
 People's Republic of Angola." In fact, the Angolan people live
 under censorship, intimidation and Government control of the
 media. Opposition views are not tolerated, and critics such as
 Bartolomeu Dias Fernandes, who was accused of "insulting the
 Head of State," have been sentenced to long prison terms.
 The Government is especially sensitive to criticism in the
 foreign press. But in 1986 the Government began to allow the
 travel of foreign correspondents to Angola in a controlled
 flow. Angola subscribes to the "Front Line" States' ban on
 accepting South Africa-based news correspondents. The
 circulation of Western journals and periodicals in Angola is
 tightly-restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is denied to any political group or
 movement other than the MPLA. All other political movements
 have been banned. There are numerous unconfirmed reports of
 arrests of people who voice support of opposition movements or
 alternative political systems. The people's vigilance
 brigades, which have some law enforcement authority in urban
 areas, and the martial law climate throughout the country tend
 further to restrict freedom of assembly and association.
 
 
 9
 ANGOLA
 The only trade union movement in Angola is the National Union
 of Angolan Workers, which is controlled by the MPLA and is a
 member of the continent-wide Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity. Traditional labor union activities are tightly
 controlled by the Government, and legislation ensures only a
 single trade union structure. Strikes are prohibited by law as
 a crime against the security of the State.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution guarantees the inviolability of
 freedom of conscience and belief and provides for separation of
 church and state, the Government publicly emphasizes the
 importance of propagating "atheism" and has been critical of
 religious activities. The overwhelming majority of the Angolan
 population is Christian, however, and the Government has not
 moved to close down churches. Church services are regularly
 held, and there is widespread attendance. Foreign and Angolan
 missionaries are allowed to carry out their normal activities.
 Reportedly, UNITA respects freedom of religion in the areas it
 controls. But in 1986, UNITA several times captured foreign
 missionaries, releasing them unharmed after publicly warning
 them.of the dangers of being caught in the war's crossfire.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country. Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a result of the increased fighting, the Government is
 acutely security-conscious and has tightly restricted travel.
 Indeed, travel by road in most areas of Angola is dangerous.
 The Government has instituted a pass system within Angola, and
 foreigners are generally prohibited from traveling outside the
 principal cities. UNITA has publicly warned that it considers
 all of Angola to be a war zone and that it cannot guarantee the
 safety of persons traveling there.
 Angolan citizens are allowed to travel abroad, but this travel
 is carefully controlled by restrictions on issuance of
 passports and exit visas and by currency restrictions.
 Emigration is restricted. The Government limits travel to
 Angola through a selective and stringent visa policy. Angola
 is a party to the U.N. Protocol Relating.to the Status of
 Refugees. There are currently approximately 70,000 Namibian,
 15,000 Zairian, and 9,000 South African refugees or displaced
 persons in Angola. Since mid-1980, between 120,000 and 140,000
 former Zairian displaced persons in Angola returned-home under
 the auspices of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Approximately 200,000 Angolans have taken refuge in Zaire since
 1975, and an estimated 100,000 have taken refuge in Zambia. Of
 the estimated total of 400,000 Angolans who have left the
 country since independence, the Government claims that 180,000
 have returned, but this claim cannot be verified.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their Government.
 Angola is ruled by a small group of officials within the party
 apparatus of the ruling MPLA. The Constitution provides for
 popular participation in the political process, but political
 activity is limited to participation in the MPLA or in one of
 its controlled and sanctioned organizations such as its youth.
 wing, the Angolan Women's Organization, or the trade union
 movement. Political power is centered in the elite membership
 
 
 10
 ANGOLA
 of the politburo and the somewhat larger central committee.
 Party membership is very restricted, with fewer than 30,000
 members out of a population of almost 8 million, according to
 the official media.
 The Constitution provides for a popularly elected National
 People's Assembly, established in 1981, and people's assemblies
 at the provincial and local level. However, despite recent
 suggestions from President Dos Santos that the powers and
 membership of the National People's Assembly be broadened, as
 of the end of 1986 only candidates chosen and endorsed by the
 party have been elected. Key members of the party also hold
 leadership positions in the people's assemblies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has allowed the ICRC and United Nations
 International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) to provide
 food and medical assistance in areas it controls, and UNITA
 allows the ICRC to conduct similar operations in areas it
 controls or is contesting. The Government permitted the ICRC
 to visit one South African prisoner in Luanda but did not
 respond to ICRC requests for access to all persons arrested in
 connection with internal events and the military situation in
 the country. In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International reports
 mixed success in receiving Government responses to its
 inquiries and the information necessary to investigate possible
 abuses and track outstanding'cases.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Angola's population of about 8 million is growing at the rate
 of 3 percent a year. Estimated gross domestic product per
 capita in 1985 was approximately $540, but this reflects the
 oil revenues from the Cabinda field and has little meaning to
 the bulk of the population in the midst of civil war and in any
 case has been stagnant. Many rural inhabitants have abandoned
 the countryside to seek food and safety-in urban areas, such as
 Luanda, which have been overwhelmed by the influx. Given the
 great poverty and hardship prevailing in most of Angola, it is
 difficult to point to the possible effects of discrimination on
 the basis of race, sex, religion, language, or social status.
 For the average Angolan, life is nasty, brutish and short.
 Both the MPLA and UNITA have primarily ethnic bases of
 support--the MPLA among the Kimbundu, and UNITA among the
 Ovimbundu. Members of all of Angola's ethnic groups and
 religions, as well as women, participate in the MPLA, some at
 high levels of the party. But non-Kimbundu groups are greatly
 underrepresented in the small group within the ruling MPLA
 central committee and politburo. Over the last year, several
 prominent mesticos (Angolans of mixed racial background
 numbering only about 1 percent of the population) in the ruling
 MPLA have been removed from office or demoted. But mesticos
 remain the most highly skilled and educated group and are
 influential--politically, culturally, and economically--beyond
 their numbers. Women and blacks were given more positions in
 the top leadership by the 1985 Second Party Congress.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no information available on working conditions in
 Angola.
