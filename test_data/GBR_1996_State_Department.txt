 UNITED KINGDOM
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is a longstand-
 ing, constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary government. A lower
 legislative chamber (the House of Commons), the center of parliamentary power is
 elected in periodic multiparty elections. An upper chamber (the House of Lords),
 with the power to revise and delay implementation of laws, is made up of hereditary
 and ife pers and senior clergy of the established Church of England. There is an
 independent judiciary, but Parliament may overrule its decisions.
 Throughout the United Kingdom, police forces are responsive to, and under the
 effective ontrol of, civilian officials. The Security Service Act of 1996, giving the in-
 tei~enc agency MI-5 jurisdiction to act in support of other law enforcement agen-
 cies i the prevention and detection of serious domestic crime, received royal assent
 in July. In some areas of Northern Ireland, because of continued terrorist violence,
 army units operated to reinforce the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Although
 the security forces generally respect human rights and the rule of law, some mem-
 bers of the police have committed human rights abuses.
 The United Kingdom has a highl, devIed and diversified market-based econ-
 omy that provides most residents with a h   standard of living. Certain geographic
 areas, particularly older industrial areas including Northern Ireland, suffer from
 higher than average unemployment. In addition, unemployment tends to be higher
 among some demographic groups, such as youth and racial minorities. The Govern-
 ment provides comprehensive social welfare services, including a national health
 system, housing and family benefits, and heavily subsidized higher education.
 The Government respected the human rights of its citizens, but there were prob-
 lems in some areas. Police occasionally abused detainees. The controversial reversal
 by the RUC chief constable of his earlier decision allowed Protestant "Orangemen"
 to parade through a predominately Catholic nationalist area of Portadown on July
 11, leading to serious and widespread public disturbances throughout Northern Ire-
 land. Although the chief constable justified his decision as necessary to prevent loss
 of life, Irish nationalists argue that the RUC reacted more aggressively and vigor-
 ously to quell nationalist disturbances than toward loyalist lawbrekers.
 In January the Government announced that it was setting up an independent in-
 qiyinto, and inviting public comment on, the future need for counterterrorism leg-
 islation in Northern Ireland. Such counterterrorism legislation was renewed and
 strengthened by Parliament following the resumption of Irish Republican Army
 (IRA) terrorist violence in February. At year's end there was an upsurge in terrorist
 violence in Northern Ireland.
 The Government is taking steps to combat violence against women and societal
 discrimination against nonwhite minorities.
 Police believe paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland were responsible for nine
 killings as of September. Both Republican and Loyalist paramilitary groups contin-
 ued to engage in vigilante "punishment" attacks on alleged "antisocial elements"
 and to     e           by force. There have also been instanes of arson against
 (Protestant) Orange halls and Catholic churches.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by the Government, but several deaths of persons during civil unrest, in the
 course of apprehension, or while in custody raised questions about whether police
 and prison officers had used improper restraining techniques or excessive force
 against minority group members and criminal suspects. The Home Office banned
 the use of one restraining technique that was alleged to have been the cause of a
 prisoner fatality.
 David Ewen, pursued by police after stealing an automobile in February, was cor-
 nered by police vehicles and verbally warned. When he did not get out of the car,
 a police officer ope ned fire on the side of the stolen vehicle, killing Ewen. The police-
 man was charged with murder, and his trial continued at year's end. A jury re-
 turned a verdict in December of unlawful killing in the case of Oluwashijibomi
 Lapite, who died in police custody in December 1994 after being placed in a suffocat-
 ing choke hold. The cause of death was listedn asphyxiation. Following this inci-
 
 
 1192
 dent the police issued new gdelines banning the use of the choke hold. The inde-
 pendent Poice Comnpains Authority decided that no disciplinary action would be
 tken against any offier involved, in December an inquest juiy returned a verdict
 of accidental death in the case of Wayne Douglas, a suspected burglar who died in
 lice custody in 1995. Douglas' faily will appeal the verdict to the High Court.
 Ajury returned a verdict in November of misadventure to which neglect contrib-
 utedi3 in the case of Leon Patterson, who died in polie custody in 1992 after being
 left naked and handcuffed on a jail cell floor. No police officers or jail personnel were
 punished in this case. In August an inquest reached a verdict of accidental death
 in the case of Brian Douglas an Afro-Caibean man who in 1995 died from hemor-
 rhages and a fractured skuli 5 days after his arrest. Earlier in the year the Crown
 Prosecution Service (CPS) said that it would not prosecute the officers involved due
 to "insufficient evidence."
 A police tribunal dismissed a case of neglect of duty against a senior police officer
 who supervised the police squad involved in the death of illegal immigrant Joy
 Gardner. This brought an end to all disciplinary proceedings in the case of Gardner,
 who died of brain damage in 1993 after police officers gagged her with adhesive tape
 when she resisted arrest. The Home Ofice no longer permits mouth restraints to
 be used in the removal of people under Immigration Act powers.
 During July disturbances in Londonderry, Northern freland, an armored person-
 nel carrier ran over Dermot McShane, a convicted Republican terrorist who had
 taken refuge behind a board fence during street fighting. The army claimed that the
 death was accidental, and the RUC appointed a senior detective to investigate. A
 llie inquiry is under way into the death of Dairmud O'Neil, who was killed in
 September when police stormed a London residence where IRA bomb-making and
 other terrrist-rlated materials were found. A decision is pending by the CPS about
 whether to bring charges in the case of Richard O'Brien, an Irishman whom a Coro-
 ners Court found had been unlawfully killed by police in 1994. The CPS had earlier
 decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute, but the family's attorney peti-
 tioned the CPS to institute criminal proceedings against the officers involved.
 Human rights monitors complained about delays in the criminal process.
 KillingsyRepbcan and Loyalist groups continued. In January a group calling
 itself "Direct Action Against Drug" (DAAD), but believed to have strong links to
 the IRA, killed one person. In September the group claimed responsibility for the
 shooting death of a 31-year-old man. As of September, while there were numerous
 arrests, no persons had been charged in the cases of the DAM) murders of 1995
 or 1996.
 The January killing of reputed Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) chief of
 staff Gino Gallagher sparked7 a feud between two INLA factions, which through Sep-
 tember resulted in six other deaths, including that of a 9-yearld g
 Two innocent bystanders were killed and several hundred persons injured by the
 IRA when it detonated a massive bomb in the Dokands area of London in Feb-
 ruary, endig the cease-fire it had declared in August 1994 (see Section 1.c.). James
 Bradwell, a British     mwarrant officer, died on October 11 from injuries sus-
 tained in an October 7 RAdouble-bomb attack on a barracks and, minutes later,
 on a hospital at the British Army headquarters in Northern Ireland. Bradwell was
 caught in beth explosions, caused by around 500 pounds of homemade explosives.
 In July Michael McGoldrick, a Catholic taxi driver, was found murdered in his
 car in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. No one claimed responsibility for his mur-
 der, but it had the hallmarks of a Loyalist assassination and probably was per-
 petrated by a renegade faction of the Ulster Volunteer Forc (UsVF). In December
 a policeman was wounded during an IRA attack at a children's hospital; the subse-
 quent wounding of a Republican in a car bombing thought to be perpetrated by a
 Loyalist group prompted fears of a resurgence of sectarian violence in the province.
 The 1989 killing of Patrick Finucane, counsel to many IRA suspects, remains an
 open case. Although it was alleged that Brian Nelson, a former Loyalist para-
 military and agent for British miltary intelligence, assisted in targeting Finucane,
 the Northern  xland DPP determined that the evidence was insufficient and de-
 cided not to bring charges against him. In February Nelson was freed from prison.
 Coroners do not have the power to compel people who are suspected of involve-
 ment in extrajudicial killing to give evidence at inquests and the relatives of those
 who have died do not receive advance disclosure of information, statements, and
 other evidence, athe June inquest into the death of Patrick Shanaghan, murdered
 by Loyalist paramilitary groups in 1991, the coroner agreed to alcations by the
 Shanaghan family's lawyer to admit evidence that police officers threatened
 Shanaghan's life while he was under arrest and said that they would leak his name
 to a paramilitary group. The chief constable rebuked the coroner for straying outside
 his authority and refused to uphold the ruling.
 
 
 1193
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances attributed to the
 Government. At least 14 terrorist-perpetrated disappearances, dating back to 1972,
 remain outstanding without any significant investigative progress by the authori-
 ties. A seven-person RUC team works full time to solve the cases, but the victims,
 typically members of the security forces, suspected informers, or petty criminals
 have not been found.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Confes-
 sions thus obtained are not admissible in court and judges can exclude even vol-
 untary confessions. Detainees who claim physical mistreatment have the right to an
 immediate medical examination. Such a claim must be examined by a trial judge.
 There were no reports that government officials used torture.
 Several incidents of police brutality toward criminal suspects occurred, including
 toward ethnic minorities. In February Amer Rafiq, who is of Pakistani origin, lost
 an eye due to injuries sustained in a police van following his arrest in Manchester
 for alleged public disorder offenses. The London Metropolitan Police have had to pay
 damages in several instances. In March a Hong Kong native, who was thrown in
 the hack of a police van, punched, kicked, and insulted by three constables, was
 awarded $374,000 (220,000 Pounds) in damages against the London Metropolitan
 Police by a jury. Scotland Yard refused to discipline the officers involved and ap-
 pealed the verdict.
 Corporal punishment is still on the statute books in several British Caribbean de-
 pendent territories. It is rarely used in practice, but in May a British Virgin Islands
 youth was subjected to flogging after failing to pay a $1,000 fine for illegal cultiva-
 tion of marijuana.
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC), established by the
 Government, supervises police investigations in Northern Ireland. Authorized to re-
 view all complaints, it automatically supervises cases involving death or serious in-
 jury. It accepts information provided by a complainant and by any other sources,
 as well as that discovered by the police. The ICPC can direct the chief constable
 to bring charges against police officers. The ICPC reported that in 1995 it had re-
 ceived 2,328 complaints f official abuse and that its investigations had led to infor-
 mal     *         ion   99       form                     in 22, and the lodg-
 ing of crminal charges i 14 more. Local human rght groups complain that the
 IClCs powers are inadequate because it cannot act autonomously; it can only re-
 view cases in which a state actor or a citizen has fied a complaint.
 In 1993 the Northern Ireland Secretary named an independent assessor of mili-
 tary complaints to deal with procedures regarding compalts of abuses by the
 army; he, too, has no independent investigative powers. His third report, released
 mn May, noted that the army had largely implemented the recommendations of the
 two earlier reports. There were only 19 omplaints in 1995, down from 217 in 1994,
 as the cease-fires took hold. The assessor criticized delays in processing (nine cases
 took mere than 8 weeks to resolve) and suggested that letters denyin army cul-
 pability should. where reasonable, give the complainants the benefit of the doubt in
 order to improve community relations.
 The United Nations Committee Against Torture and manny human rights groups
 have raised concerns abut mistreatment of detainees in Nortern Ire and. where
 suspects arrested under emergency legislation are interrogated in special holding
 centers.
 In 1992 the Government appointed a senior barrister as Independent Commis-
 sioner for Holding Centers in Notern Ireland. with authority to make irregular,
 unannounced visits to any holding center, observe interrogations, and interview de-
 tainees. In Janu aa  he and his deputy noted that 11 complaints of p hyical assault
 during detention cm a detainee population of 49 were received in 19-5. Their re-
 port welcomed the Government's decision in January (not yet implemented as of c-
 tober) to introduce a system for silent video recording of interrogations of suspects
 (at which legal representatives are not allowed) but caled for introduction of audio
 recrding as well.
 There have long been accusations that security forces in Northern Ireland haras
 citizens, particularly young people, in areas where support for terrorists is consid-
 ered strong. The Government strongly denies that such behavior is widespread or
 officially tolerated.
 Police continue to use plastic bullets in crowd control situations, a practice re-
 stricted to Northern Ireland. The number of plastic rounds fired this year surpasses
 all but one prior year. This practice has been widely criticized by human rights
 monitors an the     N. Committee Against Torture. The European Parliament has
 called for a ban on their use. According to RUC rules, plastic bullets should be
 
 
 1194
 aimed at the lower half of the body-, numerous head and upper body iriuries never-
 theless have resulted from their use.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors. A 1995 security crackdown has resulted
 in harsher prison regimes, particularly for those inmates categorized as "high risk."
 In January the Home Secretary announced that female prisoners admitted to the
 hospital to give birth would no longer have handcuffs or any other physical re-
 straints applied to them at any time during their hospital stays; nor would re-
 straints now be applied during prenatal checkups unless there was a particularly
 hh risk of escape.
 i A bombings targeting buildings and economic activities in England have re-
 sulted in civilian casualties. Two bombs in February in London injured a total of
 108 persons, 2 fatall, another in June in Manchester injured more than 200. In
 September a police raid resulted in the seizure of 10,000 pounds of explosive mate-
 rial, ammunition. firearms, and vehicle booby traps from several caches in London.
 Police officials said that the evidence pointed to a planned large-scale terrorist at-
 tack. Republican terrorists are also believed to be responsible for a double explosion
 within Thiepval B       , Lisburn (British Army headquarters in Northern Ireland)
 on October 7. One soldier died later of injuries, and 31 people, including an 8-year-
 old girl, were injured.
 Joseph Kelly, Brian McHugh, James Murphy, and Michael Phillips were arrested
 in London on September 23 foloig discovery of bomb-making and other terrorist
 materials at a London residence. The four were charged with conspiracy to cause
 explosions under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. They are being heId at Belmarsh
 Prison awaiting trial
 Both Loyalist and Republican terrorists in Northern Ireland have carried out in-
 creasingly frequent "punishment" attacks, typically involving beatings with iron
 pies and spiked clubs. The RUC recorded 79 Loyalist and 176 Republican assaults
 of this nature in 1996. Young men ages 14 years and over were the most frequent
 victims. In 1995 there were 141 Repu lican assaults and 79 by Loyalists. The Loyal-
 ista often, but not exclusively, target members of their terrorist cells who have bro-
 ken ranks, while the Republicans more frequently extend their vigilante activities
 to the broader Catholic community, punishing "antisocial" activities (such as drug-
 traffickin and car theft ).
 d Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-British authorities can and often do
 make arrests or detain suspects without judicial warrants-especially in Northern
 Ireland, under laws applicable only there-- when they believe that they have reason-
 able cause to suspect wrongdoing
 The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 allows police officers to stop
 and search vehicles and pedestrians "where it appears expedient to do so in order
 to prevent acts of terrorism." The rules under the 1991 Northern Ireland Emergency
 Provisions Act permit an on-duty soldier or security officer to arrest and detain for
 up to 4 hours a person who he has reasonable grounds to suspect is committing
 or has committed or is about to commit any offense." The Prevention of Terrorism
 Act (PTA) is the most reviewed piece of legislation in the United Kingdom. It ex-
 pires every 2 years and, due to the changing security situation, is amended or al-
 tered to account for those changes.
 Outside Northern Ireland, suspects arrested without warrants must be released
 within 24 hours (or 36 hours if a serious arrestable offense is involved) unless
 brought before a magistrate's court. The court may authorize extension of detention
 by 36 hours and on further application by another 24 hours. Defendants awaiting
 trial have a statutory right to be granted bail unless there is a risk that they would
 abscond, commit an offense, interfere with witnesses, or otherwise obstruct the
 course of justice, or unless they were on bail when the alleged offense was commit-
 ted. The minority (about 3 percent) of defendants who are remanded in custody are
 protected by statutory custody time limits, which restrict the period for which they
 can be held while awaiting trial to a maximum of 182 days unless the court grants
 an extension. In 1995 (latest figures) the average period for which defendants await-
 ing Crown court trial were held in custody was 139 days.
 The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary rovisions) Act allows the police to ar-
 rest without a warrant anywhere in the U    persons they have reason to suspect
 of being involved in terrorism. The authorities may detain such persons (even those
 under the age of 18) up to 48 hours without legal representation or judicial review.
 Suspects may be interrogated during this time, and confessions obtained may be
 ue  nsubsequent court proceedings. Under the 1989 PTA in England or Wales,
 detainees are granted the right to have lawyers present during interrogation, but
 this is not the case in Northern Ireland. Detention without charge may be extended
 up to a further 5 days on the authority of the Hom Secretary or, in Northern Ire-
 
 
 1195
 land, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Extensive PTA detention owers
 were held in breach of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)
 and have occasioned a derogation by the Government. For example, in February the
 ECHR ruled that the Home Secretary's power to decide whether or not to release
 young murderers violated article 5 of the European convention on human rights.
 The ruling calls for the Government to set up an independent judicial body to review
 the detention of juveniles who have committe murder.
 Immigration legislation gives the power of administrative detention to immigra-
 tion officers. There is no time limit for such detention and no right to have it re-
 viewed by a court. In 1995 police detained a Punjab native with permanent resi-
 dency in the UK, Raghbir Singh Johal, citing national security after the murder in
 London of a Punjabi newspaper editor. The Home Office has not permitted Singh
 to see any of the evidence on which it based its decision, has not told him what the
 allegations are against him, and will not afford him legal representation.
 Refugee advocates complained about detention of about 750 asylum seekers, who
 are hedin regular prisons and ccasionaly poice ells, as well as in specially built
 detention centers. Unlike those accused of criminal offenses, the asylum seekers are
 gven no written statement as to why they are detained, and their right to apply
 or    is not automatic and requires a high level of surety. The Home Office states
 that detention is authorized only where there are good grounds to believe that a
 person will not comply with the terms of temprary admission and that the practice
 does not affect more than 1.5 percent of asylum seekers at any given time.
 The Government does not practice exile (see Section 2.d. regarding exclusion or-
 ders) but terrorist organizations do. An organization that works with individuals
 and families under threat in Northern Ireland reported that up to the end of August
 it was aware of 238 cases of people who had been warned to leave the province, 63
 of whom had actually done so. This compared with 215 cases for all of 1995.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and provides citizens
 with a generally fair and efficient judicial process.
 The Uhas several levels of courts. The vast majority of criminal cases are heard
 by magistrates' courts, which are managed by locally based committees. Their deci-
 sions may be a ppealed to the Crown Court, which also hears criminal cases requir-
 ing a      ria, or to the High Court. From the Crown Court, convictions may be
 appealed   the Court of Appeal, which in turn may refer cases involving points of
 law to the House of Lords. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (which
 consists of senior judges and is functionally distinct from the legislative arm) is the
 final court of appeal. Once all of these appeals have been exhausted, defendants in
 England and Wales may appeal to the Home Secretary to refer a case back to the
 courts if fresh evidence has emerged that casts doubt on the conviction. (Appeals
 may be made to the Northern Ireland Office and the Scottish Office in those juris-
 dictions.)
 The law provides for fair trial, and the authorities respect this. In August the
 Home Office appointed the head of a new Criminal Case Review Commission to di-
 rect and supervise investigations into possible miscarriages of justice. The Commis-
 sion, called for by the 1995 Criminal Appeal Act, is supposed to refer cases in which
 routine appeals have been exhausted for further appealon factual, legal, and sen-
 tencing grounds. Members of Parliament objected when it turned out that the ap-
 pointee belonged to the Freemasons, a secretive fraternal organization that includes
 in its membership many police officers. By year's end the Commission was not yet
 operational. Thus, cases involving possible miscarriages of justice must be referred
 to the Home Office for review.
 Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994, judges have the power
 to instruct juries that they may draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's re-
 fusal to answer questions during interrogation or trial, although no conviction can
 be based solely on such an inference. Human rights groups and the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission have sharply criticized this change in the law. A similar provi-
 sion is in effect in Northern Ireland.
 Indigent defendants have the right to free counsel of their choice, with some ex-
 ceptions. In June the European Court of Human Rights faulted the Government for
 not extending the duty solicitor scheme to poll and council tax defaulters, some 900
 of whom are jailed annually.
 All criminal proceedings must be held in public except those in juvenile court and
 those involving public decency or security. In a trial under the Official Secrets Act,
 themdge may order the court closed, but the sentencing must be public. Convictions
 canbe appealed to successively higher cour' .s.
 In Northern Ireland, special "emergency" restrictions affect due process. Under
 the Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act of 1991 (EPA), the Government can
 suspend the right to trial by jury for certain terrorist-related offenses. Such offenses
 
 
 1196
 are tried instead by a "Diplock Court" consisting of a judge presiding without a jury.
 If the decision is to convict, the judge must justify it in a document that becomes
 part of the court record, and an appellate court may overturn it on substantive as
 well as legal grounds. The Diplock Courts have been widely criticized. The EPA also
 permits the use of uncorroborated confessions, but they cannot be the sole basis for
 conviction.
 The 1988 Criminal Evidence Order allows judges to draw an adverse inference
 when a suspect refuses to answer questions. In February the ECHR found in John
 Murray v. United Kingdom that the denial in Northern Ireland of access to counsel
 for the first 48 hours in a situation where the right of the defense might thus be
 irretrievably prejudiced was, whatever the justification, incompatible with article 6
 of the European convention on human rights.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Prwcy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-War-
 rants are normally required for a police search of private premises. However, under
 the 1991 EPA, on-duty members of the armed forces or policemen in Northern Ire-
 land may enter and search "any premises for the purpose of arresting a person for
 an arrestable offense, but only if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that
 the person being sought is on the premises."
 Primarily due to fear of intercommunal violence, many Protestant and Catholic
 families in Northern Ireland moved away from mixed or border neighborhoods.
 In Northern Ireland, paramilitary groups have attacked and threatened to attack
 the homes and families of police and politicians.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Strongly held common-law tradition, an inde-
 pendent press, and a democratic political system combine to secure freedom of
 speech and the press, including academic freedom. Viewpoints critical of the Govern-
 ment are well represented. The print media are dominated by a handful of national
 daily newspapers all privately owned and independent (although often generally
 aligned with a political party). About half the electronic media are run by the Brit-
 ish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which is funded by the Government but enjoys
 complete editorial independence. The remainder are run by corporations under re-
 newable government license.
 Human rights organizations and journalists criticized the 1981 Contempt of Court
 Act, which allows courts to order a journalist to disclose a source if this is deemed
 to be "in the interests of justice." In March the ECHR found that the Government
 had violated the right to free expression when it held journalist William Goodwin
 and his publishers in contempt of court for refusing to disclose the identity of a
 source who had given Goodwin confidential corporate information that, if published,
 might have caused financial harm to a company.
 The doctrine of Public Interest Immunity (PH1) allows government ministers to
 prevent certain information from being disclosed during litigation, on the grounds
 that its revelation would be contrary to the public interest. For those charged with
 disclosing official information, the 1990 Official Secrets Act denies any defense that
 the information is already in the public domain or that its publication is in the pub-
 lic interest.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of peaceful assembly, but the right is routinely limited where it would impose a cost
 on public convenience. The annual "Marching season" in Northern Ireland, a period
 of several weeks in the summer during which the 100,000 members of the Orange
 Order and similar Protestant organizations stage traditional parades to celebrate
 their history and cultural identity, posed special problems to the Government as it
 tried to respect this right in practice. Similar organizations in the nationalist com-
 munity also march during the summer, although the smaller scale of those parades
 has presented law enforcement authorities with fewer difficulties.
 Afer initially prohibiting it, poalie  permitted Orangemen to march along
 Garvagh road in Portadown in July, despite local nationalist residents' objections.
 The RUC chief constable said that he reversed his decision because the potential
 for loss of life was very high as the likelihood increased, during a 5-day standoff,
 that more than 50,000 Orangemen would try to breach police lines. Many observers
 on both sides of the community perceived the Government's reversal in the face of
 unlawful Unionist protests as a victory of might over the rule of law, and the inci-
 dent damaged the RUC's reputation as an impartial police force.
 In July the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland appointed an independent
 commission headed by the Vice Chancellor of Oxford University to examine the pa-
 rades issue and make recommendations for the future. The Government also an-
 nounced that a review of the RUC's handling of public order situations would be
 
 
 1197
 undertaken by the Inspector of Constabulary, an independent inspectorate covering
 every police force in the United Kingdom, including the use of plastic bullets and
 would include the issue of police protection in the face of determined assaults.
 Under the PTA, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may proscribe any
 organization that 'appears to him to be concerned in, or in promoting or encourag-
 ing terrorism occurring in the United Kingdom and connected with the affairs of
 Northern Ireland." Membership in proscribed Loyalist and Republican paramilitary
 groups is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Supporting these para-
 military groups is also ilegal and an imprisonable offense, as is wearing clothing
 that arouses "reasonable suspicion" that the wearer belongs to or supports pro-
 scribed organizations. Human rights monitors, while acknowledging the deterrent
 effects of proscription powers, argue for the repeal of this law because it violates
 the fundamental right of freedom of association and the individuals right to hold
 opinions and beliefs.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Government policy and general practice ensure freedom
 of religion. There are two legally recognized official churches of the state: the (Angli-
 can) Church of England and the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. Wales has not
 had an established church since 1920. Freedom of worship has been legally guaran-
 teed to members of all faiths and denominations since the mid-19th century. Blas-
 phemy of the Christian religion is outlawed. The blasphemy law, however, is rarely
 enforced. In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 prohibits public authori-
 ties from discriminating on the basis of religious or political belief.
 d. Freedom of Mouement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens enjoy freedom ofmovement _wi*.n the ountry and in foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. However, the Home ecretary may exclude
 from Great Britain anyone believed linked with terrorism in Northern Ireland, ex-
 cept anyone bern in Great Britain or resident there for 3 years; and the Secretary
 of State for Northern Ireland can likewise exclude persons not native to or resident
 in that province. Currently 31 persons (down from 36 in 1995) are subject to exclu-
 sion orders. Several Meers of Parliament, human rights groups, and the media
 have objected to exclusion orders. The Secretary of State need not reveal the
 grounds for exclusion, and the evidence is not tested in any court. There is no right
 of appeal to the courts, but appeal may be made informally to an independent advi-
 sor.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. First asylum
 is provided under a temporary protection program started in 1992. All evacuees are
 screened by the UNHCR. Approximately 3,700 people have been accepted under the
 program, which allows them 6 months' "leave to enter the country" on arrival. They
 can then apply for an automatic 32-year extension of their stay and may apply for
 refugee status at any time. Such applications are considered in accordance with the
 criteria in the 1951 U.N. refugee convention. If recognized as refugees, they may re-
 main indefinitely.
 New measures beginning in February denied social welfare benefits to refugees
 who had not sought asylum as soon as they entered the country. The measures are
 intended to discourage false asylum claims. According to government reports, new
 asylum applications fell dramatically. After an Appeals Court ruled in July that the
 Government's plan to withdraw all benefits was illegal, the number of asylum appL
 cations nearly doubled, from 920 received in June, to 1,700 rceived in Jul mi"" y7  -
 gration officials claim that this is proof that many claiming to be political refugees
 are actually economic migrants.
 Sadi dissident Mohammed al-Masari entered the UK illegally and applied for
 asylum. His initial requ.est was denied, due to the cicumstanes of his entry, but
 the ourts prohibited immigra tion officials from deporting him to his home country
 because his safety there could not be guaranteed. The Government then considered
 sen din A1-Masari to a third ountry, Dominica, but he was able to demonstrate
 that his safety could not be assured there either. Finally, AI-Masari was granted
 permission to remain for 4 years, with the option of applying for permanent resi-
 dency at the end of that period.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and freely exercise that right.
 The Government is formed on the basis of a majority of seats in the House of Com-
 mons. Elections are held at intervals not to exceed 5 years.
 Participation in the political process is open to all persons and parties. All citizens
 18 years of age and older may vote. Northern Ireland has city and district councils,
 as m the rest of the UK, but with somewhat fewer powers. England and Wales also
 
 
 1198
 have county councils, while Northern Ireland does not. (Scotland's structure is dif-
 ferent still.) Despite periodic attempts, there has been no devolved government in
 Northern Ireland since 1972 because of the situation there.
 Parties committed to the establishment of some form of Scottish parliament re-
 ceived some 75 percent of the vote during the last general election (in 1992). The
 Scottish National Party, which holds four seats in Parliament, advocates independ-
 ence for Scotland.
 British dependent territories, other than Hong Kong, have small populations,
 under 60,000, and all are ruled by appointed governors or administrators assisted
 by executive councils (usually appointed) and legislative assemblies or councils
 (partly elected).
 Women and minorities face no legal constraints on voting or holding office.
 Women members constitute about 10 percent of the membership of the lower legisla-
 tive chamber and 5 percent of the upper one. Several members of minority ethnic
 groups serve in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are cooperative and responsive to their views. In 1973 the Government estab-
 lished a Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights (SACHR) to monitor
 human rights in Northern Ireland but has not adopted many of its security-related
 recommendations.
 A number of international, nongovernmental human rights organizations, includ-
 ing Amnesty International and Article 19, are based in the UK. The Government
 cooperates fully with international inquiries into alleged violations of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Race Relations Act of 1976 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color,
 nationality, or national or ethnic origin and outlaws incitement to racial hatred. No
 legislation exists to specifically outlaw racial discrimination in Northern Ireland.
 Discrimination on grounds of religious or political opinion is unlawful in Northern
 Ireland but not in Great Britain. Discrimination on the basis of religion is only ille-
 gal in Great Britain when its effect is to discriminate against a member of a minor-
 ity ethnic group. The Government respects and enforces all extant antidiscrimina-
 tion laws, which concentrate on employment and the supply of goods and services.
 Women.---Statistical and other evidence indicates that most victims of societal vio-
 lence are women. Domestic violence constitutes one-third of all reported crimes
 against women and accounts for almost 25 percent of all reported violent crimes.
 The Government believed that the problem of stalking was becoming so acute that
 it promised to introduce a new law that could result in stalkers being jailed for up
 to 5 years.
 The law provides for injunctive relief, personal protection orders, and exclusion or-
 ders for women who are victims of violence. The Government provides shelters,
 counseling, and other assistance for victims of battery or rape, and it offers free
 legal aid to battered women who are economically reliant upon their abusers. The
 Government actively prosecutes perpetrators of domestic violence, and the law pro-
 vides for their imprisonment. The courts have held that nonconsensual marital sex
 can constitute a criminal offense. A 1994 law abolished the warning that judges had
 previously been required to give juries to the effect that a victim's testimony alone
 should not be adequate for a rape conviction. The Criminal Justice and Public Order
 Act of 1994 made sexual (as well as other intentional) harassment a criminal of-
 fense.
 The law provides for equal opportunity between the sexes, but women experience
 some discrimination in practice. Nevertheless, according to the Equal Opportunities
 Commission, there has been significantprogress in equal opportunity for women at
 work since the Commission was set up following the passage of the Sex Discrimina-
 tion Act. The Equal Opportunities Commission supports persons who bring discrimi-
 nation cases before industrial tribunals and courts, and it produces guidelines on
 good practice for employers. Women in Britain earn approximately 20 percent less
 than their male counterparts in comparable positions. A government minister co-
 chairs the Women's National Commission, a forum for women's organizations that
 presents women's views to the Government.
 The 1975 Sex Discrimination Act as amended in 1986 prohibits indirect as well
 as direct discrimination in training, education, housing, and provision of goods and
 
 
 1199
 services, as well as in employment. Women have equal rights regarding property
 and divorce.
 Chi/dren.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care.
 While there is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children, indications
 are, despite the lack of reliable data, that child abuse is nevertheless a problem.
 Various laws covering England and Wales stipulate that children have the right to
 apply for court orders, to give or withhold consent for medical treatment (for those
 calable of making an informed decision), to make complaints to the relevant local
 authority, to have their ethnic, linguistic, and religious background considered in
 decisions affecting them, to have reasonable contact with thenr family (usually ap-
 plied in a circumstance where there has been abuse), and in general to be consulted
 regarding their desires.
 In September a tribunal commenced examination of allegations of child abuse in
 public children's homes in Wales over the last 20 years. The hearings followed alle-
 gations of systematic physical and sexual abuse of hundreds of children by staff and
 were expected to last for 12 months.
 People With Disabilities.-The Disability Discrimination Act passed in 1995 out-
 laws discrimination against disabled persons in provision of access to public facili-
 ties, by employers of more than 20 workers, service providers (apart from those pro-
 viding education or running transport vehicles), and anyone selling or renting prop-
 erty. The 1993 Education Act imposes specific duties on local education authorities
 to make provision for the special educational needs of disabled children. Disabled
 rights groups continued to complain that the Gvernment had declined to create an
 enforcement body for the Discrimination Act.
 Rights Now, a onsortium of over 50 independent organizations campaigning for
 laws to end discrimination on the grounds of disability, reported that employers
 were 6 times more likely to turn down a disabled person for a job interview than
 a nondisabled appicant with the same  qualifications; that only 80,000 wheelchair-
 accessible houses were available, and that in the last general election 88 percent
 of plling stations were inaccessible to disabled people.
 Access to buildings is improving but inadequate. Many buildings and train sta-
 tions are so old that they do not have elevators. Since 1985 government regulations
 have required that all new buildings meet the access requirements of all persons
 with impaired mobility. In 1992 the Government put in place similar regulations for
 sensory-impaired persons. Government regulations mandate that by the year 2000
 all taxms be accessible to wheelchairs.
 Religus Minorities.-Despite government efforts, the unemployment rate for
 Catholic men in Northern Ireland remained twice that for Protestant men. The Fair
 Employment (Northern Ireland) Act of 1989, as amended, aims to end even uninten-
 tional or indirect discrimination in the workplace. A fair employment tribunal adju-
 dicates complaints. All public-sector employers and all private firms with over 10
 workers must report annually to the Fair Employment Commission on the religious
 composition of their work force and must review their employment practices at least
 once every 3 years. Noncompliance can bring criminal penalties and loss of govern-
 ment contracts. Victims of employment discrimination may sue for damages. While
 critics of the act have asserted that its targets and timetables are too imprecise,
 most leaders of the Catholic community have praised it as a positive step.
 There have been improvements in fair housing, education, and provision of goods
 and services, althou   there is no legislation to prohibit discrimination on the basis
 of religion in Great ritain.
 Whfe active recruitment of Catholics by the Northern Ireland civil service has
 produced rough proportionality in overall numbers, the service has acknowledged
 that Catholics remain significantly underrepresented in its senior grades, and in
 1993 it declared its intention to overcome this imbalance. Service-wide employment
 cutbacks have thus far hampered its efforts. Government efforts to increase recruit-
 ment of Catholics into the police force (currently 92 percent Protestant) and related
 security fields in the province have been hampred by IRA assassinations and death
 threats as well as widespread antipathy in the Catholic community to the security
 forces. he number of Catholics joining the RUC increased somewhat during the Au-
 gust 1994 to February 1996 cease-fire period but has fallen since, despite continuing
 recruitment efforts.
 National(Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the law prohibits discrimination
 based on race (except in Northern Ireland), persons of African or south Asian origin
 face occasional acts of societal violence and some discrimination. Incitement to racial
 hatred is a criminal offense punishable by a maximum of 2 years' imprisonment.
 The Government strictly enforces the laws and regulations in this area.

 The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted with seri-
 ous concern in March that among the victims of death in custody in the UK were
 a disproportionate number of memibers of minority groups; that police brutality ap-
 pear6d to affect members of minority groups disproportionately; and that allegations
 of police brutality and harassment were reportedly not vigorously investigated and
 perpetrators, once guilt was established, not appropriately punished.
 A. overnment-appointed but independent Commission or Racial Equality (CRE)
 provides guidelines on good practice, supports persons taking court action under the
 Race Relations Act of 1976, and may initiate its own court action. After investigat-
 ing a complaint, the CRE may issue a notice requiring that the discrimination be
 stoppRd. The CRE monitors the response to such a notice for 5 years.
 Following a 2-year examination of the army's household cavalry, the CRE in
 March found that there had been racial discrimination in recruitment and transfer
 and racial abuse and harassment in individual cases. The Ministry of Defense
 agreed to take steps, including monitoring of ethnic recruitment and prompt inves-
 tigation of complaints, to redress these problems.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Workers have the right to form and join unions, and
 the Government fully respects this right in practice. Unions are free of government
 control. Like employers' associations, they must have their accounts certified by the
 Government. Senior union officers must be elected by secret ballot. The law man-
 dates secret ballots before a strike call, prohibits unions from disciplining members
 who reject a legal strike call, and allows members to lodge complaints against their
 union with a government-appointed commissioner.
 There is no specific statutory "right to strike." Voluntary cessation of work may
 be considered a breach of contract. A system of legal immunities from prosecution
 for unions engaged in lawful industrial action was narrowed by acts of Parliament
 in the 1980's. These acts exclude secondary strikes and actions judged to have politi-
 cal motives; unions encouraging such strikes are subject to fines and seizure of their
 assets. The legislation also restricts the ability of unions to act against subsidiaries
 of prime employers with which they are in dispute when the subsidiaries are not
 party to the dispute and are the employers of record.
 In 1993 the Council of Europe (COE) determined that British labor law violated
 the European Social Charter by permitting an employer to dismiss all employees
 who take part in a strike and then, after 3 months, to rehire them selectively. The
 Council requested that the British Government notify them of the measures to be
 taken to remedy this defect, but the Government has not done so because it is no
 longer a party to the Charter.
 Legislation in 1978 and 1990 made it illegal to deny employment on the grounds
 that the applicant is not a union member. The Trade Union Reform and Employ-
 ment Rights Act of 1993 set new procedural requirements for union strikes, dues
 collection, and membership rules. It also made it possible for private citizens, when
 deprived of goods or services due to strike action, to seek damages and to obtain
 assistance in this effort from the Government. The Trade Unions Congress (TUC)
 in 1993 lodged complaints with the International Labor Organization (ILO) on var-
 ious provisions of the 1993 Act (see Section 6.b.). In 1995 a court upheld a provision
 of the Employment Protection Act of 1978, as amended by the Employment Act of
 1988, allowing employers to offer workers financial inducements to give up trade
 union representation. In 1996 the Committee of Experts of the ILO found this law
 in substantial violation of Convention 98 which guarantees the right to organize and
 bargain clectively and asked the UK to amend its legislation. The Government has
 not yet acted on this recommendation.
 Unions participate freely in international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Although there is no legal ob-
 ligation for employers to bargain with workers' representatives, and while labor-
 management contracts are not enforceable in the courts, collective bargaining is
 long standing and widespread, covering about 40 percent of the work force.
 orers who beieve themselves victims of antraunion discrimination may seek re-
 dress through industrial tribunals. Remedies available include payment of indem-
 nities and reinstatement.
 Contrary to ILO Convention 98, it is lawful for employers or others to circulate
 blacklists of union members seeking employment. In 1993 the ILO concluded that
 the British Government was obliged to protect union members from such discrimi-
 nation, but the Government has not responded to this.
 There are no export processing zones in the UK.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited and is not practiced.
 
 
 1201
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-School attendance until the age
 of 16 is compulsory. Children under the age of 16 are not permitted to work in an
 industrial enterprise except as part of an educational course.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage. The
 Trade Uniion Reform and Employment Rights Act of 1993 abolished the wage council
 system, which prior to September 1993 had established minimum hourly wages and
 overtime rates for adult workers in 26 low-wage industries. No legislation limits
 daily or weekly working hours.
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 requires that the health and safety
 of employees not be placed at risk. A Health and Safety Commission effectively en-
 forces regulations on these matters and may initiate criminal proceedings. Workers'
 representati   ively monitr the enforcement. Workers can remove themselves
 from hazardous conditions without risking loss of employment as provided in the
 European Union Framework Diective on Safety and Health.
 In November the European Court determined that an EU directive limiting the
 workweek to 48 hours in most circumstances was applicable to the UK. The Govern-
 ment argued that EU directives dealing with the Social Chapter should not apply
 in the UK because of its "opt out" from this prvision, but agreed to enforce the di-
 rective while undertaking to modify it via changes in the jurisdiction of the Euro-
 pean Court.
