 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a
 mixed economy emphasizing the private sector. It is a member
 of the British Commonwealth. A Governor General, appointed by
 the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister, represents the
 Queen, while the elected Prime Minister, the leader of the
 majority party in Parliament, is the country's chief
 executive. The Parliament is comprised of the elected House
 of Representatives (currently 60 members) and the appointed
 Senate of 21. The powers and procedures of Parliament
 correspond to those of the Westminister model.
 Two major political parties have alternated in power since the
 first elections were held in 1944. The Jamaica Labour Party's
 leader, Edward Seaga, has been Prime Minister since November
 1980. The Constitution requires that general elections be
 held at least once every 5 years; the last general election
 was held on December 15, 1983. However, because an outdated
 voters' list was being used, the PNP boycotted the election
 and the JLP gained all 60 seats in the House of
 Representatives. The next parliamentary elections must be
 held before March 15, 1989.
 The opposition's boycott created an anomalous and
 unprecedented situation for democratic Jamaica. The Jamaica
 Labour Party has attempted to compensate for the absence of an
 elected parliamentary opposition by appointment of independent
 senators to the upper chamber and enhancing opportunities for
 citizens to appear and address the House.
 The small, apolitical security apparatus comes under the
 Ministry of National Security and consists of the Jamaica
 Constabulary Force, the Jamaica Special Constabulary Force,
 and the Jamaica Defense Force. The latter consists of a
 regular and a reserve force and includes an Air Wing and a
 Coast Guard. Since 1974, the Jamaica Defense Force has been
 authorized to conduct joint operations with the police in
 order to maintain the peace under the Suppression of Crime
 Act.
 During 1985 human rights were generally respected in Jamaica.
 Political demonstrations and protests occurred on several
 occasions, including a 3-day island-wide general strike in
 June. The Government maintained order, and violence and
 arrests associated with the protests were minimal. Violent
 crime continued to be a major social problem, especially in
 the Kingston area. Instances of excessive violence by the
 police were criticized in newspaper editorials, by human
 rights advocates, and by the Police Commissioner himself.
 Problems associated with a poorly trained, overburdened, and
 underpaid police force continue to generate the country's most
 persistent human rights concerns.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does not
 occur in Jamaica. However, Jamaica suffers from a high level
 of violent crime, some of which has political overtones. Both
 
 
 594
 JAMAICA
 major parties, as well as the Workers Party of Jamaica (WPJ)
 which is communist, have supporters who occasionally resort to
 violence. The legal system has not been effective in dealing
 with these cases because of a code of silence enforced at the
 local level and the reluctance of the police to get involved
 in political disputes.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances perpetrated by security forces. In most
 incidents where people disappear and are later discovered
 dead, the victims are involved in criminal activities or were
 suspected of being police informers.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government does not sanction or condone the use of
 torture. However, criminal suspects frequently allege that
 they were beaten or mistreated by police while being held in
 police lock-ups. Some individuals have brought suit
 successfully against the police for these actions and the
 Government has had to pay damages.
 During 1985 there was a public outcry concerning the level of
 violence associated with the police. Impromptu demonstrations
 protesting indiscriminate police killings have taken place in
 various communities. There have been frequent editorials and
 speeches, including several by the new National Police
 Commissioner, on the need to improve the force through better
 training, better supervision, and elimination of unsuitable
 persons, but the process of reform is slow.
 The lynching of criminal suspects by local inhabitants,
 especially in rural Jamaica, occurs periodically. Victims,
 typically, are those caught stealing crops or cattle or guilty
 of rape or housebreaking. Although these incidents are
 publicized, prosecutions of vigilantes are rare.
 Prison conditions in Jamaica are acknowledged by the
 Government to be substandard. The Parliamentary Ombudsman
 reports conditions have further deteriorated since 1984, when
 he released a study on the deplorable state of facilities and
 the degrading conditions in the nation's jails. Overcrowding,
 lack of functioning plumbing facilities, and limited medical
 care are particularly bad in the island's two maximum security
 prisons. With government resources extremely limited, one
 citizens group began a fundraising campaign to aid the women's
 prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Suppression of Crime Act, which has been extended
 for 6-month intervals since its adoption in 1974, security
 forces do not need a warrant to detain persons "reasonably"
 suspected of having committed a crime. Although the Act is
 conceived of as an extraordinary measure, security forces rely
 on it extensively. Particularly in ghetto areas, detention of
 suspects without a warrant is regularly practiced. Nearly all
 detainees are eventually released without being charged. Some
 are held for as long as 2 weeks without being brought before a
 judicial officer as required by law. Habeas corpus is
 available, but many detainees are not aware of their rights.
 
 
 595
 JAMAICA
 The Jamaica Council for Human Rights reports that 90 percent
 of its routine daily caseload involves assisting people
 attempting to locate and gain the release of detained family
 members. The Council reports that in 1985, under the
 administration of a new Police Commissioner, supervisory
 officers have been more cooperative than in the past in
 providing information about detained persons.
 For those suspects who are charged, a functioning system of
 bail is available. In minor cases, bail is set by the local
 police supervisor, while a judicial officer is involved in
 more serious matters. For those unable to make bail,
 detention prior to a judicial hearing frequently exceeds the
 limits set by law. Outsiders are permitted access to the
 accused. There are no political prisoners in Jamaica.
 Although the Constitution of Jamaica does not specifically
 address the matter of forced or compulsory labor, Jamaica is a
 signatory to the ILO convention prohibiting compulsory labor.
 There have been no allegations of this practice in Jamaica.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jamaica has an independent judiciary. Persons who have been
 charged with a criminal offense have access to legal
 representation, and legal counsel is provided to indigents in
 criminal cases. The Court of Appeal and the Parliament may
 refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in
 the Unfited Kingdom. However, the legal system is
 overburdened, and many cases take years to come to trial.
 In addition to the regular courts, there is also the Gun
 Court, which was established in 1974 as an extraordinary means
 of dealing with the serious problem of violent crime. It
 considers cases involving the illegal use or the possession of
 firearms or ammunition. There are restrictions on public
 attendance and less stringent rules of evidence apply in the
 Gun Court. Hearings are conducted before a judge. In capital
 cases, hearings before the Gun Court serve as preliminary
 hearings to jury trials under the jurisdiction of the Supreme
 Court. The 1983 Gun Court Amendment Act eliminated several of
 the special exceptions to normal judicial rules and procedures
 which had applied to the Gun Court. A committee of senior
 judges continues to review and revise the sentences of persons
 given life terms prior to the adoption of the Gun Court
 Amendment Act.
 Intimidation of witnesses in criminal cases is a chronic
 problem hampering criminal prosecutions in Jamaica. Jurors,
 too, have reported receiving threats from associates of
 criminal defendants. Some convictions have occurred for such
 attempts to subvert the judicial system, and the police have
 announced they will provide assistance to any witness who
 requests protection.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private life of the individual. Individual rights
 are protected, and there is no arbitrary monitoring of
 correspondence or telephones, or restrictions on the receipt
 of foreign publications.
 
 
 596
 JAMAICA
 Under the Suppression of Crime Act, search warrants are not
 required to enter homes or business when a crime is
 "reasonably" suspected. This authority is sometimes abused by
 police, especially in ghetto neighborhoods. Regulations
 approved by Parliament in 1980 require that every effort be
 made by the security forces to have the owner or occupant of
 the premises present during the search.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the Constitution
 and are observed in practice within the broad limits of the
 libel laws and the State Secrets Act. There is no censorship
 or interference in academic studies. Jamaica's principal,
 privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, has been
 critical of Jamaican governments through the years. Several
 small newspapers and magazines are also published, including
 two by the opposition parties, both of which are highly
 critical of government policies. Foreign publications are
 generally available.
 The Government owns and operates one radio network and the
 island's only television network. The other radio network is
 partially owned by the Government. A new media policy
 announced by the Government will retain public ownership of
 television and partial ownership of radio, although some
 television time will be leased out. The officially owned
 television and radio network has often been accused of bias in
 favor of the Government by whichever party is in opposition.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed in the
 Constitution. A large variety of professional groups and
 private associations function freely. Public demonstrations
 and rallies are staged by all political parties, although the
 law requires application for a police permit, which is usually
 granted. In January there were widespread but generally
 nonviolent public protests for 3 days over a 21 percent rise
 in the price of gasoline. Several deaths occurred during the
 protests. However, there were few arrests and the security
 forces were publicly praised for not overreacting to a
 difficult situation. In May, the People's National Party
 obtained a permit to demonstrate at the formal opening of
 Parliament. When party leaders announced at the last minute
 that the protest would be held instead at one of Kingston's
 busiest intersections, the police denied permission. When PNP
 supporters rallied at the new location without a permit,
 police dispersed the crowd with tear gas. There were no
 arrests. In November, police denied without explanation a
 request for a march permit for an antiapartheid demonstration
 in the New Kingston business district.
 Freedom of association includes the right to join a trade
 union. The Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act of
 1975 sets forth workers' rights regarding union membership and
 collective bargaining. No worker is compelled to join a union
 as a prerequisite for getting a job, nor, having found
 employment, is he compelled to join the union that represents
 that bargaining unit. Unions are free to elect their own
 representatives, draw up their constitutions, and determine
 
 
 597
 JAMAICA
 their action programs. Jamaican unions are affiliated with
 various international and regional labor organizations.
 Jamaica has several strong trade unions which are among the
 most active organizations in the country. The two major
 unions, the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and the
 National Workers Union (NWU), are affiliated respectively with
 the ruling Jamaica Labour Party and the opposition People's
 National Party. These two unions can act independently,
 however, and on occasion take issue with party policies. The
 number of registered trade unions is approximately 78; in
 practice, only about 20 are active. Until recently,
 approximately 25-30 percent of the work force was organized,
 although the Government's public sector reduction program has
 lowered this figure.
 There is no right to strike in either common or statutory
 law. What exists in practice is a freedom to strike, which
 Jamaican workers have consistently exercised over the years.
 There have been differing legal rulings on the "right to
 strike." Workers may exercise their "freedom" to strike and
 be immune from criminal liability. There is, however, no
 parallel guarantee under the law that they will retain their
 jobs.
 In June 1985, trade unions called on workers to strike in
 protest against the Government's public sector staff
 reductions and wage offers, spiraling costs for basic
 commodities, and insufficient communication by government
 officials with workers' representatives. After the strike a
 number of firefighters and public service company electric
 workers were dismissed. The firemen were later recalled, but
 the case of the electric workers is now before the Industrial
 Disputes Tribunal. The dismissals have sparked charges of
 victimization (politically motivated dismissal) by the unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and is
 well established in Jamaica. A great variety of religious
 groups and cults operate freely. More than 80 percent of the
 population professes one Christian denomination or another.
 Evangelical Christian movements have gained substantial
 followings in recent years, and foreign evangelists visit
 Jamaica regularly to preach.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees Jamaican citizens freedom of
 movement throughout the country, the right to reside in any
 part of it, the right to enter, and immunity from expulsion.
 There are no national restrictions on foreign travel or
 emigration.  Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 Jamaica's central location in the Caribbean makes it a
 potential hub for illegal migrants and would-be refugees or
 asylum seekers. Consequently, Jamaica has avoided any
 declarative policy on refugees. As a party to the 1951 U.N.
 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, it honors its
 treaty obligations, dealing with refugees on a case-by-case
 basis. Jamaica's reasons for not accepting migrants are
 largely economic ones, and include high domestic
 unemployment.
 
 
 598
 JAMAICA
 In recent years, individuals from Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua
 have arrived in Jamaica claiming to be refugees. Haitians
 have been treated as economic migrants and have been returned
 to Haiti. Six Cubans are currently in Jamaica under the
 protection of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees pending
 resettlement in a third country. All of the Nicaraguans have
 been permanently resettled in Jamaica and elsewhere.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 In Jamaica, the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the
 majority party, and a cabinet made up of ministers appointed
 by him, constitute the executive power. The Executive usually
 takes the initiative in legislative matters and is responsible
 to the House of Represenatives.
 The Constitution requires that elections be held not later
 than 5 years from the first sitting of Parliament; within that
 period, the Prime Minister can call an election whenever he
 sees fit.
 Two main parties, the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and People's
 National Party (PNP), have regularly alternated in power since
 the first elections under universal adult suffrage were held
 in 1944. The JLP came to power in November 1980 when it won a
 majority of seats in the House of Representatives. Other
 opposition groups, including the Communists, operate freely,
 and no group is denied participation in the political
 process.
 In August 1983, voter registration was commenced to bring
 voting lists up to date and help protect the electoral process
 from fraud. In December 1983, prior to completion of this
 process, the Prime Minister called a "snap election." The PNP
 boycotted the vote, alleging that the JLP previously had
 agreed not to hold an election until new voter lists and
 identification cards were ready. As a result of the boycott
 and the failure of any of the seven third-party candidates to
 be elected to the House, there is currently no official Leader
 of the Opposition. As the elected House, composed of 60
 seats, is now under exclusive control of the members of the
 JLP, Jamaica has a "one-party house" but is not a "one-party
 state." Although the 1983 election was constitutional and
 held in conformity with election law, the PNP has continued to
 question its legitimacy. The Government, however, continues
 to resist calls for new elections prior to the expiration of
 its current term in 1989.
 Parliament has also acted to postpone local elections,
 originally due in June 1984. The delay has been due to
 disagreement over the number of possible Council seats. On
 October 16 the Electoral Advisory Commission announced that
 both major parties had accepted a reduction of Council seats
 from 278 to 189. Acceptance of the plan paved the way for the
 actual redrawing of local consitituency boundaries and,
 ultimately, for local government elections. Current
 legislation extends the deadline for local elections until the
 end of July 1986.
 Despite the unprecedented situation caused by a one-party
 Parliament, the democratic tradition remains strong in
 Jamaica. All parties operate freely and have an opportunity
 to state their positions. Eight independent senators,
 
 
 599
 JAMAICA
 appointed by the Prime Minister in the absence of a
 parliamentary oppostion, serve as a check on government
 actions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There has been little interest among international or
 nongovernmental groups in investigating human rights in
 Jamaica. Freedom House rated Jamaica as "free." Amnesty
 International expressed concern in its 1985 report over the
 continued use of the death penalty.
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in
 Jamaica. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights is the only
 independent human rights organization. The Council is
 critical of police abuses and has called for reform of the
 force. Its small paid staff spends the majority of its time
 on cases involving police detention of suspects and on
 complaints from prisoners. Its pool of volunteer attorneys
 frequently represents those appealing death sentences. The
 Council is also involved in international human rights issues,
 particularly those dealing with southern Africa.
 The Government is also a strong advocate of human rights in
 international forums, such as Caricom and the UN. Jamaican
 leaders, including the present Prime Minister, have spoken
 before regional and other international bodies in opposition
 to apartheid.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Jamaica's population of 2,266,000 grew at an annual rate of 1
 percent in 1985, and the per capita gross national product was
 $1,300 (1983 figure).
 While revenues from bauxite/alumina exports, the traditional
 foreign exchange earner, increased during 1984, earnings fell
 sharply in 1985 due to the closure of one mining/refining
 facility and the temporary closure of another because of weak
 markets. Receipts from tourism also fell. Real gross
 domestic product fell by 8.4 percent in 1984; inflation went
 up by 31.3 percent, a significant increase over the 16.7
 percent figure recorded in 1983. The unemployment rate fell
 marginally from 25.6 percent in April 1984 to 25.4 percent in
 October 1984.
 The shortage of foreign exchange and budget cuts have left the
 Government with fewer resources to deal with pressing economic
 and social problems. It has therefore given priority to
 maintaining the flow of raw materials and capital goods needed
 to support Jamaica's private sector-oriented recovery
 program. The import licensing regime has been abolished for
 all but a few items and replaced with higher customs duties,
 prices of most items under price controls have been
 deregulated, and a 50 percent depreciation of the local
 currency took place in 1984. The Government has tried to
 limit the impact of these measures on the basic nutrition of
 the poor through the establishment of a food security plan
 which included food stamps and school lunch programs.
 There are wide disparities in income levels. In October,
 1984, the unemployment rate for males was 16 percent, while
 
 
 600
 JAMAICA
 that for females was more than 36 percent. Rates for young
 men and women were considerably higher. The Government sought
 to reduce some of these disparities through a major
 agriculture program designed to increase production and
 employment in rural areas, job training programs for youth,
 and programs to assist individuals in starting their own
 businesses.
 The adult literacy rate in Jamaica is officially 96.1 percent,
 but the Minister of Education stated in 1985 that the
 functional illiteracy rate was nearly 50 percent. There is
 nearly universal primary school enrollment, but attendance has
 suffered recently as more parents cannot afford to send their
 children to school. Jamaica's educational system is free, but
 families must provide most school books and uniforms for the
 students.
 Under the Government's austerity program, access to education,
 housing, health care, and other services for the low income
 groups has been reduced due to cuts in budget expenditures.
 In the health care area, a proposal to introduce "user fees"
 at primary health clinics was dropped following public
 opposition.
 A minimum wage law was enacted in 1975. Government and most
 private sector employees work a 5-day/40-hour week. While
 there is no statutory provision for overtime payments, unions
 seek overtime and holiday pay benefits in their collective
 bargaining agreements. Statutory provision for leave with pay
 covers vacation, public holidays, sick leave, and maternity
 leave.
 A juvenile act provides that no child under age 12 shall be
 employed except by parents or guardians. Such employment can
 only be in domestic, agricultural, or horticultural work.
 Children under age 12 cannot be employed at night or at any
 industrial site. In actuality, children under age 12 are
 often seen peddling goods and services on the streets.
 Under the Factories Act, all plants must be registered and
 approved by the Ministry of Labour (MOL) before they can begin
 operations. The MOL's industrial safety division is
 responsible for, at minimum, yearly inspections of all
 facilities. Because of budget constraints, these site
 inspections are often not performed. The MOL has no authority
 to oversee private sector work sites and other places of
 employment which do not meet the statutory definition of a
 factory, Other Acts of Parliament establish minimum standards
 for working conditions. It is left to management, in
 consultation with workers or their representatives, to
 negotiate improvements in these standards. Industrial health
 and safety precautions and education are seriously lacking in
 Jamaica.
 Jamaican women are accorded full equality under the
 Constitution, and the 1975 Employment Act guarantees them
 equal pay for equal work. The legal status of women is
 reflected in the number of influential positions they hold in
 the civil service and the Government, including Minister of
 Education, Director of the-Jamaica Information Service, and
 President of the Senate. Nevertheless, because of cultural
 and social values, women often suffer economic
 discrimination. This discrimination frequently evidences
 itself in hiring practices. Access to higher paying jobs and
 
 
 601
 JAMAICA
 positions outside traditional "female" areas is limited. The
 higher paying senior-level positions in business and'
 commercial areas are still predominantly held by men. The
 1975 Act has helped to narrow the gap between men's and
 women's salaries, but disparities remain.
 The Government has a number of programs to help women with the
 problems they face: primary health care clinics for mothers
 and their children; education programs in family planning,
 population, and family life; a special food stamp program for
 pregnant and lactating women and women whose income is below a
 specified minimum amount; agricultural and technical training
 projects and centers to provide continuing education for
 pregnant women. The Government has created a national
 advisory committee for women's affairs. Family law reforms
 based on a report from the Family Law Committee set up in 1975
 have not yet been acted upon by Parliament.
 Jamaica participated actively in the 1985 end-of-decade
 Conference on Women held in Nairobi. Not only was there an
 official delegation of 10 members, but Jamaican women also
 took part in the Nongovernmental Organizations meeting held in
 conjunction with the conference. The current President of the
 Inter-American Commission for Women, Princess Lawes, is a
 Member of Parliament.
