 MOZAMBIQUE
 The People's Republic of Mozambique obtained independence from
 Portugal in 1975. It is governed by a small elite within the
 sole legal party, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique
 (Frelimo), under the leadership of President Samora Machel. The
 party espouses Marxism-Leninism.
 Mozambique is an extremely poor country with an estimated per
 capita annual income of less than $250, in which 85 percent of
 the pop~lace is engaged in subsistence agriculture. A dearth of
 trained personnel, a fragile economy inherited at independence,
 losses suffered during the recent war in Zimbabwe, and disloca-
 tions growing out of a current internal insurgency have impeded
 economic development. Questionable development schemes absorbed
 a major portion of the country's limited resources.
 The integrity of the perso and private property, although
 guaranteed by the Constitution, is diminished due to the still
 weak national judicial system and the excercise of extraordinary
 powers by military and state security entities. The right to
 political participation is limited to involvement with the sole
 political party and programs conducted under its auspices.
 The past year has seen increased disruption in the lives of
 the rural population in the southern and central part of the
 country arising out of an armed insurgency and the Government's
 efforts to defeat it. The insurgents have particularly targeted
 key infrastructure facilities, development projects, and national
 and international transportation links. Gradual institutional-
 ization of the legal system appears to have reduced somewhat the
 incidence of arbitrary detention and confinement. There have
 been indications of further accommodation between the Government
 and organized religions.
 Overall, there have been some small and erratic improvements in
 the human rights situation, as efforts are made to enlist formerly
 disaffected individuals into the Government's fight against the
 insurgency, and as administrative procedures employed in existing
 government institutions are improved. This trend is likely to
 continue in the short term. In the long run, however, signifi-
 cant achievments in human rights will probably require a major
 revamping of the institutions themselves, rather than tinkering
 with administrative procedures.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 In the context of the intensifying confrontation between insur-
 gent and government forces, deaths among the non-combatant popu-
 lation have no doubt increased during 1982. There is no hard
 information on how many killings have actually taken place as a
 result of the conflict, but the total number has been estimated
 in the hundreds. Intimidation, including threats of death and
 actual executions, has credibly been attributed to the insur-
 gents. Civilian government and party workers have been singled
 out for harsh treatment. In contested areas, the population is
 vulnerable to injury or death from both sides. Mozambican govern-
 ment military tribunals, created for the purpose of prosecuting
 "crimes against the people and state security," in 1982 admin-
 istered death sentences against nine individuals found guilty
 of involvement with the insurgency.
 The Mozambican Government charges that the Republic of South
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 16
 
 
 216
 Africa significantly supports the armed insurgency in Mozambique.
 The capture in Mozambique of quantities of military equipment of
 South African origin, the deaths of three apparent saboteurs in
 possession of South African identification, testimony of captured
 insurgents, and other documentary materials have been cited as
 evidence of this involvement. In 1982 there were credible reports
 of at least two probes by South African military units across the
 border into Mozambique and of scores of overflights by South
 African military aircraft.
 During the year a South African citizen with ties to the African
 National Congress and the South African Communist Party was
 killed by a letter bomb in her university office in the Mozambi-
 can capital.
 b. Disappearance
 Civil, criminal, and state security authorities are theoretically
 obligated to inform relatives of an individual's detention. In
 practice the guarantee is not always observed. There does not
 appear to be a systematic pattern of carrying out unannounced
 detentions as an instrument of intimidation or coercion. Persons
 confined for "reeducation" after national independence often have
 been sent to remote locations and their whereabouts and conditions
 not revealed to relatives; an unknown number of individuals per-
 ished without their relatives being notified. Recently, some
 efforts have been made to inform relatives of the status of long-
 term internees in reeducation camps. The Government, as an ele-
 ment of its "offensive for legality" which was initiated in late
 1981 and maintained through 1982, has publicized a small number
 of conspicuous cases of official negligence and wrongdoing in the
 treatment of prisoners. The perpetrators are supposedly punished,
 although specific terms of such punishment are not public know-
 ledge.
 At present, at least 20 foreign citizens are held captive by the
 insurgents. The insurgents reportedly have pressed Mozambican
 citizens into joining their activities.
 C. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Mozambican Constitution. There have
 been no known cases of torture on the part of government agencies
 in 1982. It is impossible to rule out the possibility that
 isolated incidents of torture have occurred, but there appears to
 be no pattern of sanctioned or systematic use of torture. Cases
 of mutilation by insurgent bands to coerce and intimidate the
 population have been documented in Manica, Gaza, and Inhambane
 provinces.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Extremely spartan and often overcrowded conditions of confine-
 ment characterize the country's prisons and detention centers.
 These conditions probably reflect government administrative and
 economic limitations, rather than a calculated means to inflict
 punishment. At "reeducation centers," generally located in very
 remote parts of the country, internees are required to labor to
 feed and shelter themselves. Reports of the centers by journa-
 lists who have visited them describe extremely spartan condi-
 tions, often undefined periods of internment, and the presence
 of individuals held for political reasons.
 Internees in the centers may be individuals suspected of opposi-
 tion to the Government or others whose behavior is deemed "anti-
 social" by the authorities. It is not known whether different
 
 
 treatment is given to different classes of prisoners. Conditions
 are known to vary between camps as a result of physical differ-
 ences in these installations.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A large number of individuals are confined at "reeducation cen-
 ters." These isolated detention camps were established in the
 immediate post-independence period to hold prisoners of all types,
 including those accused of "counter-revolutionary" political
 crimes. Estimates of the number of immates in the centers appear-
 ing in international publications in recent years range from sev-
 eral thousand to 10,000. Despite publicized releases of more
 than one thousand internees in late 1981, probably thousands
 remain confined in such centers.
 The "offensive for legality" prescribes that prisoners in re-
 education centers should enjoy full constitutional protections.
 The Government's Inspector General has toured camps to review
 the cases of inmates and the assignment of fixed sentences.
 While he had been widely expected to report his findings, there
 was no announcement that any report would be made public and
 to date none has been. There is no public breakdown of the
 types of charges lodged against those confined in the centers.
 The concept of habeas corpus is recognized in Mozambican juris-
 prudence but is not always observed. while not specifically
 addressed in the body of law, preventive detention may be employ-
 ed in civil and state security cases if authorities believe a
 violation is probable or imminent. A suspect can be held for up
 to 90 days before charges are brought in serious cases and for
 shorter periods in lesser cases. This investigative period may be
 extended only once for an additional 90 days if the state requires
 more time to prepare its case.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mozambique uses an inquisitional system of justice which invests
 considerable discretion and power in the hands of investigatory
 authorities and trial judges. In important cases, charges
 against an accused person are drawn up by a public prosecutor,
 and a defendant has the right to choose counsel or have a court-
 assigned defender. This right seems to be observed, although the
 vagueness of the definition of "important crimes" allows latitude
 for determining whether or not counsel is actually assured.
 Ju dgement is rendered by the judge and four elected jurors. In
 lesser cases or in district courts, a judge and two jurors con-
 stitute the court. In "popular tribunals" in rural areas, chosen
 individuals with a minimum of a primary school education and
 rudimentary legal orientation are instructed to exercise "good
 sense and application of general principles in deciding disputes
 and minor offenses."
 Several systems of law and detention exist in Mozambique. The
 civil court system, under the Ministry of Justice, apparently
 operates without political intrusion. The Ministry of Interior
 operates "reeducation centers" outside the control of the Justice
 Ministry. New internees may be remanded to the centers by the
 Justice or Interior Ministries. Those sent by the Justice
 Ministry probably have the benefit of some judicial safeguards.
 They apparently are sent to the centers rather than to ordinary
 prisons when their infractions are deemed "anti-social" rather
 than "criminal" in nature; i.e., prostitution. Those sent to
 the centers by the Interior Ministry, which has responsibility
 for some aspects of internal security, may not have had benefit
 of the judicial process, if the Interior Ministry had moved
 
 
 218
 against them as the result of supposed "crimes against the
 state."
 Military tribunals sit in judgement of cases involving "crimes
 against the people and state security." In late 1982, however,
 it was announced that at least one individual charged with
 "economic crimes" would be so tried. It is not believed that a
 military tribunal has yet been convened to try this individual.
 Military tribunals operate in camera and are composed of military
 personnel, some of whom may have some legal training. The right
 of appeal is recognized for civil cases involving serious offenses
 (those carrying a sentence of eight years or more). Persons
 sentenced to death by military tribunals may appeal for clemency
 to the President of the Republic. The operation of the legal
 system and observance of constitutional safeguards, although
 possibly improving as officials gain administrative experience,
 remains fragile.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees the sanctity of the home. In prac-
 tice, judicial and security authorities exercise broad powers in
 authorizing warrants and administrative permission to enter pri-
 vate residences. Although warrantless arrests have been known
 to occur in past years, no cases came to light in 1982. Forced
 entry has occurred in cases presumed to involve state security.
 It is widely assumed that surveillance devices are employed in
 the telephone system. Other clandestine monitoring devices may
 be used at targeted residences and other locations.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public opposition to government and ruling party policies is not
 tolerated, and open criticism of them is confined to issues of
 marginal significance. There is censorship of domestic and
 foreign books and publications through the state's monopoly of
 printing facilities and control over means of distribution of
 literature. As employees of state operated institutions of
 learning, academics are constrained from pursuing studies which
 might run counter to the accepted social philosophy. They are
 encouraged, through their activities, to promote the realization
 of "socialism" in Mozambique.
 The Government owns and operates the only authorized publica-
 tions in the country as it does the radio and experimental tele-
 vision facilities. These media actively disseminate the Govern-
 ment's viewpoint on issues and its general social philosophy.
 Reporting on individual lapses, and failures of government
 policies of marginal importance, is tolerated. Otherwise,
 journalists practice self-censorship and are susceptible to
 pressures exerted by the government-sanctioned association of
 journalists to which they belong.
 The widely assumed presence of electronic surveillance and use of
 informers inhibit free expression.
 The letter bomb assassination in the Mozambican capital of a
 South African citizen may have been intended to inhibit anti-
 South African academic and political activity as well as to
 silence a vocal critic of South Africa. Government and party
 functionaries are a particular target of insurgent groups oper-
 ating in the interior of the country.
 
 
 .219
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and the right to organize are greatly cir-
 cumscribed. The Government and party authorize and dominate so-
 called mass organizations, all professional associations, and
 "production councils" at industrial and commercial enterprises.
 Other public assembly and association is not permitted. "Pro-
 duction councils" are not comparable to free labor organizations
 but act in accordance with government and party instructions and
 precepts. The same is true of recognized professional associa-
 tions. There is no right to strike. In 1982 there were uncon-
 firmed reports of "slow-downs" by stevedores in the Maputo and
 Heirs ports, which apparently were resolved through negotia-
 tion among the workers, shipping companies, and Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Mozambique. The Constitution
 grants individuals the right "to practice or not to practice"
 religion although the official government attitude has been to
 discourage religious activities.
 In the pas year the Government has allowed the Roman Catholic
 Church to assign an additional 27 nuns to the country to con-
 duct humanitarian and religious work. Several priests were also
 allowed to enter the country. These actions were a departure
 from the virtual freeze on the numbers of both nuns and priests
 which had prevailed since independence. In addition, a high-level
 delegation from the Vatican visited Mozambique in 1982 for the
 first time since independence. Preliminary soundings reportedly
 have yielded agreement in principle by the Mozambican Government
 for a papal visit some time in the future. However, government
 restrictions and administrative practices continue to impede the
 Church's activities of conducting services, the clergy's movement
 among parishioners in outlying districts, and proselytizing and
 recruitment.
 Conditions facing other organized religious groups including the
 significant Protestant and Islamic communities are relatively
 more favorable. The practice of traditional cults and ceremonies
 receives official criticism and ridicule but otherwise is allowed
 to take place. Membership in an organized religious group does
 not appear to confer appreciable advantage or disadvantage to an
 individual's secular standing. In December of 1982 the party re-
 iterated that membership in Frelimo was open to believers and
 non-believers.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel and relocation within the country are administratively con-
 trolled by security restrictions and employment requirements
 under the rationale of assuring public and social order. Formal
 emigration by citizens is not addressed in Mozambican law. Un-
 authorized emigrants may be punished by incarceration or "reeduca-
 tion." Expatriates who, for political, civil, or economic reasons
 left the country before independence are encouraged to return.
 Mozambican citizenship was revoked for those who, at independence,
 opted for the nationality of the former colonial power. In gen-
 eral, the Government has responded positively to those requesting
 reinstatement of their Mozambican nationality. Some Mozambicans
 who opposed the party before independence, however, were jailed
 for suspected disloyalty to the new regime on their return to the
 country.
 A 1980 agreement with Swaziland providing for the return of
 
 
 220
 illegal entrants in each other's country appears to have been
 applied primarily toward economic refugees. It is not believed
 to have been invoked in 1982. Mozambique has an average of 35-50
 persons with recognized refugee status in the country at any one
 time. An unknown number of South Africans are in Mozambique with
 informal status, having fled their country for alleged political
 and human rights infringements.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mozambique's only legal party, Frelimo, totally dominates legal
 political activity in the country. A small group of senior
 officials directs the party and state apparatus. Frelimo claims
 to have 100,000 members. Mass political involvement occurs at
 local, district, and provincial levels, but initiatives and
 directives emanate from above. Election to representative
 bodies is made from a single slate and affords the population
 the option of endorsing or rejecting candidates pre-selected by
 party structures. In the national popular assembly, votes en-
 dorsing government policies are invariably unanimous. All adult
 Mozambicans may take part in what political process exists.
 Women hold many positions in both the party and Government.
 There is no apparent exclusion from political activities due to
 regional, racial, or religious factors.
 3. Government Attitudes Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Mozambique is not a signatory to international human rights or
 refugee conventions, and it has not been the subject of systema-
 tic investigations conducted by official international organiza-
 tions. Amnesty International, relying upon confidential reports
 and public documents, has registered concerns with detention at
 reeducation centers without trial, political imprisonment, and
 the use of the death penalty. The Government has not responded
 publicly to these charges. In past years, the Government has
 allowed journalists and selected scholars to visit, under super-
 vision, its reeducation centers.
 There is a resident representative of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and a chapter of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross. The organizations rely upon the
 cooperation and logistical assistance of the Mozambican Govern-
 ment in fulfilling their functions. Mozambique provided for
 numerous refugees during the Zimbabwe independence war at con-
 siderable cost.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Mozambique, a country of 12.6 million people, has a per capita
 Gross National Product of less than $250. Approximately 85 per-
 cent of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture.
 Because of a series of natural disasters ranging from floods to
 drought, as well as an economic system that offers few incen-
 tives to peasant farmers, food production has fallen far short
 of domestic requirements. In an attempt to meet the population's
 nutritional requirements, the country has had to spend a signifi-
 cant portion of its meager foreign exchange earnings on imports
 of food. Mozambique also received sizable food aid from abroad.
 The industrial sector has fared no better. Productivity has
 suffered from shortages of raw materials, equipment, spare parts,
 and trained personnel. Due to the dearth of foreign exchange,
 the country has been unable to ease the shortages through imports.
 As a result, most factories and plants operate at less than 50
 percent of capacity and even key companies undergo occasional
 
 
 221
 work stoppages.
 The Government has adopted a socialist economic system and the
 number and influence of state enterprises continue to grow. The
 Government has implemented a policy of devolving small businesses
 and shops to private individuals, but the right to own property is
 restricted. The country has intensified its efforts to attract
 foreign investment, but so far has had only very limited success.
 International aid donors report that their contributions are em-
 ployed for the purposes for which they were allocated and not
 diverted for other uses. The Government has focussed primarily
 on improving health and human services and agricultural produc-
 tion. Programs and benefits are administered in a non-discrimin-
 atory fashion. There is no evidence of racism either officially
 or unofficially, and there are no major conflicts among the
 nation's ethnic groupings. Many ethnic Portuguese and Asians
 hold senior positions in the Government. Equality for women is
 .guaranteed under the Constitution, and the Government has taken
 active steps to protect the rights of women.
 Mozambique faces major developmental problems. Because reliable
 statistics are unavailable, it is difficult to gauge how success-
 ful the country has been in its efforts to promote social welfare.
 The population growth rate was estimated to be 4.0 percent per
 annum in 1981. Despite the difficulties encountered in feeding
 its people, the Government has encouraged a high population
 growth rate, reasoning that the present population density of
 15.8 per square kilometer is too low. Medical care remains a
 problem. The Government has made a concerted effort to expand
 medical training programs and to increase the number of clinics
 in rural areas, but the quality of medical personnel remains
 low. Efforts are also hampered by a shortage of medical supplies.
 These difficulties of delivering health services to rural areas
 are aggravated by the unrest in much of the countryside as a
 result of the insurgency.
 There is a large discrepancy between the quality of medical care
 offered in major cities and in rural areas. For example, the
 infant mortality rate now averages about 115 per 1,000 live births
 nationwide but varies from a low of 35 per 1,000 in sections of
 the capital to a high of 190 per 1,000 in certain rural areas.
 Currently, life expectancy at birth is approximately 47 years.
 The Government has also encountered difficulties in other areas
 of public health. An inoculation program has had some success,
 but malnutrition remains a problem. At least 30 percent of
 Mozambican children under the age of 12 suffer from undernourish-
 ment or malnutrition. Malnutrition so debilitates children's
 resistance to disease that an many as 40 percent of all deaths in
 Mozambique occur among children under the age of five. Fewer than
 10 percent of the population has access to safe water supplies.
 In the past few years, outbreaks of cholera have occured even in
 Mozambique's two largest cities, Maputo and Beira.
 Mozambique has continued to make some gains in education. The
 Government has emphasized teacher training programs, particularly
 in rural areas. Many teacher training centers, however, lack
 adequate facilities and are grossly understaffed. As a result,
 although there are now more schools and more teachers in rural
 areas, the quality of instruction available is low.
 The Government estimates that 50-60 percent of the primary school
 population is enrolled in school. This figure can be misleading
 both because of the poor quality of the schools and because many
 primary school enrollees are in fact older students or even
 adults. Similarly, the literacy rate has risen as a result of
 
 
 222
 government programs and now reportdly stands at 15-20 percent,
 but this statistic includes many people who can do little more
 than read and write their own names. Despite the Government's
 efforts to allocate its limited resources in as egalitarian a
 fashion as possible, there are still large differences between
 the quality of services offered in rural and urban areas.
