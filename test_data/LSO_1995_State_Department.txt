 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle of the
 Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) is the Head of Government. Since winning free
 and fair elections in 1993, the BCP has controlled the Government and Parliament.
 Under the 1993 Constitution, the King has no executive authority. In 1994 King
 Letsie Im unconstitutionally suspended Parliament and installed a Ruling Council.
 Local and international pressure led to a rapid return of constitutional government.
 The security forces consist of the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF), the Lesotho
 Mounted Police (LMP), and the National Security Service (NSS). The three services
 are under the control of the Defense Commission comprised of the Prime Minister,
 the LDF Commander, Deputy LDF Commander, LMP Commissioner, Deputy LMP
 Commissioner, and Director of the NSS. However, the Commission is independent
 of Parliament, and the civil Government exerts little control over the security forces.
 Although there were fewer disturbances and human rights abuses than in 1994, se-
 curity forces continued arbitrarily to detain and harass government officials. Some
 police personnel engaged in looting during a May salary dispute. The BCP Govern-
 ment took no action to punish the offenders in these incidents or in the more exten-
 sive disturbances of 1994.
 A landlocked country surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is almost entirely de-
 pendent on its sole neighbor for trade, finance, employment, and access to the out-
 side world. A large proportion of the adult male work force is employed in South
 African mines; miners' remittances account for around 40 percent of the gross na-
 tional product (GNP). Real gross domestic product grew an estimated 7.5 percent
 during 1995 with inflation predicted at less than 8 percent. Per capita GNP was ap-
 proximately $690. State-owned organizations predominate in the agro-industrial and
 agribusines sectors, but private sector activity dominates in manufacturing and
 construction. Under Lesotho's traditional chieftainship structure, land is controlled
 by the chiefs and owned by the Kingdom, precluding private ownership of land.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there continued to be problems in some areas. Lack of discipline in the security
 forces led to continued arbitrary detentions and harassment. The Government ac-
 knowledged that a number of pr-existing laws were inconsistent with human rights
 prvisions of the new Constitution but did not act to repeal the laws. For example,
 the legal prvisions that allowed for lengthy detention without trial continued in
 force. The authorities did not investigate or prosecute anyone for extrajudicial
 killings and brutality committed in previous years. Women's rights continued to be
 severely restricted, and violence against women remained widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial King.-In August a student at the National
 University, Edward Fob, was shot and kiled allegedly by a member of the LDF
 and others. A soldier and a civilian have been arrested while the Government inves-
 tigates this incident which does not appear to have been politically motivated. How-
 ever, the authorities did not investigate or prosecute any security officials for the
 extrajudicial or summary killings committed during the political unrest of 1994.
 They also failed to investigate 1994 reports of police brutality, as well as pre-1994
 reports of deaths in police custody of a number of unionists and criminal suspects.
 b. Disappearance.-oThere were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 ce. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or D e   cutreatment or Punishment.-
 In Marsh the President of the Lesotho Law Society, K. Thabang Khauoe, was de-
 tained and physically abused by members of the LMP. Khauoe had legally chal-
 lenged the restoration of Kin g Mosh oeshoe II. Moreover, the Government did not in-
 vestigate the numerous incidents that occurred in 1994 and previous years.
 In general, prison facilities in Lesotho are overcrowded and in disrepair but do
 not threaten th health or lives of inmates. Conditions are not monitored independ-
 Und.rbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-dMembers of the NSS arbitrarily detained
 cabinet members and other senior government officials. In June then Foreign Min-
 ister Mpho Malie was forced out oa his car and obliged to walk home by persons
 believed to  work for the NSS. Then Foreign     Ministry Principal Secretary
 Nthabiseng Monoko also reported being interrogated and having her car temporarily
 confiscatedby NSS personnel. NSS officials also reportedly detained and harassed
 a number of other lower level government officials.
 
 
 In general, pretrial detainees constitute a significant portion of total prison popu-
 lation; up to one-half in some locations. Because of backlogs, pretrial remand can
 last several years.
 Persons detained or arrested in criminal cases, and defendants in civil cases, have
 the right to legal counsel. The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as
 amended in 1984, makes provision for the granting of bail. Bail is granted regularly
 and generally fairly.
 Although the Government acknowledged that the Internal Security Act (ISA) of
 1984 is partly inconsistent with the new Constitution, the ISA remains in force. The
 ISA provides for s-called investigative detention without charge or trial in political
 cases for up to 42 days (the first 14 days on order of the police; the second 14 days
 on order ofthe Police Commissioner; and the final 14 days on order of theMinister
 of Defense--a portfolio now held b the Prime Minister). A political case involves
 subversion," a term loosely defined in the ISA to include "any act or thing   * reu-
 dicial to public order, the security of Lesotho, or the administration of justice. The
 Act also allows for detention of witnesses in security cases and permits the Minister
 of Defense to "restrict" a person who, in the opinion of the Police Commissioner, is
 acting in a manner prejudicial to public order, security, or the administration ofjus-
 tice.
 There were no known restrictions or detentions under the Act; legal professionals
 held that any such attempt to detain persons would promptly be declared unconsti-
 tutional by the High Court. There were no known political detainees.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal
 (which meets semiannually), the High Court, magistrate's courts, and customary or
 traditional courts, which exist largely in rural areas to administer customary law.
 The High Court Chief Justice's decision in 1994 to swear in a provisional Ruling
 Council, in defiance of the Constitution, raised new questions about the independ-
 ence of the judiciary. In particular, magistrates appear susceptible to governmental
 or chieftainship influence. Accused persons have and use the right to counsel and
 public trial. The authorities generally respect court decisions and rulings.
 There is no trial by jury. Criminal trials are normally adjudicatedby a single
 High Court judge who presides, with two assessors serving in an advisory capacity.
 In civil cases judges normally hear cases alone. The High Court also provides proce-
 dural and substantive advice and guidance on matters of legal procedure to military
 tribunals; however, it does not participate in arriving at judgments. Military tribu-
 nals have jurisdiction only over military cases, and their decisions may not be ap-
 pealed. Lesotho's law and custom severely limit the rights of women (see Section
 5), but court treatment of women is not discriminatory.
 There were no trials for political offenses. There were no reports of political pris-
 oners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though search warrants are usually required under normal circumstances, the ISA
 provides police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles and to
 enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a warrant. The security
 services are believed to monitor routinely telephone conversations of Basotho and
 foreigners on national security grounds.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights,
 which are generally respected in practice. The independent newspapers, including
 one each controlled by the Roman Catholic and Lesotho Evangelical churches, and
 two English-language weeklies, routinely criticize the Government. The official
 media, which consist of one radio station, a 1-hour daily newscast on a local tele-
 vision channel, and two weekly newspapers, faithfully reflect official positions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under a mid-1993 revision of
 the ISA, a public meeting, rally, or march no longer requires prior police permission,
 only advance notification. However, police or local authorities repeatedly interfered
 with this right. In August, for example, police turned away striking teachers who
 were attempting to march through downtown Maseru.
 The Government did not investigate or prosecute any of the security personnel
 who killed and wounded several protesters at a peaceful 1994 progovernment dem-
 onstration.
 In addition to the BCP and the Basotholand National Party (BNP), there are sev-
 eral smaller politicalpies. Political party meetings and rallies occurred regularly
 throughout Lesotho. There are no restrictions on political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens generally are able to move freely within the country and across
 national boundaries. The Government places no obstacles in the way of citizens who
 wish to emigrate.
 In 1994 the Government allowed about 25 refugees to register with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to study in Lesotho. They were expected
 to return to their countries of first asylum after completing their studies. Other
 than these students, Lesotho has no resident refugee population.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In the first multiparty democratic elections in over 20 years, the BCP swept into
 power in 1993 with complete control of the Parliament. Despite the landslide elec-
 toral victory, the BCP Government was forced to contend with a number of chal-
 lenges to its power in 1994. Those challenges culminated in August when King
 Letsie I unconstitutionally suspended the Parliament and installed a Ruling Coun-
 cil. Many Basotho responded by demonstrating their support for the democratically
 elected BCP Government. Organized labor and others held two national "stayaways"
 to demonstrate support for the ousted Government, and there were numerous rallies
 at the National University. As a result of both local and international pressure, the
 King soon reversed himself, and the BCP regained control of the Government. The
 Memorandum of Understanding between King Letsie III and Prime Minister
 Mokhehle, which was brokered by South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, called for
 the reinstatement of the King's father, Moshoeshoe II, who had been deposed by the
 previous military government and exiled in 1990, in addition to steps to broaden
 sotho's political process. Early in 1995, Moshoeshoe 11 was returned to the throne.
 The 1994 suspension of the Constitution, although short-lived, highlighted the fra-
 gility of constitutional rule.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics, but women remained underrepresented. There is one woman in the Cabinet,
 the Minister of Natural Resources. There are 2 other women in the 65-member As-
 sembly and 7 women in the 33-member Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not hinder the activities of various nongovernmental human
 rights groups. These groups freely criticized both the Government and the short-
 lived Ruling Council. The Government was cooperative during an Amnesty Inter-
 national visit.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, Disability, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1993 Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, lan-
 guage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, birth or other
 status, and the Government generally respected these prohibitions in practice.
 Women.-Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs frequently. Statistics
 are not available, but the problem is believed widespread. In Basotho tradition a
 wife may return to her 'maiden home" if physically abused by her husband; in com-
 mon law, wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault. Few domestic
 violence cases are brought to trial. Women's rights organizations, such as the local
 chapter of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, have taken a leading
 role in educating Basotho women as to their rights under customary and common
 law, highlighting the importance of women fully participating in the democratic
 process.
 Both law and custom severely limit the rights of women in such areas as property,
 inheritance, and contracts. Women have the legal and customary right to make a
 will and sue for divorce. However, under customary law, a married woman is consid-
 ered a minor during the lifetime of her husband; she cannot enter into any legally
 binding contract, whether for employment, commerce, or education, without her hus-
 band's consent. A woman married under customary law has no standing in court
 and may not sue or be sued without her husband's permission. Senior government
 officials have publicly criticized customary practice which discriminates against
 women. The Government has committed to implement the plan of action from the
 Fourth International Conference on Women, held in Beijing in September.
 Children.-The government has not addressed directly children's rights and wel-
 fare, although it has devoted substantial resources to primary and secondary edu-
 cation. There is no pattern of societal abuse against children, but many children
 work at a young age (see Section 6.d.).

 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not legislated or mandated acces-
 sibility to public buildings for the handicapped.
 Discrimination against physically disabled persons in employment, education, or
 provision of other government services is unlawful. However, societal discrimination
 is commonplace.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Most citizens speak a common language and
 share common historical and cultural traditions. Small numbers of Asians (pri-
 marily ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are active in the coun-
 try's commercial life. Economic and racial tension between the Chinese business
 community, specifically textile and garment industry employers, and the Basotho re-
 mained a problem.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to join or form unions
 without prior government authorization. A large percentage of the male labor force
 works in South African gold and coal mines. The remainder are primarily engaged
 in traditional agriculture. There are small public and industrial sectors. A majority
 of Basotho mineworkers are members of the South African National Union of
 Mineworkers (NUM). However, as a foreign organization, the NUM is not permitted
 to engage in union activities in Lesotho.
 Unaer the 1993 Labor Code, prepared with the assistance of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), all trade union federations require government registra-
 tion. There are two trade union federations: the Lesotho Trade Union Congress
 (LTUC) and the Lesotho Federation of Democratic Unions (LFDU). The Government
 registered neither federation but made no attempt to inhibit their activities. Unions
 are not tied to political parties. Overall, unionized workers represent only about 10
 percent of the total work force.
 No legally sanctioned strike has occurred since independence in 1966. Legal pro-
 tection for strikers against retribution has not been enforced in cases of illegal
 strikes. Employers dismissed several hundred workers in the textile industry follow-
 ing wildcat strikes in 1994, and the Government maintained it could not oblige their
 employers to reinstate them. Security forces violently suppressed some of the strikes
 in the textile, garment, and construction sectors during 1994.
 There were no instances of governmental restrictions on international affiliations
 or contacts by unions or their members.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-All legally recognized trade
 unions in principle enjoy the legal right to organize and bargain collectively, but in
 practice the authorities often restrict these rights. Although there was some bar-
 gaining between unions and employers to set wage and benefit rates, employers gen-
 erally continued to set wage rates through unilateral action. For example, the Gov-
 ernment unilaterally rescinded a pay increase granted to teachers early in 1995.
 Lesotho has several industrial zones, in which mostly textile and apparel firms
 engage in manufacturing for export. All national labor laws apply in these industrial
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1987 Employment Act pro-
 hibits forced or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that such labor is prac-
 ticed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment in commercial or industrial enterprises is 14. In practice, however, chil-
 dren under 14 are often employed in the textile and garment sector and in family-
 owned businesses. As much as 15 percent of the textile work force of some 15,000
 may be children between the ages of 12 and 15, according to a 1994 U.S. Depart-
 ment of Labor study. There are prohibitions against the employment of minors in
 commercial, industrial, or nonfamily enterprises involving hazardous or dangerous
 working conditions, but enforcement is very lax. The Ministry of Labor and Employ-
 ment's Inspectorate is grossly understaffed. Basotho under 18 years of age may not
 be recruited for employment outside of Lesotho. In Lesotho's traditional society, rig-
 orous working conditions for the country's young "herdboys" are considered a pre-
 requisite to manhood and a fundamental feature of Basotho culture beyond the
 reach of labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Wages are low. Statutory monthly minimum
 wages in the established categories range from the equivalent of $80 (294 maloti)
 for an unskilled laborer to $154 (565 maloti) for a heavy vehicle driver. At the low
 end, minimum wages are insufficient to ensure a minimum decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. Most wage earners supplement their income through sub-
 sistence agriculture or remittances from relatives employed in South Africa. Many
 employers in Lesotho now pay more than minimum wages in an effort to attract
 and retain motivated employees.
 
 
 The 1993 Labor Code spells out basic worker rights, including a 45-hour work-
 week, a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, 12 days' paid leave per year, and
 paid public holidays. The Code requires employers to provide adequate light, ven-
 tilation, and sanitary facilities for employees and to install and maintain machinery
 to minimize the risk of injury. In practice, employers generally follow these regula-
 tions only within the wage economy in urban areas and the Ministry of Labor and
 Employment enforces the regulations haphazardly. he Labor Code does not explic-
 itly protect the right of workers to remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without prejudice to employment. But Labor Code sections on safety in the work-
 place, and dismissal, imply that dismissal in such circumstances would not be legal.
