 MOROCCO*
 Morocco is a constitutional monarchy whose King effectively
 dominates the country through the exercise of his wide-ranging
 governmental powers and his traditional role as spiritual
 leader of the country's predominantly Muslim population. The
 King makes all major political decisions, appoints and
 dismisses the Prime Minister and cabinet members, promulgates
 laws, presides over the Council of Ministers, may dissolve the
 nation's single legislative body (the House of
 Representatives), and may exercise powers by decree. 'The King
 often expresses his desire to strengthen democracy, and some
 democratic practices and institutions in Morocco are in
 place. The Constitution provides for a pluralistic political
 system and a parliamentary form of government, and stipulates
 the freedoms of movement, expression, and association, among
 others. The Parliament exercises little power, however. Past
 elections have not been truly free, and constitutional freedoms
 are frequently ignored in practice. While significant
 restrictions exist, the political system remains open to
 gradual change.
 The security apparatus is composed of several overlapping
 police and paramilitary organizations, operating within a
 framework of legal provisions designed to maintain public
 order. All of the organizations are under the King's ultimate
 control, though many are administered on a day-to-day basis by
 the Interior Minister. In recent years, especially after the
 riots of 1981-82 and 1984, Interior and Surete Nationale
 officials have been placed in administrative posts in other
 ministries, such as the Ministry of Religious Affairs, to
 assure a pervasive Interior Ministry presence.
 Private property and private investment predominate in the
 economy. Morocco is rapidly undergoing urbanization; nearly
 50 percent of the population now lives in cities and towns.
 Unemployment and underemployment remain at about 25 percent of
 the work force, and the creation of new jobs continues to lag
 behind population growth. New entrants to the labor force
 number more than 200,000 annually, and the majority are
 unlikely to find full-time employment.
 Reports of police brutality and torture and of cruel treatment
 and substandard conditions within prisons continued. There
 were almost daily reports of hunger strikes, petitions, and
 other forms of protest on the part of both prisoners and their
 families. Some Moroccans were in prison and in exile solely
 because of their political beliefs. A new study, "Human
 Rights in Moroccan Law," presented at a national colloquium on
 human rights organized by the Moroccan Bar Association in
 Oujda in December 1987-, substantiated these abuses.
 The human rights situation did not improve significantly in
 1988 and may have deteriorated. On January 20, a violent
 clash between police and some 3,000 peacefully demonstrating
 Fez university students resulted, according to the Government,
 in one student fatality and some 20 injuries to police and
 students. Unofficial sources placed the fatalities as high as
 eight or more and the injured in the dozens. Fueled by
 grievances over academic and administrative restrictions, as
 *A separate section on the Western Sahara is appended to this
 report.

 MOROCCO
 well as by the harsh overreaction of the police who arrived on
 the scene, the Fez incident sparked a series of demonstrations,
 walkouts, and disturbances by both university and high school
 students in other Moroccan cities. However, unlike at Fez,
 the response of the Moroccan authorities was measured and
 restrained in their reactions to the later demonstrations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been few new permanent disappearances in recent
 years, and none were reported in 19&8. However, temporary
 "disappearances" continue as a result of the practice of
 holding persons for long periods of pretrial detention without
 notification of families or attorneys.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 A 1987 Oujda Bar Association study reported that the number of
 incidents of torture, whether conducted in police stations or
 at secret locations, is high and increasing, and most
 frequently involve detainees accused of politically related
 charges. The study described in detail 15 common techniques
 of physical and mental torture employed by the Moroccan
 authorities, which in some cases have led to death or
 permanent physical or mental defects.
 Two Moroccan human rights organizations charged in a joint
 declaration in March that seYen Moroccan prisoners were
 tortured over a period of 10 days in January and February.
 The Justice Ministry denied the allegations as "unfounded and
 without truth." Other reliable reports have confirmed the use
 of torture and other forms of cruel treatment by police
 authorities to extract confessions from detainees and punish
 prisoners accused of both ordinary and political crimes.
 Public officials are largely protected by law from
 investigation and prosecution for acts of torture, although in
 one case of torture leading to death, two gendarmes were
 suspended.
 Two human rights organizations issued a communique in
 September declaring that "there is not any improvement,
 tangible or intangible, in the conditions of political
 prisoners in Morocco." Prison legislation and standards have
 not been changed since the colonial period, and the amount of
 funds appropriated for penitentiaries has not been made
 public. Prisoners are held in degrading conditions; the 1987
 Oujda bar study reports acute overcrowding, appalling hygienic
 conditions in kitchens, cells, and dispensaries, poor medical
 care, extremes of heat and cold, and lack of ventilation.
 Disease is prevalent, with a high incidence of permanent
 defects, chronic illnesses, and mental disorders. Deaths,
 suicides, hunger strikes, and revolt reportedly occur as a
 result."
 
 
 1434
 MOROCCO
 There are almost daily press reports on prison conditions and
 abuses committed by the Moroccan police and prison authorities.
 Many of these reports are based on letters sent to the press
 by prisoners and their families, who also complain that they
 are denied visitation rights and the right to deliver food to
 the prisoners.
 In its 1988 Report, Amnesty International (AI) noted that it
 continued to receive reports of ill-treatment, including
 beatings, of detainees in police custody, as well as new
 reports of the torture of prisoners in previous years. It
 also observed that complaints of torture or ill-treatment did
 not appear to have been fully or impartially investigated by
 the courts. AI cited the case of a juvenile prisoner reported
 to have been tortured apparently after protesting a decision
 "to move him...to a prison wing where conditions were much
 worse. Guards were reported to have encouraged criminal
 prisoners to take part in the attack on him."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Moroccan law requires that a detainee be brought before a
 judge within 4 days of detention and informed of the charges
 against him. The police can request a 48-hour extension of
 that period. For political crimes, a detainee can be held 8
 days, with a 4-day extension. These legal requirements,
 however, are widely ignored, and detainees are often held for
 up to several weeks or longer before being brought before a
 judge, frequently without notice or access to their families
 or attorneys. It is during these periods of incommunicado
 detention that torture and inhuman treatment allegedly takes
 place most frequently. Families can usually learn of
 detainees' location through their own efforts.
 Most persons are arrested in public view, but police sometimes
 refuse to identify themselves, and warrants are not always
 used. Arrests are frequently made only on the basis of
 suspicion. Moroccan law requires that a lawyer be in
 attendance after the initial presentation of the detainee
 before the review court, but no such right exists for the
 prior period of police custody. Morocco does not have an
 extensive system of bail, although defendants are sometimes
 released on their own recognizance. Moroccan law does not
 have a specific provision for habeas corpus or its equivalent.
 Under a separate code of military justice, military personnel
 have been detained in past years without warrants or
 announcement of trial. No such incidents were confirmed in
 1988.
 Although reliable estimates of arbitrary arrests and
 incommunicado detention are not available, the Moroccan press
 reported several dozen arrests during the first half of 1988
 involving workers, trade unionists, secondary school teachers,
 and university professors. Their families were reportedly
 never notified of the reason for the arrests or the fate of
 those arrested. The arrestees were described either as
 Islamic conservatives or students belonging to the banned
 leftist National Union of Moroccan Students (UNEM). It is
 estimated that the actual nuiber of those arrested greatly
 exceeded the number reported.
 There are no known instances of political activists sentenced
 to exile, although allegations were made in 1987 that Moroccan
 security forces had ordered citizens to leave Morocco or face
 criminal charges. There are activists who prefer to remain
 
 
 1435
 MOROCCO
 abroad rather than risk arrest on their return to Morocco.
 According to some reports, the Government has refused to issue
 passports which might enable large numbers of exiles to return.
 As of the fall of 1988, there was no sign that any Moroccan
 activist living in exile would return to Morocco. The Oujda
 colloquium on human rights called for the restoration of all
 rights to exiles, including the right to return, to move about
 within the country, and to travel abroad.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Morocco has a well developed judicial system which includes
 courts of original jurisdiction, appellate courts, and a
 supreme court. Although most cases are handled by
 civilian/secular courts based in part on French legal
 tradition, Morocco has a parallel judicial system using
 Islamic legal principles to deal with marriage, divorce, child
 custody, and inheritance for Muslim Moroccans. Western legal
 practices are not applicable in the Islamic courts; Koranic
 principles govern the limited kinds of cases heard.
 In general, cases are brought before an initial review
 court--the court of first instance in Morocco--which can call
 for a hearing quickly to bring cases to trial- The detainee
 is informed of charges and questioned by the judge to decide
 if they-have merit. If not, or if the infraction is minor,
 the judge may release the detainee or impose a light sentence.
 If a lengthy investigation is required, the judge may release
 detainees on their own recognizance. In cases of political
 crimes, detainees are. often held for long periods prior to
 trial. Defendants have the right of appeal.
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered
 susceptible to political intervention and control in cases
 viewed as challenges to royal authority or state policy. The
 Oujda colloquium, for example, called for measures to
 strengthen the independence of the judiciary and to protect
 defense attorneys from prosecution for their words, actions,
 and practices. Human rights activists claim that only a
 minority of lawyers dare to take cases of defendants involved
 in political issues, and some defense lawyers are intimidated
 or persecuted. According to the 198 Oujda study, trials
 involving political issues are held in an atmosphere of
 harassment, designed to confuse both defendants and their
 attorneys. Because of overcrowding of court dockets and lack
 of judicial resources, defendants often receive only cursory
 hearings, and judges depend on police reports to decide
 cases. Although the State provides an attorney at public
 expense for serious crimes (when the sentence is over 5
 years), appointed attorneys often provide inadequate
 representation. For lesser crimes, needy defendants usually
 are not represented by counsel.
 Although the Government has stated that there are no political
 prisoners, most observers estimate that there still remain as
 many as 300 prisoners held for political activities dating as
 far back as the early 1970's and sentenced to long terms up to
 life imprisonment. According to an estimate published in June
 by the Moroccan Association of Human Rights, Kenitra Central
 Prison alone contains 41 political prisoners (most of whom
 were sentenced by the Casablanca Court of Appeals in 1977 on
 charges of endangering the internal security of the State).
 
 
 1436
 MOROCCO
 In addition, there remain approximately 125 Moroccans convicted
 of Islamic fundamentalist activities, although some sources
 insist that the number could be as many as several hundred.
 Human rights groups in Europe assert that nearly 1,600 persons
 were tried and sentenced following riots in 1984. Many have
 been released after completing their terms, but estimates of
 those still in prison range in the hundreds. The Oujda human
 rights colloquium called for an amnesty of all prisoners
 incarcerated for political or trade union activities.
 Al's 1988 Report noted reports of detainees who, in addition
 to possible torture and ill-treatment, were "convicted on the
 basis of confessions which they said had been extracted under
 duress."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary government interference in the private lives of
 citizens is relatively infrequent. The Constitution states
 that the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation
 may take place without a judicial warrant. However, this
 stipulation is not always observed in practice, and there
 continued to be allegations of illegal searches of homes and
 offices of political activists and those suspected of
 political activity. It is widely accepted that the Government
 selectively monitors certain individuals, including their
 telephones and mail, and that the university campuses are
 under close surveillance. An informant system exists on the
 campuses and in poor blue-collar sections of the major cities.
 The Government does not generally interfere with the private
 beliefs of the individual, and there is no forced membership
 in political organizations. The Government remained concerned
 about the spread of what it considers radical religious
 beliefs and carefully monitored activities in the nation's
 mosques.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression. However,
 criticism of the monarchy and Islam is not tolerated, and, in
 the opinion of most observers, foreign policy is also not
 fully open to free discussion. King Hassan has made it clear
 that any challenge to Morocco's claim to the Western Sahara is
 not to be the subject of public debate.
 There is some press criticism of the Government and of
 Moroccan officials, and limited discussion of political and
 socioeconomic issues. Nevertheless, investigative reporting
 is severely limited, and journalists are under government
 pressure to conform to government policy through self-
 censorship. Officials have frequently seized publications
 entering the country from abroad through the mail, and
 distribution of some issues of international journals has been
 stopped. Some cultural activities, including those of
 theatrical associations, have also been banned.
 Government censorship in the aftermath of the January 20 Fez
 disturbances was rigorous, aimed at curbing publication of
 both factual detail and commentary. The authorities briefly
 placed the Communist newspaper Al Bayane under prepublication
 censorship and seized the entire January 24 edition.
 
 
 1437
 MOROCCO
 Authorities also seized the January 24 edition of Al Ittihad
 Al Ichtiraki and placed the paper under prepublication
 censorship, allegedly because of a January 23 editorial
 pointing out inconsistencies in the Government's account of
 the Fez incident and calling for a parliamentary investigation.
 Al Alam reported on January 28 that its correspondent had been
 held and interrogated for 6 hours by the Fez police.
 In March the Government seized an edition of the popular
 French-language women's magazine Kalima and temporarily
 suspended its publication. The offending edition contained
 two "muckraking" articles--one on male prostitution and the
 other an essay on the restrictions placed by Moroccan
 authorities on the right to hold demonstrations, with
 references to the Fez student demonstrations of January. The
 Moroccan authorities allegedly also use the threat of
 defamation actions to intimidate the press. In July Al
 Massar, an opposition weekly, was fined about $18,500, and its
 owner given a suspended prison sentence of 2 months for
 publishing an article about abuse by a local official, which
 the court found defamatory. Ministry of Interior and
 Information officials have called publishers in to review
 allegedly offensive articles and threatened suspension if such
 articles contiriued.
 The Arabic language daily Al Anbaa aswell as the Moroccan
 press agency Maghreb Arab Press are government owned. Many
 newspapers and journals are privately owned, although they are
 influenced by the Government, receive government subsidies,
 and reflect offici&l views to varying degrees. Some are
 controlled by political parties or private groups. Television
 and radio are government owned, and the views expressed are
 the Government's. Certain cities receive television
 broadcasts from Spain, France, and Italy.
 There is a measure of academic freedom. Although there are
 strictures against scholarly investigation of the monarchy and
 Islam, there is limited research and publishing on Islam and
 Islamic fundamentalism. In 1987 the authorities banned a book
 on women's issues, "The Political Harem," by a well-known
 Moroccan feminist, after it had been distributed in bookstores.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While there are constitutional guarantees of assembly and
 association, these rights are carefully controlled and may, in
 fact, be abrogated. Two decrees dating back to colonial times
 (1935 and 1939) enable the Government to suppress any type of
 popular manifestation of dissent, no matter how peaceful. In
 January the Government banned peaceful pro-Palestinian
 demonstrations scheduled by the political parties to be held
 in Meknes and other centers. In the interest of free
 assembly, the Oujda colloquium called for the abolition of the
 two decrees.
 Groups seen as threatening the political stability of the
 regime, such as declared radical leftist and Islamic
 fundamentalist organizations, are outlawed. Private,
 nonpolitical associations are usually permitted, after
 registering with the Government, and professional, business,
 religious, and cultural associations are active. Permits are
 required for public meetings, and if the requesting group is a
 legally registered association, permission is normally--though
 not always--granted.
 
 
 1438
 MOROCCO
 In early December, the Government unexpectedly approved the
 formation of a new human rights organization. Three times in
 1988, the Government had forced postponement of the founding
 meeting of the new organization, which its founders say would
 be independent, nonpartisan, and intended to serve as a
 rallying point for all human rights activists in the country.
 The 200-300 organizers included leaders from both the leftwing
 and establishment political parties and prominent figures in
 academia, the arts, and the professions. The organization met
 December 10, elected officers, and approved by-laws.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies
 to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is over 99 percent Muslim, and Islam is the
 official religion. The King bears the title "Commander of the
 Faithful," and is the religious as well as secular leader of
 the Moroccan people. The Constitution makes provision for
 freedom of Worship, although proselytizing is prohibited by
 law. Islamic tenets and ingrained popular attitudes strongly
 discourage conversion from Islam to another faith. In March a
 Moroccan Christian convert was arrested and reportedly
 brutally beaten while in police custody. This treatment was
 suspected to be due to his religious faith and the fact that
 he was translating the Bible into a Berber dialect.
 There are two organized communities of Christians and Jews in
 Morocco. There are up to 10,000 Jews, most of whom live in
 Casablanca and several other major cities. The Jewish
 community operates schools and social institutions as well as
 a number of synagogues. Publications in Hebrew are permitted,
 and rabbis serving the Jewish community are trained in
 Morocco. Jews are active in the business community and are
 represented in the Government.
 The Government adheres to a pledge by the King to guarantee
 the Roman Catholic church's right to conduct both religious
 and charitable work. Catholic clergy, who come exclusively
 from abroad, minister to some 100,000 foreign residents with
 parishes in most cities. As a result of the Pope's visit in
 1985, a resident apostolic nunciature was established in 1986.
 There continued to be reports of administrative harassment of
 members of the Baha'i community, including the continuation of
 the 1983 ban on the holding of religious meetings and the
 sealing off in 1986 of the Baha'i cemetery in Rabat.
 The King and other religious leaders continue to oppose
 "radical" religious beliefs, and a number of Muslim
 fundamentalists (see Section l.e.) have been imprisoned.
 Interior Ministry officials monitor what is taught in the
 mosques and report deviations from orthodox Islam.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco. As
 the administering authority in the Western Sahara, however,
 the Moroccan Government restricts movement in areas of the
 territory which are militarily contested. There were no
 reported cases of restrictions on foreign travel for political
 reasons in 1988, although some persons imprisoned for
 political reasons in the past have had difficulty obtaining
 
 
 1439
 MOROCCO
 passports. While there are no formal restrictions on foreign
 travel and emigration, it often takes an ordinary citizen
 months to obtain a passport and, in some cases, a passport
 maynot be issued at all. Some districts of Morocco have
 liberalized their approach to passport issuance in the past
 year, but delays and difficulty remain the norm rather than
 the exception. A woman is obliged to have the permission of
 her father, or, if she is married, her husband, to obtain a
 passport. A divorced woman must receive her father's
 permission for a passport and, if she has custody of children,
 she must have the children's father's permission for passports
 to be issued to children.
 There are no known instances of the Government depriving any
 citizen ofI Moroccan nationality. Moroccan law considers any
 person who acquires Moroccan nationality to be a citizen for
 life. As a result, the Government has often refused to
 recognize the right of foreign embassies to act on behalf of
 dual nationals, or even to receive information concerning
 their arrest and imprisonment. This has been a major problem
 for some Western European embassies. Moroccan law encourages
 voluntary repatriation for Jewish community members who have
 emigrated from Morocco. It also encourages the return of
 Saharans who opposed Morocco in the Western Sahara conflict.
 Returning former Polisario members deemed to pose no security
 threat are reinteqrated into Moroccan life.
 Morocco adheres to the 1951 Refugee Convention. It currently
 has some 500 refugees, mainly from African countries and
 Eastern Europe. For a grant of refugee status, the Government
 requires that the applicant be able to care for his own needs.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Moroccan citizens are not in a position to change their
 government since the Parliament has little or no authority to
 effect change, and all executive power is vested in a
 government appointed by the King which serves at his
 pleasure. Moreover, the Constitution may not be amended
 without the approval of the King, who would be unlikely either
 to abolish or modify the monarchy or the current system of
 government. The King's messages to the House of
 Representatives and the nation are not open to debate. The
 King's Prime Minister shares with Parliament the
 responsibility for initiating legislation and thus controls
 the legislative process.
 The Parliament passes the annual budget and other items of
 legislation. However, many measures of importance are
 promulgated as government decrees or by royal proclamation.
 Opposition politicians frequently complain that the
 Government, which must approve the introduction of legislative
 bills into the Parliament, does not give the body sufficient
 work, both in terms of the volume of the legislation referred
 to it and of the importance of the legislation. Opposition
 party leaders also complain that the Government fails to keep
 the Parliament advised of developments relating to key
 issues. Parliamentary absenteeism is high.
 While government legislative proposals are rarely rejected-
 outright, the Parliament is sometimes able to modify the bills
 it passes and, -n occasion, persuade the Government to delay
 or withdraw legislation. A dramatic example came in late 1987
 when, after heated debate, the Parliament forced the
 
 
 1440
 MOROCCO
 Government to withdraw several controversial elements of the
 proposed budget in order to obtain approval, thus stimulating
 widespread popular interest and effacing somewhat the
 Parliament's rubberstamp image.
 More than a dozen political parties, representing a spectrum
 of political philosophies from far left to conservative,
 competed in the municipal elections of 1983 and the 1984
 parliamentary elections. Some of the results were challenged,
 and there were widespread accusations, which persist today, of
 government tampering, both in terms of the selection of the
 candidates and in the tallying of the results. In a number of
 cases, these challenges were upheld in court.
 The Constitution provides that "men and women enjoy equal
 political rights." Women occupy a few responsible government
 positions, including at the ministerial staff level, but
 women's role in political life remains restricted. No woman
 holds a seat in the 306-member Parliament, although women have
 run in parliamentary elections. Of 15,000 city council
 members in Morocco, only 43 are women. Women serve on the
 executive committees of several of the major political parties
 and on the Saharan Consultative Council, a body created in
 1981 to advise the King on Western Saharan issues. In
 September, for the first time, a woman was named dean of a
 Moroccan university.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 It is not known whether any international or nongovernmental
 investigations have been requested in recent years, although
 an Amnesty International group visited Morocco in early 1988.
 The Government is generally sensitive to human rights
 inquiries and international publicity. It has been very slow
 to respond to various embassies' inquiries into alleged human
 rights cases; many such inquiries have gone unanswered for up
 to 2 years.
 Two Moroccan human rights associations are affiliated with
 political parties and a third is nonpartisan. Although
 permitted to function, these groups are occasionally subject
 to police surveillance and harassment. In June the two groups
 formed a coordinating committee and issued several joint
 communiques on prison conditions, torture, and political
 prisoners.
 The Moroccan Red Crescent sponsored several seminars in
 1988 on human rights and humanitarian law.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution affirms the legal equality of all Moroccans.
 In the professions, women have made progress in law, medicine,
 and teaching, but progress in professional fields has not been
 matched in the society at large. There are areas where
 traditional standards prevail, especially in the area of
 private law. Divorce is permitted, but a husband can
 repudiate his wife while she'cannot repudiate him. A man is
 permitted four wives according to Islamic tradition, although
 multiple marriages are rare. Serial marriage, however, has
 become more common due to the ease of divorce for men.
 Segregation of the sexes is common, especially in social
 
 
 1441
 MOROCCO
 settings. However, in rural areas and among the urban poor,
 as well as increasingly among middle and upper class families,
 women work outside the home and contribute to family income.
 Some Berber spokesmen claim that Moroccan institutions do not
 reflect the Berber character of the population and that, as a
 result of the lack of Berber-language schools, the Berber
 identity is not adequately maintained. A popular intellectual
 monthly review, largely dedicated to questions of Berber
 identity, was suspended in 1983 and has not reappeared.
 However, Berbers continue to play a significant role in
 national and local affairs. Some state-owned radio stations
 broadcast several hours daily in the Berber language.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to organize trade unions is provided for in the
 Constitution. Three trade union federations dominate the
 labor scene: the Union Marocain du Travail (UMT), the
 Confederation Democratique du Travail (CDT), and the Union
 Generale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). Each has a
 democratically elected leadership. The UMT has no political
 affiliation, the CDT is linked to the Socialist Union of
 Popular Forces, and the UGTM with the nationalist Istiqlal
 Party. All three federations belong to regional labor
 organizations and maintain contacts with international trade
 secretariats. They also attend and participate in the annual
 conference of the International Labor brganization (ILO). In
 all, about 1 million of Morocco's 7.5 million workers are
 organized.
 Despite constitutional protection, unions complain regularly
 that employers have suspended or dismissed their members for
 trade union activity with little risk of penalty, although the
 law entails fines or imprisonment for some labor law
 violations. In 1988 Morocco's phosphate workers--the largest
 segment of industrialized workers--were unable to publish an
 announcement of a representation election and instead had to
 accept slates of delegates chosen by management.
 Consequently, only a few workers voted, and the unions claimed
 that "a fair and free exchange of information" had been
 blocked.
 The Constitution gives workers the right to strike, but no
 detailed law exists to define it. Laws governing settlement
 of disputes set forth mandatory procedures. Disputes are
 handled by the Government on a case-by-case basis.
 Moroccan law outlaws strikes in sectors affecting national
 security. The Government has used that provision" to ban
 strikes by teachers, among others. During strikes and work
 protests, workers have also been arrested and prosecuted under
 criminal statutes that ban picketing and damage to employers'
 property. The U14T has filed with the ILO several cases
 alleging infractions of ILO conventions on freedom of
 association, the right to organize, and collective
 bargaining. The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association is
 monitoring several cases involving dismissals and prison terms
 for Moroccan strikers and workers involved in trade union
 activity. The Government reported in April that persons
 suspended because of participation in a June 1981 work
 stoppage had been ordered reinstated and that public sector
 employers had been ordered to normalize the situations of
 
 
 1442
 MOROCCO
 public servants affected by suspension measures. In late
 April, however, nonunion miners who struck to protest
 dismissals were removed and imprisoned for trespassing. Union
 activists accuse the police and the Interior Ministry of
 interfering on behalf of employers in these and other labor
 disputes. Thus, while Moroccan law provides for the right of
 association, enforcement is irregular.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is also
 provided for in the Constitution. The multiplicity of trade
 union federations creates competition to organize workers.
 Any group of eight workers can organize. Thus, any single
 factory may contain several independent locals or locals
 affiliated with more than one labor federation. Xn both the
 organization process and during collective bargaining, the law
 is honored most often in the industrial sector of the economy,
 especially because government mechanisms to promote
 worker-employer negotiations are easier to apply there.
 In the informal and underground economies, the law is less
 well observed and sometimes ignored entirely. In part, the
 state of the economy, with widespread youth unemployment,
 hinders protection of the organization and collective
 bargaining process. Workers understand that replacements are
 available should they be fired for organizing or bargaining
 activity. On the other hand, workers face no barriers in
 making complaints to Moroccan authorities or the ILO. There
 are no special economic zones in Morocco, and labor
 legislation applies equally throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Although there appears to be no legal or constitutional
 prohibition, there is no forced labor in Morocco.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Moroccan law specifies that children cannot be employed or
 apprenticed before age 12. Special regulations govern the
 employment of children between the ages of 12 and 16. In the
 traditional economy, however, particularly in artisanal work,
 children may be apprenticed earlier than age 12. Safety and
 health conditions in many enterprises employing children are
 substandard. In 1987 and again in 1988, the Moroccan press
 highlighted abuses of minors in the rug-making and carpentry
 industries, and Moroccan children are often seen in the
 streets of small cities working with yarns. Labor inspectors
 have difficulty ensuring application of child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Moroccan laws provide a 48-hour maximum workweek, premium pay
 for overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and minimum
 conditions for the safety and health of workers, including
 prohibition of night work for women and minors. These are
 observed unevenly. The Ministry of Labor maintains inspectors
 to monitor worker rights and working conditions. They lack,
 however, sufficient resources and authority to investigate
 complaints and assure compliance with the law.
 Minimum wages are set by law and were last raised in January
 1988 to about 50 cents an hour for industrial workers. Many
 workers complain, however, that they never received the

 increase. The minimum wage for agricultural workers is less
 than $3 per day. Although the Government subsidizes staples,
 a family cannot live easily on the minimum wage. Most
 industrial workers in the modern sector, however, earn more
 than the minimum wage, while in smaller establishments and
 outside the formal economy minimum wage levels are less
 frequently observed.
