 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multi-party parliamentary democracy based on
 constitutionally guaranteed universal suffrage. Botswana has
 maintained the fundamental principles of the rule of law,
 political democracy, and independence. The Constitution of
 Botswana, which came into effect in 1965 when Botswana was still
 the British-administered Bechuanaland Protectorate, contains
 what is in effect a bill of rights and freedoms of the individ-
 ual. These constitutional rights are upheld in the courts.
 Botswana permits political dissenty competition among the five
 active political parties results in lively discussion of politi-
 cal issues. Civil and military officers in Botswana are accountable
 to an independent judiciary for misconduct in office. Legislation
 protecting the rights of minorities is generally enforced.
 Botswana accepts refugees and currently provides for the social
 welfare needs and security of more than 1,200 refugees from
 neighboring countries. Botswana continues to make significant
 progress in addressing the economic and social needs of its
 people despite declining world prices for key exports and a
 drought emergency which have adversely affected the economy.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no known cases or allegations of killings by
 either official government or opposition political groups. One
 incident of attempted murder, a bombing of a house inhabited by
 Namibian refugees,'is widely believed to have been the work of
 agents hired by the South African Government.
 b. Disappearance
 The Botswana Constitution provides for the protection of per-
 sonal liberty. There have been no allegations of secret arrests
 or clandestine detentions in Botswana.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, and there have been
 no allegations of torture in Botswana.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by law, is contrary to public
 policy, and is rare in practice. The Attorney General's
 office investigates reported cases of police brutality. All
 such claims investigated to date have proved unfounded. There
 have been no summary executions in Botswana. Prison conditions
 allow for adequate diet and health care and visits from family
 members. Jails can, however, be crowded and inmates who have
 no relatives to see to their needs may encounter difficulty in
 arranging for maintenance. Flogging is permitted for infrac-
 tions of prison rules. It is also used by traditional tribal
 courts, whose jurisdiction is limited to minor offenses. A bill
 which may become law in 1982 provides for compulsory corporal
 punishment for persons (male or female) convicted of rape,
 attempted rape, causing grievous bodily harm, armed robbery,
 burglary, house breaking, and other related offenses. Corporal
 punishment is also administered occasionally in the schools for
 serious cases of disobedience.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Botswana Consfitution contains provisions protecting Botswana
 citizens from arbitrary arrest. There are no political prisoners
 in Botswana and preventive detention is illegal. Habeas corpus
 exists in practice, with a requirement that the police bring a
 suspect before a magistrate for charging within 48 hours of his
 arrest. All suspects must be released at that time unless the
 magistrate issues a warrant of detention.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is provided by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel, and
 consultation between defendants and counsel may be held in
 private. Defendants must be charged within 48 hours of arrest
 and all charges must be formally and clearly stated. The
 judiciary is independent of the executive and military. This
 separation has been upheld even in controversial and politically
 sensitive cases. The high court has ruled that the Constitution
 implies that no one may be compelled to testify against himself.
 Moreover, silence cannot be construed as guilt, and the burden of
 proof remains with the prosecution. Most trials are held in
 public. Provisions exist for conducting closed hearing trials
 relating to security cases. A recent court case involving an
 attempt by a South African police officer to bribe a Botswana
 police investigator in return for information was held behind
 closed doors. The results of the trial were, however, announced
 in the government-owned newspaper approximately one week after
 the trial. A second such trial, resulting in a three year
 sentence, was not publicized. Accounts by foreign as well as
 domestic news sources indicate a scrupulous adherence to established
 procedures and meticulous observance of the rights of defendants.
 There are no special courts to deal with security or political
 offenses. Although the Botswana Defense Force Act provides
 for military courts, none as yet has been established, and cases
 over which the military has jurisdiction are referred to the
 Attorney General and the civilian court system. There are
 problems in the administration of justice, but they center
 mainly on the difficulty in recruiting a sufficient number of
 qualified judicial personnel and court reporters.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is safeguarded by law and respected
 in practice. A search warrant issued by a magistrate is required
 for an official to enter a private residence, except in cases
 of suspected diamond theft or illegal drug transactions when a
 senior police officer may search without a warrant. This
 authority has not apparently been abused, and is believed to
 be rarely used.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press ar-e guaranteed by the Consti-
 tution. Until very recently, the Government had a monopoly
 over the news media, publishing the only daily newspaper and ope-
 rating the only radio station. This monopoly resulted from
 economic, rather than political, constraints. In September 1982
 the first commercial newspaper began publishing in Botswana (an
 event which was welcomed in an editorial in the government-owned
 press). Prior to this, even though the government owned the
 press, opposition views were aired, and the activities of the
 minority parties received extensive coverage. The Government
 has encouraged the free exchange of ideas and has permitted
 considerable latitude in the media.
 
 
 35
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a well-established tradition in Botswana
 society, with roots in the traditional system of representative
 democracy based on the K gota--much like a New England town
 meeting where citizens gather to question their leaders and
 voice their opinions on government policies. Large gatherings
 require local police approval which is routinely given. Demon-
 strations are permitted so long as order is maintained. Organizers
 are required to submit a detailed plan for any demonstrations and
 are held personally responsible for ensuring that the plan is
 adhered to. Though tensions between the Government and unions
 are increasing, unions are permitted to organize and operate
 freely. Strikes are permitted though they rarely occur. The
 Government has taken steps through the legal process to invalidate
 a 1981 election of officers by the Botswana Federation of Trade
 Unions. The court upheld the Government's position, and the
 Federation was required to repeat its elections. Professional
 groups have not been subjected to persecution or intimidation.
 Unions are permitted free association with international organ-
 izations.  . .
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. Open practice of religion is per-
 mitted and encouraged. While most residents of Botswana practice
 one form or another of Christianity, there are active groups of
 Muslims, hIndus, Bahais, and other religions. Conversions are
 not a matter of concern to the Government, and religious affilia-
 tion is neither an advantage nor disadvantage.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Botswana citizens are subject to virtually no restrictions
 on emigration or repatriation. Domestic and foreign travel is
 unrestricted as well. Passports, in general, are easily obtained.
 Some members of the opposition, however, have experienced difficulty
 or delay in getting passports. Refugees recognized by the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are required to
 live in a refugee settlement at Dukwe in northern Botswana. The
 settlement's housing, infrastructure, and other amenities are
 markedly superior to those which are available in nearby villages
 (largely due to inputs from donor organizations). Refugees may
 be authorized to live elsewhere for reasons such as employment
 or schooling. In cooperation with international agencies the
 Government provides educational programs, sports and recreational
 programs, and business opportunities for the refugees at Dukwe.
 Like other foreigners in Botswana, refugees are not permitted to
 accept employment opportunities which could be filled by a
 citizen. While consistent with local policy, this position is not
 in keeping with United Nations standards on treatment of refugees.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The citizens of Botswana enjoy complete freedom to participate in
 politics by voting, engaging in party activities, and in publicly
 advocating proposed policies. In the October 1979 parliamentary
 elections, three opposition parties challenged the ruling
 Botswana Democratic Party in free and open elections which were
 decided by secret ballot. While the ruling party contested all
 32 constituencies, the Botswana National Front contested 16
 (one short of the number constitutionally required to elect
 a presidential candidate), the Botswana People's Party contested
 14, and the small Botswana Independence Party contested only
 five. Since the opposition parties tend to have different
 regional bases, no ruling party candidate ran unopposed. The
 
 
 36
 Government made a strong effort to persuade eligible voters to
 participate in the electoral process. The ruling Botswana
 Democratic Party holds 29 seats in the National Assembly; the
 Botswana National Front holds two; the Botswana People's Party,
 one. The Botswana Independence Party lost its only seat in the
 1979 election.
 Women have full political rights in Botswana. In practice,
 women increasingly participate in political life. There are
 two women members of parliament, both of whom are ministers.
 The Executive Secretary of the ruling party is a woman.
 There is one white member of parliament, who is also a
 cabinet minister. The Speaker of the National Assembly is
 also white.
 The next elections are scheduled for 1984. In anticipation of
 these elections two new political parties have been officially
 formed, bringing the total number of active parties to six.
 Opposition groups operate publicly and are given coverage in the
 government-owned daily newspaper as well as on the national
 radio. The new commercial newspaper has also covered opposition
 politics. Only the Basarwa, or "Bushmen", remain unrepresented
 in Government and are generally ignored. These primitive people
 have been profoundly affected by the recent economic development
 in Botswana which has turned traditional hunting and gathering
 areas into cattle grazing land. The Government has, as yet,
 done little to recognize this problem.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Botswana's record of cooperation with international agencies
 involved in assisting refugees has been very good. At present,
 there are no Botswana-based organizations set up to observe,
 report, or contest human rights violations. The Botswana Govern-
 ment consistently responds promptly and forthrightly to the
 inquiries it receives from international human rights organiza-
 tions about the human rights situation in Botswana.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Botswana became independent in 1966 lacking many economic
 development benefits. It had no hard-surfaced roads and very
 few schools, particularly above the primary level. Per capita
 GNP is estimated to have been no more than $69, and 57 per-
 cent of the Government's operating budget was financed by
 foreign aid. Despite these initial handicaps, the Botswana
 Government has been successful in bringing about economic
 development and improving the economic and social situation of
 the people.
 The Government of Botswana has been consistent in its efforts to
 meet the health and nutrition needs of the people. The percent-
 age of the population with access to safe water increased from 29
 percent in 1968 to 45 percent in 1975. The increase in access to
 safe water was greater in urban areas, from 71 percent to 95 per-
 cent, due in part to the fact that Botswana's rural population is
 widely scattered. It is estimated that in 1977, 94 percent of
 the calorie supply required for Botswana's population was avail-
 able in the country. The Government's efforts in the health
 field were reflected in an increase in life expectancy from 41.0
 years in 1968 to 49.9 years in 1980. The infant mortality rate
 in 1980 was 83.3 per 1000 live births, as compared to 97 per 1000
 live births in 1975.
 
 
 37
 Starting from a very weak base, Botswana has attempted to pro-
 vide educational opportunities for its people as rapidly as
 possible. The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio increased
 from 56 percent in 1968 to 89 percent in 1978 and to 93 percent
 in 1979. The difference in the 1978 ratios for boys (80 percent)
 and girls (98 pbrcent) is due primarily to the custom of using
 school-age boys to herd cattle. Botswana is now attempting to
 implement a policy of universal primary education, and the ratio
 should, therefore, continue to improve. The adult literacy rate
 was 35 percent in 1975.
 In 1978 per capita GDP was $620. By 1980, this figure had
 risen to $910, primarily as a result of mining expansion.
 The disparity between rural and urban income remains a major
 concern of the Government. Despite the improved income level,
 much remains to be done to overcome poverty in Botswana. The
 most recent estimates, which take into account the annual
 population growth rate of nearly five percent, are that 55
 percent of the rural population and 40 percent of the residents
 of the country's urban areas have incomes below the absolute
 poverty level. Despite the Government's attempt to redress this
 imbalance, progress may prove difficult because a substantial
 number of the country's citizens are only marginally involved in
 the money economy.
