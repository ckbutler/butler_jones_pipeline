 BENIN
 A small West African country of three and a half million
 people, Benin is among the world's poorest nations. African
 traditionalism and tribalism remain strong, although there
 has been considerable social modernization, particularly in
 the two decades since independence. Since 1972, the country
 has been governed by a radical Marxist-Leninist regime which
 subordinates political and personal liberties to "revolu-
 tionary* goals (development, mobilization of the popula-
 tion, vigilance against "imperialist" efforts to *recolonize"
 Africa) decided upon by the sole political party, the
 People's Political Party. The military officers who have
 directed the regime since 1972 adopted a constitution in
 February 1980 which gives a more civilian hue to the govern-
 ment. It sets up a parliament and other political institu-
 tions and provides in principle for a panoply of political,
 civil, and economic rights. Nevertheless, it leaves all
 real power in the hands of the party and the small number of
 people (mostly military officers) who are concurrently the
 party leaders and key governental officials.
 Major threats to human rights in recent years have been
 episodic, rooted largely in tensions connected with real
 and alleged plots to overthrow the government, and occa-
 sLonal manifestations of organized political dissent.
 Political prisoners may number about 200. While there is no
 evidence of widespread torture or "disappearance", govern-
 mental secretiveness and lack of public accountability
 mak6 information very difficult to obtain. Moreover, there
 are no real restraints, either in theory or in practice, on
 the arbitrary use of power by the governmentl thus, the
 potential for serious human rights abuses is always there.
 The government's stated policies of fulfilling vital
 human needs and improving the lot of the poor have not
 been successful. Rising population growth has negated the
 impact of small economic advances, and declining quality has
 offset the rising quantity in such fields as education.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution does not specifically address the question
 of torture, although it does state that Benin subscribes to
 the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 While there is no organized or systematic use of torture,
 the police and military sometimes use physical violence on
 suspects, particularly during arrest and interrogation. In
 some instances foreigners have been beaten for minor immigra-
 tion infractions.   Gathering facts concerning mistreatment
 is extremely difficult, since law enforcement authorities
 are not accountable to independent outside authorities or
 subject to any public scrutiny.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Conditions are poor in Beninese jails and other places of
 detention. Beninese student associations abroad have
 alleged that conditions for some prisoners are extremely
 
 
 degrading. Amnesty International's 1981 report claims that
 Cotonou's central prison has one cell, nicknamed "the cage",
 which is so overcrowded that many detainees are forced to
 remain standing. There is no evidence of summary executions.
 Prisoners are generally treated the same regardless of race,
 sex, or type of conviction, except that those with financial
 means are able to buy preferred treatment. Medical facilities
 at most Beninese prisons are known to be poor.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no known instances of "disappearance" in Benin.
 The secretiveness of the regime and the lack of any official
 accountability makes knowledge of such matters limited.
 Nevertheless, in such a small country if disappearances or
 clandestine arrests were widespread, they would have come to
 public attention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Although rare in periods of political calm, arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment is a standard government response
 to any type of organized political dissent. Political
 prisoners have been held, in some cases for many years,
 on vague charges of having supported previous regimes or
 posing political threats to the government. Government
 secretiveness and lack of accountability make it impossible
 to do more than guess at the number of political prisoners
 involved. According to local sources with contacts in
 the jails, there are a dozen or so prisoners still jailed
 for opposition to the regime during the 1972-75 period when
 it was consolidating its power. These sources also substan-
 tiate charges by the French section of Amnesty International
 that more than half of the approximately sixty students and
 professors arrested during 1979 political disturbances at
 the university remain imprisoned without trial or formal
 charges. Several people were arrested in connection
 with an effort to form a free trade union in late 1980
 (Amnesty International claimed more than 100); the govern-
 ment has not disclosed how many are still being held.
 Coup-plotting within the military produced a few more
 arrests in mid-1981. Three former Beninese presidents held
 under house arrest since 1972, however, were released
 in early 1981.
 Preventive detention has been practiced primarily in periods
 of high political tension, but it has not been widespread.
 Habeas corpus or its equivalent does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary has no independence, since magistrates are
 appointed by and are under the control of the political
 party. Qualifications for judges include, most importantly,
 their "revolutionary political conviction." Accused criminals
 normally have public trials, with the right to defense
 counsel. Secret trials have been conducted, however,
 particularly for security and political offenders. The 1980
 Amnesty International report alleges that many prisoners are
 not informed of the charges against them. Amnesty Interna-
 tional's 1981 report cites the case of a former ministry of
 finance official who was arrested in 1975 and sentenced to
 10 years imprisonment without having been permitted to
 attend his own trial. In 1979, the supreme revolutionary
 council condemned 100 persons to death in absentia for
 having been implicated in the 1977 mercenary attack on the
 capital city of Cotonou, but none have been apprehended, and
 the sentences have not been carried out. In corruption
 cases, special commissions of inquiry appointed by the
 president or council of ministers make judicial decisions
 and mete out sentences, but usually only brief periods of
 detention are involved.
 
 
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution provides for the "inviolability of the
 home." In practice, however, this is respected only to
 the extent that one does not become a suspect, and arbitrary
 searches and seizures are not uncommon. As with all other
 types of human rights, constitutionally guaranteed or not,
 no practical restraints exist on the arbitrary exercise
 of government power.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedoms of speech, press, and assembly do not exist in
 Benin. The fundamental basis of the regime's Marxist-
 Leninist ideology is that the interests of the state, as
 defined by the sole political party, take precedence over
 individual rights. The press is totally under state control.
 Organized political opposition is not tolerated. Labor
 unions and artistic expression must, according to the
 constitution, be "based on our national Marxist-Leninist
 orientation."
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion are
 only partially observed in practice. While Christianity,
 Islam, and animism are all flourishing, there have been
 periodic government efforts to suppress the latter, and
 such efforts intensified in 1981. One sect, Celestial
 Christianity (a blend of Christianity and animism) was
 formally banned and its meeting places were closed.
 Missionaries are active, although forbidden to operate
 schools. In 1976, when the Jehovah's Witnesses group
 refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the revolutionary
 government, church property was confiscated and foreign
 members were expelled.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on the movement of Beninese
 within the country. Foreign travel is possible in principle
 but difficult in practice, particularly for people with
 needed skills (whose travel under government practice is
 restricted) and for those without the resources to pay
 substantial bribes for passports. Repatriation is possible,
 although the question is rarely raised. Few Beninese
 residing outside the country have returned. There is no
 discrimination against women or other groups with regard to
 freedom of movement.
 c. Freedom to Participate In the Political Process
 The 1980 constitution established various political and
 administrative organisms, including a national assembly
 elected by universal adult suffrage. However, all political
 activity is in the context of a Marxist-Leninist, one-party
 system. Candidates are selected by the single political
 party and ratified by popular vote with no opposition
 permitted.
 At the local level, Political participation on a limited
 scale has been organized since 1975. Mass meetings select
 precinct delegates, who then select commune representa-
 tives, who in turn elect a mayor. However, the party
 controls this process and in any case the mayor and the
 local delegates are obliged to carry out the orders of the
 government-appointed district chief.

 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International, particulatiy its French section,
 has called attention to human rights violations in Benin.
 Its 1981 report says its main concerns are detention without
 trial of political opponents, political imprisonment after
 unfair trials, and the cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment
 of some prisoners. Amnesty International made a special
 appeal to President Kerekou to release students and teachers
 arrested in 1979, and many Amnesty members have written
 letters about individual political prisoners they have
 "adopted." These appeals, however, id all adverse publicity
 about human rights, thus far have been totally ignored by
 Beninese authorities. The government's attitude is that any
 attempt to investigate human rights practices constitutes
 interference in its internal affairs.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The constitution specifically guarantees, as economic
 and social rights, decent working conditions, old age
 benefits, education, and free medical care. Moreover, the
 regime has made significant efforts to improve the lot of
 the poor, through both redistribution of wealth and economic
 development. It has given priority to rural areas, where
 more than 80 percent of the population lives.
 There have been some positive results, including an increase
 in life expectancy from 42.4 to 47.0 years between 1970
 and 1979; adjusted primary school enrollment of 60 percent
 according to the most recent estimate, as opposed to 40
 percent in 1970; calorie supply of 98 percent of nutritional
 requirements in 1977, up from 96 percent in 1970. However,
 because of rapid population growth (2.9 percent between 1970
 and 1979), dislocations associated with expropriations and
 the imposition of Marxist-Leninist economic structures,
 mismanagement of quasi-governmental enterprises, declining
 academic standards, and rising corruption, both per capita
 real income and the quality of life in Benin have done no
 more than hold their own over the past decade. Most
 observers believe they have declined.
 Particularly during the past two years, economic problems
 have mounted, primarily as a result of governmental policies,
 poor performance, and corruption. The government's ability
 to maintain even current living standards, and the present
 GNP of approximately $250, has been maintained only by
 rising foreign aid levels.
 Notwithstanding the deteriorating economic situation, the
 regime has raised the portion of the budget devoted to defense
 from 10 percent in 1976 to 15 percent in 1981.
 The new constitution guarantees the legal equality of
 women. At the same time, however, it recognizes current
 realities by stating that the "revolutionary state" will
 work *to create progressively the conditions for exercising
 this right- to equality. Women are hampered by traditional
 attitudes and social structures, even though they have equal
 legal status.
