 ZAMBIA
 Ii Zambia's one-party system-of government, President Kenneth
 Kadnda exercises-predominant.executive authority. He is
 advised by-a central committee' of'party leaders and governs
 through a cabinet and a parliament. There is strong
 competition for parliamentary seats within the single-party
 structure..- All candidates for political offie'at any level
 must be members:of the United National Independence Party
 (UNIP  and must be screened by its Central Committee in
 advance. Under a state of emergency in effect for the. past 25
 years, the President has broad discretion to detain or
 restrict the movements of people, and law enforcement
 personnel h4ye extraordinary powers. to detain suspects and
 search homes,        .-                -
 The Zambian police,-operatlng under theMinistry of Home
 Affairs, have primary responsibility fog maintaining law and
 order. Divided,into regular and paamilitaty units, it
 supervises a volunteer vigilante forbe composed primarily of
 party activists. The Zambian Intelligence and Security
 Service is charged with intelligence and counterespionage
 responsibilities while the armed services are used for
 internal security, especially .at checkpints and roadblocks.*
 Although'Zambiv's economy grdw,in real'termsfor the second'
 straight year' (after.years of steady detetiorationy dle'to
 high copper'prides and bumper corn crops, per capita income
 continues to declind because of'rapid populdtlon growth. Over
 the neariahd mbdfiumi terni. the country will contihue to be' "
 burdened with an overvalued.currency and beset by high
 inflation;lhigh unemployqent,'and chronic underutilization of
 industrial-production. The Government undertook economic
 reforms late in 1988 with stifFer measures in 1989 *designed to
 stimulate market 'forces ,by ending subsidies and  pice controls
 and by significantly devaluing the currency. 'With more
 reforms required, Zambia will be hard pressed to cushion the
 blows d..-its p6orst cititeis. '
 Positive human rights developments in Zambia in 1989 included
 judicial Action against officials accused' of mistreating
 prisoners;';release of detained' pposition politiCal party
 members; 'the'return of'shops seized in an earlier crackdownon
 "black markeitering;" and'spirited, widely'ejorted,
 parliamentary debate over Zambias 6n6-party State and 8tite
 of Emer~q'eny, issues that were previously hot dfscuied
 publicly.
 Areas in which human rights problems occurred in 1989 included
 mistreatment of prisoners and detainees, including evidence of
 torture; arbitrary and excessively long detentions; lack of
 fair trials in security cases; restrictions on freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly, and association; the right of
 citizens to change their government; and traditional, often-
 illegal, discrimination against women. In 1989 the
 deteriorating economic situation and increased authority
 granted by the 1988 Emergency Powers Act led police to use
 excessive force in their efforts to curb smuggling and illegal
 trading and to stem the influx of illegal aliens. In
 assisting the police, overzealous party militants and
 vigilantes also used illegal means or excessive force.

 RESPECT FOR HUM4AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing
 In 1989 no killings occurred which could be attributed to the
 Zambian Government. Ten people were killed when a household
 of Malawian dissidents was bombed in Oetober. Zambian press
 reports hinted that Malawian government agents were to blame.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of government-inspired disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there are credible
 reports that police and military personnel have resorted to
 excessive force when interrogating detainees or prisoners. In
 January 1989, a Lusaka High Court judge expressed concern over
 the torture of people under the custody of law enforcement
 officers. Those who are maltreated by authorities can and do
 appeal to the judicial system for redress.
 In 1989 Zambian courts tried some cases charging police or
 prison officers with mistreatment of prisoners. In one case,
 a man was awarded damages for pain, suffering, permanent
 damage to his eyesight, false imprisonment, and general
 damages when he was assaulted by police. In another case, a
 commanding officer of a regional prison and two senior
 subordinates were acquitted on charges of failing to feed a
 prisoner. Militant vigilantes were accused of publicly
 beating and humiliating citizens suspected of black
 marketeering. During 1989 two vigilantes were jailed for
 beating a suspected cattle rustler to death.
 The vigilantes (volunteer party activists) are tasked with
 assisting the police in combating crime, black marketeering
 and smuggling. These units- are frequently overzealous, and,
 in 1989 there were many ciLizen complaints of harsh
 treatment. The Human Rights Committee of the Law Association
 of Zambia (Copperbelt branch) appealed to the party to check
 harassment of the people by vigilantes.
 Conditions in Zambian prisons are harsh with limited medical
 facilities. Several foreigners imprisoned for brief periods
 in Zambia have reported substandard food, overcrowding, and
 the absence of beds. According to Amnesty International's
 1989 Report, covering 1988, these conditions have resulted in
 a number of deaths. The Report noted in particular the extent
 of overcrowding in the Central Remand Prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Preservation of Public Security Act (PSA) gives the
 President broad discretion during a state of emergency, which
 has been in effect since 1964, to detain or restrict the
 movements of persons and to order that persons be arrested and
 detained for indeterminate periods. Presidential detainees
 are entitled to formal notification of the reasons for their
 detention within 14 days of arrest;.publication of their
 detention in the Government Gazette; access to counsel;
 
 
 428
 ZAMBHIA
 frequent visitation by family and colleagues; immediate right
 to petition the detaining authority for release; and the right
 to seek judicial review of the detention order by an
 independent and impartial tribunal after 1 year. However, the
 President is not legally bound to accept a tribunal's
 recommendation of release if he still believes that the
 detainee poses a threat to national security. In practice,
 detainees have been released if the judicial tribunal so
 recommended. Some detainees have been'heid for years without
 coming to trial;,for example, Faustino Lombe, who was arrested
 in 1981 foi plotting the escape of detainpes held on treason
 charges. He was rot released until 1988.
 In March one detainee successfully sued the State for unlawful
 detention and false imprisonment.
 Approximately six people detained under presidential order
 were released in 1989. These included three alleged members
 of an opposition political party, the People's Redemption
 Organization (PRO), which is illegal under Zambia's
 Constitution. Four army officers, who were detained under
 presidential 6rder and charged with coup plotting in 1988,
 were formally charged with treason and committed to the High
 Court for trial. According to the Government Gazette,
 approximately 18 persons were detained under the PSA.. Four
 are suspected of involvement in the petrol-bombing murder of
 10 Malawian exiles. Most of the remaining 14 are being held
 on suspicion of drug-related activities.
 The 25-year state of emergency gives law officers and defense
 personnel extraordinary powers. Police officers of assistant
 inspector rank and above may arrest without a warrant and
 detain a person for up to 28 days if the officer has reason to
 believe that grounds exist to justify a presidential detention
 order. In theory, police must provide the detainee with
 reasons for his detention within 14 days of arrest. In July a
 magistrate summoned two police officers who in separate
 incidents had kept two accused persons for 7 days without
 detention orders. By the end of 1989, there was no
 information available on whether or not they were punished.
 Police can use a 1989 law supplementing the Dangerous Drugs
 Act to secure forfeitures of property or proceeds earned or
 suspected to have been earned through drugs. A Drug
 Enforcement Commission was created in 1989 under the same Act.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian judicial system consists of the Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts of which the
 High Court is the most important. Although presidential
 detainees are not guaranteed public trial, such trials are
 usually public when they occur. In most cases, presidential
 detainees are eventually released without having been tried.
 The trial of Lt. Gen. Christian Tembo and three other military
 officers charged with plotting a coup was scheduled to be held
 in public in early 199a.
 In ordinary cases, the law protects suspects' rights during
 the conduct of interrogations and provides for the right to
 legal representation at one's own expense or through legal
 aid; the right to give evidence under oath in criminal
 procedures; the right to give an unsworn statement; and the
 
 
 429
 ZAMBIA
 right to remain silent. The Zambian judiciary traditionally
 has maintained its independence from executive branch
 influence. Although the President has the power to appoint
 and transfer judges, there appears to be no evidence that such
 power has swayed court decisions.
 The number of political prisoners held at the end of 1989 was
 unknown. There are five prisoners serving life sentences for
 coup plotting in 1980.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is generally respected, except
 in cases relating to the state of emergency or to roundups of
 illegal aliens and black marketeers. In such cases, security
 forces have broad powers and often enter the homes of suspects
 without search warrants.-
 In May 1989, 120 persons were picked up in Mongu and, in June
 the Flying Squad (an antirobbery unit) raided homes in a Kitwe
 residential area, allegedly to flush out illegal aliens. Such
 raids were extended in July to Chililabombwe where some
 persons were rounded up, allegedly for attempting to smuggle
 goods to Zaire.
 Early in the year many businessmen, whose trading licenses
 were revoked in a 1988 clampdown on black marketeering, were
 given back their licenses and shops. They were also promised
 compensation for their losses.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted. Parliament debates a wide
 range of political, economic, and social issues but within a
 controlled one-party context. Direct negative comments
 concerning the Head of State, or the national phi16sophy
 ("Humanism") generally may not be expressed in public, the
 Parliament or the media. A Kitwe resident was sentenced to 2
 years hard labor in June after he was found guilty of defaming
 the President.
 Toward the end of 1989, Members of Parliament questioned the
 usefulness of the one-party state and the state of emergency.
 These parliamentary debates were widely covered in the
 newspapers.
 Since the beginning of 1989, the two national dailies have
 been owned by a new public corporation, the National Media
 Corporation, headed by an advisor to the President.
 Television and radio are also state owned under the Zambia
 National Broadcasting Corporation. In spite of its
 quasi-government ownership, the press generally carries a
 substantial amount of commentary critical of party and
 government performance but within the parameters of dissent
 tolerated by the Government.
 Academic freedom is respected in Zambian society, and
 educators are outspoken in their opposition to government
 influence over the educational system. However, university
 teachers and researchers are subject to the same broad
 restrictions on criticism of the President and his philosophy-
 that apply to other Zambians.

 ZAMIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All political activity outside the one-party structure is
 banned. Police permits are issued routinely for meetings,
 rallies, or marches unless the Government believes the
 proceedings are likely to be contrary to its interests. There
 are a number of unofficial pressure groups for various
 economic,-political, and social subjects. The most
 influential in affecting government policy are the Zambia
 Industrial and Commercial Association and the Commercial
 Farmers Bureau.
 For discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Zambia has no state religion, and
 adherence to a particular faith does not confer either
 advantage or disadyantage. The Government has prohibited the
 Jehovah's Witnesses from proselytizing. Nevertheless, the
 sect functions openly, and its freedom to refrain from
 participating in various secular activities such as voting,
 singing the national anthem, and saluting the flag has been
 upheld in the courts and supported by senior party leaders.
 Christian missionaries ,from a wide variety of faiths operate
 in the country. Lay associations and religious youth groups
 operate independently of party control or influence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Police roadblocks are common, and vehicles and passengers are
 commonly searched. Under the longstanding state of emergency
 legislation, the President may restrict the movement of
 persons within Zambia although this authority is seldom used
 and was not used in 1989. The Government withholds or
 withdraws passports to prevent foreign travel by persons whose
 activities are considered inimical to Zambian interests. In
 August junior doctors, who went on a "go-slow" demanding
 better conditions of service, were dismissed and their
 passports taken by police. The doctors were subsequently
 reinstated and their passports returned.
 While the majority of Zambians are subsistence farmers, about
 47 percent of the people live in urban areas, and migration to
 cities is increasing. In November 1989, President Kaunda
 announced that unemployed urban Zambians have until June 30,
 1990, to return voluntarily to work the land in rural areas.
 The President warned that failure to respond to his call for
 voluntary resettlement would result in the imposition of an
 involuntary resettlement program next year. The Government
 has promised to provide the resettlers with land and food for
 1 year to assist in the resettlement process.
 Zambia hosts a large refugee/displaced persons population,
 particularly from Angola and Mozambique in several refugee
 settlement centers. The United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that there are approximately
 143,000 refugees and displaced persons in Zambia. The largest
 group of refugees is from Angola, totaling more than 97,000
 persons. Nearly 30,000 Mozambican refugees have also entered
 in recent years. In 1989 the Government cooperated with the
 UNHCR in the repatriation of over 4,000 Namibian refugees.
 
 
 431
 Z~AMBIA
 There have been repeated press reports of Mozambique National
 Resistance (RENAMO) guerrilla bands from Mozambique entering
 eastern Zambia and killing civilians while raiding villages.
 Zambian security forces reportedly pushed most of the rebels
 back- across the border, killing 272 and capturing 117 as of
 June 1989.
 Some dissidents who have left exile groups such as the African
 National Congress have been subject to harassment and
 abduction by their former associates, causing some
 embarrassment to the Government. The Government has
 cooperated with the UNHCR which has been active in intervening
 to provide protection and/or resettlement on a case-by-case
 basis. It also supported the U.N. Secretary General's Special
 Representative in Namibia in his efforts to investigate the
 question of Namibians allegedly detained by the South West
 Africa People's Organization.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government:
 Zambian citizens do not have the right to change their form of
 government. Under the Constitution, UNIP is the sole legal
 political party. It has an estimated membership of less than
 10 percent of the adult population. Power is, concentrated in
 the hands of the President as leader of the party and Head of
 State. He plays a dominant role in determining the membership
 of Zambia's top executive institutions, including the party
 Central Committee and the Cabinet, which traditionally contain
 a general regional and tribal balance.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members
 of the party and are subject to close examination by the
 Central Committee. In practice, the political system is open
 to persons of somewhat divergent opinions, provided they are
 willing to work within the one-party structure and do not
 challenge the Pregident's preeminent position.
 Theoretically, the National Assembly is equal to the President
 in power and importance. However, following the October 1988
 general election, the President moved to curb the independence
 of the newly elected National Assembly. In a break with
 tradition, members were sworn in by the President at the State
 House instead of by the Speaker at the National Assembly
 buildings, as had been the practice. At the ceremony, the
 President stated that unwarranted criticism in Parliament
 would not be tolerated and stressed that the National
 Assembly's principal purpose is to implement party policy
 through the drafting of legislation. Despite the President's
 warning, there.was extensive criticism of party and government
 policies during the second 1989 session of Parliament. These
 debates were well covered in the press.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government neither encourages nor hinders inquiries or
 visits by human rights organizations.
 In August 1989, the press carried an Amnesty International
 report which expressed concern over detained persons and urged
 the Government to release them without further delay. The
 Government, through the Minister of. State for Home Affairs,
 has indicated that it is studying the report.
 
 
 432
 ZAMBIA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based'on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status:
 The population of 7 million comprises more than 70
 Bantu-speaking tribal groupings. Economic and social needs
 are met on a generally nondiscriminatory basis. In 1989
 compensation was promised to both black and Asian businessmen
 whose licenses and shops had been seized in 1988 (see Section
 l.f.).
 By law, women are entitled to full equality with men. In
 practice, while they participate increasingly in Zambia's
 social, economic, and political life and are gaining
 representation in the professions and higher education, they
 remainin a subordinWte position in many ways. Zambian women
 are a major component of the rural work force. Customary law
 and practice, in contradiction to Zambia's Constitution and
 codified laws, place women in subordinate status with respect
 to property, inheritance, and marriage. Until 1989, under
 traditional customs, all rights to inherit property rested
 with the deceased man's family. The widow and her children
 were entitled to nothing. The Intestate Succession Act passed
 in 1989 guarantees widows a 20 percent share and children a 50
 percent share in the inheritance of a deceased man's
 property. Divorce laws are applied to men and women equally.
 There are no reliable statistics on the extent to which
 violence against women, including wife beating, occurs.
 Domestic assault is a criminal offense, but, in practice,
 police are often reluctant to pursue reports of wife beating
 or other forms of abuse. According to women's rights
 advocates, nondomestic violence against women is not generally
 tolerated by traditional or civil authorities. Victims
 usually report attacks, and legal action is taken. In crimes
 against women where rape, serious injury, or death occurs,
 men--including husbands--can receive sentences up to, and
 including, the death penalty.
 According to the 1980 census, the percentage of literacy among
 Zambians above the age of- 15 is 75.4 per cent for males and
 53.1 per cent for females. In employment, Zambian men and
 women receive equal pay for equal work. However, there is no
 legal redress for women who are refused employment on the
 basis of their sex. Within the workplace, regulations often
 deny married professional women the fringe benefits (cars,
 housing etc.) provided to their male colleagues.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Zambia has a history of strong labor union organizations,
 dating from the establishment of the copper mines during the
 1930's. Zambia's 18 large national unions, organized by
 industry or profession, are all members of the Zambia Congress
 of Trade Tinions (ZCTU), the sole legal confederation.
 The ZCTU is not controlled by the party or the Government, and
 union leaders frequently criticize government policy on such
 subjects as wages, economic policy, conditions of service, and
 labor representation in party and government organs. The ZCTU
 is democratic and regularly conducts open elections to select
 its leadership.
 
 
 433
 ZMBIA
 With the economic downturn and implementation of stringent
 reform measures, there has been an increase in labor unrest.
 Under existing legislation, strikes are permitted only after
 all other recourse has been exhausted. In practice, virtually
 all strikes are illegal, since they almost-always commence
 before the mandatory process of mediation has run its course.
 The Government normally has relied on persuasion and continued
 mediation to end strikes once they have begun.
 Deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in widespread
 labor unrest. Throughout the year, teachers, bank workers,
 air traffic controllers, foresters, railway workers, sugar
 refinery workers, miners, and junior doctors were among the
 groups that mounted boycotts, 'go-slows," and strikes. The
 Government instructed education officers to compile lists of
 teachers involved in class boycotts so disciplinary action
 could be taken but later backed down in the face of protests
 from the ZCTU and the teachers union. Twenty-six air traffic
 controllers were arrested and charged with taking part in an
 illegal strike. President Kaunda declared in 1989 that he
 would not tolerate any more wildcat strikes and would insist
 on total industrial peace. The Minister of Labor warned that
 trade union leaders abetting strikes would be deregistered and
 cease to hold office at any level while offending unions would
 be dissolved.
 The ZCTU is a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 ZCTU's right to organize and bargain collectively with
 employers is codified under regulations in the Industrial
 Relations Act (IRA). These rights are respected in practice.
 The IRA provides a mechanism for initiating and settling
 worker-employer disputes and provides for the establishment of
 an industrial relations court. Union rights against
 management interference or discrimination have been readily
 upheld by the industrial relations court. There are no exrort
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Slavery, involuntary servitude, and forced labor are
 prohibited by the Constitution. Generally, these prohibitions
 are observed. In its 1989 report, the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts reiterated its
 longstanding request to the Government to modify various
 legislative provisions which it finds incompatible with
 Convention 105 on forced labor. The provisions in question
 impose imprisonment, involving forced labor, for expressing
 certain political views and/or for engaging in political
 activities outside the UNIP as a means of labor discipline or
 as a punishment for having participated in strikes. The ILO
 Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
 also considered this issue at the ILO conference in June and
 requested the Government to take urgent action.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age is 16. This and other age restrictions
 apply to the industrial sector, where, because of adult
 unemployment, there are few employees under age 16. However,
 persons under age 14 are often employed in the commercial and
 subsistence agricultural sectors. In 1986 (the most recent
 
 
 434
 ZAMBIA
 year for which statistics are available), 163,216 children
 aged 12 to 14 were employed--mainly on family farms--out of a
 tot91 population of 464,809 in that age group.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Zambian law regulates minimum health and safety standards in
 any industrial undertaking. Enforcement of these laws is
 carried out by the Ministries-of Mines and Labor. The Office
 of the Inveztigator General exists to redress the excessive
 use or abu6e of power by government officials against their
 subordinates.
 There is no general minimum wage in Zambia. However, each
 industty has its own minimum wage determined through the
 process of collective bargaining. In industries where
 collective bargaining is not effective, the Minister of Labor
 and Social Services has determined a lowest wage of an amount
 equivalent to aboul $1.00 a day for cleaners, office
 orderlies, and watchmen. An average wage for shopworkers is
 about $32 per month which is insufficient to provide an
 adequate standard of living. Most Zambian workers must
 supplement their incomes through second jobs, some subsistence
 farming, or reliance on the extended family. The normal
 workweek is 40 hours. There are legal requirements for.annual
 leave (2 days per month of service) and maternity leave (90
 days). Women are legally excluded from night work and a
 variety of hazardous occupations.
