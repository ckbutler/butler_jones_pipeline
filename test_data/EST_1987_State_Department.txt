 ESTONIA
 Estonia was an independent state between the two World Wars
 but was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as a constituent
 republic of the U.S.S.R. The United States does not recognize
 the forcible incorporation of Estonia into the U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Estonia is subjected to the same
 centralized rule, the same Constitution and judicial system,
 and the same restrictions on civil and pdlitical liberties as
 in the Soviet Union. Moreover, Soviet policy toward the
 Estonian nation arouses great concern because the process of
 Sovietization and Russianization threatens its survival as a
 distinct echnic nation. Because of a low birthrate and an
 official settlement policy that has resulted in an influx of
 Slavic, primarily Russian, settlers in the recent past,
 Estonians make up only 63 percent of the total population, as
 compared to 92 percent in 1939.
 The standard of living in Estonia is higher than the Soviet
 average, but the margin is shrinking. Estonians resent the
 fact that too much of the national income they generate is
 transferred to other republics, and they complain of the
 declining quantity and quality of food supplies and consumer
 goods.
 While the situation appears to have eased slightly during late
 1986 and 1987, expressions of Estonian nationalist and
 religious sentiment continue to meet with repression on the
 part of the Soviet authorities. Under discussion are changes
 in the Soviet legal code which would eliminate some laws and
 regulations used to incarcerate or institutionalize political
 activists. Even if these changes were instituted, however,
 the regime would retain a number of legal tools of repression.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In past yeats, Estonian activists have died in Soviet custody,
 but proof of direct official responsibility for their deaths
 is seldom available.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances in 1987 of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In Estonia, as throughout the Soviet Union, cruel and inhuman
 treatment of prisoners occurs during both interrogations and
 confinement in labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric hospitals.
 Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners is common, as is
 detention under extremely unhealthful conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted in so broad a manner
 that persons may be arrested and convicted for trying to
 exercise their basic human rights. During 1987 the number of
 such arrests appeared to have decreased sharply, apparently in

 ESTONIA-
 keeping with Soviet Communist Party General Secretary
 Gorbachev's campaign for more "openness" in and
 "democratization" of Soviet society. This campaign has
 improved somewhat the ability of Estonians to express their
 views and criticize the Government. However, one leading human
 rights activist, Tiit Madison, was compelled to leave Estonia
 and renounce his citizenship because of his activities.
 Estonian activists Heiki Ahonen, Lagle Parek, and Arvo Pesti,
 all sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment and 2 years of exile in
 1983 for writing and signing open letters and appeals, were
 among those freed under a series of U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
 decrees, starting in February, which released a large number
 of political prisoners convicted under "political' Articles 70
 (anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda) and 190-1 (anti-Soviet
 slander) of tbe Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic
 Criminal Code. Also released was activist Jaan Korb.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite provisions for judicial objectivity in both the
 Estonian and Soviet Constitutions, the State completely
 controls the judicial process and, in political cases,
 arbitrarily decides the outcome of all trials to suit its
 requirements. No rights of a defendant override the
 compelling "interests of the-State." A few Soviet public
 figures spoke out in 1987 for-strengthening the rights of
 defendants in Soviet trials, but it is as yet unclear whether
 or how such reforms might be implemented.-
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in personal life is pervasive through
 the use of informers, mail censorship and confiscation,
 electronic monitoring of telephones, and other means. Contacts
 between Estonians and visitors from foreign countries continue
 to be discouraged, and those who engage in such contacts are
 often subject to harassment by the authorities. Nonetheless,
 interference with mail and telephonic communications appears
 to have diminished slightly during the past year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties on condition that their exercise does not
 threaten the security of the Socialist system. In practice,
 the authorities rarely tolerate dissident behavior of any
 kind. While Gorbachev's "glasnost'" (openness) campaign has
 expanded the ability of official and unofficial writers to
 explore heretofore taboo subjects and to spotlight economic
 and social problems, these opportunities are still subject to
 controls, and their limits have not been stabilized or defined.
 A new pregs law is being drafted. No questioning of Estonia's
 status as a Soviet republic or of the Communist Party's
 monopoly of power is permitted, and while subjects such as
 environmental damage are discussed more openly, they are still
 subject to self-censorship. All Estonian newspapers,
 magazines, journals, and books remain firmly under the control
 of the Communist Party, which, in the final analysis, decides
 what shall and shall not be published.

 ESTONIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The peaceful assembly of citizens is subject to unpredictable
 levels of harassment and repression. On August 23, several
 thousand Estonians took part in an unprecedented unofficial
 march in Tallinn to bring pressure on the Soviet Government to
 renounce the signing in 1939 of the Molotov-Ribbentrop
 Non-Aggression Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union,
 which became the basis for the Soviet occupation and
 annexation of Estonia. While the authorities did not
 interfere with the demonstration, they strongly denounced it
 in the press and accused Western radio stations of instigating
 it. Some of the demonstrators were briefly detained.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public
 organizations, but this right has been limited by legislation
 and regime policy. During the past year, unofficial groups
 have been tolerated, but some harassment has occurred, and
 their status remains insecure. The regime continues to
 exercise control over the official mass organizations.
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Estonia.
 Although the Constitution grants all Soviet citizens the right
 to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise this
 right, independently of the state-controlled unions, are
 repressed brutally. Past efforts to call strikes at state
 enterprises have been denounced by local authorities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Soviet Constitution provides for the right to
 profess, or not to profess, any religion, both the Party and
 Government promote atheism while at best barely tolerating
 organized religion. Lutheran and other pastors are often
 called in for questioning in an attempt to intimidate them and
 reduce their authority and activities. The authorities engage
 in constant efforts to harass and suppress numerous
 unregistered Baptist, Pentecostalist, and other religious
 groups throughout Estonia. In general, the policies of
 "glasnost'" and "perestroyka" (restructuring) have benefited
 religious believers less than other social groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor respected
 in practice. The right to emigrate by choice is not recognized
 by Soviet law. Travel abroad for family reunification or
 family visits is limited by restrictive legislation and
 arbitrary enforcement. Over the past few years, several
 Estonians have been imprisoned for allegedly "attempting to
 leave the Soviet Union." Many Soviet Jews repeatedly have
 been denied permission to emigrate, and the vast majority of
 Estonians are not even allowed to apply. Nonetheless, the
 dramatic, albeit limited, upsurge in Soviet Jewish emigration
 affected Jews in Estonia as well. The number of Estonians
 allowed to visit relatives in the United States, and the
 number of United States citizens formerly residing in Estonia
 who were allowed to return as visitors, rose in 1987. At
 least one Estonian activist, former political prisoner Tiit
 Madison, was compelled to depart Estonia for the West.

 ESTONIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Citizens of Estonia, like those of the Soviet Union, are not
 free to change the system of government. Soviet authorities
 strictly forbid all political activity outside the framework
 of the Communist Party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government in late 1986 and 1987 repeatedly
 expressed its readiness to discuss human rights issues, a
 change'from previous practice, and created an Administration
 for Humanitarian and Cultural Ties in the Foreign Ministry.
 Nonetheless, the Government's attitude towards investigation
 of the human rights situation in Estonia remained basically
 negative, as demonstrated by the continued imprisonment under
 harsh conditions of Helsinki monitor Mart Niklus.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution. Tensions between ethnic
 Estonians and ethnic Russians are always near the surface in
 Estonia, and they appear to be increasing as the proportion of
 the Russian-speaking population grows.
 One manifestation of this is the reluctance of Estonians to
 learn or use the Russian language. In 1979 only 24 percent of
 Estonians said they spoke Russian well, a decline of 5 percent
 from 1970. Furthermore, Russian speakers are often greeted
 with hostile stares. Both of these developments run counter
 to efforts by the authorities to promote the use of the Russian
 language. Many Estonians report that Russians, both living in
 and visiting Estonia, suffer frequent harassment, such as
 vandalism and physical and verbal attack. Restaurants and
 bars are often informally off-limits to one or the other
 group, and ethnic brawls are not uncommon. In August and
 September 1987, the authorities discussed programs to expand
 the study of Estonian by children in the early grades of
 elementary school, to increase the number of textbooks and
 courses in the Estonian language available for Russian-speaking
 adults, and to improve the qualifications of Estonian-language
 teachers.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 assists women iq~obtaining and retaining jobs. In general,
 however, women ho d less remunerative positions than men do in
 the same professions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor conditions in Estonia are identical to those in the rest
 of the Soviet Union: The statutory minimum age for the
 employment of children in 1986 was 16, and the standard
 workweek was 40 hours. The minimum wage was set at $112 per
 month at the official rate of exchange. According to the
 latest Soviet official data, the average wage is about $272
 per month. Soviet law establishes, in general terms, minimum
 healthy and safety conditions. According to the Soviet press,

 the laws on maximum hours of work and health and safety
 standards are widely ignored.
