 HAITI
 Haiti has had a long and troubled history of autocratic
 rule characterized by many periods of political
 instability and human rights abuses. The country
 is constitutionally a republic. Executive authority
 is vested in a president for life. The legislature
 is a unicameral chamber, with members elected for
 six-year terms. In practice, virtually all effective
 government powers are concentrated in the presidency.
 During the eight months that the legislative assembly
 is in recess, major sections of the constitution
 concerning protection of individual liberties are
 suspended, and the president has full powers to
 rule by decree. Considerable open political opposition
 to the government was permitted in Haiti during
 the period 1976-80. In November 1980, however,
 dozens of persons were arrested on various charges
 of conspiracy and subversion. Seventeen of them,
 including journalists and opposition political party
 leaders, were expelled from Haiti. In August 1981,
 26 of those arrested were brought to trial in the
 criminal courts on charges of conspiracy and arson.
 Twenty-two, including the head of the Christian
 Democratic Party, were found guilty and sentenced
 to 15 years at hard labor. Four others received
 one-year sentences. Appeals are pending.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There were no reports of torture in 1981.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings, a traditional practice in Haitian jails,
 continue to be administered with some frequency in
 connection with the interrogation of suspects or the
 punishment of prisoners violating prison discipline.
 The government has not taken any effective measures
 to eradicate this practice. Physical facilities,
 medical care and diet in Lncarcerative facilities
 are generally poor. Reports from reliable sources,
 however, indicate political prisoners have been
 treated reasonably well. Lesser offenders may be
 visited by family members, who may also bring them
 food, but persons considered a political threat
 to the government are likely to receive few or no
 visits or mail.
 c. Disappearances
 The police frequently fail to inform family members
 of an individual's arrest. However, the police
 ordinarily do not refuse to confirm an arrest if in-
 quiries are made. There have been no "disappearances'
 in recent years.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Haitian constitution provides that no one can
 be followed by government authorities, arrested or
 detained except as determined by required procedures
 of law and according to the prescribed forms. The
 government does not generally observe these guarantees
 in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is unevenly observed.
 According to the constitution, arrests should be
 followed by an appearance before a judge within
 48 hours. However, this provision is often not
 followed. Indigent defendants often remain in prison
 for months without trial.
 In the August 1981 trial of 26 political dissidents
 associated with the Haitian Christian Democratic
 Party, the accused were charged with three counts of
 conspiracy and arson. The trial was open and in
 accordance with Haitian law. The defendants parti-
 cipated in the selection of the jury and were rep-
 resented by able counsel. Witnesses testified,
 and evidence was presented. Nine other political
 prisoners are awaiting trial.
 The court of appeals (cour de cassation) is the
 highest court in the judicial system. Its judges are
 appointed by the president for ten-year terms.
 The judicial system is not independent of the executive.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There were no reports of invasion of the home in 1981.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Haitian constitution provides for freedom of
 speech, press, assembly and religion. The press
 code promulgated in April 1980 remains unchanged.
 Though less harsh than the previous codes, it retains
 serious restrictions: a formal requirement (which can-
 not be met by daily newspapers) that all publications
 be submitted to the censors 72 hours in advance; the
 licensing of press credentials by the ministry of
 the interior; and the prohibition of material critical
 of the president or his family. In addition, during
 1981, the independent press and radio stations felt
 constrained to avoid almost all direct criticism
 of the government. In October 1981, however, the
 weekly independent magazine, "Le Petit Samedi Soir,"
 published a strong attack on the government for
 agreeing to the United States-Haitian program to
 interdict illegal migrants.
 There were no reports of interference by the government
 with academic inquiry in natural or social sciences.
 Little in the way of trade union organikation or
 collective bargaining exists, and strikes are extremely
 rare. Unions must obtain recognition from the ministry
 of labor and conform to the labor code which provides
 for a direct government role in labor disputes.
 
 
 461
 Communist and other left-wing groups are prohibited
 from organizing, and groups not registered with
 the government are limited to public assemblies
 of fewer than 20 people. What labor union activity
 there was decreased with the 1980 expulsion of leaders
 of the "Centre Autonome des Travailleurs Haitiens,"
 which was Haiti's only independent labor forum.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 In September 1981 the governments of the United
 States and Haiti signed an agreement to stop the
 illegal migration of Haitians to the United States.
 An estimated 800,000 Haitians have left the country
 over the past 20 years, primarily in search of better
 economic opportunities and in some cases, for political
 reasons. More than 5,000 Haitians per year are issued
 immigrant visas and travel legally to the United
 States. In addition, during January-September 1981
 more than 1,000 Haitians per month illegally entered
 the United States. The Haitian government has made
 an effort to stem the illegal immigrant tide by seizing
 vessels on occasion, and fining or imprisoning boat
 captains and crews. In May 1981 the Haitian government
 received a proposal from the International Committee
 on Migration to establish an office of migration and
 resettlement for Haitians. The plan is still under
 consideration.
 The government does not impede domestic movement.
 Foreign travel requires a passport and exit visa,
 which together can cost up to a maximum of $97, but
 there is no indication the Haitian government attempts
 to control travel for political or other arbitrary
 reasons. Those who leave illegally are subject to
 fine or imprisonment, but the government has given
 assurances it will not prosecute or punish such
 migrants who have left Haiti without fulfilling
 these requirements. Checks on a sample of returnees
 from the United States indicates that these assurances
 have been kept to date.
 Under the terms of a bilateral agreement, the government
 receives an unspecified but fairly substantial re-
 cruiting fee for allowing Haitian migrant workers
 to work in the Dominican Republic sugar harvest.
 There is no evidence that workers are involuntarily
 made to go to the Dominican Republic to fulfill the
 terms of the agreement, although there have been
 substantial and documented charges that they work
 under harsh conditions.
 Except for married women seeking exit visas (for
 which they need permission of their husbands), there
 appears to be no discrimination against women in
 matters of internal or foreign travel, emigration
 or repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Participation in ruling Haiti is limited to a small
 group of people associated with President Duvalier.
 In accordance with the constitution, President Duvalier
 was designated president by his father and predecessor,
 
 
 462
 Francois Duvalier. He was subsequently confirmed
 as life president in a national referendum. In the
 last elections for the unicameral legislature, held
 in 1979, one independent deputy was elected, although
 he and the remaining members of the legislature are
 all supporters of the government. Two fledgling
 independent political parties, established in 1979,
 suspended operations in 1981. The Haitian Christian
 Democratic Party leader, his daughter, who was the
 party secretary general, and 20 other party members
 were convicted of conspiracy and arson in 1981 and
 are now serving 15-year prison terms. The head
 of the Christian Party remains in exile following
 his 1980 deportation from Haiti. The conviction
 of the head of one of these independent parties
 and the deportation of the other have effectively
 neutralized organized internal political opposition.
 The Communist Party is specifically outlawed. Various
 private groups, such as the Haitian Association
 of Manufacturers and the National Committee of Women,
 have criticized government positions on specific
 issues. The government's division of human rights,
 in the ministry of foreign-affairs, was not active
 during the year.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human.Rights
 The government of Haiti authorized the International
 Committee of the Red Cross to visit political prisoners-
 at three places of detention in April-May 1981. The
 results of the visit are confidential. President
 Duvalier also authorized the International Committee
 to repeat the visit in March 1982. The United Nations
 Human Rights Commission delegated a special rapporteur
 to Haiti in order to continue its consideration
 of the human rights situation there.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere,
 with a per capita income under $300, and one of the
 least developed countries in the world. It has
 limited mineral resources and many deficiencies in
 infrastructure. Agriculture employs about 70 percent
 of the population. Intense pressure on land resources
 has destroyed the forest cover on hillsides suitable
 for cultivation -- while only 40 percent of the land
 is considered arable, about 53 percent is actually
 cultivated. Average plot size is less than two acres,
 too small for modern farming methods. Many peasants
 do not enjoy clear title to their land, which impedes
 their access to agricultural credit. Reliable estimates
 place 78 percent of the rural and 55 percent of
 the urban population below the absolute poverty
 level.
 Infant mortality is high, with a rate of 130 per
 1,000. Hospitals are rudimentary, and life expectancy
 is 53 years. Many Haitian children have no access to
 schooling. During the past six years the government,
 with international donor assistance, has been engaged
 in extensive school construction. The World Bank
 and AID estimate that 58 percent of Haitian children
 had access to primary schooling in 1978. However,
 the literacy rate remains low, and in 1978 the adult
 literacy rate was just 23 percent.
 
 
 463
 Social services are severely limited outside the
 capital city. Sanitation facilities are virtually
 non-existent, and illnesses are easily spread since
 93 percent of the rural inhabitants do not have
 access to safe water. The fertility rate of 5.7
 remains high, although family planning programs
 are gaining greater acceptability.
 Agricultural productivity has been declining, as
 plots are sub-divided into ever smaller pieces and
 increasingly unsuitable slopes are brought under
 cultivation. Port-au-Prince and other urban areas
 are experiencing abnormally rapid growth because of
 rural flight to the cities. Urban living conditions
 are worsening as a result. There is a housing density
 of approximately two persons per room, and sanitation
 facilities are poor, with only 38 percent of the
 urban population having access to safe water. There
 is increasing urban unemploymenty no precise figures
 on this can be obtained, but the Haitian department
 of information estimates that 41 percent of those
 seeking work cannot find it.
 The economy is also facing serious problems common
 to other Caribbean countries. Domestic inflation
 is approximately 20 percent. There are capital out-
 flows, shortfalls in government revenue and increased
 petroleum costs. During 1981 the gross national
 product is estimated to have approached $1.5 billion,
 with a real growth rate close to two percent.
 Aid in 1981 to Haiti from all official sources amounted
 to about $100 million, most of which is directed toward
 improvements in agriculture, education, health and
 transportation. In 1981 the Haitian government began
 to exercise greater control over expenditures and
 economic reform measures as recommended by international
 financial institutions.  It appears that the government
 is attempting to curtail fiscal'and administrative
 practices of previous years, such as diversion of
 public funds by government officials, which undercut
 Haiti's development efforts and had severe impact on
 the government's budgetary solvency and foreign
 exchange position. Centralization of budgetary
 accounts and revenues appears virtually complete.
 The government has, with outside help, completed
 the southern highway, many secondary roads, clinics,
 schools, the electrification of a number of provincial
 cities and the extension of the telephone system.
 With foreign assistance, it is expanding secondary
 roads through an extensive construction program.
 The minimum wage is $2.64 per day. There are, however,
 many workers for whom the minimum wage does not apply,
 and who have difficulty in earning enough to provide
 for their basic needs. While there is a government
 social security plan, few urban workers and no rural
 workers are covered.
 The Haitian constitution gives equal rights to men
 and women. However, under Haitian civil codes,
 married women forfeit the right to manage their
 own property, are required to live in their spouse's
 residence and must have the husband's written per-
 mission to obtain an exit visa. Qualified Haitian
 women have access to most jobs, including government
 appointments. They receive wages in general equal
 to those received by their male counterparts. Although
 54 percent of the economically active population
 is female, women are concentrated in nonskilled
 occupations, and lack of education bars them from
 the better job opportunities.
