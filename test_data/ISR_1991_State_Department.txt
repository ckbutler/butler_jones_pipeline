 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty political
 system and free elections. There is no constitution, but a
 series of basic laws defines the responsibilities of government
 institutions. The legislature (the Knesset) can limit the
 government and force its dissolution. Israel has an
 independent judiciary. Public debate on issues of concern to
 Israelis is open and lively. A vigorous free press scrutinizes
 all aspects of Israeli life and politics.
 Since Israel's founding in 1948, it has been in a formal state
 of war with most of its Arab neighbors, except Egypt, with
 which it concluded a peace treaty in 1979. As a result of the
 1967 war, Israel has occupied the areas of the West Bank, the
 Gaza Strip, the eastern sector of Jerusalem, and the Golan
 Heights. Israel has experienced numerous terrorist incidents,
 within and outside its borders. In this atmosphere of
 hostility and threat, Israel has relied heavily on its military
 and related services for security and has retained many of the
 security-related emergency regulations from the preindependence
 British Mandate period.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the General Security
 Service (GSS, also known as Shin Bet), which is under the
 authority of the Prime Minister's office. The police are under
 the authority of a separate minister. The Israeli Defense
 Forces (IDF)--which include a significant portion of the
 Israeli adult population in either active duty or reserve
 status--also play a role in maintaining internal security. The
 IDF is under the authority of a civilian Minister of Defense.
 The Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee reviews the
 activities of the IDF and the Shin Bet.
 Israel has a predominantly market economy with substantial
 government regulation and subsidies for some basic
 commodities. Economic policy has a strong social welfare
 orientation. Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of
 living.
 Israeli citizens enjoy a broad range of civil and other human
 rights. Israel's Arab citizens'have nonetheless not shared
 fully in the rights granted to, and the duties levied on,
 Jewish citizens. In 1991, as in recent years, Israel's most
 significant human rights problem has been its practices in the
 occupied territories.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.' Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political kilfings in Israel are neither practiced nor
 sanctioned.by Israeli authorities. In the context of the
 extreme political tension between Israel and the Palestinians,
 * Because the legal status of the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan
 Heights, and East Jerusalem and the political and human rights
 conditions there differ sharply from those in Israel, the
 situation in the occupied territories is dealt with in a
 separate report following the report for Israel.
 
 
 1431
 ISRAEL
 intercommunal killings are often assumed to have political
 motivation. In 1991 Israeli authorities asserted there was
 enough circumstantial evidence to link the murder of 11
 I-sraelis to Arab nationalist motivations. For example, in
 March 4 Israeli women waiting at a bus stop were stabbed to
 death by a Palestinian, 2 alleged members of a fundamentalist
 Islamic group were arrested for the murder of a 67-year-old
 Beersheba resident in September, and in October a Palestinian
 resident of the occupied territories drove his vehicle into a
 bus stop in Israel, killing 2 Israeli soldiers and wounding 11.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of goverrment-condoned disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Israeli laws and administrative regulations prohibit such
 practices. (See the occupied territories report for a
 discussion of allegations of mistreatment of Palestinian
 prisoners from the occupied territories who are incarcerated in
 detention facilities located in'Israel.)
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Israeli law and practice provide guarantees against arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment; Writs of habeas corpus and other
 procedural and substantive safeguards are available.
 Defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Administrative detention, with no formal charge or trial, is
 permitted under emergency regulations. The Minister of Defense
 may issue a detention order for a maximum of 6 months. Within
 48 hours of issuance of such an order, a detainee must be
 brought before a district judge. The process of review to
 confirm, shorten, or overturn the detention order must be
 carried out within 3 months. The detainee is entitled to be
 represented by counsel and may appeal to the Supreme Court.
 The Ministry of Justice reports that two Israeli citizens were
 held in administrative detention in 1991. Israel continued to
 hold most Palestinian administrative detainees from the
 occupied territories in detention centers inside Israel. (For
 a full discussion of administrative detention and deportations
 of Palestinians, see the separate report on the occupied
 territories.)
 According to 1991 Israeli press reports, scores of Lebanese and
 Palestinians, who were captured in Israel's self-proclaimed
 security zone in southern Lebanon and brought to Israel for
 trial on criminal charges and who have been imprisoned in
 Israel following conviction, continue to be held in Israeli
 prisons even though they have completed serving their sentences.
 Israel does not exile its citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law and followed in
 practice. The judiciary is independent and effectively
 insulated from political interference. All nonsecurity trials
 are open except in those instances in which the interests of
 the parties are deemed best served by privacy.  Security cases
 may be tried before a military court or a civil court and may
 
 
 1432
 ISRAEL
 be partly or wholly closed to the public. The burden of
 justifying nonpublic proceedings falls on the prosecution.
 Defense counsel is present, even during closed proceedings, but
 may be denied access to some evidence on security grounds. In
 security cases in which access to some evidence is denied, that
 evidence is not presented to the court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected
 by law within Israel. Emergency regulations permit mail to be
 stopped, opened, and even destroyed on security grounds. A
 1979 law allows tapping of telephones for security reasons,
 with cohfirmation by the Prime Minister or Defense Minister.
 Interference with mail and the tapping of telephones are
 practiced in some cases. In June State Comptroller Miriam
 Ben-Porat issued an official report reviewing Police Ministry
 performance. It concluded that Israel issued more court
 permits for phone taps than other democracies, noting that in
 1990 Israel police tapped 1,001 telephones. Ben-Porat also
 said that, in many cases, police recorded all conversations on
 a monitored phone, not just those relating to the investigation
 for which they have been given a permit. According to
 government sources, the Ministry of Police will soon issue its
 own report addressing the possible misuse of wiretaps.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 (See the separate report on the occupied territories.)
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Individuals, organizations, the press, and the electronic media
 freely debate a wide range of public issues and criticize
 government officials and policies, except where emergency
 regulations authorize censorship or outlaw statements or
 written materials that express or encourage support for illegal
 organizations.
 Publications and domestic or foreign press (including radio and
 television) articles dealing with security-related matters must
 be submitted to the military censor. In 1991 the media were
 under reporting restrictions during the Persian Gulf War,
 especially with respect to Iraqi attacks on Israel by
 surface-to-surface Scud missiles. Arabic-language publications
 and press are censored more strictly than Hebrew-language
 equivalents. Recent High Court of Justice rulings have
 narrowed the range of material that may be censored on security
 grounds. The trial of an Arab poet accused in 1990 of writing
 a book of .poems alleged to incite violence continued through
 1991. An Israeli Arab magazine was closed during the Gulf War,
 allegedly for advocating revolution.
 Prosecution for statements or writings on behalf of outlawed
 organizations are relatively infrequent, but, when pursued, are
 almost always directed against Israeli Arabs.  Provisions
 against maintaining contact with, or accepting support from,
 outlawed organizations apply to the media as well as
 individuals, although no media organization was prosecuted on
 these grounds in 1991. It is government policy to withhold
 licenses for distributing Israeli Arab magazines in the West
 
 
 1433
 ISRAEL
 Bank and Gaza. Only the progovernment Arab weekly Al-Sennara
 is regularly distributed in the occupied territories, along
 with two Hebrew language newspapers.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. The
 quasi-independent Israel Broadcast Authority, whose director is
 appointed by the Government, retains significant control over
 electronic media. According to government sources, Israel is
 on the verge of adopting private commercial radio and
 television with varying degrees of government monitoring.
 Israeli Arab publishers reportedly must undergo thorough checks
 of their criminal and security records before distribution of
 their publications is permitted in Israel.
 In 1991, after a 2-year trial period, theater censorship was
 abolished.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Israelis representing almost any point of view are free to
 assemble and associate, and the law and court rulings protect
 these rights. However, emergency regulations prohibit
 membership in, or contact with, outlawed organizations, their
 subdivisions, or their individual members. In 1991 a Jewish
 Israeli peace activist, previously jailed in 1989 for such an
 offense, was again convicted and sentenced to a jail term of 18
 months for a similar contact. Under the same regulations, five
 Israeli Arabs were also convicted and sentenced to jail terms
 in 1991.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In Israel there are strong guarantees of freedom for all
 faiths. Approximately 82 percent of Israeli citizens are
 Jewish. Muslims, Christians, Druze, and members of other
 minority religions make up the remaining 18 percent. Travel to
 visit religious sites or perform religious obligations in and
 outside Israel is widely permitted. In' 1991 Israel approved
 the pilgrimage to Mecca of over 1,500 Israeli Muslims, a number
 significantly less than previous years owing to the situation
 in the Persian Gulf. In addition, the Israeli Government
 approved the year-end travel of over 1,200 Israeli Muslims to
 Mecca for Umra (also known as the "little hajj").
 Each recognized religious'community in Israel has legal
 authority over its members in matters of marriage, divorce, and
 conversion. Secular courts have primacy over questions of
 inheritance and legitimacy, but parties may bring cases to
 religious courts. Orthodox religious authorities have
 exclusive control over marriage and divorce of all members of
 the Jewish community, whether or not they are Orthodox.
 Missionaries are allowed to work in Israel. A 1977
 antiproselytizing law, prohibiting the offering and receipt of
 material benefits as an inducement to conversion, was not
 applied in 1991.
 See Section 5 for discussion of a new draft law, passed by the
 Knesset, which guarantees inter alia freedom of religion and
 belief.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli citizens may move freely within Israel except in
 military or security zones,.or in cases where they may be
 
 
 1434
 ISRAEL
 confined to their neighborhood or village by. administrative
 order under emergency regulations. Israeli citizens are free
 to travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have no
 outstanding military obligations or are not restricted by
 administrative order. In 1991 the Government lifted a
 longstanding ban on the travel of an Israeli Arab political
 activist, permitting him to attend a conference in the United
 States, and the law that required reserve soldiers to get prior
 permission from the military to leave the country was abolished.
 Israel welcomes Jewish immigrants, including Jewish refugees,
 to whom it gives automatic citizenship and residence rights.
 It accepts the return of Jewish Israeli citizens who have
 emigrated. Under the principle of family reunification, Israel
 has allbwed the return of a very few Arab refugees who fled
 Israel in 1948-1949, but has rejected the great majority of
 requests by such refugees to return.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with a multitude of
 parties representing a wide range of political views, in which
 the people have the right and the ability to change their
 government. Relatively small parties, including those whose
 primary support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in
 the Knesset. All adult Israeli citizens have the right to
 participate in the political process and to vote by secret
 ballot. Participation of eligible voters, including Israeli
 Arabs, in recent national and local elections has been high.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Private Israeli organizations are active in publicizing and
 litigating human rights issues and cases. The Government and
 the courts treat seriously responsible challenges to Israel's
 human rights practices.
 Israel is responsive to international and nongovernmental
 interest in its human rights situation. It hosts and works
 with a delegation of the International Committee of the Red
 Cross. It permits regular visits by a wide range of private
 and international organizations concerned with human rights.
 The Ministry of Justice's human rights office responds to human
 rights inquiries, and the Government has designated specific
 points of contact within the Ministries of Defense and Foreign
 Affairs to give timely responses to human rights inquiries from
 foreign governments, international bodies, and human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by the Equal Opportunity
 Law, which forbids sex discrimination. It requires employers
 to pay male and female workers equal wages for equal work.
 Other laws and regulations give protection to women employees
 regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and child care. The
 Government includes a senior adviser on the status of women,
 and the Civil Service Commission (a subsidiary unit of the
 Ministry of Finance, headed by a Commissioner, which is
 responsible for the rules and regulations relating to the
 government-wide employment of civil servants) and several
 
 
 1435
 ISRAEL
 government ministries have officers responsible for women's
 rights. Nongovernmental women's organizations work actively in
 promoting women's rights and welfare. Women are drafted into
 the military but do not fill combat positions. Domination of
 personal status law by religious courts means that
 women--particularly Jewish and Muslim women--are subject to
 restrictive interpretations of their rights in such crucial
 areas as marriage, divorce, and inheritance.
 The courts in Israel deal firmly with persons convicted of
 violence, including violence against women. Human rights
 groups, especially women's groups, are increasingly active in
 dealing with the issue of domestic violence against women, and
 the Government provides some funding for intervention
 activities. In 1991 a new law was passed, directed against
 domestic violence, which provides more effective assistance for
 victims of such abuse.
 A small number of Israeli Arabs, who comprise approximately 18
 percent of Israel's population, have risen to responsible
 positions in the civil service, generally in the Arab
 departments of government ministries. Arabs make up 12 percent
 of the voting-age population, and there are 6 Arab members of
 the 120-seat Knesset. The Arabic-speaking community has access
 to local and foreign Arabic press, publications, and media.
 Israeli Arabs have not received or attained the same quality of
 education, housing, or other services as Israeli Jews. Arab
 Israeli municipal officials state that the Government continues
 to underfund Arab municipalities. Relative to their numbers,
 Israeli Arabs are underrepresented in the student bodies of
 universities and in higher-level professional, academic, and
 business ranks.
 The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities, at their
 initiative, are subject to Israel's military draft, and some
 Hedouin Arabs serve voluntarily in special military units.
 However, most Israeli Arabs are not subject to the draft, and,
 although Israeli authorities assert they may volunteer, Arab
 citizens state that the few Arabs who do volunteer are
 generally rejected. The Government stated in 1991 that some
 Christian Israeli Arabs would be permitted to volunteer for
 military service. According to government sources, the
 minister in charge of minority affairs instructed the Prime
 Minister's Advisor on Arab Affairs to examine the question of
 voluntary national service as an alternative to military
 .service for those exempted from the draft. The current
 recommendation, yet to be adopted, is to allow a trial period
 during which national service for minorities will be on a
 voluntary basis. If found to be successful, it would become
 mandatory in 3 years. These sources say a public committee
 representing different views on the matter will be appointed to
 consider the proposal.
 Military service is a prerequisite or an advantage in obtaining
 a variety of governmental social and economic benefits,
 including housing and new-household subsidies and government or
 security-related industrial employment. Consequently, Arab
 Israelis have less access than other Israelis to such social
 and economic benefits.
 The Arab Israeli residents of the village of Ramiyeh were
 ordered by government authorities in 1991 to vacate their
 properties. The land had originally-been expropriated in 1976
 under general legislation that allowed such action for the
 
 
 1436
 ISRAEL
 public interest. Government officials state that the land will
 be used for' public housing, while the residents of Ramiyeh
 assert the land will be used to house new Jewish immigrants.
 Residents of Ramiyeh assert that the financial compensation
 offered for the land by the Government is much less than the
 market price for comparable land in the area. The residents
 have appealed the eviction and at year's end the two sides were
 still trying to reach an agreement before giving the case to
 the courts for final decision. Appeals against land
 expropriation, including those by Arab-Israelis, have seldom
 been successful.
 A new basic law, the Fundamental Human Rights Bill, has passed
 the Knesset and is currently under ministerial review,
 accordihg to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' legal division.
 This proposed law would enshrine the principles of equality
 before the law and prohibit discrimination on the basis of
 religion, nationality, race, or place of national origin.
 Section 6 Worker Rights,
 a. The Right of Association
 Israeli workers have freely established organizations of their
 own choosing. Most unions belong to the General Federation of
 Labor in Israel (Histadrut), although there is another, much
 smaller federation also in existence. Histadrut is independent
 of the Government and political parties, even though a majority
 of the elected leadership is identified with the Labor Party
 and there is also a significant Likud minority. Histadrut also
 has a significant Israeli Arab membership. About 80 percent of
 the work force, including Israeli Arabs, are members of
 Histadrut trade unions, and still more are covered by Histadrut
 social and insurance programs and collective bargaining
 agreements.
 Histadrut members democratically elect national and local
 officers and officials of its affiliated women's organization,
 Na'amat, from political party lists. Plant or enterprise
 committee members are elected individually.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. A 15-day notice
 prior to a strike or lockout is legally mandated unless
 otherwise specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 Unauthorized strikes do, however, occur. If essential public
 services are affected, the Government may appeal to labor
 courts, which include employer and employee representatives,
 for back-to-work orders while negotiations continue. Strike
 activity in 1991 was lower than in 1990 and no general strikes
 occurred.
 Unions freely exercise their right to form federations and
 affiliate internationally. Nonresident workers, including the
 approximately 84,000 nonresident Palestinians from the West
 Bank and Gaza working in Israel at the end of 1991, may not be
 members of Histadrut and may not organize their own trade
 unions within Israel. Palestinian trade unions in the occupied
 territories may not represent nonresident Palestinian workers
 in Israel. However, nonresident workers in the organized
 sector, including Palestinians from the occupied territories,
 are represented by Histadrut and are covered under its
 collective bargaining agreements. They may join, vote for, and
 be elected to shop-level workers' committees if their numbers
 
 
 1437.
 
 ISRAEL
 in individual establishments pass a minimum threshold.
 However, Palestinian participation in such committees is
 minimal.
 Labor laws applicable in Israel are applied to Palestinians in
 East Jerusalem and Syrian Arabs and Druze on the Golan
 Heights. (See the occupied territories report for discussion
 of worker rights in East Jerusalem and the West Bank and Gaza.)
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Israelis fully exercise their legal right to organize and
 bargain collectively. The majority union (generally Histadrut).
 is the exclusive bargaining agent. Nonresident workers may not
 organize on their own or bargain collectively but are entitled
 to representation by the bargaining agent and the protection of
 collective bargaining agreements. Before new security measures
 were imposed in 1991, a majority of the Palestinians worked
 outside the legal hiring system mechanism and lacked this
 protection (See Section 6.e.). Moreover, both Histadrut and
 labor attorneys report that in practice even legally admitted
 Palestinian workers do not always receive the full benefits to
 which they are entitled under such agreements.
 While there is no law prohibiting antiunion discrimination,
 local sources indicate that the basic law against
 discrimination could be used in the courts to contest
 discrimination based on union membership. No antiunion
 discrimination has been reported.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and neither
 Israeli citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in Israel
 are subject to such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 By law, children under age 15 may not be employed. School
 children aged 15 may not be employed without special permission
 except as apprentices or during school vacations. Employment
 of those aged 16 to 18 is restricted to ensure time for rest
 and education. Israeli labor exchanges do not process work
 applications for West Bank or Gaza Palestinians under age 17.
 .A labor inspection service enforces these provisions, although
 enforcement is difficult in smaller, unorganized enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Legislation in 1986 established a minimum wage at 45 percent of
 the average salary, calculated periodically. The minimum wage
 is generally sufficient to provide workers and their families a
 decent standard of living. Most wages and salaries are
 established in collective bargaining agreements. Along with
 union representation, the labor inspection service effectively
 enforces labor, health, and safety standards in the workplace.
 By law, maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours per
 week, 8 per day, and 7 the day before the weekly rest, which
 must be at least 36 consecutive hours and should include the
 Sabbath. By national collective agreements, the private sector
 established a maximum 45-hour workweek in 1988 while the public
 sector moved to a 5-day, 42 1/2 hour workweek in 1989.
 
 
 1438
 ISRAEL
 In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, the Government
 imposed new restrictions on West Bank and Gaza Palestinians'
 access to and employment in Israel. Longstanding requirements
 for work permits are now much more-stringently enforced than in
 previous years. The number of workers employed through the
 Israeli employment service labor exchanges rose from 33,000 in
 1990 to 74,000 by July 1991. The estimated number of illegal
 workers declined from approximately 72,000 to an estimated
 10,000 over the same time period, according to the Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA).
 Palestinians working in Israel are technically covered by the
 laws and collective bargaining agreements that cover Israeli
 workers, including minimum wage, sick leave, severance pay,
 paid vacations, and pensions administered by the MLSA. Because
 of travel restrictions on workers from the West Bank and Gaza
 during the Gulf War, many Palestinians working in Israel lost
 their employment and did not-receive the severance pay to which
 they were entitled.
 Palestinians working in Israel are paid through the employment
 service, which receives their wages and benefits from employers
 and pays the recipient after deducting taxes, a 1-percent union
 fee, and contributions to the National Insurance Institute
 (NII). The same percentage (5.35 percent) for NII
 contributions is deducted from the pay of legally hired
 Palestinians and from Israeli workers. For their NII
 contributions Palestinian workers receive some of the benefits
 that Israeli workers receive: full coverage for workmen's
 compensation, employer bankruptcy insurance, and maternity
 benefits (only for births in Israeli hospitals). However,
 nonresidents do not receive a number of benefits granted
 Israeli citizens: NII old-age, survivors, and disability
 pensions, unemployment compensation, insurance for long-term
 care or injury in nonoccupational accidents, NII children's
 allowances, or NII-administered welfare programs. Because of
 these benefit restrictions, only 1.2 percent of Palestinian
 workers' pay goes to the NII. The remaining 4.15 percent is
 nonetheless deducted from their pay in order to equalize the
 labor costs of Palestinians and Israelis. These funds are
 deposited with the Ministry of Finance, which applies them to
 social and development programs administered by the Government
 of Israel in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians have
 criticized the lack of public accounting for the Government's
 use of these funds. The Government insists that all money thus
 collected is used exclusively in the West Bank and Gaza but has
 not made the budget figures public.
 In 1991 an employer brought a suit to the Supreme Court,
 arguing that Palestinian workers and their employers should
 have to contribute only that percentage of the salary which
 applied to benefits directly received by the employee. In
 October the Supreme Court recommended that the Government form
 an interagency committee to study the issue.
 Israeli settlers living in the occupied territories but working
 inside Israel have the same benefits as all other Israeli
 workers.
 Histadrut continues to have limited success in defending
 Palestinian workers against dismissal for absences caused by
 official curfews or Palestinian-called general strikes. In
 March it hired two lawyers to attend to Palestinians' claims
 and in October it opened a 24-hour telephone hotline to
 increase access to Palestinians represented by Histadrut.
 
 
 1439
 ISRAEL
 In 1991 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions as
 well as the Director General of the International Labor
 Organization reiterated earlier recommendations for steps to
 equalize the benefits and protections available to Israeli and
 nonresident Palestinian workers. They both also called for
 steps to revamp the social security system to give nonresident
 Palestinians full social benefits or to reimburse them for
 those deductions that did not go to direct social benefits.
 
 
 1440
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Whereas almost all other reports in this volume deal with the
 relationship between governments and their own citizens, this
 report concerns the practices of the authorities of one country
 in the exercise of governmental functions in territories
 outside that country and under military occupation. The lands
 known as "the occupied territories" (the West Bank, Gaza Strip,
 Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem) were occupied by Israel in
 1967 and have been under military occupation since then.
 Israel is not recognized internationally to have sovereignty
 over any of the occupied territories, but has asserted
 sovereignty over and annexed East Jerusalem. The West Bank and
 Gaza are governed under applicable Jordanian, Egyptian, and
 British law, as modified by Israeli military orders. Israeli
 law and administration have been extended to the Golan
 Heights. The United States-considers Israel's occupation to be
 governed by The Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth
 Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilians in
 Time of War. Israel does not consider the Convention
 applicable but states that it observes its humanitarian
 provisions.
 Israel governs the West Bank and Gaza through a military-backed
 Civilian Administration (CIVAD), which is responsible to the
 Minister of Defense. There are Arab municipalities with both
 elected and Israeli-appointed mayors. However, municipal and
 local elections have not been held since 1976. Palestinian
 political activity is restricted, and Palestinians do not have
 the opportunity to participate in significant political or
 economic decisions in the occupied territories, except for East
 Jerusalem, where Palestinians have largely boycotted the
 political process. Israeli settlers in the territories (about
 5 percent of the Palestinian and Jewish population of the
 territories, exclusive of East Jerusalem) are subject to
 Israeli law, which generally treats them more favorably than
 Palestinians are treated under military occupation law and
 administration. Economic policies often discriminate in favor
 of Israeli interests and Israeli settlers in the territories.
 Since 1967 Palestinians have protested, often violently,
 against Israel's occupation. The "intifada," Palestinian
 civilian massive unrest characterized by violence followed by
 severe Israeli countermeasures, erupted in late 1987. It
 continued in 1991 but at a significantly reduced level. The
 number of Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces and in
 intra-Palestinian violence was significantly lower than in
 1990. There were also fewer demolitions and sealings of houses
 and rooms, and the number of administrative detainees at the
 end of 1991 was less than one-third the number detained at the
 end of 1990. Nevertheless, the United States remains concerned
 about human rights abuses resulting from Israeli occupation
 practices and Palestinian violence.
 In 1991, as a result of security concerns prompted by
 Palestinian support for Iraq during the Gulf war, Israel
 imposed a 24-hour curfew over the West Bank and Gaza that
 lasted for over a month. This curfew resulted in economic
 losses, inability to obtain medical care, and disruptions in
 the distribution of foodstuffs and other necessities.
 In 1991 the Government of Israel announced and began to
 implement measures intended to reduce some of the restrictions
 and lighten the burden of occupation on Palestinian residents
 of the territories. Bridge-crossing formalities were eased,
 
 
 1441
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 the numbers of permits for new industries increased, and new
 taxation policies were formulated. By the end of the year, all
 but one of the occupied territories' six Palestinian
 universities had been given permission to reopen. In addition,
 the Government raised to more senior levels the responsibility
 for approving curfews of over a few hours.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political and extrajudicial killing are not officially condoned
 by Israel.
 In 1991 nonuniformed security personnel are known to have
 killed 27 Palestinians, many of whom were unarmed but were
 generally either wanted, masked, or fleeing from authorities
 after writing graffiti. Palestinians and human rights groups
 claim that many of these individuals were killed without
 warning or after surrendering or having been subdued. Isra-li
 authorities have acknowledged the operation of special
 undercover units whose members circulate among Palestinian
 activists, but insist that such units observe standard rules of
 engagement, which narrowly define when lethal force may be used
 by security forces and provide penalties for violations (see
 Section l.g. below). Israeli authorities say that they have
 charged a Colonel who commanded one such unit, as well as
 soldiers under his command, for failing to adhere to
 established procedures and that a number of other cases are
 under investigation.
 Palestinian attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians in
 the occupied territories in 1991 resulted in 12 deaths and at
 least 254 injuries, an increase over such attacks in 1990.
 Israeli civilians killed four Palestinians in 1991.
 During 1991, 140 Palestinians were killed by other Palestinians
 (compared to 165 in 1990), most often because of alleged
 collaboration with Israeli security services. Other grounds
 for such killings were alleged crimes against public morality,
 interfactional political disputes, and private feuds. Many
 other Palestinians were wounded, and there were frequent
 threats and acts of intimidation. Some of these attacks and
 acts of intimidation were carried out under the direction of
 the covert leadership of the uprising. However, many of the
 attacks were by individuals or gangs operating autonomously.
 Some of the victims were village officials and Arab policemen,
 and some of the victims were armed. The Palestinian press in
 1991 published numerous statements of Palestinian leaders
 condemning such killings.
 Israeli authorities prosecute Palestinians accused of murdering
 other Palestinians as well as of murdering Israelis, and
 sentences are severe. However, much intra-Palestinian violence
 goes unpunished because of the problems of law enforcement,
 including the refusal of Palestinians to cooperate with Israeli
 authorities. The Government also prosecutes Israelis accused
 of killing Palestinians. Sentences given to Israelis for
 killing Palestinians are generally much lighter than sentences
 handed down to Palestinians convicted of killing either
 Israelis or Palestinians.

 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearances in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law, and Israeli authorities
 say that torture is not authorized or condoned in the occupied
 territories. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) orders forbid the use
 of force after the detention of a suspect and the cessation of
 violent resistance. In 1987 the Landau judicial commission in
 a secret report specifically condemned "torture" but approved
 of "moderate physical and psychological pressure" to be used to
 secure confessions and to obtain information concerning
 terrorism.
 In 1991 international, Israeli, and Palestinian human rights
 groups published detailed credible reports of torture, abuse,
 and mistreatment of Palestinian detainees in prisons and
 detention centers. The practices reportedly included hooding;
 deprivation of food, sleep, and sanitary facilities; forced
 standing; confinement in a narrow, small space; slaps, blows
 and beatings; and threats against the detainee or his family.
 Most such abuse takes place immediately after arrest and during
 the first few days of detention and interrogation when
 detainees are denied access to family members, attorneys, and
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The ICRC
 cites this isolation period as an issue of great concern.
 Aside from these forms of abuse, a Palestinian human rights
 organization reported in detail eight credible cases of
 electric-shock torture in the Hebron military headquarters
 between April and September 1991. Other allegations of the use
 of electric shock in Hebron, Bethlehem, and Ramallah (possibly
 involving the same group of interrogators) were under
 investigation at year's end.
 As a result of the reports alleging mistreatment during
 interrogation noted above, the IDF in-1991 instituted an
 internal investigation which recommended, among other things,
 that IDF personnel no longer be involved in interrogating
 Palestinians. The Ministry of Justice and General Security
 Services (GSS, also known as Shin Bet) began a second
 investigation, but the results of their efforts have not been
 made public. IDF authorities report that, of 16 complaints of
 mistreatment made against IDF interrogators, 8 were dismissed
 after investigation, 4 are still under investigation, and the
 findings in the remaining 4 investigations were forwarded to
 the military prosecutor for decision.
 Most convictions in security cases are based on confessions.
 An attorney is normally not allowed to see a client until after
 interrogation is complete and a confession, if obtained, has
 been made. The ICRC is not allowed access to detainees until
 the 15th day after arrest. Human rights groups point to this
 prolonged incommunicado detention of security detainees as
 contributing to the problem of abuse.
 If a detainee claims to the court that his confession was
 coerced, his trial is stopped, and a "trial within a trial" is
 held to determine if the allegation of coercion can be
 substantiated. Israeli and Palestinian attorneys and human
 rights organizations have said they do not know of any case in
 which a confession was set aside because the court had
 
 
 1443
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 determined that coercion had been used. Even if the claim is
 verified, however, evidence obtained as a result of, or
 information derived from, the confession may still be used
 against the defendant. According to Israeli authorities, 90
 complaints of violence by IDF personnel in detention facilities
 were investigated in 1991. The results of those investigations
 are not available.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In January Israel deported four Gazans alleged to be leaders of
 Hamas, a fundamentalist Islamic movement. All four withdrew
 their appeals to the Israeli High Court when they were denied
 the opportunity to examine secret evidence against them. In
 May, after an unsuccessful appeal to the High Court, four other
 Gazans alleged to be senior Fatah leaders were deported.
 Deportation orders are subject to judicial review; the High
 Court of Justice has never overturned a deportation order. The
 United States considers deportations to contravene Article 49
 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 Administrative detention for'alleged security reasons without
 formal charges continued in 1991. The United States opposes
 the use of administrative detention and believes that
 individuals accused of crimes should be brought before a court,
 presented with the evidence, and be allowed to defend
 themselves against the evidence. Numbers peaked at
 approximately 1,400 in February (during the Gulf War) and then
 declined to fewer than 350 in December. Israeli officials
 state that administrative detention is used only when IDF legal
 advisors have determined that there is sufficient evidence to
 detain a person and that the evidence has been corroborated by
 two sources, but that the evidence cannot be presented in open
 court because to do so would compromise the method of acquiring
 the evidence, which is often provided by informers whose lives
 would be jeopardized if their identities were known.
 Administrative detention orders are issued for a maximum'of 6
 months and are renewable. Each order is subject to judicial
 scrutiny, with access by the court to all evidence, including
 secret evidence. Each detention order must also be approved by
 the Minister of Defense. .Secret evidence is not available to
 the detainee or his attorney. There are no restrictions on the
 number of times an administrative detention order may be
 renewed, but at each renewal a new order must be issued which
 is subjected to at least the same judicial scrutiny as the
 original order. Israel claims that administrative detention is
 imposed only for activity that is both dangerous and serious
 and that it is not'imposed for the expression of political
 views or nonviolent activity. "Conspiracy" or "incitement to
 violence" often may include activity which itself is-nonviolent
 but which nevertheless is deemed by Israel as involving
 participation in a conspiracy leading to violent acts.
 District military commanders may order administrative detention
 without formal charges. An order for detention or renewal of
 detention may be appealed to a military judge. In appealing
 detention orders,'detaindes or their attorneys, while not
 having access to secret evidence, may question security service
 witnesses concerning the general nature of that evidence.
 Nonsecret evidence may be challenged directly. Rulings by
 military judges may be reviewed by the High Court, which also
 may see the secret evidence. According to the IDF,
 approximately 30 percent of the detention orders appealed in
 1991 were reduced or reversed on appeal.
 
 
 1444
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The authorities continued to transfer detainees and prisoners
 out of the occupied territories to detention facilities in
 Israel, especially to the Ketziot camp in the Negev Desert and
 Megiddo Prison near Afula. In the view of the United States,
 the transfer of prisoners from the occupied territories to
 Israel contravenes Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 Family visits to Megiddo Prison were suspended during the Gulf
 conflict and resumed in late September 1991. Family visits to
 Ketziot Prison began in November 1991.
 Any soldier may arrest without warrant a Palestinian who has
 committed, or is suspected of having committed, a criminal or
 security offense. Persons arrested for common crimes in the
 occupied territories are usually provided the opportunity for
 bail, access to an attorney, and a statement of charges
 (although these opportunities are sometimes delayed). Bail is
 rarely available to those arrested for security offenses.
 Persons may be held in custody without a warrant for 96 hours
 and then must be released unless a warrant is issued. A
 warrant may be issued by a police officer for 7 days and may be
 extended by a police inspector for an additional 7 days if the
 investigation warrants extension. For extensions beyond 18
 days from the date of arrest, the detainee has to be brought
 before a military judge, where he is entitled to defense
 counsel. A military judge may extend the detention for a
 period of no longer than 6 months from the date of arrest. If
 there is an indictment during this period, a judge may order
 indefinite detention until the end of the trial; if not, the
 detainee must be released.
 A detainee has the right to see a lawyer as soon as possible.
 However, in the cases of security detainees, an officer may
 issue a written order to delay access to counsel for no longer
 than 15 days for reasons of security or the efficiency of
 investigation. Senior officials or judges may extend this
 period up to 75 days for the same reasons. In practice,
 security detainees are usually denied access to a lawyer during
 the initial investigation for periods of 7 to 15 days. Israeli
 regulations permit prisoners to be held in isolation from
 family and from other detainees during interrogation.
 Israeli authorities claim that they attempt to post
 notification within 4a hours; Palestinians assert that families
 and lawyers are normally notified much later and often locate
 the detainee through their own efforts. The ICRC attempts to
 help by passing on to families (by telephone) the information
 it receives from Israeli prison officials. A military judge
 may delay notification of arrest to immediate family members,
 attorneys, and consular officials under the law for up to 12
 days. A military commander may appeal to a judge to extend
 this period in security cases for an unlimited time.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Palestinians accused of nonsecurity offenses are tried publicly
 In local courts by Palestinian judges appointed by Israeli
 officials, except where jurisdiction has been transferred by
 military order. Since the'beginning of the uprising, regular
 local law enforcement has deteriorated seriously. Many Arab
 policemen and judges have resigned, and Palestinian courts have
 functioned sporadically.
 Palestinians accused of security offenses are tried in Israeli
 military courts. Articles 64 ahd 66 of.the Fourth Geneva
 
 
 1445
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Convention govern security offenses that may be tried in
 military courts. Security offenses are broadly defined by
 Israel and may include charges of political activity that
 itself may be nonviolent but which is deemed to involve
 participation in a conspiracy leading to violent acts. Serious
 charges are tried before three-judge panels, and defendants are
 entitled to appeal the judgments of such courts as a matter of
 right. Charges are brought by military prosecutors, and
 suspects are entitled to counsel. Lesser offenses are tried
 before single-judge courts, and the court of military appeals
 may hear appeals of decisions by those courts based on the law
 applied in the case, the sentence imposed, or both.
 The right of appeal does not apply in all cases, and appeals in
 some cases require court permission. As of December, the
 military appeals court had heard 563 appeals, about
 three-fifths of which were accepted. "Acceptance" of an appeal
 can mean anything from a complete reversal of the prior
 decision to alteration of the punishment, including either
 reducing or lengthening the sentence.
 The military justice system has opened new courts and added
 additional judges. Trials are delayed for several reasons:
 witnesses do not appear; the defendant is not brought to court;
 files are lost; or attorneys fail to appear. Human rights
 groups cite these delays as an additional source of pressure on
 defendants to plead guilty in order to avoid serving a period
 of pretrial detention which could exceed the sentence likely to
 result from'plea bargaining. The'IDF reported that the total
 numbers of prisoners declined during 1991. In December Israeli
 authorities reported that there were 11,344 Palestinians in
 military detention centers and regular prisons. Of those,
 approximately 60 percent had completed their trials and were
 serving sentences, a higher percentage than in 1990.
 In cases involving minor offenses, such as stone-throwing, a
 "quick trial" may be held, in which a charge sheet is drawn up
 within 48 hours and a court hearing scheduled within a few
 days.
 Most military trials are public, although access is controlled
 and in some cases limited. Consular officers are allowed to
 attend military court proceedings involving foreign citizens,
 but there have been delays in gaining admission. Acquittals
 are very rare in security cases, with about 96 percent of
 defendants being convicted of the original security charge
 Most convictions in military courts are based on confessions.
 Physical and psychological pressures and reduced sentences for
 those who confess contribute to the likelihood that security
 detainees will sign confessions. Confessions are usually
 recorded in Hebrew, which many defendants cannot read. Israeli
 authorities state that confessions are made hy and repeated to
 the defendant in Arabic, although they are written down in
 Hebrew because Israel court personnel often can speak Arabic
 without being able to write-it.
 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories accused of
 security and ordinary criminal offenses are tried in the
 nearest Israeli district court-under Israeli law. These courts
 are presided over by civilian judges. Procedure and
 admissibility of evidence are not governed by military
 occupation law. Settlers convicted in Israeli courts of crimes
 against Palestinians regularly receive lighter punishment than
 Palestinians convicted of crimes against either Israelis or
 other Palestinians.
 
 
 1446
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Military authorities in the occupied territories may enter
 Palestinian homes and institutions without a warrant in pursuit
 of security objectives. However, authorization by an officer
 of the rank of lieutenant colonel is required prior to entry.
 Forced entries are used in IDF operations and are sometimes
 accompanied by beatings and destruction of property. Israeli
 authorities state that forced entry may lawfully occur only
 incident to arrest when entry is resisted and that limited
 force may be used only to subdue or restrain those resisting
 entry or arrest. Arbitrary beatings and destruction of
 property during searches are punishable violations of Israeli
 military regulations, and compensation is due to victims in
 such cases.
 Human rights organizations report that such violations often go
 unpunished. Israeli officials state that over $225,000 in
 compensation has been paid in 18 cases*.
 According to press reports, security authorities demolished 55
 houses and sealed 62 for security reasons in 1991, compared to
 94 demolished and 87 sealed in 1990. Israeli authorities
 report 43 demolitions and 58 sealings in 1991. Security forces
 assert the right to confiscate and then to demolish or seal all
 or part of the house of a suspect, whether he is the owner or
 only a tenant, and to do so before a suspect is brought to
 trial. The final decision to seal or demolish all or part of a
 house is made by a number of high-level Israeli officials,
 including the Coordinator of the Civil Administration. Israeli
 authorities assert that they demolish or seal only rooms or
 houses occupied by Palestinians known to have actively .
 participated in a murder or caused serious physical injury.
 Owners of houses ordered to be demolished have 48 hours to
 appeal to the regional IDF commander, and final appeals may be
 made to the High Court of Justice. According to Israeli
 authorities, almost all demolition orders in 1991 were
 appealed. Of these, 20 percent in Gaza and about 15 percent in
 the West Bank were changed, most to sealings. The High Court
 overturned one demolition order in the occupied territories in
 1991.
 While Palestinians say that owners of properties that are
 demolished or sealed are not allowed to rebuild on the same
 property, Israeli authorities assert there is a formal
 procedure whereby owners may apply to regional military
 commanders for permits to rebuild or unseal and that there are
 a few cases where owners have received relief in this manner.
 -They acknowledge that the process is difficult and complex,
 because individuals must first regain possession of the
 confiscated land. The United States believes that the
 demolition or sealing of a home as punishment of families
 contravenes-the Fourth Geneva Convention. This type of house
 demolition or sealing is enforced only against Arab residents
 in the occupied territories.
 Mail and telephone conversations are sometimes monitored.
 Telephone service to specific areas is sometimes interrupted by
 the authorities.
 
 
 1447
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Casualties attributed to security forces' use of standard,
 rubber, and plastic ammunition declined in 1991, following the
 general decline in large-scale demonstrations and the sharp
 reduction of IDF patrols in Palestinian villages and towns,
 designed to avoid incidental confrontations with Palestinians.
 IDF regulations permit the use of standard ammunition only when
 (1) soldiers' lives are in imminent mortal danger, or (2) when
 a soldier is detaining a person suspected of a dangerous crime
 and the suspect attempts to escape after having been duly
 cautioned in various ways. Only a specific attacker may be
 fired on, except when facing immediate danger; fire is to be
 directed at the legs only; and fire may be directed at a
 fleeing suspect only if a serious felony is suspected, and as a
 last resort. Soldiers may fire at any fleeing masked person
 but may fire standard ammunition only after exhausting other
 methods such as tear gas, rubber bullets, and warning shots.
 Estimates of the number of casualties from violence in the
 occupied territories vary, but almost all categories of
 violence declined substantially during 1991. Figures compiled
 from press, Palestinian sources, and international
 organizations indicate that a total of 97 Palestinians were
 killed by security forces in 1991 (78 according to the Israeli
 Government), compared to 140 in 1990; 4 Palestinians were
 killed by Israeli civilians, compared to 10 in 1990; and 140
 were killed by other Palestinians (183 according to the Israeli
 Government), compared to 165 in 1990. Estimates from the same
 sources of the numbers of Palestinians wounded by security
 forces varies from 841 (1,475 according to the Israeli
 Government), to over 5,000. Israeli authorities state that
 during this period 404 Palestinians were injured by other
 Palestinians. Government sources also report that 1 soldier
 and 6 Israeli civilians were killed, and 685 soldiers and
 policemen and 238 Israeli civilians were injured by
 Palestinians. Press reports indicate that 12 Israeli civilians
 were killed and 220 were wounded by Palestinians in 1991.
 Charges of beatings and physical abuse by Israeli security
 forces were again made in 1991, but according to the IDF the
 number of complaints of such incidents declined compared to the
 previous year.
 The IDF says that it automatically investigates every fatality
 in the occupied territories. Nonlethal violent incidents are
 not routinely investigated unless a complaint is made.
 Investigations into lethal incidents are lengthy. Human rights
 organizations state that the IDF does not make sufficient
 effort to obtain testimony of Palestinian witnesses; IDF
 officials say that Palestinians usually refuse to cooperate
 with investigations. According to the IDF, during 1991 three
 soldiers were tried in military tribunals for causing the death
 of Palestinians. One was convicted, the indictment of another
 was rescinded, and the trial of a third was ongoing as of the
 end of the year.
 Human rights groups state that many investigations into
 killings did not result in disciplinary action, and when
 disciplinary actions, either administrative or judicial, were
 brought, punishments were lenient. For example, an IDF colonel
 convicted in April of giving illegal orders in 1988 to beat
 Palestinians was demoted to private but not given any prison
 
 
 1448
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 sentence. In February two General Security Services officers
 were sentenced to 6 months in prison after being convicted of
 negligence and reckless indifference to human life for the
 beating death in 1989 of a Gazan under their interrogation.
 On a number of occasions Israeli security forces forcibly
 removed from hospitals Palestinian suspects undergoing medical
 examination or treatment. Israeli authorities state that
 suspects are only removed from medical facilities when a
 physician has determined that the patient's medical condition
 permits him to be moved. Authorities also note that suspects
 often seek sanctuary in medical facilities, even when they are
 not ill or injured but are simply fleeing arrest.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 East Jerusalem is an active center of Arabic publication,
 including newspapers. No newspapers are published in the West
 Bank or Gaza, although Jerusalem papers are distributed there.
 Israeli authorities impose restrictions on the Arabic press,
 citing broadly defined security reasons.
 Publications in East Jerusalem must submit to military
 authorities for prior censorship all copy relating to the
 security, public order, and safety of Israel and the occupied
 territories. Some reports and editorials related to the
 uprising and Palestinian political goals were permitted, but
 articles and editorials were routinely expurgated. Arabic
 translations ot news stories related to the uprising, which had
 previously appeared in the Hebrew-language Israeli press, were
 routinely censored from the Arabic press.
 The display of Palestinian political symbols, such as flags,
 national colors, and graffiti is prohibited in the occupied
 territories and is punishable by stiff fines (usually $150 to
 $300 for graffiti) or imprisonment. Palestinians are often
 required to erase graffiti found by security forces regardless
 of whether they are responsible for it. Public expression of
 -support for the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), its
 component factions, Muslim extremist groups (such as Hamas),
 and other banned organizations is officially prohibited.
 No broadcast media originate from the occupied territories, and
 authorities have jammed inflammatory radio broadcasts from
 neighboring countries. Palestinian press offices have been
 censored and restricted on security grounds, and in a number of
 instances have been closed by Israeli authorities.
 At least 18 Palestinian journalists were arrested or detained
 in 1991 by Israeli authorities on security charges, such as
 filming in a closed military area. Numerous other journalists
 were interrogated, press offices were reportedly raided, and
 occasionally telephones were cut off on security grounds.
 A permit is required to import publications into the occupied
 territories. Imported materials are censored or banned for
 anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli content, support for the intifada
 or Palestinian nationalism, or when deemed a threat to
 security. Possession of banned materials, such as uprising
 leaflets, is punishable by fine and imprisonment. The IDF-
 periodically designated locales as closed military areas. One
 significant effect of such action is to exclude journalists not
 
 
 1449
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 under military escort. Reports by foreign journalists are
 subject to censorship under a system of self-regulation.
 Of the four West Bank and Gaza universities remaining closed at
 the beginning of 1991, three were permitted to reopen during
 the year, Hebron and Al-Najah in August and Gaza Islamic
 University in September.
 Secondary and elementary school closings in the 1990-91
 academic year varied greatly from region to region, but on the
 average schools lost about 40 percent of the days scheduled in
 a normal year, even though the school year was extended 1 month
 to June 30. Strike days called by the "United National
 Leadership of the Uprising" (UNLU) or local activists accounted
 for a substantial number of school days lost, in addition to
 the 24-hour curfew imposed on all Palestinians in the occupied
 territories from January 16 to February 19. (Elementary grades
 were allowed to resume classes on February 19, while the
 remaining grades were allowed to return in stages over the next
 4 weeks.) Israeli authorities continued to close individual
 schools for short periods, citing security problems emanating
 from the schools.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Military orders ban public gatherings of 10 or more people
 without a permit. Political parties and other groups are
 banned, including some labor unions viewed as being affiliated
 with banned organizations such as Hamas or the PLO. Private
 organizations officially must be registered, though some
 operate without licenses or interference from Israeli
 authorities.
 Palestinian charitable, community, professional, and self-help
 organizations were permitted to operate unless their activities
 were viewed as overtly political or supporting the uprising.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in the occupied territories.
 No group or sect is banned on religious grounds. Muslim. and
 Christian holy days are observed, as are Jewish holy days in
 Jerusalem and the settlements. All faiths operate schools and
 institutions (although religious schools were subject to the
 same extended closure as other schools in the occupied
 territories). Religious publications circulate, subject to the
 laws for publications detailed in Section 2.a.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Occupied Territories,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 New security measures adopted in 1991 at the conclusion of the
 Gulf War seriously hindered Palestinian travel within the
 occupied territories. In the spring, the authorities required
 that any Palestinian wishing to enter Israel or Jerusalem
 obtain a special permit issued by the Civil Administration.
 Palestinians found in Israel or Jerusalem without such a permit
 were subject to a fine (usually about $160) or arrest. Because
 most main roads in the West Bank pass through Jerusalem, the
 new permit system effectively divided the West Bank into two
 parts, with the result that Palestinians from the north could
 not easily travel to the south, and vice versa, unless they
 qualified for a travel permit. In addition, Gazans could
 travel to East Jerusalem and the West Bank only with such a
 permit. Persons not found eligible to receive permits were
 
 
 1450
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 adversely affected if they wanted to visit or transit East
 Jerusalem for religious observances, medical care, or to attend
 institutions of higher education. Israeli authorities state
 that while 17,010 special identity cards that prevented access
 to Israel and Jerusalem were issued in the West Bank in 1991,
 only 9,078 remained valid at the end of the year. Seventy-two
 restricted identity cards remained valid for Palestinian
 residents in Gaza, which authorities expected shortly to
 exchange for regular identity documents.
 Israeli authorities continued to impose frequent curfews and
 military closures as security controls in 1991. In July the
 Government announced that in the future only the head of the
 Civil Administration could authorize curfews of over a few
 hours' duration.
 Citing security concerns linked to Palestinian expressions of
 support for Iraq in the Gulf War and attacks in Israel by
 Palestinians from the occupied territories, Israel imposed a
 24-hour curfew over the Palestinian population of the West Bank
 and Gaza from January 16 to February 25. Israeli settlers and
 settlements in these areas were not included in this curfew but
 were subjected to the far less rigorous travel restrictions
 imposed on Israelis in Israel. While Israeli authorities
 lifted the curfew every few days for a few hours so that the
 population could shop for food and other essentials,
 transportation problems caused periodic food shortages in many
 areas. Almost all Palestinian educational, commercial,
 industrial, and agricultural activities ceased during the
 curfew.
 The authorities issued curfew passes for key medical personnel
 and ambulances, but some Palestinians said they could not leave
 their residences to apply for these passes. A major
 Palestinian hospital reported a more than 50-percent decline in
 the number of women admitted for childbirth during the war.
 Another major curfew was imposed December 1-15 on some 100,000
 Palestinians in the Ramallah area following the shooting death
 of an Israeli settler. Authorities lifted the 24-hour curfew
 for a few hours on several days to allow residents to buy
 food. On December 15, the authorities replaced the 24-hour
 curfew with a nighttime (5 p.m. to 4 a.m.) curfew on the major
 urban centers and declared 150 meters on either side of the
 roads outside built-up areas to be closed military zones at
 night. Neither the 24-hour curfew nor the other restrictions
 were applied to Israeli settlers, who roamed freely in Ramallah
 and other Arab towns during the period. Israeli authorities
 state that the curfew and other restrictions were pursuant to
 their attempts to apprehend the murderers of the settler and
 were necessary to prevent further violence. Human rights
 groups assert that the curfew was excessive and constituted
 collective punishment.
 Thousands.of Palestinians in the occupied territories travel
 abroad each year. Citing security concerns, Israel has imposed
 travel restrictions on some political activists. In addition,
 Palestinian men between the ages of 16 and 35 who cross the
 bridge to Jordan generally must remain out of the occupied
 territories at least 9 months. All Palestinians need exit
 permits, which require several clearances (including an annual
 certification of payment of all tax liabilities), in order to
 travel outside the occupied territories. In August authorities
 announced changes in bridge-crossing procedures that could make
 such travel easier. Palestinians have been told that they may
 
 
 1451
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 obtain bridge-crossing permits from local post offices rather
 than having to obtain them from the Civil Administration. In
 addition, authorities announced that they would reduce the
 extent of searches conducted on Palestinians crossing the
 bridge.
 There are no obstacles to emigration, except the fear of losing
 residence permits. Israel sometimes refuses to renew the
 laissez-passers of Palestinians from the occupied territories
 who live or work abroad on the grounds that they have abandoned
 their residence, even though they may not have acquired foreign
 citizenship. Palestinians who obtain foreign citizenship
 ordinarily are not allowed to resume residence in the occupied
 territories; those who acquire the right to residence elsewhere
 or who remain outside the occupied territories for over 3 years
 are often not permitted to resume residence in the
 territories. They are permitted to return only as tourists and
 sometimes are denied entry entirely. Enforcement of the
 3-month limit for tourist visas for Palestinians is uneven.
 Permanent residency permits are usually denied to foreign-born
 spouses and children born in the occupied territories of
 nonresident mothers, although they are allowed to reside as
 temporary residents with renewable permits.
 Most Palestinians who were abroad during the 1967 war, or who
 have lost their residence permits for other reasons, are not
 generally permitted to return to reside permanently with their
 families. Israeli officials acknowledge that family
 reunification is limited for demographic, political, and
 economic reasons. According to Israeli authorities, in 1991
 some 635 family reunification applications were approved for
 Palestinians to reside in the West Bank and Gaza, and 119 were
 rejected. Human rights groups and local attorneys report that
 there are thousands of outstanding applications from prior
 years which have received no reply from the Israeli
 authorities. Adjudication of these applications is at the
 discretion of the CIVAD. Israeli authorities assert that the
 laws of occupation do not require Israel to permit the return
 of former Palestinian residents who were abroad in 1967 or who
 have lost their residency status by protracted absence and
 relocation of domicile, even if they were born in the
 territories. In mid-year, Israeli authorities announced that
 they would accept applications from Palestinians seeking
 permanent residence if the applicants were able and prepared to
 make sizable investments in the occupied territories.
 Restrictions on residence, tourist visas, reentry, and family
 reunification apply only to Palestinians resident in the
 occupied territories.
 Israeli authorities agreed in June 1990 to allow foreign-born
 wives and minor children of West Bank residents, who had
 entered prior to that date, to remain in the West Bank as
 permanent visitors. (The agreement does not apply to Gaza.)
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 The West Bank and Gaza are ruled under occupation by Israel's
 Ministry of Defense through a military government and civil
 administration. Israel does not permit Palestinians to
 participate in policy decisions concerning land and resource
 use and planning, taxation, trade, industry, and many other
 governmental functions. Some Israeli-appointed Palestinian
 mayors have resigned or stopped .iorking because of the uprising
 and threats or intimidation by other Palestinians.

 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Those Palestinian municipalities which have approved town plans
 are usually allowed to issue building permits within their
 boundaries. Municipal elections were last held in 1976 in the
 West Bank, and most mayors elected then were later dismissed
 or, in some cases, deported on security grounds. Municipal
 elections have not been held in Gaza since 1946, as they were
 not permitted by Egyptian as well as Israeli occupation
 authorities. Palestinians appointed by Israel have filled most
 vacancies. Some appointed mayors have resigned or stopped
 working because of the uprising and, in some cases, threats
 from other Palestinians. East Jerusalem is governed as part of
 Israel. Arab residents of East Jerusalem are permitted to vote
 in municipal elections but have largely boycotted them.
 Accordingly, no Arab resident of East Jerusalem now sits on the,
 city council. In the last municipal election (in 1989), less
 than 5 percent of Jerusalem's Arab population voted.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Israel normally permits international human rights groups to
 visit the occupied territories. Israel actively cooperates
 with a number of such organizations, and officials are
 generally available for meetings on human rights issues.
 However, some organizations complain that Israel's responses
 are-inadequate, that not all inquiries receive answers, or that
 some requests for meetings with officials or access to
 detention facilities are denied. Many local groups--Israeli,
 Palestinian, and mixed--are concerned with human rights. Their
 publications and statements are generally allowed to circulate
 in the occupied territories as well as to be sent abroad. They
 are allowed to hold press conferences. During the month-long
 curfew on Palestinians implemented by Israel during the Gulf
 War, human rights field workers were denied access to the West
 Bank and.Gaza.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Israeli law has been extended to cover most activities of
 Israeli settlers who live in the occupied territories, while
 Palestinians live under military occupation law. Under the
 dual system of governance applied to Palestinians and Israelis,
 Palestinians--both Muslim and Christian-are treated less
 favorably than Israeli settlers on a broad range of issues,
 including equality before the law, the right to residence,
 freedom of movement, sale of crops and goods, land and water
 use, and access to health and social services. Israeli
 settlers involved in security violations have been treated far
 more leniently than Palestinians guilty of similar offenses.
 Offenses against Israelis are investigated and prosecuted more
 vigorously than offenses against Palestinians, in part due to
 less cooperation from Palestinian witnesses. Israeli
 agriculture and manufacturing are protected against Palestinian
 competition from the territories, whereas all markets in the
 territories are in principle open to Israelis, subject to
 extensive Palestinian boycotts.
 Prior to the Gulf War crisis, Israel distributed gas masks
 within Israel but not to nearby West Bank and Gaza residents.
 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories received masks
 after a protest and, on the eve of the war and in response to a
 petition, the Israeli High Court ordered the authorities to
 distribute masks to the Palestinian population,-terming the
 
 
 1453
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 failure to do so "gross discrimination." Israeli authorities
 acknowledge they were unprepared and state that gas masks were
 provided to Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel in those
 areas deemed by the'Government to be potential areas for attack.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 The applicable sections for West Bank and Gaza Palestinians
 working in Israel are contained in the country report for
 Israel.
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor law in the West Bank is Jordanian Law 21 of 1960, as
 amended by military orders. It permits workers to join unions
 without Government authorization. It also permits the
 formation of unions by any group of 20 or more persons from the
 same trade or workplace, with prior government authorization.
 Two requests to register new labor unions were filed in the
 West Bank in 1991; one for the Union of Driving School Teachers
 and one for the Union of Hebron. Municipal Employees. The
 former was approved, while the latter was rejected, Israeli
 authorities state, because the local laws in the West Bank do
 not allow municipal employees to unionize. In 1991, 32
 registered unions were operating in the West Bank, in addition
 to approximately 100 unregistered unions.
 The labor law in Gaza is Egyptian Military Order 331, which
 supplements the prior British Mandate labor law and which has
 been amended by Israeli military orders. It allows the
 organization of unions on a workplace or craft basis. Since
 1979, unions have been permitted to operate under strictly
 enforced restrictions that, among other things, prevent
 elections of new union leaders and the opening of branch
 offices. As a result, only the six unions that existed in Gaza
 in 1967 operate, out of one office in Gaza City. All six Gaza
 unions held elections in 1991. No new unions were formed in
 Gaza in 1991, and no requests to organize were made to Israeli
 authorities.
 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are governed by the
 same law as workers in Israel and are free to establish their
 own labor unions. Israeli authorities officially bar East
 Jerusalem unions from joining the West Bank trade union
 federations, though this restriction has not been enforced.
 Individual Palestinian workers in East Jerusalem may belong
 both to local unions, some of which are affiliated with a West
 Bank federation, and to the Israeli Histadrut labor federation.
 Israeli authorities, citing security concerns, actively
 discourage many activities by unions in the West Bank and
 Gaza. The authorities assert that the West Bank umbrella
 federations and many individual unions are fronts for illegal
 political organizations rather than trade unions. Measures
 taken against trade unions include arrests, administrative
 detention, searches of trade union premises, and confiscation
 of union property, according to the 1991 report of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Director General.
 Israeli authorities state they do not knQw of any searches of
 union offices in the occupied territories in 1991 and that they
 do not interfere with legitimate union activities. The
 ILOreport states that various organizations, including the ILO,
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the
 human rights organization Al-Haq, have intervened in cases
 involving the arrest and detentions of union members or raids
 
 
 1454
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 on union premises and property confiscation. However, the
 report says, Israeli authorities have seldom responded to such
 interventions.
 The Government of Israel claims that no legitimate union
 activities are disrupted and that the actions complained of are
 intended to prevent illicit political and terrorist activity.
 The ILO Director General's report, however, complains that
 Israeli officials usually do not substantiate these claims with
 concrete, corroborative information, leading it to conclude
 that in-a majority of cases the measures taken by military
 authorities-are excessive and unwarranted.
 More than 100,000 West Bank Palestinians, representing a range
 of blue-collar and white-collar professionals, were members of
 over 130 trade unions in 1991. The great majority of West Bank
 unions belong to either the General Federation of Trade Unions
 in the West Bank (GFTU) or the General Federation of Trade
 Unions in the West Bank-Work Unity Bloc (WUB). The GFTU
 participates in meetings of the International Confederation of
 Arab Trade Unions (ICATU), although it is not formally
 affiliated. Both the GFTU and the WUB have applied for
 membership in the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU). The West Bank unions are independent of the
 Government of Israel and do not have official contact with the
 Israeli Histadrut labor federation.
 Military Order 825 of 1980, officially applied in the West Bank
 and unofficially in Gaza, requires that Palestinian unions
 present lists of candidates for union office to the Civil
 Administration for approval 30 days before elections. The
 order authorizes the CIVAD to remove from the lists candidates
 who have been convicted of a felony, including those sentenced
 for security-related offenses. The CIVAD has said it will
 enforce this order by disallowing the election of candidates
 not approved in advance. Because Palestinian unionists fear
 that the CIVAD will use the order to exclude those candidates
 who have served in administrative detention, they refuse to
 adhere to the order and hold elections at the workplace level
 without the approval of the authorities. The GFTU has
 petitioned the ICFTU to intervene with the Israeli authorities
 to allow federation-level elections and to act as an observer
 at such elections. No authorized federation elections are
 known to have occurred in 1991, but the six Gaza unions did
 hold union elections.
 There has been no dissolution of unions by administrative or
 legislative action. Under prevailing labor law, unions have
 the right to strike only after submitting a complaint to the
 CIVAD for mandatory arbitration. One legal strike took place
 this year in Ramallah, which lasted for 2 weeks. Israeli
 authorities have not interfered with unauthorized strikes
 called over strictly labor issues. According to Israeli
 authorities, the unions supported "strike" calls that were made
 by the "Unified National Leadership of the Uprising" and
 nationalist or religious movements.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor laws applicable in the occupied territories recognize the
 right to collective bargaining by unions that are recognized.
 The only legal forum for labor grievances in the West Bank is
 the CIVAD's military court system. Palestinians view the
 system as unsympathetic and prefer to use the traditionil
 technique of mediation by community notables.
 
 
 1455
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 There are no export processing zones in the occupied
 territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in the occupied
 territories.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 A 1978 military order raised the minimum working age in the
 West Bank and Gaza to 14, though this order is not effectively
 enforced, and underage labor is used in the agricultural sector
 and in some West Bank and Gaza factories.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In the West Bank, Jordanian law allows a maximum workweek of 48
 hours, except for certain hotel, food service, and cinema
 employees, whose workweek is 54 hours. In Gaza, Israeli
 authorities amended this law to provide for a 45-hour workweek
 for day-laborers, and a 40-hour workweek for salaried
 employees. There is no effective enforcement of maximum
 workweek laws, nor is there any minimum wage provision in the
 West Bank or Gaza. The Ministry of Labor's Office of
 Inspection Services is charged with enforcing health and safety
 standards in the West Bank and Gaza and claims to have
 undertaken a small number of inspections. Health and safety
 conditions in some factories do not meet industry standards
 established by international union organizations.
