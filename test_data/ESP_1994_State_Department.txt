 SPAIN
 Spain is a democracy with a constitutional monarch. The Parliament consists of
 two chambers, the Congress of Deputies and the Senate.
 The security forces are controlled by the Government- allegations of human rights
 abuse are generally investigated, and individuals found guilty are punished by law.
 Spanish security services also maintain anticorruption brigades which investigate
 allegations of governmental fraud or dishonesty. Since 1989 there has been a Spe-
 cial Advisor for Human Rights in the Ministry of Justice and Interior, charged with
 promoting humanitarian law and training senior members of law enforcement
 groups in human rights issues. Years-old charges of police abuse of detainees were
 still being investigated at year's end.
 The economy is market-based, with primary reliance on private initiative, al-
 though there remain a number of public-sector enterprises in key areas. The econ-
 omy has been in recession since 1992, but it grew by an estimated 1.7 percent in
 1994. While the unemployment rate improved, at year's end official data indicated
 it remained well over 20 percent. Actual unemployment is lower than these data in-
 dicate, due to the extensive underground economy. Nonetheless, the rate is problem-
 atically high. The main causes of this are the entry of large numbers of people into
 the labor force (disproportionately affecting women and youth) and some labor laws
 that tend to impede job creation. Parliament in 1994 enacted a labor reform package
 to help create jobs.

 The Constitution provides for the fundamental rights of freedom of speech, assem-
 bly, press, religion, nmvement, and suffrage and the Government respects these
 provisions. The Basque Fatherland and Freedom Seï¿½paratist Group (ETA) continued
 its longstanding terrorist campaign, committing killings and other abuses. The Gov-
 ernment's efforts to bring terrorists to justice were marred by detainees' accusations
 of ill-treatment. In September 1993 two suspected ETA collaborators died while in
 police custody; the Government has not yet released the results of its investigation.
 A prisoner died under disputed circumstances while in solitary confinement. Other
 human rights problems included persistent de facto discrimination against Roma,
 reports of police mistreatment of detainees, and maladministration of Spain's judi-
 cial system as it copes with a huge backlog of cases (of all kinds of crime) and a
 severe shortage ofjustices.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killin  by government forces but the September 1993 incident in which two sus-
 pe   d ETA collaborators died while in police custody was still under investigation
 at the end of 1994, and in February a prisoner was found dead in a solitary-confine-
 ment cell.
 Regarding the 1993 incident, one death was due to cardiac arrest, and the other
 to a fall from a second-story window. The Prime Minister gledged the Government
 would carr.y out an investigation, with total "transparency, until both deaths were
 fully explained. A prominent nongovernmental human rights organization launched
 its own investigation.
 The Government considers the February prison "suicide" case closed. While medi-
 cal evidence indicates the prisoner's death was the result of severe trauma to the
 head, there is no conclusive evidence as to whether this was caused by a severe
 beating by guards (as inmates allege) or by self-inflicted injuries (as authorities
 claim, saying he had a history of mental illness and self-beating). Local human
 rights organi ations are divided on this question.
 July a former Civil Guard member and three other defendants charged with
 the 1992 race-motivated killing of a female Dominican illegal immigrant were con-
 victed of the much-publicized crime. The ex-Guard member was sentenced to life im-
 prisonment (see Section 5).
 A detailed investigation by the judiciary completely exculpated the police in the
 case of an American citizen who died in 1992 after fleeing police in the Canary Is-
 lands; the family of the deceased, and their legal representative, accepted this out-
 come.
 To avoid a possibly negative ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, in
 March the Government agreed to settle out of court a 1982 case involving a youth
 who was killed while in police custody in the Canary Islands. The European Com-
 mission of Human Rights ruled in favor of Spain against the charges of torture, and
 that there was no violation of the right to life. But it concluded that the father of
 the victim had been denied due process in seeking justice for the death of his son;
 the Government awarded him $47,000 (6 million pesetas).
 There continued to be frequent terrorist incidents. During the first 10 months (lat-
 est data), 14 attacks attributed to the ETA resulted in 15 deaths and 39 injuries.
 As usual, the majority of those killed were members of security forces. However, in
 May the ETA planted bombs on beaches near San Sebastian, and the resulting ex-
 plosions maimed three persons. The ETA carried out beatings and killings of sus-
 pected drug dealers and others it deemed "enemies of the Basque people ; at least
 three people are believed to have been killed for this reason during the year. Other
 actions by the ETA and its affiliates caused property damage in the Basque region.
 In September a lawyer for Castilian-speakers opposing Catalonia's Law of Lan-
 guage Normalization (see Section 5) received a letter-bomb that failed to detonate.
 No one claimed responsibility, and there have been no arrests.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance. The Basque industri-
 alist whom the ETA kidnaped in 1993 was released later that year;, authorities have
 not been able to determine whether any ransom was paid. (The Government forbids
 payment of ransom by families of kidnap victims, and in some cases it has frozen
 the family's assets.)
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such acts. Spain is a signatory to the U.N. Convention against
 Torture. Nonetheless detainees charged with terrorism invariably assert they have
 been abused during detention, and similar charges are sometimes made by other de-
 tainees. In July a high-level investigation into the alleged abuse of six recently cap-
 
 
 tured terrorists concluded that the claims were unfounded. ETA members in Uru-
 guay unsuccessfully based their arguments against extradition on grounds they
 feared mistreatment in Spain.
 Nonetheless, documented cases of abuses do exist. Individuals, nongovernmental
 organizations, and the media frequently have accused the Civil Guard of
 unprovoked brutality, particularly in the Basque region. The Spanish Association
 Against Torture asserted that the number of complaints of police brutality increased
 by 40 percent from 1992 to 1993. In November it asked the Minister of Justice and
 Interior to review the status of 335 security personnel who have been officially im-
 plicated in torture or abuse. The U.N. Human Rights Commission reported in Feb-
 ruary that there are eight unresolved cases of individuas abused while in custody
 during 1992-93. In November the U.N. Committee Against Torture agreed for the
 first time to review a case alleging mistreatment by Spanish security forces; an ETA
 terrorist sentenced to over 2,000 years in prison claimed he was tortured during his
 1990 interrogation. In the military, various complaints of mistreatment of recruits
 surfaced in 1994, some of which led to prosecutions of military officers.
 In December 1993 the Supreme Court overturned the appeals of five former mem-
 bers of the Civil Guard convicted in 1990 of torturing the father of a suspected ETA
 member in 1981. The perpetrators received 6-month prison terms and 7 years on
 probation. Others implicated in the crime or its coverup received probation or rep-
 rimands.
 In March a court sentenced five national plice officers to 5 2 months in prison
 and 48 years on probation for torture and illegal detention of seven transients in
 1982 and for perjury.
 In July the Supreme Court overruled a lower court's decision that the statute of
 limitations had run out for charges against five policemen for torture in a 1982 inci-
 dent. (One defendant had been convicted earlier of a different torture charge, yet
 was able to keep his job during the years of litigation on the 1982 incident, and was
 even promoted to commander.) All are now serving sentences.
 In November two Civil Guard officers were convicted of torturing two female ETA
 suspects in 1984; the offenders were sentenced to 6 months in jail and 26 years on
 probation. Also in November, a Basque tribunal convicted three other officers of po-
 lice brutality in a retrial (ordered by the Supreme Court) of a 1982 case in which
 the three had been found not guilty; each was sentenced to 2 months in jail and
 2 months on suspension.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and the authorities respect this provision. A suspect normally
 may not be held more than 72 hours without a hearing. The Penal Code permits
 holding a suspected terrorist 2 more days without a hearing. An asylum law passed
 in May permits the petitioner to be detained at the pert of entry for up to 4 days
 without a hearing, but at year's end the legality of the law was under review by
 the courts (see Section 2.d.). Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the right to a fair public trial. This right is observed in practice. The judi-
 cial structure comprises territorial, provmcial, regional, and mumcial courts, with
 the Supreme Court at its apex. A Constitutional Court protects constitutional rights,
 but there is no clear distinction between its jurisdiction and that of the Supreme
 Court on some issues, nor is it clear which has ultimate authority. The European
 Court of Human Rights is the final arbiter in cases concerning human rights.
 A severe backlog of pending cases--some 40,000 of all kinds (not only human
 rights)-and an acute shortage of judges have made plain the need to overhaul the
 judicial system. In September the Government submitted to Parliament bills cover-
 ing judicial reform and establishment of ajury systen.
 Defendants have the right to be represented by an attorney (at state expense for
 the indigent). They routinely are released on bail unless the court has reason to be-
 lieve the suspect may flee or be a threat to public safety. The law calls for an expe-
 ditious judicial hearing following arrest. Suspects may not be confined for more than
 2 ears before being brought to trial, unless a further delay is authorized by a judge,
 who may extend pretrial custody to 6 years. In practice, pretrial custody generally
 is less than a year. In cases of petty crime, suspects released on bail sometimes wait
 as long as 5 years for trial. As of July, 12,780 people were in jail awaiting trial-
 over one-fourth of the entire prison population, although this is down from 38 per-
 cent in 1990. Following conviction, defendants may appeal to the next higher court.
 Human rights groups and members of the press complain that accused human
 rights offenders have avoided penalization by prolonging the a ppeals process, and
 that sentences for convicted abusers are unduly light. (Both kinds of complaints are
 borne out by the 1994 court actions reported above in Section 1.c.)
 
 
 972
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the privacy of the home and correspondence. Under the Crimi-
 nal Code government authorities must obtain court approval before searching pri-
 vate prop'erty, wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 antiterrorist law authorizes the Minister of the Interior to act prior to obtaining
 court approval "in cases of emergency.' There have been no complaints of abuse of
 this authority.
 The Congress of Deputies passed legislation in 1992 broadening police authority
 to makes searches and detentions without a court order, mostly in antinarcotics op-
 erations, but in 1993 this law was ruled unconstitutional. During the 20 months it
 was in force, this law led to 340 raids and 940 arrests. Many damage claims have
 been filed against the Government.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these provisions. Opposition view-
 points, from political parties and other organizations, are freely aired and widely re-
 flected in the media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under the Constitution, all
 groups have the right of free assembly and association for political or other pur-
 poses. This right is fully respected and freely practiced.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this in practice. Roman Catholicism is the predominant reli-
 gion, and its institutions receive official funding. Protestant and Jewish leaders
 have refused the Government's offer of financial support.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within and outside the country, to emigrate,
 and to repatriate. The law on aliens permits detention for up to 40 days prior to
 deportation, but specifies it must not take place in a prison-like setting. Generally,
 the Government grants refugee status on the recommendation of the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Suspecting that economic refugees are clogging the system with spurious requests
 for asylum, the Parliament passed a new law on asylum which took effect in Sep-
 tember. This gives the Ministry of Justice and Interior more powers to handle asy-
 lum cases, but mandates that they be referred to the UNHCR for appeal. Asylum
 requests may be made only at the port of entry, where the applicant can be held
 for up to 4 days without judicial intervention. Time allowed to process the applica-
 tion can prolong the initial detention to 7 days. The new law also allows the appli-
 cant to stay in detention until the case is resolved; 1993 cases took 3 months on
 average. No provisions are made for detainees to have access to translators or law-
 yers. Enforcement of the new law has been held up pending a court ruling on its
 constitutionality.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the right to vote in secret ballot for Parliament as well as for
 provincial and local bodies. At all levels of government, elections are held at least
 every 4 years.
 Governmental power is shared between the central Government and 17 regional
 "autonomous communities," which are similar to US. states in function. The Basque
 and Catalan regions are governed by regional parties that reflect the desires of
 many there to give political expression to their linguistic and cultural identities.
 These parties provide democratic alternatives to separatist groups which advocate
 achieving independence through terrorist violence.
 Women are increasing their participation in the political process. The number of
 female candidates increased in the 1993 national elections. However, under Spain's
 electoral system the percentage of votes for a party determines the number elected
 from that party's list of candidates; and because many women have been placed in
 the lower half of the list, the number elected has never rached 25 percent of those
 who attain ofice. In the Congress, 54 of the 350 deputies are women, while in the
 Senate women number 32 of 256 members. There are three female ministers. In
 March the ruling Socialist Party mandated a 25-percent quota for women to partici-
 pate in all its political endeavors. Other parties have similar quotas, but none cur-
 rently fulfills them.
 
 
 973
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of nongovernmental human rights groups are established in Spain, in-
 cluding the Human Rights Association of Spain, in Madrid, and the Human Rights
 Institute of Catalonia, in Barcelona. All operate freely without government inter-
 ference.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4gion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens, and an independent
 Ombudsman actively investigates complaints of human rights abuses by the au-
 thorities.
 Women.-While in recent years women have moved towards equality under the
 law, and entered the educational system and the work force in larger numbers, tra-
 ditional attitudes continue to impose de facto discrimination. This varies consider-
 ably among the regions. Although one-third more women (mainly those under age
 29) work outside the home than a decade ago, women make up only a third of the
 total work force. Growing numbers of women occupy senior governmental positions,
 among them the Ministers of Social Affairs, Health, and Culture, and about 30 per-
 cent of the number of judges (a profession that was closed to women before 1977).
 Also, women outnumber men in the legal, journalistic, and health care professions.
 The law mandates equal pay for equal work. In March the Constitutional Court
 ruled that 140 women employed at a cosmetics firm were paid less than their male
 colleagues, and awarded them back pay plus damages. Earlier, the United Left
 Party proposed legislation to overcome what it asserts is a 20 percent gap between
 the average salaries of women and of men.
 Sexual abuse, violence, and harassment of women continued to be areas of con-
 cern. According to the nongovernmental (but largely government-funded) Commis-
 sion for Investigation of Mistreatment of Women, 86 women were killed by male
 partners in 1993 (latest data). The Commission estimated that only 10 percent of
 the approximately 250,000 violent acts against women each year are reported to au-
 thorities, owing in part to the unsympathetic attitudes of some police and judicial
 personnel. Some rape cases in 1994 were decided on the degree of the victims phys-
 ical resistance. According to the Rape Victim's Assistance Association, 322 rapes and
 409 sexual assaults were reported in 1993. A 1989 law prohibits harassment in the
 workplace, but very few cases have been brought to trial under this law.
 Several levels of government provide assistance to battered women. A toll-free
 hot-line advises women where to go for government shelter or other aid if mal-
 treated. The Government also runs educational programs seeking to change public
 attitudes that contribute to violence against women. The Women's Institute has
 charged that some judges show reluctance to get involved in cases of violence
 against a woman by a member of her family. Similarly, in smaller towns some police
 officers have been reluctant to accept complaints from battered women. Recognizing
 the latter problem, the Ministry of the Interior initiated a program in 1986 that cre-
 ated special sections within the national police to deal with violence against women,
 staffed by specially trained women officers.
 Children.-The Ministries of Health and Social Affairs are responsible for the wel-
 fare of children, and have created a number of programs to aid needy children.
 Under the expected new Penal Code, children under age 18 are not considered re-
 sponsible for their acts, and so cannot be sent to prison.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Roma, constituting about 3 percent of the
 population, continue to suffer de facto discrimination in housing, schools, and jobs.
 Legal mechanisms exist by which they may seek redress, and the Government has
 stated its commitment to securing equal treatment for them. In November the ex-
 mayor of Mancha Real and six others began serving their sentences for destroying
 seven Roma homes in May 1991 in retaliation for the murder of a non-Roma Span-
 iard; the ex-mayor was convicted of inciting the mob that attacked a llma settle-
 ment, and in 1994 the Supreme Court extended his 1-year sentence to 5 years in
 prisn.
 Since 1991 the Madrid city government, in cooperation with the autonomous re-
 gional government, has been carring out a program to relocate squatters-the
 great majority of whom are Roma--t housing projects within the region. Spain's
 leest Roma or      aation, Gypsy Presene, protests this and omplains that the
 city has put up fences and police checkpoints which make Roma communities resem-
 ble prison camps. In May 300 Roma were ordered to relocate to an open field; the
 group's complaints that that area lacks basic services have found support in non-
 government organizations and the press. The city government denies any anti-Rema
 bias in its actions.
 
 
 974
 
 Six of the 17 Autonomous Communities use a language or dialect other than Cas-
 tilian Spanish. The Constitution stipulates that citizens have the "duty to know"
 Castilian, which "is the official language of state," but it adds that other languages
 can also be official under regional statutes, and that the "different lan age vari-
 ations of Spain are a cultural heritage which shall be**  * protected. Catalonia
 has passed a law whereby Catalan is to be taught in the region's schools and is to
 be used for official regional functions. In December the Constitutional Court ruled
 against a challenge to the constitutionality of this law, in a case brought byseveral
 Spanish-speakers in Catalonia who claim to be discriminated against in education
 and employment. Suits regarding specific applications of this law are still pending
 in various courts.
 Spsin's human rights groups and media continued to give increasing attention to
 the human rights of the growing numbers of illegal immigrants from northern and
 sub-Saharan Africa. Cases of police mistreatment were often reported. In March the
 Government announced it would increase deportations of non-Spanish citizens con-
 victed of even minor crimes.
 The most publicized incident against foreigners was the 1992 killing of a female
 illegal Dominican immigrant by an off-duty member of the Civil Guard. In July a
 Maarid court sentencedhim to 126 years in jail and gave lesser prison terms to
 three co-defendants; the daughter of the victim was awarded an indemnity of
 $156,250 (20 million pesetas).
 People With Disabilities.-Since 1982 a law on assistance for disabled citizens has
 been in effect which aims at ensuring fair access to public employment, preventing
 discrimination, and improving physical accessibility to public facilities andtranspor-
 tation. Such accessibility has not yet improved much in many areas. In 1993 the
 autonomous community in Madrid passed a law requiring all new construction there
 to be adapted to the needs of the handicapped.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except those in the military services,
 judges, magistrates, and prosecutors, are freely entitled to form or join unions of
 their own choosing. All that is required for organizing a union is that more than
 two workers register with the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. Spain has over
 200 registered trade unions, and one not legally registered (because the Constitu-
 tional Court ruled in 1986 it was ineligible, as it represents military personnel).
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their representatives, de-
 termine their policies represent their members' interests, and strike. They are not
 restricted or harassed by the Government, and are independent of political parties.
 A strike in nonessential services is legal if its sponsors give 5 days' notice. Any
 striking union must respect minimum-service requirements negotiated with the re-
 spective employer. The right to strike has been interpreted by the Constitutional
 Court to include general strikes called to protest government policy; in January
 there was a 1-day nationwide strike by a group of unions to protest proposed labor-
 market reform legislation. Strikes occur frequently, but most are brief. Data for
 1993 (latest available) show a sharp downturn in strike activity, presumably reflect-
 ing Spain's economic recession.
 Unions are free to form or join federations and to affiliate with international bod-
 ies, and do so without hindrance.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collective y.-A 1980 statute undergirds the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. Trade union and collective bargaining
 rights were extended in 1986 to all workers in the public sector, except the military
 services. Public-sector collective bargaining in 1990 was broadened to include sala-
 ries and employment levels, but the Government retained the right to set these if
 negotiations failed. Collective bargaining agreements are widespread in both the
 public and private sectors; in the latter they cover 60 percent of workers, notwith-
 standing that only about 10 percent of them are union members.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. Discrimination cases have priority in the labor courts. Legislation in 1990
 gave unions a role in controlling temporary work contracts to prevent abuses of
 ese and of terminations of employment. Nonetheless, the unions contend employ-
 ers are discriminating in ma~ny cases by refusing to renew the temporary employ-
 ment contract of a worker who has engaged in union organizing,more than a third
 of all employees in Spain are under temporary contracts. In June the Parliament
 passed legislation that greatly limits the types of workers who may be employed
 under temporary contracts.
 The same legislation abolishes some work rules dating back to the Franc dicta-
 torship decades ago, and leaves it to the collective bargaining process to come up
 with replacements.
 
 
 975
 
 Labor regulations and practices in free trade zones and exportprocessing zones
 are the same as in the rest of the country. Union membership in these zones is re-
 prtedly higher than the average throughout the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Fored or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is out-
 lawed in Spain and is not practiced. The legislation is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chde.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security is primarily re-
 sponsible for enforcement. The minimum age is effectively enforced in major indus-
 tries and in the service sector. It is more difficult to control on small farms and in
 family-owned businesses. Legislation prohibiting child labor is effectively enforced
 in the special economic zones. The law also prohibits the employment of persons
 under age 18 at night, for overtime work, or in sectors considered hazardous.
 e. Acceptable Conditions V' Work.-aThe legal minimum wage for workers over age
 18 is considered sufficient for a decent standard of living for workers and their fami-
 lies. The daily minimum wage was $15.77 (2,019 pesetas); for those aged 16 or 17
 it was $10.42 (1,334 p  tas. These rates are revised every year in line with the
 Consumer Price Index and are effectively enforced by the Ministry of Labor and So-
 cial Security. The law sets a 40-hour workweek with an unbroken rest period of 36
 hours after each 40 hours worked. Workers enjoy 12 paid holidays a year and a
 month's paid vacation. Worktime limits are effectively enforced.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions and occupational
 health and safety rules, but bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and ineffi-
 cient. Safety and health legislation is being revised to conform to European Union
 directives. The National Institute of Safety and Health within the Ministry of Labor
 has technical responsibility for developing labor standards, but the Inspectorate of
 Labor has responsibility for enforcing the legislation through judicial action when
 infractions are found. Workers have legal protection for filing complaints about haz-
 ardous conditions.
