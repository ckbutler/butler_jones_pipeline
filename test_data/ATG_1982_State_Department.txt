 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 A British colony until 1967 and afterward an associated state
 with the United Kingdom, Antigua and Barbuda gained its
 independence on November 1, 1981. The new nation's
 independence Constitution is patterned after the
 long-established Westminster multi-party parliamentary
 tradition and incorporates respect for human rights. The
 Government of Antigua and Barbuda strictly adheres to the
 precepts of rights and equality for all its citizens and seeks
 to avoid international criticism of itself in any area of human
 rights.
 Throughout most of its history Antigua was primarily an
 agricultural territory, relying heavily on sugar as its
 principal crop. In more recent times, as a result of changes
 in official policies and land-holding practice, the cultivation
 of sugar and other agricultural activities have declined
 greatly. This can also be accredited to the early 1960's
 consciousness-raising efforts of those who sought to free the
 black Antiguans and Barbudans from the "suppression" of field
 work which carried the psychological and social stigma of
 historic slave labor. For these reasons the traditional
 economic mainstay of sugar production has now largely been
 supplanted as a foreign exchange earner by tourism. Antigua's
 beaches and harbors have drawn thousands of visitors from North
 America and Europe. Tourism is now by far Antigua's largest
 industry.
 The sister island of Barbuda, almost as large as Antigua but
 sparsely populated, is considered to be one of Antigua's major
 political problems. The tiny island dependency wants to sever
 its ties to Antigua and either become independent or revert to
 crown colony status. Barbuda's quest for separatism stems not
 from any perceived slight, mistreatment or violation of rights,
 but rather from a desire to have equal, as opposed to
 subordinate, status with Antigua.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 No instances of political killing were reported in 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances, clandestine detention, or abductions were
 reported in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Torture is expressly prohibited by the Constitution. That
 prohibition is respected in practice.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment and there have been
 no reports of violations. In one instance in late 1980, a
 Rastafarian cult youth died in police custody under mysterious
 circumstances. The Government took an active role in
 investigating and bringing to justice the police officers
 involved. Prison conditions are humane and no incidences of
 mistreatment have been reported.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are constitutionally
 prohibited and are not practiced. Habeas corpus is a legal
 guarantee and any person detained must be brought before the
 court within 48 hours.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution, and
 there have been no reported instances where this provision has
 not been respected in practice. The regional West Indies Court
 of Appeal, widely respected for impartiality, serves Antigua
 and Barbuda. The judiciary acts independently and is not
 subject to interference by the executive, legislative,
 administrative or enforcement branches of government. All
 detainees are granted access to legal counsel, and a public
 defender is available.
 g.  Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary entry and search are specifically forbidden by the
 Constitution and are unknown in practice. Consent of the
 individual and a legal warrant are required to affect entry
 into and search of personal residence and property.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights. Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are specifically noted in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Antigua's press is very active. There
 are two newspapers published by political parties representing
 varying viewpoints. The principal radio station is
 government-owned and is acknowledged to report the news
 accurately and in a manner which reflects differing opinions.
 There are in addition one privately-owned radio station and
 several stations owned by religious organizations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association are guaranteed in
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Antiguans of all
 political persuasions are outspoken and political rallies by
 all groups are commonplace. Freedom of assembly and
 association are extended to all groups, including labor unions,
 which have and exercise the right to organize, negotiate, and
 strike. There are two main unions, one associated with the
 Government and one with the opposition party. Neither,
 however, is controlled by its associated party. The two unions
 act independently and wield considerable political weight. No
 interference in or suppression of their activities has been
 reported.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and
 respected in practice. There are many religious denominations,
 as well as several radio stations owned by religious
 organizations.

 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Antigua and Barbuda's Constitution guarantees these rights, all
 of which are honored in practice. There has been no known
 instance of refugee resettlement in Antigua and Barbuda.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Antigua's political process is lively and representative,
 encouraging participation by all sectors of the society.
 Opposition parties are not strong in Antigua, but are free to
 work in any legal way to increase their standing. Women
 participate on an equal legal footing with men, and they hold
 positions in the civil service, although social tradition has
 limited their seeking elective office and role assignment still
 constrains their role in public service. There are no women
 currently in either elective office or appointed position.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights.
 There have been no expressions of interest in Antigua and
 Barbuda by international and non-governmental human rights
 groups, nor any requests for investigation. Antigua and
 Barbuda has not yet signed the American Convention on Human
 Rights. Freedom House's 1982 report classifies Antigua and
 Barbuda as 'free.-
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Antiguan economy is heavily dependent on tourism which,
 according to World Bank estimates, directly and indirectly
 accounts for almost half of GDP. In 1981, GDP was estimated to
 be approximately $106.4 million or about $1,400 per capita.
 In the past, Antigua was an agricultural island, but
 agriculture now accounts for less than 15 percent of GDP.
 Rebuilding the agricultural sector is an important priority for
 the government, but unless agricultural work can be
 successfully disassociated from slave labor in the minds of the
 Antiguan and Barbudian laborers, it is unlikely that any major
 progress will be made.
 The manufacturing sector accounts for approximately 15 percent
 of GDP and is concentrated in the appliance assembly and
 garment industries. The Government is actively seeking foreign
 investment and is seriously interested in working with other
 eastern Caribbean states to open a joint investment promotion
 office in the United States.
 Over the past two years approximately 10 percent of Antigua's
 capital development program has been devoted to education and
 health. The adult literacy rate was 88.7 percent in 1981,
 while, according to the latest available statistics, 80 percent
 of eligible children are enrolled in primary schools. No
 similar statistics are available for secondary school or
 university levels, but the figures are considerably less. The
 
 
 383
 unofficial development plan for 1982-86 allocates approximately
 four percent of the country's capital development funds for
 education. Over a third of that money will be dedicated to
 secondary and post-secondary education.
 The population of Antigua is approximately 79,000 (1981) and
 increasing at the rate of 1.3 percent per year. Health care in
 Antigua has improved over the past 15 years as illustrated by a
 drop in infant mortality from 68.7 per 1,000 live births to
 31.5; nevertheless, the Antiguans recognize health care as a
 problem area and are allocating approximately three percent of
 their capital budget over the next four years to the health
 sector, concentrating primarily on improvements for the
 island's hospital. Additional funds have been allocated to
 extending the percentage of the population enjoying piped water
 and regular sanitation service.
