 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and
 members of a unicameral Congress chosen in free elections.
 Members of the Supreme Court, chosen by Congress, preside over
 an independent judiciary. Elections in 1979 ended 7 years of
 military rule, and since then democratically elected
 administrations have governed Ecuador. Fourteen registered
 political parties and a free and partisan press participate in
 a lively and contentious democratic political process.
 Rodrigo Borja of the Democratic Left party was elected
 President on May 8 and began his 4-year term in office on
 August 10, succeeding the center-right presidency of Leon
 Febres Cordero. Borja's party, allied with another party on
 the center-left, controls an absolute majority in the 71-
 member Congress. The next congressional elections are
 scheduled for January 1990.
 The President controls the police through the Ministry of
 Government. In 1988 local human rights organizations and
 members of Congress publicized several charges of abuse by the
 police and Ecuadorian security forces. Officials of the
 previous administration acknowledged isolated incidents but
 denied any systematic abuses. The new President has promised
 an "exemplary" degree of respect for human rights by his
 Government.
 A small group of violent leftists, Alfaro Vive Carajo (AVC),
 maintains links with the Colombian M-19 guerrillas and
 periodically engages in acts of terrorism and insurgency.
 During the police campaign against the AVC in 1985-1986, human
 rights organizations charged the Government with unjustified
 killings of AVC members and with using brutal methods during
 the arrest and interrogation of AVC suspects. AVC activity
 continued to decline during 1988, and no violent
 confrontations with government forces occurred.
 Ecuador has an essentially free enterprise economic system.
 Petroleum, agricultural, and fishing exports have financed
 most of the country's imports dvring the last 15 years, and
 petroleum revenues have been the mainstay of the budget in
 that period. The active labor movement is small but broadly
 based. Extensive rural poverty persists, especially among
 highland Indians.
 Ecuador maintained generally good human rights standards in
 1988. The most prominent human rights issues were the
 treatment of prisoners, judicial procedures, and continuing
 concern over police and armed forces abuse of ordinary
 citizens suspected of criminal activity.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known killings for political motives in 1988.
 However, on October 24, Superior Court Judge Ivan Martinez was
 murdered by unknown assailants. Because he was working on a
 number of drug trafficking cases, the press assumed his death
 was drug-related. Human rights groups remain concerned about
 instances of excessive use of police force against criminal
 suspects, including some minors. On April 9, for example,
 
 
 545
 ECUADOR
 rural police shot and killed Roberto Patricio Reasco near
 Quininde during a routine document check. A youth named Jose
 Peralta was picked up May 10 by police in Shushufindi and held
 for 3 days on suspicion of robbery. On May 14, his family
 retrieved his body from the morgue in Lago Agrio; the body
 showed evidence of extreme torture. On July 6, student Victor
 Alvarado Morales died from gunshot wounds while demonstrating
 against an increase in transit fares. The Minister of
 Government in the Febres Cordero administration denied police
 responsibility in this case. There were no instances in 1988
 of police officials being tried and punished for use of
 excessive force.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no substantiated cases of disappearance
 attributable to the Government in 1988. Human rights monitors
 decried the previous administration's lack of public response
 to charges of disappearances said to have occurred in 1985 and
 1986 and urged the Borja administration to try to shed light
 on these cases. They continued to press for information on
 the alleged disappearances of three persons detained by the
 military in Esmeraldas province in 1985 (Manuel Bolanos in
 October, Luis Vaca in November, and Consuelo Benavides
 Cevallos in December) and two persons arrested by police in
 Quito (Jaime Otavalo in August 1985 and Manuel Yanez in May
 1986). In November 1988 a congressional inquiry--facilitated
 by the Borja government--began into the fate of Consuelo
 Benavides.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. However, there were a number of
 credible allegations of torture in 1988. Human rights groups
 asserted that 20 cases of torture occurred in the first 6
 months of 1988. (This represents a decrease from 1987, when
 44 such cases were reported during the first half of the
 year). Particular concern was expressed that some of these
 cases of torture involved minors. For example, in
 mid-February an illiterate 14-year-old boy, Jose Manuel Chato,
 was picked up in Quito on suspicion of robbery. Chato was
 allegedly subjected to torture by the police, including the
 use of electric current applied to his genitals. Human rights
 groups charged that on February 25, a suspected AVC member,
 Galo Mora Procel, was apprehended and tortured by police prior
 to his release the next day. They also reported that, on June
 25, Leonardo Fabian Brito was detained for insulting a
 policeman. He was hit on the face and body and a chemical
 substance was sprayed in his eyes.
 There are charges that police frequently beat suspects or
 treat them harshly during initial interrogations. Although
 mistreatment of detainees is not officially sanctioned, human
 rights groups maintain the Government is responsible and say
 that little has been done to discipline those responsible for
 such abuses. It appears also that some police abuse
 --including torture--has occurred since Borja's inauguration
 on August 10. The Borja administration, however, has stated
 its unequivocal opposition to official use of abusive methods,
 and human rights groups hope that, over time, these statements
 will have an impact on police behavior. In early December,
 the Government sponsored a 3-day human rights seminar for the
 police, with the aim of promoting better human rights
 performance.
 
 
 546
 ECUADOR
 Ecuadorian prison conditions are so squalid and brutal that in
 themselves they represent cruel treatment. Ecuadorian prison
 guards sometimes use solitary confinement and beatings for
 disciplinary purposes, even though this is contrary to prison
 regulations. Prisoners often bribe guards to avoid punishment
 and to improve their living conditions.
 Human rights groups maintain that police unjustifiably applied
 the so-called ley de fuga (the law of escaping prisoners) on
 three occasions in 1988. This practice, unsanctioned by
 legislation, allows police to fire on fleeing prisoners.
 Escapees are generally not armed, and human rights groups
 argue that they would normally be willing to surrender if
 challenged.
 Detainees under civil control who are charged with terrorism
 or subversion generally have not been mistreated if detained
 in Quito, but those detained in the Guayaquil penitentiary
 often are treated harshly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention. Preventive detention is illegal. The criminal
 code forbids isolated confinement for more than 24 hours and
 detention without charge for more than 48 hours, but this
 frequently is disregarded in practice. Detainees under civil
 control are allowed frequent family visits. The few detainees
 under military control are usually held incommunicado and
 reportedly have been mistreated. Human rights organizations
 accused the previous government of illegal detention of
 suspected terrorists and their family members, but this
 practice appears to have ended with President Borja's
 accession to office. Human rights groups do not believe there
 were any suspected terrorist detaineesunder military control
 in 1988. Mayors and municipal council presidents have the
 constitutional right to order the release of detainees and do
 so frequently, irrespective of the severity of the charges.
 Forced exile is not practiced. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Congress elects the Supreme Court and has the power to
 impeach judges, to set the budget of the judicial branch, and
 to ratify the Supreme Court's judicial review decisions. From
 time to time, the Supreme Court investigates allegations of
 judicial inefficiency or improprieties and may remove judges.
 The autonomous Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal (TGC) is
 composed of representatives named by the President, the
 Congress, the judiciary, municipalities, business, and labor.
 The TGC is empowered by the Constitution to investigate
 breaches of constitutional or human rights. The TGC submits
 its findings to Congress but has no statutory power to enforce
 sanctions. Military courts may try only those cases involving
 infractions of military regulations or acts against military
 installations.
 As in most civil law systems, there is no trial by jury.
 Judges play a central role in investigations as well as in
 
 
 547
 ECUADOR
 deciding guilt or innocence. Defendants have the right to
 counsel as soon as arrested. They can call witnesses on their
 own behalf, cross-examine all witnesses, refrain from
 testifying against themselves, and appeal sentences to
 intermediate or higher courts. Although a public defender
 system is mandated by the 1979 Constitution, it has not yet
 been implemented.
 Due to inefficiency and corrupution, detainees may wait 2
 years or more for trial, placing additional burdens on the
 prison system. According to the Congressional Commission on
 Human Rights, approximately 50 percent of all prisoners have
 not been charged or sentenced. Time spent awaiting trial is
 counted toward completion of the final sentence, but some
 long-term~detainees have been found innocent. Those unable to
 afford legal counsel face the longest periods of pretrial
 detention.
 There were no Ecuadorian political prisoners in 1988. A
 Basque detained for suspected terrorist activity in 1987 was
 released in early 1988. The 39 Air Force personnel who
 remained in jail for participating in the 1-day kidnaping of
 President Febres Cordero were pardoned by President Borja in
 late November. Most were released immediately from prison,
 and the rest were released in December.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with 'Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police must have a warrant to enter a dwelling except in the
 case of hot pursuit. Although the Government generally
 respects the sanctity of the home and privacy of
 correspondence, police have been involved in illegal,
 surreptitious entries. One human rights group claimed that
 reports of violations of homes and private property numbered
 15 for the first 6 months of 1988, a figure similar to the
 1987 total for the same period.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 expression. All Ecuadorian media are privately controlled,
 with the exception of Radio Nacional, which is operated by the
 Government's Information Secretariat (SENAC). The Government
 exercises control of the allocation of radio and television
 frequencies.
 There are over 30 daily newspapers, dozens of weeklies,
 numerous special interest magazines, four national television
 networks, six local television stations in the capital and the
 four largest Ecuadorian cities, and approximately 400 radio
 stations, all operating freely. These media outlets present a
 diversity of political opinion, ranging from Communist to
 ultraconservative, and vigorously debate political issues.
 Politicians and human rights observers accused the Febres
 Cordero Government of using a variety of pressures to soften
 or silence media criticism of its policies. Since President
 Borja took office in August 1988, government relations with
 the press have moved from adversarial to supportive and open.
 The editor of a leading opposition daily was named Secretary
 of Information of the newly renamed SENAC (formerly SENDIP).
 
 
 548
 ECUADOR
 The organization attempts to make the Government accessible to
 the media, promotes press freedom, and has abolished the
 progovernment simulcasts of the Febres Cordero
 administration. Ortel (TV 5 Quito), another private
 television channel, which was prohibited from operating for 4
 years by the former administration, resumed broadcasting in
 August. There have been no reported closings of radio
 stations, threats against reporters, or arrests of journalists
 since August.
 There is no political censorship of foreign or domestic books,
 films, or works of art, and no evidence of government
 interference with academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of free assembly and
 association. This generally is observed in practice. Public
 rallies require prior approval from local government agencies,
 which is generally granted. Demonstrations which threaten to
 disrupt public order or safety may be restricted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, Ecuador has no state
 religion. Citizens and residents are free to practice the
 religion of their choice. The Constitution prohibits the
 election of members of the clergy to the Congress, the
 Presidency, or the Vice Presidency. Foreign missionaries have
 operated freely in Ecuador for many years. Radio HCJB, the
 "Voice of the Andes," has functioned for more than 50 years as
 an evangelical Christian shortwave radio service supported
 largely by contributions from the United States.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Ecuadorians may travel freely at home or abroad. Persons
 from other Latin American countries have readily found asylum
 in Ecuador. No cases of involuntary repatriation of persons
 fleeing political persecution were reported in 1988.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ecuador is a multiparty democracy with 14 registered parties
 representing a broad political spectrum. Eleven of these,
 including two avowed Marxist parties, are represented in the
 present unicameral Congress. Voting is mandatory for literate
 Ecuadorians 18 years of age and older and voluntary for
 illiterates. Political participation and suffrage are open to
 all citizens without discrimination on the basis of sex,
 ethnic origin, or socioeconomic status. All citizens have the
 right to form and join political parties.
 Three of the 71 congressional representatives elected in 1988
 were women. Several women occupy prominent positions in the
 present Government, though none at the ministerial level. A
 woman ran as a vice presidential candidate for a major
 political party in first-round presidential elections held in
 January.
 
 
 549
 ECUADOR
 Only certified political parties may present candidates for
 election. An aspiring party must present a petition bearing a
 minimum number of voter signatures for certification. Strong
 political rivalries among individuals and ideological and
 regional differences account for much of the rough and tumble
 nature of the political process. Nevertheless, since the
 return to democracy in 1979, Ecuadorian elections have
 resulted in peaceful presidential transitions in 1984 and
 1988. In late January, legislative, municipal, and local
 elections also took place in a fully free and open
 environment.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government seeks to be responsive to human rights inquiries
 from other states and public international organizations. The
 Foreign Ministry has an office responsible for providing
 detailed replies to queries from outside Ecuador concerning
 human rights matters. Ecuadorian human rights organizations
 are free to investigate human rights practices within the
 country, although there were accusations of low-level official
 harassment of human rights activists in 1988. The
 Congressional Human Rights Commission (HRC), formed in
 November 1986, was active in 1988. The Latin American Human
 Rights Association (ALDHU) is headquartered in Quito, as is an
 office of Amnesty International. Other active human rights
 organizations include two local private groups, the Ecumenical
 Commission on Human Rights (CEDHU) and the National Human
 Rights Commission.
 During 1988, the outgoing Government continued its practice of
 refusing to engage in a substantive dialogue about human
 rights with private organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race,
 color, sex, language, religion, political or other
 affiliation, social origin, or economic position. Although
 there is no overt or legally sanctioned discrimination
 practiced against these groups, the urban poor are
 predominantly black or of mixed race, and the Indian
 population is primarily rural and poor. The Constitution
 establishes complete political equality for men and women.
 However, women still may suffer discrimination under civil
 law. In 1987 changes were made in laws concerning divorce,
 property distribution, and inheritance which gave women equal
 rights with their husbands in these areas as required by the
 Constitution. Women usually receive lower wages than men
 employed in a similar position.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Labor organizations represent about 15 percent of the
 country's economically active population. The labor movement,
 organized into four major confederations and many independent
 unions, reflects widely different political orientations and
 has links to international labor organizations. The labor
 movement is independent of the Government. The right to
 
 
 550
 ECUADOR
 strike is provided for by law in Article 31 of the Ecuadorian
 Constitution and in the Labor Code, except to government
 white-collar employees. The Labor Code provides that
 labor-management conflicts be submitted to "Conciliation
 Tribunals" which in practice are chaired by'the Ministry of
 Labor. However, these negotiations are in fact voluntary, and
 either side has the right to refuse to participate. While
 negotiations are under way, strikes and lockouts are
 permitted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 All private sector employees and government blue-collar
 workers enjoy the right to organize unions. The right to
 collective bargaining is guaranteed by law for private sector
 employees and government blue-collar workers and is used
 extensively in practice to resolve potential or actual labor
 conflicts. Collective bargaining rights are not, however,
 granted to government white-collar workers.
 Ecuador's labor code provides for a considerable government
 role in encouraging voluntary labor-management negotiations,
 especially through the action of Conciliation Tribunals in the
 Ministry of Labor.
 There are no export processing zones in Ecuador. Labor laws
 are applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 By law, forced or compulsory labor is prohibited. In
 practice, Indians occasionally work for agricultural emplcyers
 for near starvation wages and have no practical means to
 demand their rights. International Labor Organization (ILO)
 supervisory bodies concluded in 1988 that government decrees
 imposing prison labor sentences for offences committed by
 seamen in one case and for seditious acts in another were not
 in conformity with the ILO convention on abolition of forced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of individuals under the age of 18, the age of
 majority in Ecuador, requires parental permission. This
 regulation is generally observed in larger enterprises;
 however, many children in rural areas are active in the work
 force. Enforcement mechanisms prohibiting unauthorized
 employment of children exist but in practice do not
 effectively cover the rural poor or many activities in the
 informal sector of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor code prescribes a standard 40-hour workweek with
 paid annual vacations. Ecuador enforces a minimum wage law.
 The wage, now set at approximately $44 per month, is not
 sufficient to support a family. In practice many people earn
 a fraction of the minimum wage. Many families must supplement
 the principal breadwinner's minimum wage with income from
 other sources. The labor code mandates safe and healthy
 working conditions and holds employers responsible for
 
 
 551
 ECUADOR
 maintaining such conditions. The Social Security Institute is
 responsible for monitoring complaints concerning working
 conditions and has legal power to enforce compliance.
 Enforcement is generally adequate.
