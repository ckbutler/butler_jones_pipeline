 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a 100-year old democracy with separate
 executive, legislative and judicial branches. Elections for
 president, two vice presidents, and 57 deputies to a
 unicameral legislative assembly are held every 4 years and
 have been free and fair. Oscar Arias won the presidency in
 February 1986 in an election in which approximately 80 percent
 of all eligible voters participated. New elections will take
 place in February 1990. The President is constitutionally
 barred for life from reelection. Members of the Legislative
 Assembly may be reelected but only after at least one term out
 of office.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished Costa Rica's standing army.
 The codntry's small security forces consist of the Civil
 Guard, the Crime Prevention Unit, the Directorate of
 Intelligence and Security, the Narcotics Control Unit of the
 Ministry of Public Security, and the Rural Guard of the
 Ministry of Government. The Judicial Police, charged with
 investigating crimes, report directly to the Supreme Court.
 These public security organizations observe the procedural
 safeguards established by the law and Constitution and are
 subject to the strict control of the civilian Government.
 Significant agricultural and light industrial sectors lead the
 Costa Rican economy. The steady economic growth of recent
 years continued during 1989 at a projected rate of 3.6
 percent. Private enterprise accounts for 70 percent of the
 gross national product. The right to hold private property is
 protected by the Constitution, although delay in compensating
 foreign and Costa Rican citizens for expropriated properties
 has been a problem in recent years. Properties are
 expropriated for incorporation into nature protection reserve
 areas or are based on legal claims of Indians.
 During 1989 the Arias administration continued to demonstrate
 a strong commitment to the longstanding Costa Rican tradition
 of respect for human rights. There were, however, some
 problems of de facto, though not de jure, discrimination
 against women, blacks, and Indians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section . Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government does not practice, abet, or condone political
 killing, and none was reported.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known or reported incidents of politically
 motivated abductions or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and
 holds invalid any statement obtained through violence. These
 prohibitions are respected in practice. Prisoners generally
 receive humane treatment in Costa Rica. The press, however,
 occasionally reports incidents of alleged police mistreatment
 of prisoners. In 1989, for example, the press reported
 
 
 523
 COSTA RICA
 allegations by two men that they had been imprisoned and
 tortured in the basement of the Judicial Police (OIJ)
 building. However, their accusations were dismissed after a
 thorough investigation by the Judicial Inspections
 Department. Charges of mistreatment of prisoners in 14 other
 cases are still under investigation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Warrants are required for arrests, and an arraignment must
 take place within 24 hours of arrest. Article 48 of the
 Constitution entitles detained persons to a judicial
 determination of the legality of the detention. These rights
 are generally respected, although there are frequent reports
 of detainees remaining in custody long periods awaiting trial.
 Costa Rica has separate pretrial detention for major offenses,
 such as narcotics trafficking, and this detention can last for
 months.
 The right to bail is provided for in law and observed in
 practice. Bail is sometimes denied to repeat offenders,
 however, and is usually denied to foreigners on the assumption
 that they would leave the country before coming to trial. A
 1988 drug law, upheld by the Supreme Court, allows denial of
 bail to accused drug offenders. Detainees may be routinely
 held incommunicado for 48 hours after arrest and for up to 10
 days with authorizatioh of judicial authorities. The
 judiciary is generally effective in ensuring that legal and
 constitutional safeguards are observed.
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is widely recognized as independent and fair.
 The Supreme Court, the final court of appeal, supervises the
 work of the lower courts. Its 24 magistrates are elected for
 8-year terms. Accused persons may select their own attorneys;
 access to counsel is guaranteed and honored in practice. The
 State provides legal counsel for those who cannot afford an
 attorney.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reported instances during 1989 of extralegal
 invasions of privacy conducted by, or with the knowledge of,
 the Government. Warrants are required to search private homes.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically provides for freedom of speech
 and press. These freedoms are generally respected in
 practice. Nine private newspapers (including two Communist
 weeklies), six private television stations, and several radio
 stations pursue independent editorial policies. The media
 freely criticize the Government, and there is no evidence of
 self-censorship or intimidation.
 Foreign journalists challenged a law requiring the
 accreditation of journalists by the government-sponsored Costa
 Rican National Journalists Association; the Inter-American
 
 
 524
 COSTA RICA
 Court of Human Rights declared in 1985 in an advisory opinion
 that the law is incompatible with the freedom of information
 provisions of the Inter-American Human Rights Convention. The
 Minister of Information in 1988 recommended formally that the
 Government remedy this perceived restriction of freedom of the
 press, but in October 1988 President Arias came out in favor
 of the journalists' accreditation law in a speech to the Costa
 Rican National Journalists Association. To date, the law
 requiring the accreditation of Costa Rican and foreign
 journalists has not been revised. A Costa Rican newsman was
 convicted in 1989 by a criminal court for engaging in
 journalism without a license.
 In what some charged was a violation of the freedom of
 expression, the censor's office banned the film "The Last
 Temptation of Christ" early in 1989. In June the Law
 Students' Association of the University Costa Rica denounced
 the ban before the Attorney General for Human Rights. At
 year's end, the Censorship Tribunal of the Ministry of Justice
 was awaiting the Attorney General's decision before issuing
 its own opinion.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional provisions of freedom of assembly and
 association are fully respected. Permits are not required for
 public meetings. Authorization is needed only for parades or
 similar large-scale gatherings.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 observed in practice. While Roman Catholicism is the official
 state religion, Costa Ricans affiliated with a wide range of
 religious groups participate without prejudice in social and
 political life. The Constitution stipulates that the
 President must be a layman. There are no restrictions on
 religious activity, and foreign missionaries'and clergy of all
 denominations work and proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within the country
 or abroad, and both citizens and foreigners are free to live
 anywhere within the national boundaries. Neither emigration
 nor a citizen's right of return is restricted. Costa Rica
 .supports multinational refugee programs and has accepted many
 refugees from Central and South America, although the
 continuing influx of Nicaraguan refugees has provoked
 government expressions of concern over strains on the economy
 and social fabric. During 1,989, there were two instances of
 border officials forcing Nicaraguans entering Costa Rica to
 return to Nicaragua without allowing them to be interviewed by
 the proper authorities (immigration officials and office of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) to
 determine if they were in fact political refugees. In July
 III Nicaraguans and in August 10 Nicaraguans were turned away
 at the border. The Constitution specifically prohibits the
 Government from repatriating any foreigner who may be subject
 to political persecution in his own country, and political
 
 
 525"
 COSTA RICA
 asylum traditionally has been granted to exiled dissidents of
 various political orientations.,
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Costa Rica is a democracy in which citizens choose their
 government through free, open, and competitive elections. The
 integrity of elections is ensured by the independent Supreme
 Electoral Tribunal, and election results are respected. The
 Legislative Assembly can and does reject executive branch
 initiatives. Citizens can and do petition their elected
 representatives for legislative redress and assistance with
 government bureaucracies. The ruling National Liberation
 Party and the opposition Social Christian Unity Party control
 29 and 25 seats, respectively, in the 57-member Legislative
 Assembly. Two rival Communist parties, which freely
 participate in the political process, each hold one seat. An
 independent provincial party holds the remaining seat.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A 1984 Executive Order created the Ombudsman for Human Rights,
 under the Attorney General's office. Called the Defensoria
 Para Derechos Humanos, it hears complaints from individuals.
 There is also a similar office for complaints concerning the
 penitentiary system.
 Costa Rica has traditionally been a strong supporter of
 international and private human rights organizations. The
 Inter-American Institute of Human Rights maintains its
 headquarters in San Jose. The Government has invited the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit the country
 whenever it wishes. Three nongovernmental groups monitor and
 report on human rights matters in Costa Rica: the Costa Rican
 Commission for Human Rights, the Commission for the Defense of
 Human Rights in Central America and the Family and Friends of
 Political Prisoners of Costa Rica.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Costa Rica's population includes some 26,000 Indians, most of
 whom live in traditional communities on 21 reserves which, in
 part because of their remote location, often lack access to
 schools, health care, electricity, and potable water. The
 Government is attempting to improve the quality of basic
 services in the Indian communities. Indians participate in
 the management of their own affairs through the National
 Indian Commission. Indian leaders continue to urge the
 Government to devote more resources to improving the welfare
 of the indigenous population.
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is
 legally unrestricted. Women and men generally are paid
 equally for equal work. A law designed to supplement existing
 legislation against sex discrimination was introduced in the
 Legislative Assembly in August 1988, but it was not enacted.
 Physical abuse of women is prohibited by law but does occur.
 When reported, cases of physical abuse of women, including
 domestic violence, such as wife beating, are prosecuted and
 often result in stringent penalties-, usually prison terms
 determined by the gravity of the crime. Abuse of female
 
 
 526
 COSTA RICA
 minors is considered aggravated assault. Neither the
 Government nor Costa Rican society tolerates violence against
 women. The Costa Rican press has reported a recent increase
 in the number of violent crimes against women and these
 reports have increased the awareness of Costa Ricans to the
 problem. There are a number of women advocacy groups in the
 country with various degrees of effectiveness. These groups
 monitor official and unofficial reports of abuse and provide
 counseling.
 Costa Rica's population of 30,000 blacks, who reside largely
 on the Caribbean coast, enjoys full rights of citizenship as
 well as other rights and protections, including laws against
 all forms of racial discrimination. However, prejudice toward
 blacks'and Indians, generally covert, still exists in some
 elements of the population. The Caribbean coast, with its
 large black minority population, suffers from a lower level of
 development than San Jose and the Central Valley. The
 consequent high unemployment in the region has resulted in
 labor and racial tensions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Costa Rica has ratified International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association. Approximately 15
 percent of the work force is organized, and there are several
 different trade union centrals in Costa Rica. Unions are
 independent of government control and are free to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies such as the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The
 American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations (AFL-CIO), the ICFTU, and other trade union
 organizations contend that the Solidarismo movement in the
 country, an alternative to traditional trade unionism, is an
 employe -inspired and dominated "company union", supported by
 the Government as an alternative to independent trade unions.
 Leaders of the Solidarismo movement claim that it is a
 legitimate form of employee organization, and that Solidarismo
 organizations and their officials are prohibited by law from
 engaging in antitrade union activities.
 At the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA)
 Conference in Geneva in June 1989, the ICFTU filed a formal
 complaint against the Government of Costa Rica, alleging that
 it supports the Solidarismo movement in violation of
 Convention 87. At its November 1989 meeting, the CFA noted
 that the Government had not supplied information requested by
 the Committee and adjourned consideration of the case until
 its next meeting in February 1990.
 When labor disputes arise within the San Jose metropolitan
 area, the presiding judge of the Labor Tribunal attempts to
 negotiate.a settlement. Labor inspectors from the Ministry of
 Labor handle disputes outside the capital. If conciliation
 fails, the case is referred to a labor court, which decides
 the legality of the strike. Unions have complained that this
 process is complicated, time-consuming; and often fruitless.
 Public sector strikes are illegal but occur with some
 frequency.
 Strikes and labor unrest were at higher levels in 1989 than in
 the past year. Two of the most significant strikes were a
 doctors' strike and a general strike in the port city of
 
 
 527
 COSTA RICA
 Limon. In the former, the strike was declared illegal, but
 an agreement was reached under which no reprisals were to be
 taken against strike participants. In the latter, the strike
 was also declared illegal, but an agreement was reached with
 the Government providing for the lifting of the strike and
 subsequent negotiations, and for affected employers to decide
 individually whether or not to withhold the salaries of
 striking workers.
 At its 1989 meeting, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE),
 recalling its previous complaints about the broad strike
 prohibitions in Costa Rican law, noted that provisions in the
 pending revision of the law are still too broad. The COE
 called on the Government to bring the latter provisions into
 conformance and enact the new law.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Costa Rica has-ratified ILO Convention 98 on the Right to
 Organize and Collective Bargaining. The right to organize is
 provided-for in the Constitution. The commitments are
 observed in practice. However, there have been some
 allegations that the Government is unresponsive to charges of
 antiunion discrimination in the private sector.
 In spite of guarantees in the 1943 labor code, many labor
 leaders claim that the statute is outdated and unjust. They
 cite in particular a clause which permits employers to fire
 workers for "any other grave fault" not specified elsewhere in
 the code as a mechanism used by management to fire would-be
 labor organizers. To date, this code has not been revised,
 although the Government has attempted to negotiate a mutually
 acceptable revision with representatives of both management
 and labor. In the report of its 1989 meeting, the COE noted
 that the pending revision of the labor code includes
 provisions providing for nondiscrimination and nonintervention
 vis-a-vis unions suggested by the ILO in 1981. The COE urged
 early enactment of the new code.
 Labor regulations in Costa Rica's nine export processing zones
 do not differ from the rest of the economy, either in law or
 in practice.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 there are no known instances of either.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution provides for special employment protection
 for women and minors and establishes the minimum working age
 at 12 years, with special regulations in force for workers
 under 15. The government child welfare agency, in cooperation
 with the Labor Ministry, is responsible for the enforcement of
 these provisions. Regulations concerning the employment of
 children are effectively enforced by the responsible
 government agencies.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution defines the normal hours of the workday,
 remuneration of overtime, days of rest, and annual vacation
 
 
 528
 COSTA RICA
 rights. It specifies compensation for discharge without due
 cause, and the right to a minimum wage.
 A national wage board, composed of three members each from
 government, management, and labor, sets minimum wages and
 salaries for all sectors. While violations sometimes occur,
 these wage and salary levels are generally respected. The
 minimum wage ranges from $156 to $391 per month, depending on
 occupational field. Workers at the low end of this wage scale
 often find it difficult to maintain a minimally decent
 standard of living. The minimum protection wage, which is set
 as the bare minimum a worker may receive, is currently $5.20
 per day.
 Normal'work hours are set at 8 hours for daytime and 6 hours
 for nighttime work, with weekly totals of 48 and 36 hours
 respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work not
 considered unhealthful or dangerous, but weekly totals may not
 exceed 48 hours. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime
 premium of 50 percent of regular wages for work performed in
 excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural workers are not
 paid overtime if they voluntarily work beyond their normal
 hours.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace. This
 law requires that industrial, agricultural, and commercial
 firms with 10 or more workers must establish a management-
 labor committee. The law allows the Government to inspect
 workplaces and to fine employers for violations. However,
 there are too few labor inspectors, especially outside of San
 Jose, to ensure that minimum conditions of safety and
 sanitation are maintained.
