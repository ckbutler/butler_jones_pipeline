 LIBYA *
 The Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a dictatorship ruled by
 Colonel Mu'ammar AI-Qadhafi, aided by extragvernmental Revolutionary Commit-
 tees operating at his behest. The governing principles of the society are expressed
 in Col. Qadhafi's "Green Book" rather thanin a constitution. He has created a polit-
 ical system borrowing frm pan-Islamic and pan-Arab sources and purporting to es-
 tablish a "third way" supenor to both capitalism and communism. In the past, he
 has used assassination and intimidation as ways to control his enemies abroad; at
 home he continues to use a variety of summary judicial proceedings to suppress all
 popular resistance. Ethnic minorities, such as Berbers, are tightly controlled.
 Libya maintains an extensive security apparatus, consisting of several elite mili-
 tary units, including Col. qadhafi's personal bodyguards. The local Revolutionary
 Committees and People's Coimmittees also have security functions, designed to mon-
 itor as well as protect the populace. The result is multilayered, pervasive surveil-
 lance and control of individual activities.
 Despite continued marginal efforts at privatization, the Libyan economy remains
 essentially state controlled. It is based almost exclusively on the country's rich oil
 resources, Libya's principal source of foreign exchange earnings. Libya has used its
 oil income to finance internal development (new schools, hospitals, roads), but much

 has been wasted. The Government also continued to spend vast sums on military
 and weapons procurement. Foreign exchange controls remained tight in 1992.
 There was no significant change in the human rights situation in 1992, and these
 rights remained tightly restricted. Legal freedoms and rights are generally lacking.
 There are no effective rights to peaceful association or assembly, to freedom of
 speech, including expression of views opposing those of the Government in any form,
 to formation of trade unions, or to strike. The same is true of personal rights such
 as the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty, to a public and speedy
 trial, to legal counsel, to be secure in one's home or person, or even to hold property.
 While some of these rights are guaranteed in principle by the Libyan Government,
 they do not exist in practice. Although Col. Qadhafi announced his support in 1988
 for policies and reforms aimed at remedying past abuses of human rights, there has
 been no evidence of significant change.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were reports by opposition
 groups that political killings took place in 1992, but it was not possible to verify
 these reports. There were reliable reports that 5 to 10 alleged leaders of Islamic
 groups and other political detainees arrested in 1989-90 were executed in 1991.
 A large number of offenses, including political offenses, are punishable by death
 under Libyan law. For example, Law No. 71 of 1972 provides for the death penalty
 for anyone involved with any group activity based on any ideology opposed to the
 principles of the revolution. Despite his publicly stated intentions, Col. Qadhafi has
 not acted to abolish the death penalty for this offense. In fact, in the September
 1991 Consolidation of Liberty Law No. 20, Article 4 stipulates that the death pen-
 alty may be imposed on "those whose behavior constitute a threat or cause deprav-
 ity to society."
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance in 1992 (but see Sec-
 tion 1. c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Libya is a State Party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. However, prisoners are
 reportedly tortured during interrogations or for discipline. Reporting in 1991 and
 1992 indicates that some of the thousands of black African workers who were de-
 tained and then expelled may have been tortured while in detention. One related
 death was reported in 1991, and at least 16 workers were reported to have "dis-
 appeared" while under detention. Some black African workers are reportedly still
 held in detention camps (see also Section 6.e.). Many prisoners are held incommuni-
 cado, which makes confirmation of torture difficult.
 Means of torture reportedly include: chaining to a wall for hours, clubbing, electric
 shock, corkscrews in the back, lemon juice in open wounds, breaking fingers and al-
 lowing the joints to heal without medical care, suffocation using plastic bags, depri-
 vation of food and water, and beatings on the soles of the feet.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under Libyan law, detainees may be held
 incommunicado for unlimited periods. Many political prisoners are held in unofficial
 detention centers, controlled by members of the Revolutionary Committees, where
 prolonged periods of incommunicado detention are common. Many allegedly are held
 without chare or trial, apparently as an example to other would-be opponents of
 the regime. There continued to be reliable reports that between 400 and 500 politi-
 cal detainees were still being held at the end of the year, most of whom were ar-
 rested within the past 3 years. While undergoing interrogation, sometimes for peri-
 ods of several months, prisoners are given no access to legal representation. Al-
 though -Col. Qadhafi has claimed to be opposed to secret arrests, there is still no
 evidence he has issued explicit orders to stop the practice. Foreigners have also been
 subject to arbitrary arrest and torture. There have been credible reports that some
 foreign workers in Libya have been forced into military training and military service
 on behalf of Libya or coerced into subversive activities against their own countries.
 Exile is not a form of punishment practiced in Libya; to the contrary, Col. Qadhafi
 seeks to pressure Libyans working or studying abroad to return to Libya. The re-
 gime does, however, arbitrarily expel noncitizens (see Section 6.e.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Most civilians are tried in regular courts, but their
 cases may be referred to less formal "people's courts," or to military or revolutionary
 couz'ts, depending on the arbitrary decision of the security forces. Security forces
 have the power to judge persons guilty without trial, particularly "traitors to the
 people." Some trials are held in private or in the absence of the accused.
 
 
 1053
 
 A 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and makes all attorneys employ-
 ees of the Secretariat of Justice. Libya claims it "guarantees prisoners al necessary
 means of defense and safeguards of justice adequate to the principles contained in
 the [Universal] Declaration of Human Rights" and provides for legal assistance "as
 soon as possible with respect to the exigencies of interrogation." Nevertheless, there
 continue to be numerous reports that these rights are denied.
 Alleged political offenses have at times been tried before ad hoc revolutionary
 courts rather than by civilian courts, with opportunities to engage defense counsel
 severely restricted. A number of these trials have been held in secret. Despite the
 regime s 1988 announcement of their abolition, "extraordinary" courts are still in op-
 eration and have been publicly discussed in the case of Islamic fundamentalists. Of
 the 400 to 500 known political prisoners currently held in Libyan prisons, most were
 never formally charged or tried. At least one has remained in prison since 1984 de-
 spite having been tried and aqitted in 1985.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not respect the right to privacy. The legal requirement that judi-
 cial warrants be obtained before entering a private home is ofen disregarded. Local
 and international telephone calls are routinely monitored. An extensive government
 informer network is encouraged by both security agencies and Revolutionary Com-
 mittees. Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspected regime opponents
 can result in harassment or even persecution and detention by the authorities. Prop-
 erty can be seized and burned if t belongs to "enemies of the people" or those who
 'cooperate" with foreign powers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Inluding
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Some difference of opinion is tolerated in Peo-
 ple's Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress, but in general free-
 doa of speech is severely limited. This is especially true with regard to criticism
 of Col. Qadhafi or his regime. In the summer, the Libyan media carried reports crit-
 ical of Qadhafi, but these appear to have been orchestrated by the regime as part
 of its propande campaign to deflect international pressure on Libya to respond ef-
 fectively to United Nations :'esolutions 731 and 748 regarding its role in the bomb-
 ing of Pan American flight 103 and Union de Transports Aerens flight 772.
 Political speech is repressed through legislation banning all political activities not
 sanctioned by the Government, including the nonviolent expression of conscien-
 tiously held beliefs. The legislation, which makes the dissemination of "hostile infor-
 mation" a crime, is so all-encompassing that almost any form of expression maa be
 deemed illegal. Fear of being informed upon by elements of the Revolutionary Com-
 mittees a   an underlying cimate of mistrust  all levels of society further inhibit
 freedom of speech.
 Libyan media are owned and controlled by the State. There is a state-run daily
 newspaper, with a circulation of 40,000. Several smaller newspapers are run by the
 Revolutionary Committees. JANA, the official news agency, is the designated con-
 duit for politically acceptable opinions. Publishing opinions contrary to government
 policy is not permitted. Newsweek, Time, the Herald Tribune, and Express Jeune
 Afrique are available, but censorship is applied at times. There are strict controls
 of foreign publications at the Tripoli airport. Foreign broadcasts can be received.
 b. Freedo  oPeaceful Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is repressed
 unless it is government controlled and supportive of regime positions. The right of
 association is limited and granted only to institutions affiated with the regime. Ac-
 cording to Law No. 71 of 1972, party activities constituting treasn" are punishable
 by death. Offending activities include "any grouping, organization, or formation, of
 whatever kind or number, which is based on a political concept opposed in its aims
 to the principles of the  * * Revolution." Organizations such as independent trade
 uions and professional associations are viewed as unnecessary, since Col. Qadhafi
 has vowed not to "accept intermediaries between the revolution and its working
 forces."                 .,
 c. Freedom f Religion.-Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. In an apparent effort
 to eliminate all alternative power bases, the regime has banned the once-powerful
 Sanusiyya Islamic religious sect. In its place, Cal. Qadhafi established the Islamic
 Call Society (ICS), which became the outlet for state-sanctioned religion, as well as
 a tool for exporting the Libyan revolution abroad. In mid-1992, the Government an-
 nounced the disbandment of the ICS; however, there is no evidence it has actually
 been disbanded.
 Members of some minority religions (e.g. Christianity) may conduct services, but
 Islamic grout s   at variance with the state-sanctioned version are banned. Servics
 in Christian churches  e attended by the foreign community. There is a resident
 
 
 1054
 
 Catholic bishop operating two churches with a small number of priests. Nuns re-
 portedly are permitted to wear religious habits.
 In 1990 Cl Qadhafi stepped up a campaign against Islamic fundamentalists. Lik-
 ening fundamentalists to the Mafia, he denounced them as threats to the Govern-
 ment and to Arab existence. As a result of this campaign, many fundamentalists
 left Libya in 1990. In 1992 there were renewed reports of increased arrests of fun-
 damentalists, harassment of bearded males, and an increase in surveillance of
 mosques. A majority of the political detainees in Libya are reported to be associated
 with Islamic groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-With the exception of security areas, movement is not usually restricted
 for Libyan citizens. Traditionally, exit permits have been required for travel abroad,
 and currency controls have also served to restrict travel. Women must have their
 husband's permission for them or their children to travel abroad.
 In September Libya tightened border restrictions and began enforcing currency re-
 strictions that had not previously been enforced at the Tunisian border, possibly in
 response to Tunisia's implementation of U.N. sanctions against Libya. In 1991 Libya
 and Egypt agreed to allow the unrestricted flow of each other's nationals across
 their mutual border. Thousands of Libyans reportedly go back and forth regularly.
 These borders remained open in 1992 despite increased tensions which at times re-
 suited in some tightening of restrictions on border crossings. The Revolutionary
 Committees maintain surveillance of some Libyans while abroad. The right of re-
 turn of Libyan nationals is theoretically fully protected even for opponents of Col.
 Qadhafi. However, this "rightr may be more nearly an obligation; the regime often
 calls for students, many of whom are under government subsidy, and others work-
 ing abroad to return on little or no notice and without regard to the impact on their
 studies or work. Libyans who study abroad are interrogated on their return home.
 A number of Libyans have refused to return.
 Some exiled Libyan opposition leaders reported in August that the Libyan Gov-
 ernment had renewed contacts with them encouraging their return. All refused to
 do so.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The people of Libya have no right to change their government. Major government
 decisions are controlled by Col. Qadhafi, a few key associates, or by committees act-
 ing in his name. He appoints military officers and official functionaries down to jun-
 ior levels. Power flows through a small circle of trusted associates. Corruption and
 favoritism (based on tribal origin) in the administration are major problems, ad-
 versely affecting the efficiency of government.
 Political parties and tribal or local groupings are prohibited. Participation in elec-
 tions is mandatory, and all candidates are cleared by the Revolutionary Committees.
 Candidates may not be "merchants, contractors, tribal advocates, election brokers,
 officials of the former (pre-1969) government, or people who have been attacked by
 the power of the revolution."
 Popular participation in government is theoretically provided by the grassroots
 People's Committees which send representatives annually to the national General
 People's Congress (GPC). In practice, the GPC is a rubberstamp assembly, approv-
 ing all recommendations made by Col. Qadhafi.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No independent human rights organizations are permitted to function in Libya.
 The Libyan Arab Human Rights Committee, a government oranization, was cre-
 ated in May 1989, reportedly to implement reforms announced in 1988. However,
 there are no reports of any activities ythe Committee.
 Libyan officials las t  with Amnesty International (Al) representatives during
 a June 1988 visit. Since then, the Government has repeatedly refused to reply sub-
 stantively to Als appeals on behalf of political detainees in Libya. However, in 1991
 the Government expressed willingness to diacuss Al's concerns with Al representa-
 tives. Preparations for an A' visit were under way in 1992, but by years end no
 visit had oc0urred.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sez, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on tribal status is frequently alleged, particularly against
 Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in the south. Cl. Qadhafis complaints about
 the continued power of tribal and other groups have not prevented him from utiliz-
 ing these groups for political action when he sponsors proregime demonstrations. In
 
 
 1055
 
 ast years, he sought unsuccessfully to assure that Berbers married only non-Ber-
 Is, resumably in an effort to erode their tribal identity.
 In 991 and 1992 Col. Qadhafi expelled thousands of black African workers from
 Libya under circumstances that appeared discriminatory (see Section 6.e.).
 The conservative cultural attitudes of Libya's Islamic society serve to restrict the
 rights of certain groups, most notably women. Col. Qadhafi has led efforts to change
 the status of women and expand their access to educational and employment oppor-
 tunities. With some exceptions, women currently receive basic military training and
 are subject to the military draft. However, the husband's permission is still nec-
 essary for women or children to travel abroad. Female circumcision is reportedly
 still practiced among tribal groups in remote areas of the south. No information is
 available on the extent to which violence against women is a problem in Libya.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers do not have the right to form or join unions
 of their own choosing. The official trade union organization, the General Federation
 of Producers' Trade Unions, which was created in 1972, is under government control
 and administered through the People's Committee system. Every Libyan worker is
 required to join a trade union (expatriates are not allowed to join). Although unions
 are assured the right to "safeguard their interests," there is no right to strike, and
 no strikes by Libyan workers have been reported for years. In a June speech, Col.
 Qadhafi stated that workers have the right to strike but added that strikes do not
 occur in Libya because the workers are in control and can change authority any
 time they wish. Despite this statement, no law authorizes workers to strike.
 With government funding, the official trade union organization plays an activist
 role in the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, the Arab Maghreb
 Trade Union Federation (USTMA), and the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and exploits international trade union contacts to engage in propaganda ef-
 forts on behalf of the Government.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although the Libyan Labor
 Code provides for collective agreements, with the stipulation that the validity of
 these agreements must be subject to government approval, there is no collective bar-
 gaining in Libya.
 c. Piohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The International Labor Organiza-
 tion's (ILO) Committee of Experts, in its 1992 Report, repeated its earlier observa-
 tion that "persons expressing certain political views or views ideologically opposed
 to the estalished political, social or economic system may be punished with pen-
 alties of imprisonment * * * involving * * an obligation to perform labor." It also
 noted that yublic employees in Libya can be imprisoned and sentenced to compul-
 sory labor  * *   as a punishment for breaches of labor discipline or for participa-
 tion in strikes even in services whose interruption would not endanger the life, per-
 sonal safety, or health of the whole or part of the population." The Libyan Govern-
 ment has repeatedly told the ILO's Conference Committee on the Application of
 Conventions and Recommendations that there have been changes in legislation
 which abolish these provisions, but no corroborating evidence has been submitted
 to the ILO.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 18.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Libya maintains a work force of around
 1,120,000 workers (plus an additional 1.75 million foreign workers) in a population
 of 4.3 million. There is a legally mandated minimum wage, which is adequate to
 afford a worker and his family a decent standard of living. The legal maximum
 workweek is 48 hours. Libyan labor law defines the rights and duties of workers,
 including matters of compensation, pension rights, minimum rest periods, and work-
 ing hours. A corps of labor inspectors, based in the seven municipalities of the coun-
 try, are assigned to inspect workplaces for compliance with legal standards includ-
 ing occupational health and safety. Certain industries, such as the petroleum sector,
 try to maintain standards originally set by foreign companies.
 Libyan labor law does not accord equality of treatment to the approximately 1.75
 million foreign workers in Libya, who do much of the blue-collar and technical work.
 Foreign workers may stay in the country only for the duration of the contracts
 under which they are employed. Foreign workers are subject to arbitrary pressures,
 such as changes in work rules and contracts, with little option but to accept or to
 depart the country, often without full compensation for work already performed.
 Conditions of employment are subject to negotiation between the worker and the
 employer. Foreign workers who are not under contract enjoy no protection.
 In the spring of 1990, Col. Qadhafi suddenly began expelling thousands of black
 African workers, claiming they were in Libya illegally. Chadians, Nigerians,
 
 
 1056
 
 Nigeriens, Malians, and Ghanaians were rounded up at their homes or work sites,
 detained for varying amounts of time, and returned destitute to their countries, usu-
 ally with no warning to their governments. Press reports in several of these coun-
 tries have carried unsubstantiated accounts of arbitrary detention and mistreatment
 of these workers by Libyan authorities prior to their expulsion, as well as the dis-
 appearance of at least 16 workers and the killing, probably extrajudicially, of one
 Malian laborer. There were reports that the expulsions continued in 1992 and that
 many workers continue to be detained under difficult conditions.
