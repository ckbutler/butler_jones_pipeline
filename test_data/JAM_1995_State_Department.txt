 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. Two political parties have alternated in power since the first
 elections under universal adult suffrage in 1944. The last general election, held in
 March 1993, was marred by political violence and fraud. The judiciary is independ-
 ent but lacks adequate resources.
 The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) has primary responsibility for internal se-
 curity, assisted by the Island Special Constabulary Force (ISCF). The Jamaica
 Defence Force (JDF-army, air wing, and coast guard) is charged with supporting
 the JCF in maintaining law and order, although it has no powers of arrest. While
 the civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of the security forces,
 some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is based on primary products (bauxite and alumina, sugar, bananas),
 services (tourism, finance), and light manufacturing (garment assembly). The Gov-
 ernment has promoted private investment to stimulate economic modernization and
 growth, pursuing in the process a sometimes painful program of structural adjust-
 ment. Annual per capita income is only $1,560, with a widening gap between
 wealthy and working classes.
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat due to reform efforts
 enacted by the Police Commissioner. Although members of the security forces corn-
 
 
 459
 mitted extrajudicial killings and beatings and carried out arbitrary arrests and de-
 tentions, the Government, in contrast to past years, moved effectively to punish
 some of those involved. The number of policemen charged with murder more than
 quadrupled in the past 2 years. Prison and jail conditions remained poor, with seri-
 ous overcrowding, brutality against detainees, dismal sanitary conditions, and inad-
 equate diet the norm. The judicial system was overburdened and lengthy delays in
 trials were common. Economic discrimination and violence against women remained
 problems, as did mob action against those suspected of breaking the law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The security forces frequently em-
 ployed lethal force in apprehending criminal suspects, usually in the guise of shoot-
 outs. This resulted in the killing of over a hundred people during the year. Allega-
 tions of "police murder" were common, but the validity of many of the allegations
 was suspect, the result of unresolved, long-standing antipathy between the security
 forces and certain communities, especially poorer urban neighborhoods. The JCF
 conducted beth administrative and criminal investigations into incidents involving
 fatal shootings by the police. The number of police actually charged with murder
 rose from single digits in 1993 to 35 in both 1994 and 1995. The JCF policy state-
 ment on the use of force incorporates U.N.-approved language on basic principles
 related to the use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials.
 On April 19, a JCF corporal was suspended after killing a man during interroga-
 tion about a rape. The corporal was charged with murder on May 15. Police authori-
 ties suspended two policemen in Mandeville July 23, after warning shots they fired
 on July 20 to disperse a crowd killed one person and injured two others. Authorities
 suspended a policeman from active duty, pending further investigation, after he shot
 into a peaceful demonstration in Kingston on October 25, killing one person and
 wounding several others.
 There were no developments in the murder trial of a JCF officer accused in two
 July 1993 killings. A JCF officer initially charged with murder for the shooting
 death of a spectator during the July 1991 visit of Nelson Mandela was acquitted
 of manslaughter following trial in November. A jury found a JDF corporal, charged
 in the 1993-killing of a candidate's police bodyguard, not guilty in May.
 In July the Supreme Court awarded damages to the mother of 1 of the 3 men
 who died when prison authorities confined 19 men in a nearly airless cell for 2 days
 in the Constant Spring jail in October 1992. Relatives of the other two men who
 died brought similar suits.
 An increased police presence brought a decline in vigilante action in the rural dis-
 tricts where it had been prevalent.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees. Acknowledg-
 ing past mistreatment of inmates, the Commissioner of Corrections dismissed some
 60 wardens who had abused prisoners. Despite the dismissals, procedures did not
 change significantly, and reports of wardens physically abusing prisoners continued.
 The Jamaica Council for Human Rights (JCR) noted a slight decline in the num-
 ber of reports of physical abuse by the plice.
 Prison conditions remained poor, withovercrwding, inadequate diet, and insuffi-
 cient medical care the norm. The Government began to address the problem of inad-
 equate diet by instituting programs to make the prisons self-sufficient in food, but
 it did not achieve any significant results. The Inter-American Commission on
 Human Rights, which toured correctional centers in 1994, stated in a 1995 letter
 to the Department of Corrections, that it was "impressed with the efforts being
 made by te Government to transform the prison system" although it noted that it
 would take time to put needed reforms into effect.
 The Government allowed private groups, voluntary organizations, international
 human rights organizations, and the media to visit prisons and monitor prison con-
 ditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In 1994 Parliament repealed the Sup-
 pression of Crimes Act (SOCA) of 1974, which permitted warrantless searches and
 the arrest of persons "reasonably suspected" of having committed a crime. The Ja-
 maica Constabulary Force Act, however, now contains several of these provisions,
 and reports that the police abused theseprovisions continued.
 The law requires police to present a detainee in court within 48 hours of deten-
 tion, but authorities continued to detain suspects, especially from poor neighbor-
 hoods, without presenting them before a judge within the prescribed period. Mag-
 
 
 460
 istrates inquire at least once per week into the welfare of each person listed by the
 JCF as being detained. There is a functioning bail system for citizens, but judges
 regularly denied bail for foreign detainees.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and no instances of exile occurred.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, which exists in practice. However, the judicial system is overburdened and op-
 erates with inadequate resources. Budgetary shortfalls have resulted in a steady at-
 trition of trained personnel, causing further delays. Trials in many cases are de-
 layed for years, and others are dismissed because case files can not be located. The
 Justice Ministry initiated evening court sessions in September in an effort to reduce
 .the backlog of pending cases, but there has not yet been a notable improvement in
 this regard.
 The Constitution allows the Court of Appeal and the Parliament to refer cases to
 the Privy Council in the United Kingdom as a final court of appeal.
 The defendant's right to counsel is well-established, hut courts appoint counsel for
 indigents only in cases of a "serious offense" (e.g., murder, rape, robbery, gun of-
 fenses). However, the law does not consider many offenses, including wounding with
 intent to cause great bodily harm, as "serious," and courts thus try many defendants
 without benefit of counsel.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private life of the
 individual. The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force ACt continues to give security
 personnel broad powers of search and seizure similar to those granted by the former
 Suppression of Crimes Act.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.
 The Jamaica Broadcasting Company, largely deregulated in 1988, operates two
 radio stations and one of the island's two television stations. The Government's
 broadcasting commission has the right to regulate programming during emer-
 gencies. Foreign television transmissions are unregulated and available to tens of
 thousands of Jamaicans through satellite antennas. The four largest newspapers, all
 privately owned, regularly report on human rights abuses, particularly those involv-
 ing the JCF. Foreign publications are widely available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status. However, the Gov-
 ernment had not made a decision on the 1994 applications of Cuban and Haitian
 asylum seekers by year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully. Periodic elections are held on the basis of universal suffrage. All citizens
 age 18 and over have the right to vote by secret ballot. The last general election,
 in March 1993, was marred by violence and fraud. The violence and fraud was most
 prevalent in so-called garrison communities, which are dominated by one or the
 other of the two major political parties. The People's National Party (PNP) holds a
 majority in the House of Representatives. The Jamaican Labor Party (JLP), which
 has alternated in power with the PNP since 1944, has boycotted all by-elections
 since 1993, claiming that the Government had not implemented needed electoral re-
 forms. Following agreement on procedures by the major parties in August, voter reg-
 istration will take place under an improved system in the future.
 There are no legal limits on the participation of women in politics. Women hold
 some 13 percent of all plitical offices and 30 percent of the senior civil service posi-
 tions. Women also hold the positions of General Secretary of the PNP, and 2 of 16
 cabinet offices.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their finigs on human rights cases. The work of the
 JCHR, the country's only formal organization concerned with all aspects of human
 rights, was hampered by the lack o adequate resources, and by year's end it faced
 having to close its office. Government officials are generally cooperative and respon-
 sive to the views of human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, polit-
 ical opinion, color, creed, or sex. The Government largely enforces these prohibitions
 in practice, except for widespread discrimination on the basis of political affiliation
 in the distribution of scarce governmental benefits, including employment, especially
 in the garrison communities (see Section 3).
 Women.-In practice, women suffer from economic discrimination, sexual harass-
 ment in the workplace, and social and cultural traditions that perpetuate violence
 against women, including spousal abuse. In April the Government passed long-
 awaited legislation to provide additional remedies for domestic violence, including
 restraining orders and other noncustodial sentencing.
 The Constitution and the 1975 Employment Act accord women full equality. The
 Bureau of Women's Affairs, in the Ministry of Labour, oversees programs to ensure
 the legal rights of women. These programs have had limited effect to date, but have
 raised the awareness of problems affecting women.
 A number of active women's rights groups exist. They are concerned with a wide
 range of issues, from employment, violence against women, and political representa-
 tion, to the image of women in media. Their effectiveness is mixed, but the groups
 were active in pushing for passage of the Domestic Violence bill, and in preparations
 for the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women.
 Children.-The Juvenile Act of 1951 deals with several areas related to thepro-
 tection of children, including prevention of cruelty, prohibition on causin  or  ow-
 ing juvenile begging, the power to bring juveniles in need of care or protection be-
 fore a juvenile court, the treatment of juvenile offenders, the regulation and super-
 vision of children's homes, and restrictions on employment of juveniles. However, a
 Human Rights Watch report contends that the Government has not committed an
 adequate level of resources to enforc  e Act. Government expenditures on edu-
 cation and youth comprise 14 percent of the budget, exclusive of debt servicing. The
 JCHR has noted instances where children who have been in prolonged detention by
 the security forces have left school permanently because they find it difficult to
 catch u p with the work.
 People With Disabilites.-No laws mandate accessibility for people with disabil-
 ities. Several government agencies and nongovernmental organizations provide serv-
 ices and employment to various groups of disabled Jamaicans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right to form or join a trade
 union, and unions function freely and independently of the Government. The Labor
 Relations and Industrial Disputes Act (LRIDA) defines worker rights. There is a
 spectrum of national unions, some of which are affiliated with political parties. Ap-
 proximatel 15 percent of the work farce are members of labor organizations.
 The LRIeA neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to strike, but strikes do
 occur. Workers can interrupt work to strike without criminal liability but cannot be
 assured of keeping their jobs. Workers in 10 brad categories of "essential services
 are prohibited from striking, a provision the International Labor Organization (IL)
 has repeatedly condemned as overly inclusive. The Government did not declare any
 strikes illegal in 1995.
 Jamaican unions maintain a wide variety of regional and international affili-
 ations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bar.a-   Collectively.-The Government rarely inter-
 feres with union organizing efforts. Judicial and police authorities effectively enforce
 the LRIDA and other labor regulations. All parties in Jamaica are firmly committed
 to collective bargaining in contract negotiations, even in some nonunion settings. An
 independent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT) hears cases when management and
 labor fail to reach agreement. Any cases not resolved by the IDT pass to the civil
 courts. The eDT was not able to resolve the large number of disputes before it in
 1995. LRIDA prohibits antiunion discrimination. For example, employers may not
 
 
 462
 
 fire workers solely for union membership. The authorities enforced this law effec-
 tively.
 Domestic labor laws apply equally to the "free zones" (export processing zones).
 However, there are no unionized companies in any of the 3 zones, which employ ap-
 proximately 18,000 workers. Organizers attribute this to resistance by foreign own-
 ers in the zones to organizing efforts. Attempts to organize plants within the zones
 continue. Company-controlled "workers' councils" handle grievance resolution at
 most free zone companies but do not negotiate wages or conditions with manage-
 ment. Management determines wages and benefits within the free zones; they are
 generally as good as, or better than, those in similar industries outside the zones.
 The Ministry of Labor has not performed factory inspections in the free zones since
 1992.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not specifi-
 cally address the matter of forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party
 to both ILO conventions that prohibit compulsory labor, and there were no reports
 that this practice exists.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Juvenile Act provides that
 children under the age of 12 years shall not be employed except by parents or
 guardians, and that such employment may be only in domestic, agricultural, or hor-
 ticultural work. However, enforcement is erratic. Children under 12 years peddle
 goods and services on city streets, but there is no evidence of widespread illegal em-
 ployment of children in other sectors of the economy. The Educational Act stipulates
 that all children between 6 and 11 years of age must attend elementary school. In-
 dustrial safety, police, and truant officers are charged with enforcement. Under cur-
 rent economic circmstancs, however, thousands of parents keep children at home
 to help with housework and avoid school fees. A 1994 report by t UN. Children's
 Fund stated that 4.6 percent of Jamaican children (below the age of 16 years)
 worked to contribute  the support of their households.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage, which went from $9.00
 (i_$300) to $15.00 (j$500) per week in July 1994, is widely considered inadequate.
 Most salaried workers earn more than the legal minimum. Work over 40 hours per
 week or 8 hours per day must be compensated at overtime rates, a provision that
 is widely observed.
 The Labor Ministry's Industrial Safety Division oversees the setting and enforcing
 of industrial health and safely standards, which are considered adequate. Industrial
 accident rates, particularly in the alumina and bauxite industry, were once again
 low. Public service staff reductions in the Ministries of Labor, Finance, National-Se-
 cuity, and the Public Service have contributed to the difficulties in enforcing work-
 place regulations. The law provides workers the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment if they
 are trade union members or covered by the Factories Act. The law does not specifi-
 cally protect other categories of workers in those circumstances.
