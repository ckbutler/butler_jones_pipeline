 NAMIBIA
 Formerly German South West Africa, Namibia has been ruled by
 the Republic of South Africa since 1915. The United Nations
 lifted South Africa's 1920 League of Nations mandate in 1966.
 However, South Africa refused to relinquish its possession and
 has ignored a 1971 advisory opinion of the International Court
 of Justice upholding U.N. authority over Namibia and calling
 for South Africa's immediate withdrawal. In 1978, the United
 States, United Kingdom, France, Federal Republic of Germany,
 and Canada drafted a proposal for Namibian independence worked
 out in talks with South Africa, the South West Africa Peoples
 Organization (SWAPO) insurgents, and the neighboring states
 (known as the "frontline states"). This proposal became
 United Nations Security Council Resolution 435. It calls for
 the cessation of all hostilities, the phased withdrawal of
 South African forces, and free elections under U.N.
 supervision. South Africa has said that it will not implement
 Resolution 435 without a satisfactory commitment by the
 Angolan Government on the parallel withdrawal of Cuban forces
 from Angola. In the fall of 1984, the Angolans made a formal
 proposal on the numbers and timing of Cuban troop withdrawal.
 South Africa responded with its own proposals. The United
 States is committed to the U.N. plan and has been playing a
 mediating role in negotiations between South Africa and Angola.
 A South African Government proclamation in June 1985 gave
 considerable autonomy over internal affairs to a group of
 internal political parties, known as the Multiparty Conference
 (MPC). The MPC formed a "Transitional Government of National
 Unity," more widely known as the "interim government." A
 number of parties opposed to South African rule refused to
 join the MPC. Among these parties was SWAPO, which is waging
 a guerrilla war against South African rule from outside the
 country but is still allowed to operate as a political party
 in Namibia, despite harassment by the authorities. A number
 of other parties, including a major part of The Southwest
 Africa National Union, the oldest nonviolent opposition group,
 also refused to join the MPC. A South African appointed
 Administrator General still sits in Windhoek but with
 drastically reduced powers. The United States and the rest of
 the international community do not recognize the interim
 government and hold the Republic of South Africa responsible
 for the actions of the Namibian authorities it has appointed.
 A majority (60 percent) of Namibians live by subsistence
 agriculture. The economy relies on mining, ranching, and
 fishing. A weak and unstable market for minerals, persistent
 drought, and overfishing.by some foreign concerns--particularly
 from the Soviet bloc--have caused a lingering recession.
 Uncertainty about Namibia's political future has discouraged
 potential foreign investment. Tourism is one of the few
 bright spots on the economic horizon. Meanwhile, the South
 African Government provides almost $400,000 a day in direct
 aid to Namibia.
 Most reports of human rights violations by government
 authorities or SWAPO involve actions taken in the war zone in
 the north. Low-level guerrilla conflict has focused on
 northern Namibia since 1966 when SWAPO first turned to
 violence. Sporadic incidents of violence plague the entire
 country, but most of the fighting takes place along Namibia's
 border with Angola, especially in the Ovamboland region. The
 Ovambo ethnic group comprises about 50 percent of Namibia's
 
 
 312
 NAMIBIA
 population and provides the main support for SWAPO. In recent
 years, the combat has been conducted by small groups belonging
 to SWAPO's military branch, the People's Liberation Army of
 Namibia (PLAN). SWAPO uses the denser foliation of the rainy
 season to infiltrate annually northern Namibia from bases in
 Angola and to carry out sabotage missions. The South African
 Defense Force (SADF) and the South West African Territorial
 Force (SWATF) attempt to root out the SWAPO teams and on
 several occasions in 1985 conducted major "hot pursuit"
 operations across the border into Angola. A police counter
 insurgency force known as "Koevoet," (meaning crowbar) has
 played a prominent role in combat operations.
 There were a number of civilian deaths attributed to both
 government security forces and to SWAPO, including a number
 caused by mines or bombs planted by SWAPO in public places.
 1985 saw a continuation of arbitrary detention without access
 to counsel or visits by family members and of torture and
 other abuses by security forces. However, in 1985 a number of
 prisoners were released.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political killing
 As an arena of guerrilla conflict, Namibia has seen a number
 of deaths due to terrorist bombings. Post offices, schools,
 and other government buildings in the north are heavily
 barricaded and patrolled. According to security forces, land
 mines planted in roads in Ovamboland and even farther south
 have claimed the lives of 15 civilians, with an additional 41
 civilians killed in other SWAPO actions. SWAPO guerrillas
 have reportedly murdered some Ovambo civilians, apparently in
 an attempt to intimidate others from cooperating with the
 South African Government.
 The SADF and SWATF and the police have themselves been accused
 of murder. It is a familiar axiom that SWAPO guerrillas who
 are captured rarely see the inside of a courtroom, and killing
 or disappearance of captives who refuse to cooperate with
 authorities have been reported. Defense officials insist that
 they investigate all charges of murder. They also assert that
 the murders they have confirmed are acts of indiscipline and
 not policy. Critics contend that the SADF/SWATF sometimes do
 nothing, even when informed of instances of misconduct. In
 October, in a case given considerable publicity, two SADF
 servicemen were convicted of murdering an Ovambo shopkeeper in
 February. The two men were given jail terms of 22 and 18
 years respectively.
 Some clergymen and human rights activists have accused the
 police paramilitary unit known as "Koevoet," of numerous
 atrocities, including murder (the name "Koevoet" was dropped
 in mid-1985 when the unit came under the authority of the
 Southwest Africa Police, reporting to the interim
 government). On January 26, 1985, the South African
 Government agreed to pay $35,000 in damages, along with legal
 costs, to settle claims of an alleged unlawful killing and a
 series of assaults by Koevoet. No criminal prosecutions, for
 which a higher standard of proof is required, have resulted
 from these cases.
 
 
 313
 NAIBIA
 On January 27, 1985, Thomas Shindoba Nikanur, a contract miner
 with Consolidated Diamond Mines in Oranjemund, died while in
 detention in Osire. Nikanur had been detained under security
 legislation and, according to security police, allegedly had
 hung himself with his own socks. An official inquest into his
 death was launched on September 30 but was later postponed to
 January 27, 1986.
 b. Disappearance
 The security forces are not obliged to notify anyone when a
 person is detained and often hold detainees incommunicado.
 They are sometimes accused of ignoring requests for
 information from family members and friends of those who: have
 been detained. As a result, some Namibians have "disappeared"
 only to turn up in detention cells.
 SWAPO reportedly uses abductions to win recruits, although
 SWAPO officials contend that all its recruits join
 voluntarily. In May, news accounts reported that SWAPO forces
 had abducted some 80 Ovambo school children from a school near
 Oshakati. Sixteen of the children subsequently escaped. The
 reported number of those involved was later revised downward.
 Nevertheless, the episode seemed a large-scale revival of a
 tactic which SWAPO had apparently discontinued several years
 ago because of the negative publicity which ensued. A SADF
 officer said smaller scale SWAPO abductions remain a common
 feature of life in Ovamboland.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Political leaders, clergymen, and others regularly make
 detailed allegations that the police and security forces have
 engaged in brutal treatment against civilians, both in and out
 of detention, including the use of solitary confinement and
 beatings. Several civil cases in 1985 confirm at least a few
 of these allegations. Documents filed in a court case in 1985
 contained statements that the plaintiff, a Mr. Katofa, had,
 during the initial stages of his detention, been "assaulted
 from time to time by members of the security police."
 Security officials point to these court cases as proof that
 claims are investigated and, if valid, pursued in legal
 channels.
 Several attorneys and journalists have asserted that security
 forces in the north are ruthless when extracting information
 from alleged SWAPO sympathizers or agents.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Two key articles of security legislation, enacted into law via
 proclamations by the Administrator General (AG 9 and AG 26),
 give security forces to broad detention power. AG 9 of 1977
 constitutes the legal basis for most detentions and permits
 30-day detentions without charge of anyone deemed to have
 committed an offense, to be planning an offense, or to have
 knowledge of an offense. Security forces are considered to
 include the police, the railway police, the South African
 Defense Force, and the South West Africa Territorial Force.
 Namibians detained under AG 9 are denied access to legal
 counsel, except with permission from the cabinet of the
 interim government. AG 9 initially applied only to the far
 northern areas of Namibia. However, since 1979 the "seturity
 
 
 314
 NAMIBIA
 districts" have been extended south to include most central
 areas, including Windhoek. Altogether, more than 80 percent
 of the population is subject to AG 9.
 In security cases another provision, AG 26, allows indefinite
 detention without trial, under authorization from the cabinet
 (previously from the Administrator General). AG 26 also
 provides several constructive guarantees not provided by AG 9.
 It states that detainees are entitled to a copy of the arrest
 warrant and to reasons for the arrest in writing. It further
 stipulates that they are also entitled to visits by medical
 practitioners and magistrates. AG 26 also provides for a
 review committee, but the cabinet is not required to follow
 review committee recommendations. The record in enforcing AG
 26 rights is mixed. Persons detained under AG 26 are rarely
 aware of their rights and even more rarely have access to
 legal counsel prepared to pursue those rights. However, in at
 least two cases taken up by attorneys legal action or the
 threat of such action won releases. The Katofa case was one
 instance. Until mid-1985 Namibians detained under security
 legislation had no recourse to the courts. In 1985, however,
 attorneys for Mr. Katofa, who was detained under AG 26,
 applied in the Windhoek Supreme Court seeking legal access.
 They pointed out that the Administrator General had been
 replaced by the interim government, which owed its
 establishment to a South African Government proclamation
 containing the MPC's "bill of fundamental rights." These
 rights included one that guarantees "no one shall be detained
 for an indefinite period of time without a fair and proper
 trial by a court." The Windhoek Supreme Court found that the
 cabinet had failed to show sufficient cause and ordered
 Katofa's release. In another 1985 case, the threat of legal
 action won release of an AG 26 detainee, Mr. Abed Christian.
 Section 6 of the South African Terrorism Act 83 of 1967 still
 applies in Namibia. However,-it is rarely invoked as grounds
 for detention.
 South African State President P.W. Botha stated in Parliament
 that as of February 1985, 54 persons were being detained
 without trial for periods of more than 30 days. He also said
 that another seven were being held indefinitely under
 provisions of AG 26. On November 14, 1985, interim government
 Minister of Justice Fanuel Kozonquizi stated that 50 Namibians
 were being held under AG 9, primarily because they are
 "witnesses" in pending trials, and that another 6 were being
 held under AG 26.
 The Newspaper, The Namibian, publishes a weekly column listing
 those known to be in detention and those believed to be in
 detention. Its November 8 edition listed those figures as 22
 and 23, respectively. Among those known to be detained
 without trial is Petrus Haimbondi, reportedly detained in
 1981, who was the only known intern of the Keikanachab Camp
 outside Mariental not released from custody when the camp was
 closed in late 1984. On October 22, 1985, a senior member of
 the Evangelical Lutheran church, Rev. Junius Kaapanda, was
 taken into custody under security legislation. He was still
 being held at the end of the year.
 In the recent past some detainees were released subject to
 certain restrictions, as under the South African Internal
 Security Act. These restrictions usually entailed strict
 curfew hours, confinement to the city of residence, and a
 prohibition on meetings with more than four other persons. In
 
 
 315
 NAMIBIA
 1985, 19-year-old restrictions were lifted against Nathaniel
 Maxwilili, a SWAPO acting president living in Walvis Bay. In
 late October, the interim government lifted the ban on a Roman
 Catholic priest, Father Herman Klein-Hitpass, who had been
 exiled from Namibia to Walvis Bay in 1978. No reliable
 statistics exist on others who remain in restriction.
 In late 1983, the Administrator General established a
 commission of inquiry to make recommendations on the
 adequacy, fairness and efficacy of legislation pertaining to
 the internal security of the territory." The commission was
 chaired by Justice H.P. Van Dyk and conducted hearings
 throughout the country during 1984. In late 1985, the
 commission's report was handed to the interim government
 cabinet. The report has not yet been made public.
 There is no forced labor in Namibia.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 On November 14, the interim government released 21 SWAPO
 members who had been transferred several months earlier from
 Robben Island prison in South Africa. Robben Island is
 reserved for political prisoners. All but four of the
 released men had been serving life sentences for violations of
 the Terrorism Act. Fourteen of them had been sentenced
 together on February 9, 1968, after one of the most important
 political trials affecting Namibia. SWAPO Secretary-General
 Toivo Ja Toivo, who was released from Robben Island in 1984,
 was also sentenced at this 1968 trial. The interim government
 cabinet said it had taken the decision to release the
 prisoners "within the spirit of national reconciliation."
 Also on November 14, the interim government released from
 Windhoek central prison another SWAPO member who had served 5
 years of a 7-year sentence.
 Many detainees are held without charges under AG 9 and AG 26.
 However, persons brought to trial can expect a hearing based
 on the legal merits of their case. They have access to legal
 counsel and can expect the charges against them to be clearly
 stated. The judiciary has demonstrated independence from
 government intimidation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Security legislation allows the security forces almost
 unlimited powers of search and seizure. In the operational
 area--the sectors along the northern border--invasion of home
 is said to be routine. On May 27 security police raided the
 homes of 11 senior SWAPO members in Windhoek and the southern
 city of Gibeon. This night raid saw the confiscation of SWAPO
 literature, pamphlets, and badges. Cars are regularly stopped
 and searched when entering checkpoints to the northern region;
 they are also periodically stopped and scrutinized when
 entering or leaving government installations in the
 operational area.
 Politically active Namibians regularly complain that the
 authorities keep them under surveillance. Security police,
 often disguised as businessmen, reportedly have offered money
 to activists' friends in return for information on their
 movements. In December 1984, a prominent Namibian journalist
 found in her mail a top secret instruction from the Pretoria
 
 
 316
 NAMIBIA
 police to the postmaster in Windhoek ordering that her mail be
 screened. The journalist revealed the letter to the press and
 was promptly arrested for violating the Official Secrets Act
 and the Post Office Act. The charges were withdrawn January
 31, 1985.
 In 1977, Judge T. Marthinus Steyn used his tenure as
 Admininistrator General to ease apartheid in Namibia. Laws
 prohibiting interracial marriage and sexual relations were
 repealed, and laws restricting the movement of individuals
 based on race were abolished. Today integrated facilities are
 the rule. Most hotels and restaurants are officially open to
 all races. However, at least one Windhoek restaurant
 blatantly maintains a whites-only admission policy. Several
 others seem to use more subtle methods to discourage nonwhite
 patrons. Nonwhites reportedly face open hostility from white
 thugs when attempting to use the municipal swimming pool.
 Poverty restricts most blacks and coloreds from moving out of
 their respective townships into the white neighborhoods of
 Windhoek. In December 1985, Namibia's libraries, including
 the Windhoek public library, which were operated by the
 second-tier Administration for Whites were opened to nonwhites.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Namibian newspapers are subject to South African press laws,
 including the Internal Security Act of 1950. These laws limit
 reporting on certain matters such as military affairs and
 prisons. Yet even with this restriction, the Namibian press
 often contains lively and irreverent reporting, and its
 editorial writing regularly includes anti-South African and
 even pro-SWAPO comment. Newspapers have embarrassed the
 interim government with disclosures of the salaries and
 perquisites provided to MPC representatives. The installation
 of the interim government, whose bill of fundamental rights
 guarantees the freedom of expression, suggested a looser rein
 on the press. However, the cabinet required an $8,000 deposit
 from the owners of The Namibian newspaper before allowing them
 to publish the newspaper's inaugural edition on August 30,
 1985.
 Publications which are banned in South Africa are also banned
 in Namibia. However, Windhoek book and periodical retailers
 carry many publications which one would not find in South
 Africa. Censorship laws seem to be less stringently applied
 in Namibia than in South Africa.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 On June 17, 1985, critics of the interim government organized
 a peaceful demonstration to protest the installation of the
 government. The demonstration took place in Katutura, a
 subsection of Windhoek. Security police, many of them
 "Koevoet" members, disrupted the event and brutally dispersed
 participants. Church observers reported that over 70 people
 had been injured: one was a pregnant woman who subsequently
 suffered a miscarriage. The interim government pledged to
 pursue the matter, but no convictions resulted.
 All political parties must apply for permission to convene
 meetings. The Prohibition and Notification of Meetings Act of
 1981 bars any political party from holding a public meeting of
 
 
 317
 NAMIBIA
 a certain size if that party advocates violence as a means of
 changing the status quo. This provision has allowed the
 government to limit the political activities of SWAPO
 members. In 1985, applications of the faction of the South
 West Africa Union (SWANU) which refused to join the interim
 government were also denied. This group is an important part
 of the noniolent opposition to the interim government. On
 August 25, 1985, police arrested 52 people during preparations
 for a commemoration in Katatura of the 19th anniversary of the
 "armed struggle" in Namibia. On August 26, police dispersed a
 demonstration which followed the court appearances of those
 arrested the previous day. The case was subsequently
 postponed twice. On September 30, the date of one
 postponement, police arrested 75 people outside the Windhoek
 magistrate's court under the Demonstrations in or near Court
 Buildings Prohibition Act of 1982. This law had been made
 applicable to Namibia on June 15, 1985,--2 days before the
 inauguration of the interim government, even though the
 interim government's bill of fundamental rights guarantees the
 right of "peaceful assembly."
 Six labor unions are registered in Namibia, and all are
 nominally open to all races.  Only one of the six has a
 sizable black membership: the Mine Workers Union (MWU) based
 in Tsumeb. The Department of Civic Affairs reports that only
 the MWU and the Municipal Staff Association are functioning
 labor organizations. The MWU is represented in only one of
 the three mining firms. Neither union has been noticeably
 active. Migrant labor is a staple of the mining and fishing
 industries. Many of the migrant workers are Ovambos unwilling
 to risk being discharged and forced back to the operational
 area by loss of their income, a situation which may discourage
 labor militancy.
 In November, the Namibian national assembly approved a bill
 prohibiting outsiders from forming trade unions and employers
 organizations in the territory. A cabinet spokesman said the
 bill was not intended to restrict the right of Namibians to
 form trade unions but to ensure that they exercise that right
 on their own initiative free from outside influences.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Namibians enjoy complete freedom of religion. Almost all
 Namibians are Christians. The Lutheran church has by far the
 largest share of adherents: the 1985 merger of two Lutheran
 branches formed the EvangelicalLutheran Church, to which 7
 out of 10 Namibians belong. The Catholic, Anglican,
 Methodist, and Dutch Reformed churches are also active.
 Most church officials are openly critical of the South African
 and interim governments and complain that this stance causes
 them to be regularly harassed and inconvenienced by the
 authorities. Clerics have been affected by detentions and
 passport denials. The interim government reportedly delayed
 one education aid project sponsored by the Namibian Council of
 Churches until the project was taken over by a secular group.
 Several South African Defense Force officials have argued that
 the clerics are SWAPO sympathizers and supporters. The
 clerics deny allegiance to SWAPO, stating only that they wish
 to see Namibia become independent. Clergymen in northern
 Namibia complain that security regulations hamper their travel
 to outlying areas.
 
 
 318
 NAMIBIA
 The military conscription system makes no provision for
 conscientious objectors.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 On February 26, 1985, the Administrator General issued an
 order under the Security Districts Proclamation which states
 that no person may enter six northern and northeastern
 districts without first obtaining a permit issued by the
 police. The districts are Ovamboland, Kavango, Kaokoland,
 Eastern Caprivi, Bushmanland, and Hereroland east. Everyone
 must apply in person at a police station and fill out a form
 giving their reason for travel. Approval of such applications
 can take up to 2 weeks. Since the order was issued, several
 people have been denied permits. In at least one case, the
 police refused to give reasons for the denial.
 Clerics in northern Namibia complain that these regulations
 greatly restrict their ability to attend to their
 congregations, particularly when they must travel from
 Ovamboland into Kavango. One church leader was offered a
 multiple-entry permit, but he rejected it as an illegitimate
 special privilege.
 Though enforcement of the requirement that travelers present
 permits at roadway checkpoints leading into the northern
 sectors has reportedly grown lax during the latter half of
 1985, travelers without permits still risk being turned away.
 A dusk-to-dawn curfew in the operational area also restricts
 freedom of movement. In addition, the potential danger of
 land mines discourages travel on nontarred roads.
 The authorities control travel beyond South Africa through
 denials of passports or "travel documents," which are required
 of Namibians seeking to journey overseas. Those persons
 deemed to be sympathetic to SWAPO or who are officially
 associated with SWAPO are usually given passports valid for
 only 1 year rather than the regular 5-year period. For
 example, Roman Catholic Bishop Boniface Haushiku has been
 denied written requests for a 5-year passport and issued
 passports valid only for one year. Editor of the Namibian,
 Gwen Lister, and SWAPO Secretary-General Toivo Ja Toivo are
 other examples. In some cases, individuals are refused
 passports altogether, as in the 1985 case of SWAPO internal
 Foreign Affairs Secretary Nico Bessinger. All persons
 entering South Africa or Namibia must have a passport and visa
 unless they can prove to be South African or Namibian by law
 or descent.
 In November, the national assembly passed a law requiring
 non-Namibians to apply for special permits if they wish to
 reside in Namibia for longer than 30 days. The law also
 provides for the deportation of people deemed to be
 "detrimental to the welfare of the territory or its
 inhabitants."
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Namibians do not have the right to change their government.
 Ruled by an Administrator General prior to June 17, 1985, they
 are now ruled by South Africa through an interim government
 which they did not elect and which is not accountable to
 
 
 319
 NAMIBIA
 them. Ostensibly, the MPC interim government has full control
 over all government portfolios, excepting defense and foreign
 affairs, which the South African Government retains. The six
 parties of the MPC divided the cabinet seats among themselves
 after sustained negotiations. No elections were held. The
 cabinet enacts legislation through a national assembly, whose
 members were also appointed by the parties.
 In 1978, the prospect of independence led to the creation of a
 number of political parties seeking representation via the
 election mandated by United Nations Resolution 435. At one
 period, some 44 political organizations existed, several of
 which had only a handful of members. About a dozen political
 parties have credible structures and membership rolls. Six of
 these "credible" parties take part in the interim government.
 The interim government inherited a complex three-tier
 administrative structure. The first-tier is the central
 government level. The second-tier authorities are separate
 ethnic governing bodies representing each of the 10 officially
 designated population groups. Third-tier authorities, such as
 municipal governments and village management boards, provide
 local services. The control of facilities such as schools,
 hospitals, and libraries by the ethnic second-tier authorities
 tends to reserve the best available facilities for whites, who
 enjoy a much higher tax base. The issue of whether to
 dismantle the second-tier structure or if not, how to amend
 it, is the most divisive question facing the interim
 government. Unable to resolve the matter, the cabinet and
 national assembly in September 1985 created a constitutional
 council charged with arriving at a compromise on this and
 other constitutional issues.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Critics of Namibia's human rights situation have visited
 Namibia. U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy paid a 1-day visit to
 Windhoek in January 1985. A labor party delegation from the
 United Kingdom's House of Commons journeyed through Namibia in
 early 1985. The Namibian Council of Churches occasionally
 sponsors visits of individuals and groups critical of the
 internal situation. The Namibia Communications Center, an
 ecumenical agency based in London, chronicles reported human
 rights abuses in Namibia.
 Amnesty International, in its 1985 Report (covering 1984),
 expressed concern about the detention without trial of
 political detainees and the allegations that some detainees
 were tortured and ill-treated. In its 1985-86 report, Freedom
 House upgraded Namibia to "partly free" based on the
 establishment of a "semblance of home rule and
 self-determination in 1985."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Namibia's population of 1.1 million (7 percent white, 93
 percent black) is growing at the rate of 3.1 percent a year.
 Per capita gross national product was $1,935 in 1982 but is
 misleading because Namibia is a blend of two economies: one
 modern and sophisticated, the other traditional and based on
 subsistence-level agriculture. Some 60 percent of Namibia's
 labor force works in agriculture; the vast majority,
 
 
 320
 NAMIBIA
 particularly in the north, is employed in the traditional
 sector. Whites dominate the modern sector. Some blacks find
 work in the modern sector but primarily in the lower echelons.
 Mining is the single most important economic activity,
 contributing over a quarter of the gross domestic product.
 Some mining firms--particularly in the diamond mining
 industry--have been accused of overmining in anticipation-of
 Namibian independence. Other allegations are that Namibia has
 lost revenue on diamond exports due to schemes such as secret
 exchanges of high-quality Namibia diamonds for lower-quality
 diamonds from South Africa. An independent commission,
 chaired by Judge P.W. Thirion, conducted an inquiry into
 alleged maladministration and corruption in government and
 also examined the mining sector. In November 1985, the
 commission delivered its report to the cabinet of the interim
 government. The report will not be published until the
 cabinet authorizes its release. The fishing industry also
 faces concerns that its resources are being depleted. There
 has been large-scale indiscriminate fishing in Namibian waters
 by foreign fleets, particularly those from the Soviet bloc
 countries.
 Life expectancy at birth is approximately 61.5 years, and the
 infant mortality rate (1985) is 113 per 1,000 live births.
 Calorie supply as a percentage of requirements was 99 percent
 in 1977, the most recent year for which data are available.
 Literacy figures (1983) are 100 percent for whites and 28
 percent for blacks, with primary school attendance 100 percent
 for whites and 16 percent for blacks.
 The South African Government gives Namibia direct budgetary
 aid of roughly $400,000 a day. In addition, it annually
 guarantees loans of $72 million to Namibians by third
 parties. Namibian government officials insist that the
 territory can become financially self-sufficient upon
 independence but concede that such an accomplishment will not
 come easily. The development of a gas field off the southern
 coast promises revenue and employment potential.
 There is no minimum wage in Namibia. The minimum working age
 is 15. Reliable information about the extent to which
 occupational health and safety standards are enforced in
 Namibia is not readily available.
 Women encounter considerable difficulties in both traditional
 and modern settings. Under traditional practice, a woman is
 usually the ward of her father or, when married, her husband.
 She is never independent. Women in the modern sector complain
 of discrimination in employment and in financial affairs.
 Women's groups have been formed generally under the auspices
 of the churches. Women are represented in the national
 assembly, though not in the cabinet. In 1985 the Council of
 Churches helped establish a women's organization, Namibian
