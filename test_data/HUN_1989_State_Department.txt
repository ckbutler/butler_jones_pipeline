 Hungary is undergoing an historic transition in which reform-
 minded Communists, now calling themselves Socialists, endorsed
 in 1989 the country's transition toward free; multiparty
 elections scheduled for March 25, 1990. The reform Communists
 abandoned the party's claims to a leading role in the State
 and established the Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP) to replace
 the Hungarian Socialist Workers (Communist) Party (HSWP) which
 dissolved itself. The Parliament adopted sweeping amendments
 to the 1949 Constitution, and the country's name was changed
 from the Hungarian People's Republic to the Republic of
 Hungary. Communists in 1989 had to retreat on fundamental
 issues, such as the legitimacy of opposition political
 parties; its paramilitary Workers Militia was disbanded.
 The strong state security apparatus has been nominally
 detached from Communist party control. Its activities, less
 obtrusive in 1989, were opened to very limited public scrutiny
 for the first time. The Soviet Union in 1989 announced cuts
 in its military forces stationed in Hungary of some 20
 percent, reducing them to about 55,000, and the Hungarian Army
 announced manpower reductions of 35 percent, to about 85,000.
 Eventual neutrality was accepted as a policy goal by
 reform-minded Communist party leaders.
 The economy has structural problems headed by inefficient
 state industries, a $20 billion gross debt, which is Eastern
 Europe's largest per capita, and deficits in a government
 budget which consumes 63 percent of gross domestic product.
 The Government, which is committed to social tolerance as well
 as market reforms, must cope with widespread unhappiness over
 a high inflation rate (officially 16-17 percent). The
 Government was concerned that growth in unemployment and
 widening income differentials might trigger social unrest.
 There was impressive practical and legislative progress in
 Hungary's human rights record throughout 1989. Hundreds of
 public demonstrations and opposition political meetings took
 place without police interference under the law on assembly
 adopted in January. The country took an important step in
 coming to grips with its-Communist past as over 100,000 people
 took part in the June 16 public funeral services for Imre
 Nagy, Prime minister during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, and
 colleagues who were executed in 1958. Hungary stood out among
 Warsaw Pact members by--acceding to the International Covenants
 on Human Rights as well as the.1951 U.N. Convention on the
 Status of Refugees and the 1967-Additional Protocol. The
 Government in 1989 dismantled the "iron curtain" border with
 Austria-and cou~-ageously opened the border for over 50,000
 East Germans to travel to-the Federal Republic of Germany
 (FRG) despite the provisions of an Hungarian-East German
 agreemeat and vociferous protests from East German authorities.
 Under the new law on associations, the roster of new political
 parties swe-lled to about 50. Radio Free Europe opened its
 firstEast EuTopean office in Budapest in September. The
 Parliament in September passed a law significantly broadening
 freedom of speech. With the virtual withering away of the
 official press, the proliferating independent journals have
 become watchdogs against official abuses. In multiparty
 parliamentary by-elections, the first in over 40 years, the
 opposition Hungarian Democratic Forum won four clear victories
 over the HSWP. The State Office for Religious Affairs, a
 Stalinist vestige, was abolished, and negotiations were opened
 to restore full diplomatic relations with the Vatican.

 RESPECT FOR HU14AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom ffom:
 -a.-- PoliticaLeand Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no evidence that such killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were-no reported disappearances.
 *c. 'Tofture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 No knoiwn instances-of torture have occurred in Hungary in
 rdcent'jjeais. Citizens, in principle, may bring complaints
 against the police.
 There are three -levels of punitive incarceration: -"workhouse,"
 which allows some privileges such as visiting,-outside work,
 and-leave; "jail," which i9 mdtbe punitive, and "prison," which
 mdnis a maximum-security penitentiary. With varying degrees
 of frequency, depending on levels of'imprisonmenti prisoners
 have rights-to visitation by family members, other relatives,
 ard fkiendS. Thire does not -appear to be systematic
 mistreatment of .prisoners, and~no- such cases were reported in
 1989.  -                           -
 d. .Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Hungary's-legal system underwentconsiderable'change in 1989
 with th6 adoption of' amendments-to the. penal code in '
 September,'which restricted-the definition of "anti-State
 crimes" to offenses which threaten the political system in
 respect tbthe principles'of-the Constitution,-or the
 independenae'or territorial integrity'of the'State. Attacks
 -on leading officials are no longer accepted *ithin the meaning
 6f "anti-State crimes," and criminal proceedings may no longer
 be',uiued against those who publicly urge a change in the
 political system.
 - Citizens kke'no longer subject to arbitrary arrest. The
 .amended Constitution provides that any past victims of
 unlawftl arrest or detention shall'be entitled to
 compensation. Upon arrest, a detainee must be informed in
 writing of the offense he or she is-suspected of having
 committed and may be held at a police station-for a maximum of
 72 hours before charges must-be filed. There is no right of
 bail or provisional pretrial liberty.. A'Supreme Court ruling
 is nereded to extend incarceration-for over 1 year while
 criminal proc6edings are in progress. No xases of police
 violation of arrest procedures came to light in 1989.
 The neW law :n criminal procedure adopted by Parliament in
 September limits the issuance,, extension, and withdrawal of
 orders for detention without authorization by magistrates,
 allows for the presence of defense attorneys during police
 -questioning, and limits detention without charges to 1 month.
 The law limits the jurisdiction of military courts to members
 of'the armed forces and border guards. Policemen must be
 tried in civil courts.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 1144
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for a Constitutional Court
 consisting of 15 members elected by Parliament. One-third of
 the 15 were elected by the current Parliament, and the
 remainder will be elected by the new Parliament. The Supreme
 Court exercises guidance over the Budapest, county, and local
 courts. No judge, member of the Supreme Court or
 Constitutional Court can be a member of a political party or
 engage in political activity.
 The Constitution establishes the presumption of innocence
 until criminal responsibility is established. Trials are
 open. Defendants have a right to counsel at all phases of
 proceedings. Decisions of the courts, public administration,
 or other authorities that infringe on individual rights can be
 appealed. In general, j udicial procedures are investigative
 rather than adversarial in nature. There is no trial by jury.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The amended Constitution provides for personal freedom, the
 protection of privacy, and the inviolability of domicile, but
 these provisions continued to be violated when the State
 believed that it was in its interest to do so. Search
 warrants are generally obtained. House searches are conducted
 by court order and must be carried out in the presence of two
 witnesses. A written inventory of items removed from the
 premises must be prepared.
 Since the 1960's, Hungarian authorities have become more
 tolerant with respect to a person's private activities.
 Formal systems for gathering-personal information, such as the
 widespread use of informers and block wardens and overt
 intrusions of the police into daily life, have been
 substantially curtailed.. It is widely assumed, however, that
 the authorities-tap private telephone lines and open
 correspondence when they wish to do so.
 Parents are not discouraged from enrolling their children in
 religious instruction classes. Officially encouraged
 membership in political organizations ceased to be a feature
 of Hungarian life in 1989. Hungarian citizens' ability to
 receive foreign publications is effectively limited only by
 the need for hard-currency funds to pay for subscriptions,
 although new banking regulations make it possible for
 Hungarian citizens to maintain bank accounts denominated in
 Western currencies.
 Hungary does not jam foreign radio broadcasts. Since the
 spring of 1989, accredited Radio Free Europe correspondents
 have regularly covered Hungarian events from within the
 country, and in September Radio Free Europe opened its first
 East European office in Budapest.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The latitude for freedom of expression expanded further in
 1989. In October Parliament passed a law broadening freedom
 of speech. The Government and HSP have virtually no control
 over the press and diminishing influence over radio and
 television. The state media became increasingly free in 19&9
 
 
 1145       -
 HUNGARY
 to raise hitherto hnreported issues,,air opposition views, and
 criticize the Government. An independent press began to
 function. In December the Prime Minister announced he wanted
 to include a law ensuring freedom of the press in the current
 Parliament"s agenda. In the meantime, supervisory boards for
 radio and television were established to select directors.
 The boards include representatives from major sectors of
 society, including opposition parties, and control of the
 nationar radio and television became major public issues.
 The television programs A Het (The Week) and Panorama offer
 searching and relatively balanced examinations of current
 events which are close to West European network quality.
 Opposition spokesmen haVe frequently appeared in radio and
 tel~vision news broadcasts,'although some opposition parties
 charge- that they do not receive sufficient air time. The June
 16 funeral services for former Prime Minister Imre Nagy were
 broadcast live and in full on Hungarian radio and television.
 Wide-ranging interviews were held on official television with
 the'Czechoslovak Communist Party leader in 1968-69, Alexander
 Dubcek, and Romania's ex-King Michael, which %omplicated
 Hungary's relations with neighboring Czechoslovakia and
 Romania.. Despite financial and practical obstacles, a
 virtually independent radio station, Radio Calypso, and a
 television station, NAP-television, were launched.
 Scores of independent and semi-independent newspapers and
 periodicals were launched in Budapest and in several county
 seats, while some county councils continue to retain influence
 over provincial newspapers. Independent publications
 established with the support of major Budapest banks and
 state-owned companies include Mai Nap, Hungary's most
 successful and nominally independent daily paper, financed by,
 among others, the Hungarian Credit Bank, the Hungarian post
 office," and a major paper firm. British publishing magnate
 Robert-Maxwell subsequently acquired 50 percent of the stock.
 Meanwhile; Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch purchased a
 stake in Reform, a weekly illustrated journal featuring news,
 political scandals, and sex.
 By early 1989 censorship of the press and, to an increasing
 degree, radio and television was abandoned. Investigative
 journalism includes probing questions on officials'
 performance. From different ends of the political spectrum,
 conservative Communist officials as well as several opposition
 parties have expressed unhappiness with the editorial
 management of Hungarian television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In January Parliament passed new laws on assembly and
 associations.- The former provides that organizers of public
 gatherings'must give at least 72 hours' notice and that
 assembly shall be unrestricted, with the condition that it
 "shall not result in any crime or call for committing crimes,
 and shdll not harm the rights and freedom'of others." Police
 may also move or alter the times of public meetings which
 would jeopardize the operations of legislative bodies or
 courts or seriously disrupt normal traffic flow. No actual
 permits are required.
 Hundreds of demonstrations and opposition political meetings
 took place in 1989 without any recorded police interference.
 The first of the opposition demonstrations around Budapest was
 the March 15 national holiday commemorating the 1848
 
 
 1146
 1flZNiARX
 Revolution (which included a symbolic takeover of the
 Hungarian Radio-Television building), and the June 16 funeral
 ceremonies for Imre Nagy. Police also allowed a June 15
 demonstration outside the Soviet Embassy chancery by 100 young
 people from the Young Democrats' radical faction and other
 groups calling for Soviet troop withdrawal from Hungary, as
 well as several processions by radical oppositionists during
 the summer along Budapest's Ferenc Munnich Street. The
 radicals objected to the street's name, derived from a
 conservative Communist prime minister, and sought to restore
 the former name with printed signs and paint. Although the
 sites of changed street signs included the back of the
 Interior Ministry building itself, police limited their
 response to charging twa persons for defacing public property
 in removing the old street signs. For these gatherings, as
 well as the June 5 demonstration by young people outside the
 Chinese Embassy, organizers failed to provide the 72 hours,
 notice required by law, and police waived the requirement.
 The new law on association provides that 10 or more people may
 establish associations (identified as "political parties,
 trade unions, mass movements, federated organizations,
 associations, or other organizations"). The law requires that
 exercise of the right of association "shall not commit or abet
 in committing a criminal offense and shall not disturb the
 rights and freedoms of others." Court registration is
 required on the basis of 10 or more founding members, the
 adoption of a constitution, and election of executive
 officers.
 Although Parliament's adoption of the new law on parties came
 only in October, the list of declared political parties
 swelled throughout the year to about 50. Polls indicate that
 6 of these have significant national support. Most of the 50
 are opposition parties although some, such as the Ferenc
 Munnich Society and Workers' Marxist-Leninist Party, represent
 conservative Communist factions. The new parties may
 establish bank accounts, receive assistance from domestic and
 foreign nongovernmental sources, set up headquarters, field
 candidates in parliamentary by-elections, and conduct
 political'campaigns. There have been no apparent efforts to
 restrict these parties, affiliations with international bodies
 or limit their contacts with foreign political parties. For
 example, the U.S. National Democratic Institute sponsored a
 seminar on political campaign strategies in September with
 attendance from a range of Hungarian opposition parties;
 political activists from the United States, Chile, the United
 Kingdom, Poland, and Yugoslavia took part.
 While there were no reports of denials of registrations of
 private organizations during 1989, legal and bureaucratic
 obstacles continue to hinder the establishment of nonprofit
 foundations by private sector economic groups, trade unions,
 and political parties. Norms of accepted political activity
 remain uneven throughout Hungary, and it is still possible
 that activities which would pass without notice in Budapest
 -could generate official sanctions in the countryside or in
 traditional Communist strongholds, like Miskolc.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 
 
 1147
 �HGARY
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of conscience and freedom of religious practice are
 affirmed in -the Constitution, ahd Hungary's control over'
 organized religious activities has virtually been lifted.
 Under -opposition pressure, the Government abolished its State
 Office of Religious Affairs, a Stalinist yestige established
 in 1950 to regulate and control the activities of accepted
 religious denominations. In its place, the Government
 established the National Council of Churches, a consultative
 body,-haired by. the Prime Minister with the participation of
 denominational, leaders.
 The authorities are consulting with religious leaders on a new
 law governing church-state relations, scheduled for
 implementation in 1990.- Although Communist party members and
 teachers were t Zaditionally barred from-religious activity,
 the HSWP Central Committee said in June that religious
 convictions were not incompatible with party membership.
 Despite the tolerant atmosphere, vigorous expression of
 religious beliefs can still inhibit a person's professional
 advancement in some fields.
 All denominations willing -to make minimal concessions to
 governmental authority are recognized in Hungary. They
 include the Roman Catholic Church, Hungariah. Reformed and
 Lutheran Churches, the Jewish community, and, more recently,
 the Nazarenes, Islamic, and Mormon commun1ties, and a small
 Hare Krishna sect. Recognition excludes the Jehovah's
 Witnesses, who on principle reject governmental authority.
 Religiousdenominations generally have good access to
 religious materials, including Bibles and prayer books. The
 dispositti-on of church possessions and properties seized in the
 late3940ts.is under,-discussion, and some schools and other
 propert-ies reverted to church control-in 1989.
 Church-activibiesjn education and social work are encouraged
 by the Goverpment. An-.outstanding issue in church-state
 rel-ptions remains the thousands of so-called "basic
 communities"--small, countercultural, pacifist Catholic
 communities inspired by Piarist Priest Gyorgy Bulanyi. The
 "basic communities" have long operated in defiance of both the
 .Goverjunent and the Catholic Church. In 1989 over 20 religious
 orders banned since 1950 were al-lowed to function again.
 An important irritant in relations between the Hungarian
 Government and-the churches-particularly the Protestant
 fundamentalist .groups which affirm conscientious objection to
 military service--was removed in March when all 73
 conscientious objectors then in jail were released.
 Alternatives to obligatory military service have been
 instituted.for conscientious objectors.
 For-t he first :ime  since -1948,- the reliquary hand of St.
 Stephen W-an carried in the procession around the Catholic
 Basilica in Budapest in services for St. Stephen's Day on
 August 20. During the Mass, Cardinal Paskai referred several
 times to his predecessor, Cardinal Mindszenty, who played a
 role in the 1956 Revolution, became a refugee in the American
 Embassy during 1956-71, and later died in exile. The Vatican
 announced the Popes intention to visit Hungary in 1991, and
 the-Prime Minister expressed readiness to begin negotiations
 to reestablish diplomatic relations between Hungary and the
 Vatican, which were severed in 1946.
 
 
 1148
 Reverend Billy Graham on July 29 addressed a capacity crowd of
 90,000 at Budapest's People's Stadium. With the Government's
 agreement, Reverend Graham's address was announced with
 posters and newspaper and television advertisements.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an identity booklet which they
 should carry at all times. They must register with local
 police when moving from one locality to another. However, no
 permission is required for movement within Hungary, except to
 Budapest, where housing shortages have led the Government to
 restrict the number of new inhabitants.
 Operation of the new passport law which came into effect on
 January 1, 1988 has made foreign travel available on demand to
 virtually any Hungarian. Hungarian passports are valid for 5
 years from the date of issuance for travel to any country for
 a period of 90 days.
 No cases were reported in 1989 in which a person was denied a
 passport for transparently political reasons, although
 passport issuance is withheld for cause, including pending
 legal actions. According to Interior Ministry statistics,
 3,552,804 new "World Passports" were issued in 1988, with
 8,205 refusals for all reasons, and 1,173,925 "World
 Passports" were issued in the first 6 months of 1989, with
 4,945 refusals for all reasons. Hungarians have become
 travelers. According to tourist authority statistics,
 Hungary's 10.6 million citizens made 9.9 million trips abroad
 in the first 8 months of 1989.
 In a new law on emigration and immigration, Parliament
 provided for the repeal of statutes mandating fines of up to
 $90 and denial of tourist passports for 2 years to those who
 overstayed their authorized 90-day periods abroad without
 seeking extensions from Hungarian consular officials abroad.
 Senior Interior Ministry officials stated in September that
 these sanctions were being waived pending formal entry into
 force of the new legislation. The new law establishes that it
 is the fundamental right of Hungarian citizens, for whatever
 reason, to emigrate from Hungary and return. The law limits
 emigration by persons who are facing criminal c1targes for
 crimes punishable by more than 3 years' imprisonment and other
 reasons, including possession of state secrets. This last
 provision may delay departure for 3 years from the date of
 ceasing to possess state secrets and, along with the other
 restrictions, is subject to appeal before a court.
 The new law specifically guarantees the right of every
 qualified Hungarian residing abroad to resettle in Hungary.
 The authorities, recent behavior in this respect has been
 convincing. Visitors who took part in the June 16 funeral of
 Imre Nagy included numerous 1956 exiles headed by General Bela
 Kiraly whose forces fought against the Red Army. The criminal
 records of many who participated in the 1956 uprising have
 been expunged. There is currently no reason to expect that
 any group of returnees would face political persecution in
 Hungary.
 Since early 1988, Hungary has given refuge to over 30,000
 people from Romania, mainly ethnic Hungarians, although the
 recent flow has included substantial percentages of ethnic
 Romanians. A nationwide system administered by local
 
 
 1149
 HUNGARX
 authggities assists all refugees, including nonethnic
 Hungarians, to find jobs and housing.
 In.j4arch Hungary became the first Warsaw Pact country to
 adhere.to the,1951.U..N. Convention on the Status of Refugees
 and the 1967-Addition'l Protocol, which obliges Hungary not to
 expel or involuntarily repatriate refugees.to countries in
 which, they have.awell-grounded fear of persecution. The last
 documepted case of an official effort to repatriate refugees
 involuntarily to Romanie-.was in January, and it involved three
 menwho-had repeatedly sought to cross the Austrian border
 illegally. The.Prime Minister overruled the repatriation
 order. Uowpver, before Ceausescu's overthrow in Romania in
 December, undocumented reports persisted that Hungarian
 authbrities on the Romanian-border continued-to repatriate
 involuntarily some-would-be refugees on the basis ot local
 decisiQns not subject to appeal. These were said to include
 some ethnic Romanians, Gypsies, unaccompanied minors, couples
 leaving minor children behind in Romania, and persons
 suspected of having.been sent-to Hungary by the Romanian
 secret police. Since December, the Hungarian-Government has
 worked closely with the new Romanian Government in preventing
 members of Ceausescu's secret, police from fleeing to Hungary.
 During 1989 Hungary also began to receive a limited number of
 refugees from'the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. An office
 of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) opened in-
 Budapest in October in a major effort to assist the large
 numbers of Romanians-present. On.May 6, the Hungarian army
 began-to dismantle the barbed wire and electrified fences of
 the:-ioncurtain" border with Austria. In September
 Hungarys-commitment to the Helsinki Accords and the U.N.
 Convention on the Status of Refugees was demonstrated by the
 Government's decision to suspend the terms of a bilateral
 agreement with the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and open
 the Hungarian-Austrianborder to over 50,000 East Germans who
 refused toreturn.to the GDR voluntarily so that they could
 resettle in the,.FRG.:        "
 Section 3 -Respect for Political Rights: -The Right ofCitizens
 -   to Change Their Government     "
 During. 1989 the reform leadership of the nominally ruling
 Communist party-(since October, the Socialist party)
 repeatedly committed itself to the transition to a democratic
 multiparty system. Hungary is no longer a recognizable.
 one-partyeCommunist state, and, if current trends persist,
 there will be further fundamental changes in the political
 system in 1990. Citizens may well be able, under the law, to
 change the system of government and their political leaders.
 Communists lost-ifour multiparty parliamentary elections since
 July to Hungarian Democratic-Forum candidates,.Hungary's most
 influential opposition party.
 In May the HSWP Central Committee stripped former secretary
 general'(1956-1988) Janos Kadar of all party positions,
 including that of party president. In June it elected a
 four-member Presidium headed by party Chairman Rezso Nyers.
 In October the party congress voted to dissolve the party.
 Its successor, the Hungarian Socialist Party, excluded Karoly
 Grosz, former secretary general (1988-89) and prime minister,
 from its 24-member Presidium.-
 
 
 1150
 HUNG~ARY
 Negotiations between the Government and Opposition Roundtable
 (a group of eight opposition parties) from June to September
 resulted in a limited accord clearing the way for multiparty
 elections. The September 18 document, signed by Rezso Nyers
 and Imre Pozsgay on behalf of the Communist party, concluded
 that the talks "served to create the political and legal
 conditions for peaceful transition, to develop a democratic
 constitutional state on the'basis of a multiparty system, and
 to extricate the nation from its social and economic crisis."
 The opposition parties which signed the accord claimed
 important progress in securing the departure of party units
 from workplaces, reducing the Communist party's paramilitary
 Workers' Militia and bringing it under military control, and
 promoting the depoliticization of the military and judiciary.
 The Association of Free Democrats and the Young Democrats
 (FIDESZ) neither signed nor vetoed the accord because of
 objections to holding direct presidential elections before the
 multiparty parliamentary elections.
 The Free Democrats and FIDESZ launched a campaign to hold a
 national referendum on November 26. The referendum confirmed
 overwhelming popular support for political changes already
 undertaken (e.g., withdrawal of party units from workplaces,
 disclosure of Communist party assets, and disbanding of the
 Workers' Militia), but only a razor-thin majority voted in
 favor of delaying the Presidential election until after the
 March 1990 Parliamentary elections.
 Voting was compulsory until the 1960's and was subsequently
 officially encouraged, but low turnouts have been a feature of
 recent by-elections. Suffrage is universal, and election is
 by secret ballot. Polling places were monitored, and ballots
 were counted by local officials together with representatives
 of the Communist party and opposition parties.
 Parliamentary elections take place every 5 years. Nearly 50
 percent (176 of 386) of the members of the new Parliament will
 be chosen on the basis of individual local candidacies, with
 152 chosen by proportional representation within each of the
 19 counties and Budapest, and 58 chosen on the basis of
 national proportional representation. In elections based on
 individual candidacies, the winner must obtain a majority of
 votes from a 50-plus percent turnout or, failing that, a
 plurality from a 25-plus percent turnout in the second round.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1989 Hungary was not the subject of any resolutions,
 investigations, or other actions by international or
 recognized nongovernmental organizations dealing with human
 rights. However, Hungary cosponsored a United Nations human
 rights resolution calling for a special rapporteur for Romania
 to investigate the treatment of ethnic Hungarians in
 Transylvania.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In theory and practice, Hungary is sensitive to the cultural
 aspirations of its recognized ethnic minorities. Schools
 provide instruction in the mother tongue, and varieties of
 ethnic expression are encouraged.on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. A major reason for this policy is the hope of creating
 
 
 1151
 HUNGARY
 a "demonstration effect" which will indirectly benefit the
 millions of Hungarians living as minorities in adjacent
 countries.
 Hungary has gome 500,000 people, or about 5 percent of the
 population, who -dentify themselves as-Gypsies. Athough they
 are not recognized as an official minority, the Government has
 various programs designed to raise their standard of living
 and promote their absorption into the mainstream of Hungarian
 life., Gypsies are, on the average, considerably less educated
 and poorer than the majority Magyar populaition or the
 recognized ethnic minorities. Male Gypsy life expectancy--55
 years--is 8 years below the national average for males. Half
 of Gypsy school-leavers fail to complete the minimum eight
 grad~es; Gypsies reportedly account for over half of Hungary's
 unemployed; and the crime rate is nearly twice as high among
 Gypsies as non-Gypsies. Media reporting of Gypsy issues makes
 clear that there is abundait.popular prejudice against them
 and that they suffer effectiv6'discrimination in housing and
 jobs. Gypsies have eslablished a number of rights
 organiza'tions, including the Cultural Federation of Hungarian
 Gypsies, established in 1986.
 The year saw an 'important revival of Jewish cultural life with
 the foundation of the Raoul Wallenberg Society,-the Jewish
 Cultural Association, and the Iles Monus Association. The
 Jewish Cultural Association is a grouping of young Jewish
 intellectuals who are in opposition to the Jewish-community's
 established leadership. The Iles Monus Association, named
 after a JeWi~sh Social Democrat V1ho died in a German death
 camp, seeks to cooperate withthe political left in Israel,
 including trade unions, cooperatives, and kibbutzes.
 Manifestations of anti-Semitic sentiments during the-year were
 criticifzed by the Communist party and government leadership.
 Isria6li leaders, including the Prime Minister and Foreign
 Ministof, visited Hungary in 1989, and in September Hungary
 becard the first of the Warsaw Pact countries which broke
 diplqnlatic ielations with Israel in 1967 to restore full
 relations.
 Women._enjoy the same legal rights as men and benefit from a
 good national system of child-care facilities. Inheritance
 and property rights of women are identical to those for men.
 'he women':s movement is in its infancy. The first feminist
 group, a chapter of the Democratic Trade Union of Scientific
 Workers, was established in Szdged in September. According to
 Hungarian feminists, wife beating is common in society,
 .especially among lower income groups. Husbands' sexual abuse
 of wives is not-an acknowledged legal concept. Rapes are
 frequently 'unreported. There were 321 convictions for rape in
 1988; the crime'is a felony, and punishment is from 2 to 8
 year " imprisonment or from 5 to 10 years in cases involving
 "criminal partnership."
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Legal norms and actual practice in the organization of trade
 unions continue to be in flux. The official trade union
 organization, SZOT; remains under pressure from several
 directions. As the traditional "conveyor belt" for securing
 worker c6dpliance with central economic planning, SZOT remains

 the nominal representative of Hungary's 4.5 million actively
 employed persons through its 19 affiliated unions.-
 During 1989 it sought to refurbish its- image as defender of
 workers' interests through means such as a national warning
 strike in August to protest a 6-percent meat price increase.
 The warning strike and similar tactics were denoenced by the
 independent unions and characterized by reform Communist Prime
 Minister Miklos Nemeth as "social demagoguery." While SZOT's
 relations with the country's Prime Minister and other reform
 Communists are strained, the institutional links with the
 ruling party remain. SZOT remains affiliated with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Hungary's first independent trade union, a grouping of
 scientific and technical workers (TDDSZ) formed in 1988, has
 been joined by democratic unions of teachers, film workers,
 teachers of the handicapped, ambulance drivers and
 pharmacists, railway workers, and building maintenance
 workers. Also, there are independent local unions of
 transport cooperatives (bus drivers), and a small blue-collar
 union, Workers' Solidarity, which has some 3,000 members.
 These unions are independent of the Government, the Communist
 party, and SZOT. In April the Democratic League of
 Independent Trade Unions was formally established to
 coordinate the work of independent unions; representatives
 took part in the June-September negotiations between the
 Communist party and the Opposition Roundtable. Several SZOT
 branch unions and locals, including the official Film Workers'
 Union, work cooperatively with the independent unions.
 Together with the double-affiliated SZOT branch unions,
 Hungary's independent unions have over 40,000 members. They
 have contacts with Western Europe's Christian-Socialist
 unions, Poland's Solidarity, the American Federation of Labor
 and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the World
 Confederation of Labor. Two of the independent unions have
 affiliated to an ICFTU-associated International Trade
 Secretariat (ITS), and there have also been contacts between
 SZOT branch unions and other ITS's. There is no legal
 impediment to these affiliations.
 Strike legislation adopted by Parliament in March authorizes
 strikes if conciliation procedures have broken down. Strikes
 are excluded: if workers' complaints are under legal
 adjudication; if the objective is to alter a currently valid
 collective labor contract; or if the strike would "threaten
 life, health, bodily safety, or the environment in a direct
 and serious manner, or hinder disaster relief efforts." The
 law specifically authorizes solidarity strikes. The right to
 strike is denied to members of the judiciary, military
 personnel, and the police. In addition to the national
 warning strike mentioned above, several small-scale strikes
 occurred in 1989.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The end of Hungary's system of centrally mandated wages became
 effective in January when the Government implemented a system
 of "interest coordination," in which labor and management
 negotiate specific wages in individual enterprises based on
 government suggestions, which are backed up with tax
 incentives. The new system thus provides for a limited
 element of collective bargaining. Managers have some

 flexibility in job categorization and in payment of
 allowances, which also gives importance to worker-management
 discussions in individual enterprises. There is some evidence
 that employers consult representatives of independent unions
 as well as those of SZOT in individual workplaces. While
 experience is lacking, there are no apparent safeguards
 against antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members and organizers. The 1989 strike law rules out
 punitive measures against employees who take part in strikes.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Hungary took a step forward when Parliament in 1989 repealed
 the so-called Parasitism Statute of the penal code, which
 provided for sanctions against persons lacking visible means
 of support who were convicted of refusing to work twice within
 2 years. Possible punishments included a year's imprisonment,
 .reformatory work, a fine, or expulsion to another part of the
 country. More than 2,000 people were convicted under the
 Parasitism Statute in 1987. Gypsies were prosecuted under the
 law, but there was no evidence of its use against political
 dissidents.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 15 years. There are no
 reports of significant abuses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Hungarian workplaces are obligated under law to provide
 workers with safe working conditions, a hot meal at heavily
 subsidized prices, and such pay-related benefits as overtime.
 The Government guarantees all Hungarians the right to 15 days
 of paid vacation per year and 1 additional day for each 3
 years of service. The minimum wage is equivalent to $66 per
 month at the official exchange rate, which is not sufficient
 to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and his
 family.
 The State in principle provides most workers with free
 education, health care, and pensions, but in reality the
 standard of such services is declining. The average official
 workweek is approximately 45 hours, although most Hungarians
 supplement their incomes by working after hours in
 cooperatives and private second jobs. Many must do so in
 order to provide a minimal standard of living for their
 families. The Government sets occupational health and safety
 standards, but safety conditions in Hungarian firms are not up
 to the standards of Western industrialized countries.
