 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is ruled by President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who in 1979
 as Vice Minister of Defense, overthrew his uncle Francisco Macias, the ruthless dic-
 tator of the country from its independence in 1968. As the country's most senior
 military officer, Brigadier General Obiang dominates both the military and civilian
 branches of the State. Throughout the 1980's he strengthened his position, notably
 by establishing in 1986 the sole legal political party, the Democratic Party of Equa-
 torial Guinea (DPEG), and staging in 1989 the first presidential election since 1968,
 in which, as the only candidate, he was elected to a 7-year term. Responding to
 rowing international and domestic pressures. In a November 1991 referendum,
 Obiang submitted to the electorate a new constitution, the text of which was not
 made readily available to the public, but which, according to the Government, was
 approved by 98.38 percent of those voting. While providing for a multiparty system,
 the new Constitution was on balance probably a step backwards for individual lib-
 erties because it did not provide protections against torture and arbitrary arrest,
 and it entrenched presidential powers and specifically granted Obiang lifetime im-
 munity from any legal proceedings.
 At the beginning of 1992, Obiang promulgated laws allowing opposition political
 parties and providing amnesty for political offenders. The DPEG was exempted from
 the stringent registration requirements under the political parties law. Following
 months of government manipulation of the registration process, only 6 of some 12
 opposition parties operating in Equatorial Guinea were "provisionally" registered by
 September.
 Civilian and military security branches are responsible for public order, aug-
 mented by a presidential guard of 400 to 600 men provided by Morocco. The Moroc-
 can Guard, which has been deployed to Equatorial Guinea for 13 years to provide
 protection to the President, continues to be the security cornerstone of the Obiang
 regime. In the past, the Guard has been credibly reported to be engaged in the
 abuse of detainees, although this practice seems to have stopped. Equatorial Guin-
 ean security forces historically have committed the majority ofhuman rights abuses,
 re po rtedy often at the behest of senior government officials, who commonly have
 led raids against the opposition and directed torture and interrogation sessions.
 Equatorial Guinea's tot al miitary expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the
 US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analaysis, were
 between $1 million and $5 million. Defense expenditures in 1992 were likely signifi-
 cantly higher as new security formations were organized and more extensive inter-
 nal security operations undertaken.
 Equatorial Cuineans live mainly by subsistence agriculture, hunting, and fishing.
 The small wage economy is based mainly on cocoa, lumber, and coffee. A very smal
 elite class has emerged in recent years, largely employed by, or dependent on, the
 Government. Its apparent wealth is far beyond government salaries and, according
 to many reports, may be derived in large part from corruption. The country remains
 heavily dependent on foreign aid.
 Human rights continued to be tightly circumscribed in 1992. Despite the laws on
 political parties and amnesty, President Obiang's Government blocked many opposi-
 tion parties from registering while repressing opponents of the regime. Security
 forces arrested scores of political opponents in the course of the year, beating and
 
 
 79
 torturing many of them-at least 250 persons--without judicial sanction and raided
 and sacked the offices of several of the political parties. The amnesty law allowed
 some exiles to return and freed most political prisoners, but it extended more pro-
 tection to violators of human rights than to their victims.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-While there were no known targeted
 political or extra udicial killings in 1992, two persons were killed in a summary
 manner by members of the national security force. The first killing took place in
 late October in Bata and the second a month later in Malabo. No penalty was ap-
 parently imposed on the perpetrator of the first killing, a security force member was
 executed following a summary trial by a military tribunal for the second.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or De.qroding Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police and other security forces continued routinely to administer torture and other
 cruel forms of mistreatment to prisoners. Authorities employed a wide variety of
 techniques, including, severe beatings with sticks, rubber truncheons, and whips;
 electric shocks; hanging victims by their feet or arms; the infamous "Ethiopian"
 trussing and suspension from an iron bar, and "Chinese water torture." Physical as
 well as psychological torture was used routinely as an aid in interrogation and to
 intimidate and punish prisoners. Police often detained known or suspected opposi-
 tion supporters only long enough to administer a beating. Punishments of 50 or 75
 strokes with a wood or rubber nightstick on the soles of the feet, back, buttocks,
 or other parts of the body were common.
 In February the police rounded up approximately 40 members of the youth group
 of the Social Liberal Christian Democratic Party for holding an alleged "illegal meet-
 ing." Before being released the same day, police beat the members with night sticks
 at security headquarters in Malabo under the supervision of senior police officers.
 Also in February, Captain Fausto Abeso Puma (alias Tito Garriga), President
 Obiang's son-in-law, and a squad of armed security agents under his command ar-
 rested and publicly beat Placido Miko Alog, a member of the Convergence for Social
 Democracy. Police suspected Miko of printing and disributing an antigovernment
 newspaper defaming the President. He was later severely tortured by security forces
 on the orders of President Obiang's brother, Armengol Ondo Nguema, Director Gen-
 eral of National Security. Although in severe pain from body and internal injuries,
 Miko received no professional medical attention despite pleas by his family and the
 international community.
 In Auust police detained four members of the Party of Progress and beat them
 with nightsticks. In September security forces under the command of the Secretary
 of State for National Security, Manuel Nguema Mba, and the Director of National
 Security Armengol Ondo Nguema, raided the headquarters of the Party of Progress
 (PP) in Malabo, arrested 22 of its members, and seized the party's files and mem-
 bership lists. The authorities subsequently detained at least another 10 party mem-
 bers and beat them with nightsticks at security headquarters and in Blackbeach
 Prison in Malabo. Reliable sources reported that Armengol Ondo Nguema, Manuel
 Nguema Mba, and police captain Francisco Edu Ngua supervised the beatings, and
 that Minister-Secretary General Ricardo Mangue was present at security head-
 quarters during these brutal punishments. Of those detained, Pablo Ndong Nsema,
 a former commissioner of police, reportedly was additionally tortured by being
 burned by electric cables applied to his stomach area. Similarly, the police beat six
 members of the Popular Union Party (UP) who were detained briefly in October.
 Police beatings of approximately 100 persons-students, educators and priests-
 detained on December 17 included repeated torture sessions over several days with
 punishment per session often exceeding 100 strokes with a meter-long rubber trun-
 cheon. The torture was carried out under the immediate supervision of senior gov-
 ernment authorities, including Secretary of State for National Security Manuel
 Nguema Mba and Director of National Security Armengol Ondo Nguema. Closely co-
 ordinating the detentions and summary punishments were Secretary of State in the
 Presidency Ricardo Mangue Obama Nfube, Minister of Interio Julio Ndong Ela
 Mangue, Minister of Mines and Petroleum Juan Olo Mba Nzeng, Secretary General
 in the Ministr of Foreign Affairs Luis Obiang Mangue and the Equatoguinean Di-
 rector of the World Bank's major in-country program Guillermo Nguema Ela. In one
 case, a torture victim received as many as 500-600 strokes during the course of the
 night of December 17-18; he was given injections to revive him and numb the pain,
 according to eyewitnesses. Cold water was thrown on other prisoners to revive those
 who sasRed out durina beatinus. At least six detainees--Roman Catholic oriest Luis

 Maria Ondo Mayie U.N. Development Program employee Arsenio Mom Malonga,
 political activists delestino Bacale Obiang and Santos Pascual Bikomo, and edu-
 cational authorities Daniel Nguema and Julian Bibang Oye-received internal inju-
 ries which competent medical sources reported could be life threatening as a result
 of the beatin      cre
 Prison conitions continued to be extremely harsh. Basic amenities were rarely
 provided, and prisoners' essential needs were largely supplied by their families or
 friends. The Government is reported to provide only a single loaf of bread per pris-
 oner per day. There was almost no access to medical treatment for common ill-
 nesses, such as endemic malaria or following torture sessions. As of July family
 members carrying food to political detainees at Blackbeach prison were required to
 show proof of membership in the government party in order to enter the presi-
 dential compound where the prison facility is located.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite the right of habeas corpus and
 other constitutional protections, the authorities often make arrests without judicial
 order and without regard to the individual's rights to be charged or released within
 a reasonable period of time, to have access to a lawyer, or to be released on bail.
 Arbitrary arrests by security forces or poice are ommon p lace and often based on
 spurious charges in order to extort money, harass political opponents, or gain per-
 sonal revenge. Many detainees are held incommunicado.
 Civiians are often detained in miitary camps as was the case of the 31 persons
 arrested following the attack on the Party of Progress offices. Security authorities
 also detained an unknown number of military personnel whose names were found
 on PP membership lists at these military camps m Malabo.
 Security forces arrested Jose Antonio Dorronsoro Ekuta in February and Celestino
 Bacale Obiang and Jose Luis Nvumba Manana in April. All are associates of Placido
 Miko Alogo. Dorronsoro was released within a few days without being charged
 Bacale Obiang and Nvumba were detained for several weeks and, with Placido
 Miko, were charged with slandering state authorities and institutions. Miko was
 held nearly 4 months at Blackbeach Prison, without havi been tried for "insulting
 the Head of State." All were amnestied in June in honor of President Obian's 5th
 birthday celebrations. Two other dissidents, Fernando Abaga Edjang and Arsenio
 Moro Malonga, avoided arrest by remaining in the offices of an international organi-
 zation where they are employed.
 Security forces arrested approximately 42 members of the UP, a legally registered
 political party, in Ebebiyin and Micomeseng in July and detained them for several
 weeks at Bata without charge. At least 5 members of the UP were arrested in late
 October.
 The number of detainees, political as well as criminal, held at the end of 1992
 was not known but likely was between 150 and 200. The Government refused to
 provide figures and did not permit third parties to inspect prison conditions in 1992.
 The regional delegate for the International Committee for the Red Crss (ICRC)
 made three visits to the country during 1992; discussions are still under way for
 a possible visitation pro ,gram. Antonio Ebang Mbele Abang, former Vice President
 of the Chamber of People's Representation detained in 1991, was released in early
 1992.
 In 1992 the Government continued to use internal exile (banishment to home vil-
 lages) as a technique to intimidate dissidents and keep the grwing opposition oft
 balance. In January political detainee Pedro Motu Mamiaga O naaformer army
 lieutenant, was released after 13 months in solitary confinement in Blackbeach Pris-
 on without charge or judicial proceedings. A few weeks later, Motu was again de-
 tained without warrant or charge and sent to internal exile in his home village near
 Ebebiyin, Rio Muni.
 Several prominent opposition figures returned to Equatorial Guinea in 1992, often
 after years in exile, and began political activity. Among these was Sever Moto Nsa,
 who had been denied a passport to return in 1991. Although he was notj ailed, Mot
 was harassed by security forces, and during 1992 at least 40 of his supporters were
 arrested and the majority~ tortured. Another former exile, Benjamin Ballingha
 Belinga, the leader of a legally recognized opposition party, spent several weeks in
 Blackbeach Prison on a civil charge related to a commerial debt. Also returning
 from 4 years in exile was Carmelo Modu Akuse Bindang, founder and Secretary
 General of the Democratic Social Union. Two Brazilians who accompanied Modu on
 his December 27 return as political advisors were refused entry into the country de-
 spite having valid visas.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriL-There is a formal court structure, with the Su-
 preme Court at the apex, and also military and customary (traditional) court sys-
 tems. Traditional laws and customs are honored in the formal court system when
 not in conflict with national law. The tribunal provided for in the Constitution to
 
 
 decide constitutional issues has never been established; in the meantime, the Coun-
 cil of State appointed by the President and responsible to him is empowered to rule
 on constitutional questions.
 There is no separation between the executive and the judiciary, and Supreme
 Court justices serve at the pleasure of the President. The executive branch acts with
 little respect or understanding for judicial independence. The nation's mixture of
 traditional law, military law, and Spanish rules and procedures combines to produce
 an inconsistent system of justice. Judges and court officials are poorly trained.
 There is little application of due process, and appellate proceedings are virtually
 nonexistent. Defendants unable to afford legal counsel stand little cance of acquit-
 tal. Further, most of the few lawyers (approximately 30) in the country depend on
 their connections to the Government for a livelihood, which raises questions about
 the impartiality of the defense their clients might receive.
 The Government appears to use charges of "kong" (traditional witchcraft which
 is .believed to cause injury or death) to jail those suspected of engaging in proscribed
 political activity as well as to gain personal revenge. Since the statutes of Equa-
 torial Guinea do not refer to witchcraft, such cases are reportedly handled outside
 the normal court system.
 The number of political and security prisoners held at the end of 1992 was not
 known, but throughout the year it ranged from a handful to as high as 100-a sig-
 nificant number in a population of 350,000. In January the four persons remaining
 in prison from an alleged 1988 coup plot, Joaquin Elema Borenque, Francisco
 Bonifacio Mba Nguema, Gaspar Manana Okiri, and Pedro Bakale Maye, were freed
 under provisions of the amnesty law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though required by the Constitution, search warrants are not normally used. The
 Government sometimes places under surveillance persons it deems suspicious. Many
 believe telephone conversations are routinely monitored. There seems to be no delib-
 erate, routine interference with correspondence, but security forces try to prevent
 distribution of printed materials unfavorable to the Government. Placido Miko's ar-
 rest in February was initiated after a sealed letter was taken from a traveler about
 to board an aircraft for Spain. Security agents in May confiscated several boxes of
 information consigned to the Party of Progress on their arrival in Malabo by air
 from Spain and reportedly burned them without judicial process or indemnification.
 Virtually all political parties reported confiscation of party material, including office
 supplies and equipment, at the time they were legally imported into the country.
 Most were reportedly not returned, despite payment of import duties.
 The government harassment of its political opponents also took the form of sum-
 mary dismissals from government employment and evictions from government-
 owned housing. Juan Manene, leader of the Social Liberal Christian Democratic
 Party, was evicted from government-owned housing in April and fired from his job
 at the state telephone company in July. Manene and his wife fled the country. Min-
 istry of Foreign Affairs official Terencio Luis Ngundi Ebule was summarily dis-
 missed from his job in October after he was denounced by two colleagues for being
 disrespectful of dhe Head of State, including not having a picture hanging in his of-
 fice. He was beaten in police custody and in November tried and found guilty; he
 paid a $200 fine in lieu of serving an additional 4 months in prison.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-It was still dangerous to criticize President
 Obiang or his Government in 1992. Security forces arrested persons suspected of
 distributing an opposition newspaper. At least one person, Maria de Pilar Manana,
 was violently arrested by senior police officers in June for possession of an under-
 ground newspapr; despite serious medical problems, she was held without charge
 at Blackbea   Prison for over 2 months. Those who criticized the Government could
 be charged with slandering the Head of State, other officials, or institutions. The
 Government has a monopoly on television and radio and routinely denies its oppo-
 nents access to the media, except in carefully controlled situations. The Government
 and party did not publish editions of their newspapers in 1992, and the Government
 has not issued an edition of the official gazette for over 2 years. No private news-
 papers were registered, and no foreign newspapers or magzines were available for
 sale. A press law promulgated in Ocober, but still not publicly available at the end
 of the year, institutionalized the Government's absolute control over all written
 media and press agencies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Despite constitutional provi-
 sions guaranteeing these freedoms, the Government continued to require opposition
 political organizations to obtain permission from security forces before holding pub-
 ic meetings. and there were cases of onnositinn lesdprq arrPOtPe f F n,*flrtin t.;no
 
 
 82
 in political meetings in private homes. For the first time in over 20 years, the Gov-
 ernment allowed approximately 10 rallies by legal opposition parties in 1992, at
 which speakers criticized the Government. Despite requests from political parties,
 there were no public meetings permitted during the last 3 months of the year, with
 the exception of those of the government party, whose rallies and meetings were
 near daily fare in the media and on television broadcasts. Private nonpolitical
 groups, such as professional organizations, churches, and sports groups, require gov-
 ernment approval to hold meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--Christianity, mainly Roman Catholicism, is the predomi-
 nant religion, often interspersed with traditional religious practices. Except for Je-
 hovah's Witnesses, freedom of religion is generally tolerated, though ministers of re-
 ligion are prohibited by law from criticizing government officials or institutions. Je-
 hovah's Witnesses are officially prohibited from practicing their religion, but do so
 unofficially in a low-key manner. The Islamic and Bahai faiths are also practiced
 openly. In general, active proselytizing by Protestant denominations is discouraged,
 but conversions are permitted. Government permission must be obtained to open
 new places of worship. Foreign clergy and missionaries continue to have an active
 role in educational development. All denominations are allowed to participate in
 charitable as well as religious activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and residents of Equatorial Guinea are not free to travel freely
 within the country. All persons traveling between the island of Bioko, where Malabo
 is located, and the continental portion of the country must pass through police con-
 trol. Police, who are poorly paid and trained, often extort small payments for pas-
 sage through traffic checkpoints on major roads. There were instances in 1992 of
 opposition party members being refused passage on the government-owned ship
 Acacio Mane Ela. There are restrictions on travel abroad, including lengthy delays
 in obtaining passports. To leave the country both citizens and residents of Equa-
 torial Guinea must obtain exit permits which are issued only with the approva] of
 the Secretary of State or Director for kational Security. Several known dissidents
 were refused exit permits in 1992; others had their passports held for months at
 a time with no action taken on exit visas. In at least one case the pregnant wife
 of an opposition member was delayed for several weeks from leaving the country
 for medical attention abroad which could not be obtained in Equatorial Guinea.
 Many Equatguineans leave the country without formal documentation for both eco-
 nomic and political reasons. The Government refused to consider a request from for-
 eign embassies to permit air evacuation of several of the more serious  injured vic-
 tims of police beatings following the December 17 mass detentions and torture, de-
 spite the absence of modern diagnostic equipment in the country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The people of Equatorial Guinea do not have the right to change their government
 by democratic means. There have been no free elections since 1968, and President
 Obiang's party, DPEG, still completely dominates the political system, although it
 is no long-er the sole legal party. Government and p arty are indistinguishable, with
 the DPEG receiving dues from all government employees and full backing from tele-
 vision and radio. All public and government meetings, including those of congress
 and the courts, take place under the party as well as the national flag. The legisla-
 ture is subordinate to the executive and has no independent authority all governors
 are appointed and removed by the President; all locally elected officials serve at the
 pleasure of the President as well.
 Although the Government introduced a multiparty  olitiical system in 1991 and
 legally recognized six opposition parties in 1992, it avoided recognizing at least two
 others which applied for legalization in October. During 1992 all pposition political
 groupings reported harassment, including detentions, by government officials.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The government-appointed Human Rights Commission continued to be an instru-
 ment of the President. It only held two meetings in 1992, without seriously address-
 ing human rights issues.
 President Obiang rejected the report on human rights in Equatorial Guinea pre-
 pared for the United Nations Human Rights Commission by Special Rapporteur
 Fernando Volio Jimenez, referring to Jimenez as a "known enemy of Equatorial
 Guinea." The report detailed political detentions and torture in the country's pris-
 ons, based on the Special Rapperteur's trip to Equatorial Guinea late in 1991. After
 publicly stating in November 1991 that he would welcome advice on a democratic
 
 
 transition from former Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez Obiang did not issue
 a letter of invitation until mid-April and had it delivered to the Spanish statesman
 only in mid-May. Following Suarez' trip to Equatorial Guinea in late May, Obiang
 sharply reected Suarez' advice and twice refused to grant Suarez' plane landing
 rights in Equatorial Guinea. In 1992 the Government did not respond to Amnesty
 International reports that it continued to torture prisoners and to detain political
 opponents outside the judicial process.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Although the law calls for equal treatment for all citizens, ethnic groups are not
 granted the same rights and privileges. The Fang comprise 75 to 80 percent of the
 population, the Bubi 15 percent, and other groups the remainder. A small number
 of Fang clans, especially those of the President and his relatives by marriage, domi-
 nate virtually all aspects of government, military, commercial, and social life. Dis-
 crimination against the Bubi and Fernandino of Bioko Island, as well as the Ndowe
 and associated coastal groups on the continent, is consistent, whether in the grant-
 ing of political office and civil service positions, or in the approval of academic schol-
 arships. Members of the Fang who are not from the President's clan or region also
 widely contend that they are discriminated against as well. There are, however,
 members of minority groups in positions of political prominence but with little real
 authority. A Bubi was appointed Prime Minister in January, replacing another
 Bubi; the President of the House of People's Representatives is a member of the
 Benga ethnic group from the island of Corisco; and virtually all ethnic groups were
 represented in the Cabinet.
 Women are largely confined by custom to traditional roles, especially in agri-
 culture. Polygyny, which is widespread among the Fang, contributes to the second-
 ary status given to women in society. According to the Government, boys and girls,
 once they gain admission to secondary school, are equally likely to complete that
 schooling. However, according to recent U.N. data, females in Equatorial Guinea re-
 ceive only one-fifth as much schooling as males. The Constitution and laws guaran-
 tee equal rights for women, and there is no legal discrimination in employment. The
 Ministry for the Promotion of Women focuses on agriculture, handicrafts, and pro-
 fessional training. It is interested in developing women's agricultural cooperatives
 and enrolling more women in the school of professional traimng in Malabo.
 According to medical professionals, violence against women, particularly wife
 beating, is common. Child abuse is uncommon. The Government has not ad   ad
 violence as an issue and looks to the Ministry for the Promotion of Women to ad-
 vance the interests of women in Equatorial Guinean society.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers do not have the right of free association,
 although a law governing unions was under consideration in 1992. In the small
 Wage economy, there are a few cooperatives with limited power, but there are no
 labor organizations as such. The right to strike is guaranteed in the Constitution,
 but there is no implementing legislation, and strikes are prohibited by law. An at-
 tempt by teachers to strike in support of an incarcerated colleague who had been
 detained for longer than the 72 hours permitted by law resulted in the widespread
 arrest of at least 100 students, teachers, political activists, and priests on December
 17.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation regard-
 ing these    ts or addressing antiunion discrimination and no evidence of collective
 bargaining by any group. Wages are set by the Government and employers, with
 little or no input by workers. The employer must meet the minimum wage set by
 the Government, and most companies pay above the government-established mim-
 mum.
 There are no export processing or free trade zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor and slavery are pro-
 hibited by law, and slavery does not exist in Equatorial Guinea. However, persons
 serving sentences or detained without formal charges at Blackbeach Prison, security
 headquarters in Malabo, and the police station in Luba were forced to do day labor
 on the grounds of the presidential compound as well as on the farms, at residential
 construction sites, and in businesses of senior government officials, including the
 President.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 16, but there is no enforcement of this law. Children younger than 16
 commonly assist families with agricultural production and sales. They also comprise
 a significant part of the sales force in the informal economy as street vendors and
 in the gublic markets.
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is only a small industrial sector in the
 country. Salaried employment is provided mainly by the Government, but also by
 a few construction companies and businesses furnishing retail goods and services
 and by the plantation agricultural sector. The minimum wage law is not widely en-
 forced by the Ministry of Labor and government employees are exempted from its
 pro vions. The mi*mum wage ty itself does not provide a worker and family with
 a decent living, and most of those with regular salaried income must supplement
 their earnings with income from other sources or by farming. The law limits the reg-
 ular workweek to 48 hours and guarantees employees 1 rest day per week, plus reg-
 ularly scheduled national holidays. The Labor Code offers comprehensive protection
 for workers from occupational hazards, but it is not effectively enforced by the few
 inspectors from the Ministry of Labor. Safety and health committees which are ex-
 plicitly sanctioned by the Code do not function, and employees who protest
 unheal ful or dangomus working conditions risk losing their jobs.
