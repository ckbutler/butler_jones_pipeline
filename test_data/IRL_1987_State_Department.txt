 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a
 long tradition of orderly transfer of power. Individual
 liberties and civil rights are provided for by the 1937 Irish
 Constitution and subsequent Supreme Court interpretations.
 Public safety is maintained by a civilian police force.
 Successive Irish governments have had to deal with the
 spillover into the Republic of violence in Northern Ireland.
 This violence led Irish authorities to adopt special
 legislation in 1984 granting the police increased powers to
 detain and interrogate those suspected of acts of terrorism.
 During 1987 the Government sought to apply this legislation
 with restraint, although some observers remain concerned at
 the potential use of these powers in cases where no connection
 with is apparent.
 Recent Irish governments have successfully promoted
 industrialization and diversification, raising living
 standards considerably.
 In 1987 human rights were respected both in theory and
 practice. The Government places strong emphasis on human
 rights in formulating foreign policy, and Ireland plays an
 active role on human rights questions in the United Nations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killings occasionally occur in Ireland
 as a spillover from the violence in Northern Ireland. In 1987
 a small number of killings occurred, primarily the result of a
 feud within the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). The
 Government uses the full force of law to pursue and prosecute
 such cases wherever possible.
 b* Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment is respected in practice by the Government. From
 time to time, there have been reports that individual
 policemen have used physical abuse during interrogations or
 have mistreated prisoners. As an adjunct to the Omnibus
 Criminal Justice Act of 1984, Parliament passed the Garda
 Siochana (Complaints) Act of 1986. The Act provides for the
 investigation and adjudication of complaints about the conduct
 of members of the police. In 1987 a Complaints Board and
 Complaints Appeal Board were set up pursuant to the Act to
 consider breaches of discipline and related matters.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution contains provisions implementing its guarantee
 that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save
 in accordance with law." The same section of the Constitution
 
 
 949
 IRELAND
 provides for a judicial determination of the legality of a
 person's detention and requires in such cases that the
 arresting authorities make written explanation to the court
 about the person concerned. Neither in law nor in practice is
 anyone subject to arrest for the expression of political or
 religious views. Arrest is carried out openly, and the right
 to a fair and speedy trial with full right of legal counsel
 exists in law and practice.
 Detention without charge is restricted. It is permitted for a
 maximum of 48 hours, however, in cases covered by the Offenses
 Against the State Act of 1939, legislation designed to "prevent
 actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and
 the authority of the State." This legislation was reactivated
 in 1972 and broadened to include other "scheduled offenses"
 against peace and order. The police can now arrest and detain
 for questioning anyone.suspected of any offense involving
 firearms, explosives, membership in an unlawful organization,
 or malicious damage to property. After the 48-hour period,
 the person must be brought before a magistrate, presented with
 written charges, and be given legal representation.
 The Omnibus Criminal Justice Act of 1984 gives some increased
 powers to the police in the area of detention for
 interrogation. Critics of the 1984 Act have argued that those
 increased powers, which did not come into effect until 1987
 following implementation of the accompanying complaints
 procedure, are out of proportion to the threat addressed and
 are unhealthy for democracy. Defenders of this legislation
 point out that two issues of human rights are at stake: the
 right of citizens to be protected against crime, along with
 the safeguarding of individual rights from abuse by police.
 There is no forced labor in Ireland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. The courts are independent, and jury
 trial is the norm. The Constitution provides, however, for
 the creation of "special courts" to deal with cases where the
 "ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective
 administration of justice, and the preservation of public
 peace and order." The Offenses Against the State Act of 1939
 formally set up such courts and provides that they may try
 persons for offenses against national security, in particular
 cases of political violence perpetrated by terrorist groups
 likely to intimidate regular juries. Rather than having
 juries, these courts have panels of judges, each consisting of
 an uneven number of judges, but in any event not less than
 three. Their verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of
 evidence generally are similar to those of regular courts,
 except that the sworn statement of a police chief
 superintendent that the accused is a member of an illegal
 organization is considered prima facie evidence of such
 membership. Court sessions are usually public but may exclude
 certain persons, other than genuine press representatives.
 There is provision for free legal aid and appeal against
 conviction or sentence.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Though not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the
 basic human right of noninterference with personal privacy,
 family, and home is affirmed by the Supreme Court and generally
 observed. The Constitution, however, provides that the State
 shall enact no law "providing for the grant of the dissolution
 of marriage." A proposal to amend the Constitution to permit
 divorce in limited circumstances was overwhelmingly defeated
 in a 1986 nationwide referendum. In the same year, the
 European Court of Human Rights ruled that the prohibition of
 divorce is not a breach of the European Convention on Human
 Rights.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and
 generally respected in practice. The State endeavors to
 insure that organs of public opinion, while preserving liberty
 of expression (including criticism of government policy), are
 not used to undermine public order, morality, or the authority
 of the State. Furthermore, "publication or utterance of
 blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter" is an offense
 punishable by law.
 Ordinarily, official censorship in Ireland is directed largely
 toward pornographic material. Nonetheless, the state-owned
 radio and television network, on the basis of the
 constitutional provisions dealing with public order and the
 authority of the State, denies air time to members of a list
 of organizations including (Provisional) Sinn Fein,.the legal
 political wing of the illegal Provisional Irish Republican
 Army (PIRA). In 1982 this prohibition was challenged before
 the Irish Supreme Court and upheld on constitutional grounds.
 All political parties not on the list are given access to both
 public-owned radio and television facilities and major
 independent daily newspapers. Criticism of the Government in
 such media is not only allowed but flourishes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Certain terrorist organizations, such
 as PIRA and INLA, however, are illegal, and membership in them
 is an offense against national security. Political parties or
 groups associated with such organizations, such as
 (Provisional) Sinn Fein, are not proscribed.
 Labor unions have full freedom to organize and to engage in
 free collective bargaining. The Irish Congress of Trade
 Unions, which represents unions in both the Republic and
 Northern Ireland, has 84 member unions with 670,000 members.
 The Irish Labor Party severed its formal relationship with the
 trade union movement in the 1930's, although some unions,
 including several of the largest, pay subscriptions to the
 Labor Party and assist candidates. Union officials and
 members play an active role in politics through the parties of
 their choice. Labor unions are permitted to conduct protests,
 including secondary and wildcat strikes. There are no
 compulsory settlement procedures.
 
 
 951
 IRELAND
 There is no basic law governing trade union activities; most
 terms and conditions of employment are determined through
 collective bargaining. The right to join a union is provided
 for in law, as is the right to refrain from joining. Most
 businesses (employing over 56 percent of the labor force) are
 unionized.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The Constitution
 assures freedom for all religious groups. There are no
 restrictions upon freedom of worship or association.
 Discrimination in employment, education, and other fields
 based on religious grounds has not been alleged. Some Irish
 laws, such as the prohibition against divorce and abortion,
 reflect the point of view of the majority community. The area
 of family law--including the rights of illegitimate children--
 is a subject of current debate in which minority religious
 communities have felt fully at liberty to take a vocal and
 active role.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as
 well as freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and
 voluntary repatriation. Irish authorities have accepted
 displaced persons only on a limited basis. On one occasion in
 1987, a Cuban citizen in transit at Shannon Airport sought
 refugee status for fear of persecution upon his return to
 Cuba, and the Government judged he was not a refugee under
 applicable international definitions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ireland has enjoyed a consistent history of orderly transfer
 of power by elections since the end of the Irish Civil War in
 1923. The country has several political parties and provision
 for independents to run for office in either house of the
 Irish Parliament.
 The requirement that elections be held at least every 5 years
 has always been met. Ireland uses a proportional voting
 system, and the secrecy of the ballot is fully safeguarded.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Irish Governments generally cooperate with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses, although they
 have not always been receptive to prisoners' rights groups.
 Amnesty International-is active, as is the Irish Council for
 Civil Liberties. Both operate freely and without hindrance in
 Ireland as the principal independent organizations interested
 in domestic human rights issues.
 Ireland is a member (and has held the vice-chairmanship) of
 the U.N. Human Rights Commission, reflecting concern by both
 the Irish Government and people for worldwide respect for
 basic human rights. This concern is reflected as well in
 support for Amnesty International's. activities in other
 countries.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government social services provide- adequate shelter, nutrition,
 health care, and education without regard to race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. People whose
 means are inadequate and who are not entitled to other benefits
 may receive pensions or other payments from public funds.
 In recent years, women have been playing a more significant
 role in the Irish work force. Although the Constitution
 recognizes the woman's role in terms of "her life within the
 home," women have been entering the workplace in growing
 numbers, particularly married women. The Antidiscrimination
 (Pay) Abt of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of 1977 seek
 to provide protection and redress against sex and pay
 discrimination. Their operation is monitored by the Employment
 Equality Agency which has processed 584 cases under the 1974
 Act and 165 under the 1977 Act. The number of cases has fallen
 in recent years, but this has not been accompanied by real
 progress in eliminating the differential in the key index of
 average hourly earnings in industry, leading the Agency itself
 to admit that legislation alone cannot eliminate
 discrimination. In 1987 the Government moved to repeal a
 50-year-old prohibition against night, Sunday, and shift work
 by women in industry that is thought to account for some of
 the persistent gap in hourly earnings between the sexes.
 In addition to equal pay issues, family law, rape law reform,
 and social welfare discrimination are priorities for Ireland's
 women's movement.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for employment is -15 years. Irish laws limit
 the hours of employment for 15-year-olds to 8 hours per day
 and 40 hours per week. Those from 16 to 17 years of age may
 work up to 9 hours per day and 40 hours per week. Those 18
 years and older are, in the case of shop employees and
 industrial workers, limited to 48 hours per week plus 12 hours
 overtime.
 There is no general minimum wage legislation in Ireland. Some
 56,000 workers, however, are covered by minimum wage laws
 applicable to specific industrial sectors, mainly those which
 tend to pay lower than average wages. Four basic laws dealing
 with occupational safety provide adequate coverage. An
 extensive system of public health insurance offers health
 protection.
