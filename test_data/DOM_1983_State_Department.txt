 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional, multiparty democracy
 with an elected President, Vice President and bicameral
 legislature, and an independent judiciary whose members are
 appointed by the Senate and headed by the Supreme Court.
 President Salvador Jorge Blanco is now in the second year of a
 four-year term which began August 1982.
 The Dominican Republic went through periods of harsh tyranny
 before and during the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo from 1930 to
 1961. In 1978, the country had its first peaceful transfer of
 power from one elected government to another, and free and fair
 elections were held again in May 1982.
 During 1983 Dominicans continued to exercise the broad range of
 human righte guaranteed them under the 1966 Constitution.
 Occasional abuses of authority such as the mistreatment of
 prisoners were amply reported in the media, along with the
 corrective measures taken by the Government. The Government has
 appointed a special adviser to the President on human rights. Its
 efforts to improve the economic and physical well-being of the
 populace have been hampered by the continued severe economic
 crisis which resulted in part from low prices for the country's
 principal exports, high prices for oil, and budgetary
 difficulties. The Jorge Blanco administration has embarked on an
 economic austerity program to reduce imports and public sector
 expenditures.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no known politically motivated killings in 1983. In
 response to a rise in the crime rate, during the course of the
 year the police increased their efforts to arrest common
 criminals. During gun battles with the police during robberies,
 or during arrest attempts, there were at least 20 deaths.  These
 deaths included some members of the Trinitarios, a group of
 gangsters who formerly were common bank robbers, but who now cloak
 their criminal activities with leftist slogans.
 One police suspect died while in custody. The circumstances in
 this case are not clear, and the police investigation continues.
 This was an isolated case, however, and does not represent
 government policy.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and it is not
 practiced. However, there have been reports of prisoners having
 been handled roughly. The press usually reports these and any
 other abuses of police authority. In most instances, the
 Government is quick to redress any improper and unjust behavior by
 its forces. During 1983, a number of police and army officers
 (536)
 
 
 537
 were investigated, detained, tried, and sentenced for abusing
 prisoners and for killing suspects alleged to have been fleeing
 from or resisting arrest. In June 1983, close to 20 officers were
 dismissed from the police force, and others received official
 reprimands or demotions, depending on the severity of the case.
 The inadequately financed prison system suffers from unsanitary
 conditions and overcrowding. The overcrowding results in part
 from the slowness of the judicial process under which many
 prisoners remain in custody while awaiting trial. Prisoners and
 their families have access to the press which deters cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading punishment and pressures the Government to
 take corrective action.
 Despite financial constraints the Government has already taken
 some steps to improve the prison situation. For instance, in July
 1983, the Attorney General, together with penal and judicial
 authorities, began to explore ways to accelerate the trial process
 in order to release prisoners more quickly from the system and
 relieve overcrowding. Legislation to improve the penal system is
 in preparation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no known cases of political prisoners being held in
 Dominican jails. In the summer months of 1983, the Government
 arrested a number of leftist leaders after receiving reports that
 they were instigating public disturbances. All were released
 within 48 hours, which is the period that suspects may be legally
 held before arraignment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees a public trial. No special political
 or security courts exist, and civilians may not be tried by a
 military court or members of the armed forces by civilian courts.
 The appeals procedure, which includes appellate courts and the
 Supreme Court, is widely utilized. Court-appointed lawyers are
 provided at public expense to indigents. Prosecuting attorneys
 are appointed by the executive branch. The defendant is generally
 charged very soon after arrest, and the charges are clearly stated
 and made available to the defense counsel.
 Judges are selected by the Senate and are independent of the
 executive branch but subject to removal or transfer by a majority
 vote in the Senate. Judges have displayed independence in their
 actions and have not been used to persecute opponents of the
 administration. Judges earn a relatively low salary, however, and
 the fairness and speediness of some trials have been subject to
 influence and manipulation, with allegations that some judges have
 accepted bribes.
 The Government has proposed constitutional reforms aimed at making
 the judiciary more independent from political pressures and less
 vulnerable to bribery. There is widespread agreement with this
 goal, but differences exist between the legislative leadership and
 the executive on the best way to achieve it.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no reports of arbitrary governmental interference
 with the private lives of individuals or families. Constitutional
 safeguards against invasion of the home are normally observed. A
 
 
 538
 residence may not be searched unless the search is made in the
 presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, except in
 cases of "hot pursuit" or when there is a probable cause to
 believe that a crime is actually occurring within the residence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These liberties are guaranteed by law and respected. Dominican
 newspapers are privately owned and are rated by the Interamerican
 Press Association as among the freest in the Hemisphere. In April
 1983, two officials of one of the Dominican Communist parties
 were briefly detained for making unsubstantiated attacks on the
 President and the Secretary of the Presidency in the party
 newspaper. The President himself ordered their release.
 The numerous privately owned radio stations and television
 stations air almost all political points of view, as does the
 government-owned radio and television network. Moreover, there is
 a frequent exchange of views between the Government and all media
 elements. Legislation was recently passed to establish a
 professional association of journalists.
 There is no government censorship on political grounds. Although
 there have been cases of some pro-Communist literature being
 confiscated by customs authorities, the annual bookfair amply
 demonstrates that books of all political persuasions are indeed
 allowed to come into the country. After much debate, the
 Government ordered the cancellation of an anti-Cuban radio program
 on the grounds that under the law its territory could not be used
 by foreigners to attack a neighboring country. Critics of this
 governmental action charged that it violated the Constitution,
 which prohibits all types of censorship. The owners of the radio
 station may challenge the action in the courts. University
 autonomy and academic freedom are respected by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Outdoor public meetings require official government permits which
 are routinely granted. Indoor gatherings of political parties,
 labor unions, and other associations are unrestricted.
 Labor unions have not historically played a significant role in
 the Dominican Republic, and only 12 percent of the labor force is
 organized. In the first year of the Jorge Blanco administration,
 however, over 70 new unions were offically recognized and over 50
 collective bargaining pacts were negotiated. Two-thirds of the
 labor movement is included within the four main labor
 confederations, but the confederations exercise only a limited
 degree of control over their affiliates. The largest labor
 confederation is the General Union of Dominican Workers, which is
 affiliated with the governing Dominican Revolutionary Party, a
 member of the Social Democratic Socialist International.
 Approximately 30 percent of the Dominican labor union movement is
 Communist controlled or influenced. The politically affiliated
 labor organizations frequently pursue partisan political
 objectives rather than workers' economic demands.  The Government
 has on occasion briefly detained labor union leaders in order to
 stop strikes or other labor actions it considered illegal.

 labor organizations frequently pursue partisan political
 objectives rather than workers' economic demands. The Government
 has on occasion briefly detained labor union leaders in order to
 stop strikes or other labor actions it considered illegal.
 
 
 540
 The continued deterioration of the nation's economy has hampered
 the growth of organized labor. Unions have the right to negotiate
 and go on strike, even though they operate under the handicap of a
 dated labor code written during the Trujillo dictatorship that
 gives unions few rights vis-a-vis management. For example, there
 is no effective protection for organizers or union officials. The
 current administration has however given unions more leeway under
 the existing legislation than previously and has initiated
 legislation to modernize and enhance universally recognized labor
 rights in a revised labor code.
 Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors, journalists, etc.,
 function freely. Like the unions, these organizations are free to
 maintain relations with counterpart international bodies of
 diverse political philosophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Approximately 95 percent of the population is Roman Catholic. The
 Church's preeminent position is accepted by the populace at large
 and is recognized in the Concordat between the Dominican Republic
 and the Holy See. Discrimination on racial, religious, or ethnic
 grounds is prohibited by the Constitution, and there are no
 restrictions on the practice of other religious faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travql,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within or outside the
 country. Many political exiles returned to the country after a
 1978 amnesty, but there still exists a legal ban on the return of
 certain members of the Trujillo family.
 The status and treatment of Haitians living in the Dominican
 Republic has been criticized by the press and the public, both in
 the Dominican Republic and abroad. The approximately
 500,000-large Haitian community is composed mainly of illegal
 immigrants seeking employment and better living conditions but
 also includes about 400 individuals who have received "political
 refugee" status from the Dominican Government, mostly opponents of
 Haitian President Duvalier and deserters from the Haitian Armed
 Forces. The illegal immigrants are routinely deported under
 Dominican immigration law, while those seeking political refuge
 are not repatriated if the Government determines that they have a
 legitimate fear of persecution. Some individuals have been
 deported, however, for failing to obey the provision in the
 Dominican Constitution that foreigners should not engage in
 political activity directed against another country. Haitian
 exile Clarel Belliard was detained under this section of the
 Constitution in July 1983, but was released by President Jorge
 Blanco on the condition that he obey Dominican law. Anti-Duvalier
 Haitians when expelled are sent to countries other than Haiti.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report expressed concern about
 reports which it received between 1979 and 1981 involving the
 detention and forcible repatriation of Haitian refugees by the
 Dominican Government. Amnesty International also received a
 report of a Haitian national who "disappeared" following his
 arrest in June 1983. The Government denies that these actions are
 its official policy. During the first year of the Jorge Blanco
 administration 15,000 illegal migrants who entered the Dominican
 Republic for economic reasons were returned to Haiti.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 I Change Their Government
 The Dominican Republic is a functioning democracy in which
 governments are freely elected by the citizens. Opposition groups
 of the left, right, and center are allowed to operate freely. The
 free and fair elections in 1982 resulted in the victory of
 President Jorge Blanco. In the 1982 election the Partido de
 Liberacion Dominicans, a pro-Cuban Marxist party, received 9.8
 percent of the vote and elected seven congressional deputies, the
 first time a Marxist party was represented in the legislature.
 The remaining parties of the Marxist left received two percent of
 the vote.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in international and
 regional human rights bodies and supports human rights issues in
 international forums. In March 1983, the Congress ratified the
 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
 Discrimination adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on December
 21, 1965. The Dominican Republic is a party to the Convention on
 Human Rights, and in July 1983 the Government announced that it
 would deposit a declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the the
 Inter-American Human Rights Court. The overall climate for human
 rights has won the praise of the local Catholic Church hierarchy.
 International human rights organizations have been allowed free
 access to the country. The Government has cooperated fully with
 the investigation into the sensitive subject of the treatment of
 Haitian refugees and migrant workers. The International Labor
 Organization (ILO) undertook a study on the conditions and
 treatment of Haitian sugarcane cutters at the end of 1982, and
 submitted its report in the summer of 1983. The ILO report did
 criticize some of the conditions which it found in the Dominican
 Republic. The Government has embarked on improvements to the
 conditions on which the ILO had reported.
 Local organizations which freely report and comment on the few
 human rights violations which do occur include the Dominican Union
 of Solidarity with Latin America, the Ecumenical Center for Human
 Rights, and the Dominican Union for the Defense of Human Rights.
 The Government has not harassed these organizations for their
 criticism of official actions or policies. Freedom House in 1983
 'rated the Dominican Republic "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Dominican Republic is a poor country with a population of
 approximately 6.2 million people and an annual population growth.
 rate which is estimated at 2.7 percent. Half of the population is
 under 16 years of age. The low price of sugar, the country'
 principal export, and the high cost of energy imports, have
 seriously hurt the economy. Unemployment, now estimated between
 25 and 30 percent, is on the increase as economic growth has
 slowed and as more individuals enter the labor market. At least
 another 20 percent of the labor force are believed to be
 underemployed. Although the per capita income is estimated at
 about $1,300, poverty is widespread.
 
 
 542
 Per capita calorie consumption meets minimum requirements,but only
 a little over half of the population enjoys access to potable
 water. Health conditions are poor, particularly in the rural
 countryside. Life expectancy at birth is 61.4 years, and the
 infant mortality rate is 78 per 1,000 live births. Almost 2,000
 cases of malaria were expected to be reported in 1983. Primary
 school enrollment is claimed to be over 90 percent, but the
 literacy rate is 67 percent. In 1983, major vaccination and
 literacy campaigns were initiated by the Government in order to
 attack some of these problems.
 While sexual and racial discrimination is prohibited by law,
 traditionally women have not shared equal social and economic
 status with men. Women's political rights have been recognized in
 legislation since 1942. Forty-seven percent of the registered
 voters are women, and women hold both elective and appointed
 offices in the Government. The Jorge Blanco administration has
 established an office to encourage the advancement of women, and
 in 1983 the United Nations International Research and Training
 Institute for the Advancement of Women set up an office in Santo
 Domingo. Divorce is easily attainable by either party, and women
 can hold property in their own names, apart from their husbands.
 There is subtle social discrimination against darker skinned
 Dominicans, although this has not prevented their success in a
 variety of fields. Cultural creativity and cultural freedom are
 widely respected and allowed to flourish.
