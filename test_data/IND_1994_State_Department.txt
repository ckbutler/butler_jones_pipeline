 INDIA
 India is a longstanding parliamentary democracy with a free press, civilian-con-
 trolled military, independent judiciary and active political parties and civic associa-
 tions. Competitive elections produce regular changes of leadership at the national,
 state, and municipal levels.
 Although the 25 state governments have primary responsibility for maintaining
 law and order, the central Government provides guidance and support through use
 of national paramilitary forces. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs controls the
 nationwide police service, most of the paramilitary forces, and the internal intel-
 ligence bureaus. Paramilitary forces are deployed throughout India and have com-
 mitted significant human rights abuses, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir.
 India has a mixed economy. The private sector is predominant in agriculture,
 most nonfinancial services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy indus-
 try. The Government continued economic liberalization and structural reforms
 begun in 1991. India's economic problems are compounded by rapid population
 Crowth of 2 percent per year with a current total well above 900 million. Income
 dtribution remained very unequal. Forty percent of the urban population and half
 the rural population live below the poverty level.
 There continue to be significant human rights abuses, despite extensive constitu-
 tional and statutory safeguards. Many of these abuses are generated by intense so-
 cial tensions, the authorities' attempts to repress violent secessionist movements,
 and deficient police methods and training. These problems are acute in Kashmir,
 where the judicial system has been disrupted both by terrorist threats including the
 assassination of judges and witnesses, and by judicial tolerance of the Government's
 heavy handed anti-militant tactics.
 Serious human rights abuses include: extrajudicial executions, torture, and re-
 prisal killings by security forces fightin separatist insurgents in Kashmir and
 northeast India; political killings, kidnaping, and  extortion  by  militants;
 extrajudicial executions by police in Punjab; torture, rape, and deaths of suspects

 in police custody throughout India; incommunicado detention for prolonged periods
 without charges under special security legislation; government failure m most in-
 stances to prosecute and appropriately punish police and security forces implicated
 in abuse; widespread intercaste and communal violence; legal and societal discrimi-
 nation as well as extensive violence, both societal and by police and other agents
 of government against women; infrequent prosecution of 'dowry deaths" (wife mur-
 der); and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded, and child labor.
 Beginning in late 1993, the Government sought to address human rights concerns
 by establishing a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) with powers to in-
 vestigate and recommend policy changes, punishment, and compensation in cases of
 police abuse. The Commission began to establish a record as an effective advocate
 for human rights when it examined security forces abuses committed in November
 1993 in Bjbehara, Kashmir. One international human rights group commended the
 Commission's reports as "hard hitting." The steadfast work of local human rights
 groups and the contribution of the NHRC helped bring about a public acknowledge-
 ment of serious human rights abuses and the need for official steps to deal with
 them (see Section 4).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killings by both government
 forces and militant terrorists continued at a high rate, particularly in Jammu and
 Kashmir, and the northeast, where separatist insurgencies continued in 1994.
 The security forces continued to commit extrajudicial killings of suspected mili-
 tants in Kashmir. Human rights monitors maintain they have docunented the
 names, dates, and circumstances in scores of extrajudicial killings each month. Typi-
 cally, those killed were detained by security forces, and their bodies, bearing mul-
 tiple bullet wounds and often marks of torture, returned to relatives or were other-
 wise discovered the same day or a few days later. While there is little information
 to corroborate individual cases, press reports and anecdotal evidence leaves no doubt
 that the pattern exists and is extensive. Security forces claim that these killings,
 when they acknowledge them, occur in armed encounters with militants.
 Deaths in Kashmir, particularly of security forces and militants, increased in 1994
 compared with the previous year. Press reports indicate that 1,296 civilians, 175 po-
 lice personnel, and 1,630 militants died in insurgency-related violence in Kashmir.
 In Punab, instances of terrorist violence virtually disappeared in 1994 and the
 number of Sikh militants killed diminished considerably from 1993. The NfRC, vis-
 iting the state in April, concurred with a widespread public perception that Puniabi
 militancy was at an end and that police exesses ould no  longer be explained as
 a response to an emergency. In a report issued in August, the NIIC strongly rec-
 ommended that the  *uab state government take steps to restore the normal func-
 tioning and oversight of the police. During 1994, 76 alleged Punjabi militants were
 reportly killed in armed encounters, including only 4 in the last 6 months of the
 year, compared with more than 583 such killings in 1993. No police or other security
 rsonnel were killed in such encounters in 1994. The fact that no police died un-
 erscored the implausibility of police claims that militants were killed in "crossfire."
 Punjab police hit teams again in 1994 pursued Sikh militants into other parts of
 India. On June 24, Punjab police shot and killed Karnail Singh Kaili, a man they
 identified as a Sikh terrorist leader of the Bhindranwale Tiger Force (BTFK) in
 West Bengal. The government of West Bengal claimed that it had not been informed
 of the presence of the Punjab police in West Bengal, seized Kaili's body and weap-
 ons, and barred the departure of the police team until the Punjab Chief Minister
 apologize."d.
 In Bihar, human rights groups claim police continued to kill Naxalites in faked
 "encounter killings." In one case in April, police allegedly killed 11 suspected
 Naxalites in cold blood and then claimed the deaths had occurred in an encounter.
 During their August visit to Andhra Pradesh representatives of the NHRC heard
 complaints of abuses committed by both Naxafites and police. The NHRC asked the
 Bihar government for details of nine alleged faked encounter killings by the police
 and recommended the payment of compensation to the relatives of the Naxalite
 killings, and also to the relatives of the victims of faked encounter killings.
 There is evidence that the practice of faked encounter killings has spread to Bom-
 bay. The previous year's pattern persisted in 1994. There were over 60 alleged
 criminals reported as killed in armed encounters with the Bombay Police during the
 first 7 months of the year.
 While state authorities continued to tolerate extrejudicial killings in areas buf-
 feted by separatist insurgencies, the press and courts paid increasing attention to
 
 
 1221
 deaths in police custody and faked encounter killings. The Supreme Court directed
 active investigation and prosecution of custodial deaths and other cases of police
 abuse and neggence. In one case murder charges were brought against Pujab po-
 licemen for a faked encounter killing. In another case, a High Court judge in July
 recommended murder charges for 11 Punjab policemen in a faked encounter killing
 and compensation to the victim's family.
 In September the Supreme Court strongly criticized the Punjab police, including
 the Director General K.PS. Gill, for inaction following the abduction by police in
 1991 of 7 members of a family, none of whom has been seen since. In October the
 Supreme Court ordered the prosecution of 58 police officers accused in the 1991
 murders of 10 Sikh youths in Uttar Pradesh. The NHRC is investigating 25 cases
 of suspected faked encounter killings.
 Deaths of suspects in police custody continued to occur as a result of torture dur-
 ing interrogation. One such case was that of Madan Lal who died in November 1993
 within hours of being picked up and released by police. In June the NHRC rec-
 ommended the award of $1,700 to compensate Lars family, the transfer of the inves-
 tigation from the Delhi Police Department to the Central Bureau of Investigation
 (CBI), and the initiation of proceedings against a police officer who had threatened
 witnesses. The Government accepted the recommendations.
 The press reported that police arrested Mahesh Paswan in the Hajipur District,
 Bihar on the evening of February 19 and that Paswan died in custody early the next
 morning. The victim's father filed charges against four policemen suspected of caus-
 ing his son's death. The authorities suspended one officer, and the district mag-
 istrate initiated an inquiry.
 According to press reports, Bapula Das died in police custody in the Khandagiri
 Police Station in Orissa April 27, hours after he was detained. Two men who had
 been detained with Das tofd a local human rights group that the police tortured the
 three of them with electric shocks. The Orissa Lovernment reportedly suspended
 three police officers, initiated ajudicial inquiry, and paid the victim's family $800 in
 compensation.
 On August 29, Kashmiri journalist Ghulam Mohammad Lone and his young son
 were shot dead in their home. He had received a death threat from an army officer
 in connection with a story reporting corrupt practices in the military. At year's end,
 the authorities had not charged anyone in the killing.
 Terrorist attacks accounted for hundreds of deaths. As in the past, Kashminri mili-
 tant groups carried out politically motivated killings on a wide scale, targeting
 proovernment politicians, government officials, alleged police informers, civilians
 and members of rival factions. Examples included: the shooting death of Wali Mo-
 hainmad Itoo, a National Conference leader and former state minister, the killings
 of former state assembly member Abdul Majid Pandey and a police inspector in sep-
 arate incidents on July 15; and the killing of three passengers on two buses stopped
 by militants in the Doda District May 20. On June 20, militants allegedly shot and
 killed the Dr. Qazi Nissar, the Mirwaiz (Muslim religious leader) of South Kashmir,
 for speaking out against militancy. The Government estimated that 70 persons, in-
 cluding 35 militants, were killed in clashes between militant factions in the first 3
 months of 1994.
 Maoist revolutionary Naxalites continued to commit many killings in Andhra
 Pradesh, Bihar, and Orissa. Naxalites held "people's courts" in which village head-
 men and others were condemned to death and summarily executed as "class en-
 emies" and "caste oppressors." In Bihar during 1993, 300 persons were estimated
 to have been killed in clashes between security forces and Naxalites, and between
 Naxalite factions.
 Extensive, complex patterns of violence continued in the seven states of north-
 eastern India. Numerous killings can be attributed to conflicts in each of the follow-
 ing categories: between indigenous peoles, usually Buddhist or animist, and immi-
 grant groups, usually Muslinm or Hindu; between tribes of indigenous peoples; be-
 tween security forces and militants of at least 18 insurgent groups; among factions
 of insurgent groups. Large numbers of security personnel were among the victims
 of the violene of t  northeast.
 b. Disappearance.-There were widespread reports of disappearances again in
 1994. There are credible reports that police throughout India often do not file re-
 quired arrest reports. As a result, there are hundreds of unsolved disappearances
 in which relatives claim an individual was taken into police custody and never
 heard from again. Police usually deny these claims, countering that there are no
 records of arrest.
 Security forces acknowledge that they detained more than 10,000 in Jammu and
 Kashmir from 1990 to mid-1994 and that they released over 7,000 of them. The
 Government made public a list of more than 3,000 detainees in more than 20 deten-
 
 
 1222
 tion centers in Jammu and Kashmir in 1994. However, human rights groups main-
 tain that the Government does not acknowledge holding without charge as many as
 7,000 additional persons in incommunicado detention.
 The Government maintains that screening committees run by the state govern-
 ment provide information about detainees to their families. However other sources
 indicate that families are able to confir-m the detention of their relatives only by
 bribing prison guards. The Kashmir Bar Association reports that bodies bearing
 marks of torture of persons detained weeks earlier have been found or returned to
 the victim's families.
 Amnesty International (Al) published a report in December 1993 on disappear-
 ances in Jammu, Kashmir, and Punjab. The Government's response to the report
 shed little light on cited cases. The response indicated that the Government of Paki-
 stan and militant groups bear the responsibility for creating circumstances in Kash-
 mir that "created possibilities of what may be perceived as excesses." The response
 indicated that the Government had completed inquiries on 75 disappearances: 35
 were dismissed on the grounds that no missing-person reports were filed with local
 police authorities. That is, the relatives did not file reports with the authorities
 whom they believed perpetrated or condoned the abductions. Investigation contin-
 ued in 12 cases and in 10 cases the authorities released disappeared individuals
 from detention. he Government offered other explanations for the remaining cases.
 Problems with the absence of police arrest records is particularly common in Pun-
 jab, where a number of disappearances were reported. A noteworthy case is that of
 Sukhwinder Singh Bhatti, a defense lawyer for accused Sikh militants. On May 12,
 plainclothes police officers arrested Bhatti; he has not been seen since. In a letter
 to the Chief Justice, a group of Punjab Inwers pinted out that Bhatti's case was
 the fourth in 3 years in which the police kidnaped a defense lawyer for accused ter-
 rorists. On June 17, the Haryana and Punjab High Court ordered a CBI investiga-
 tion into Bhatti's case; and on July 22, e NHRC summoned the Punab state
 Home Secretary to provide explanations for the disappearances of the four lawyers.
 The NHRC reported that the cases are under investigation or before the Supreme
 Court.
 Militants in Kashmir and the northeast have increasingly resorted to kidnapings
 to sow terror, seek the release of detained comrades and extort funds. According to
 the government, Kashmiri militants conducted 368 kidnaping in first half of 1994,
 including those of an American citizen and 5 British nationals, all of whom were
 released unharmed or freed unharmed by police.
 c.Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prhibits torture, but there is credible evidence that it is common through-
 out India. The authorities often use torture during interrogations. In other cases,
 they torture detainees to extort money and sometimes as summary punishment. Po-
 lice officials in West Bengal acknowledged in press interviews that torture is a rou-
 tine practice in interTogation.
 Human rights groups continue to report numerous cases in which police and para-
 military forces have used torture during interrogations in Kashmr, Punjab, and
 Assam. Commonly reported methods include: beatings, rape, burning with cigarettes
 and hot rods suspension by the feet, crushing of limbs with heavy rollers, and elec-
 tric shocks. Because many alleged torture victims die in custody, and others are
 afraid to speak out, there are few first-hand accounts, although the marks of torture
 have often been found on the bodies of deceased detainees (see Sections l.a. and
 L.b.). The prevalence of torture by police in lockups throughout India is borne out
 by the number of cases of deaths in police custody.
 The rape of persons in custody is part of the broader pattern of custodial abuse.
 According to the Home Minister, 54 cases of custodial rape occurred in 1991, 79 in
 1992 and 45 in 1993. A report published by the People's Union for Democratic
 Rights (PUDR) in May detailed 24 cases of alleged custodial rape between 1989 and
 1993 in Delhi. The PUDR noted that there have been no convictions and that the
 authorities reinstated three of 10 policemen dismissed in connection with these
 cases.
 In Madras, there were three publicized cases of gang rapes of the wives of pris-
 oners in police stations in 1994; a number of policemen have been suspended in con-
 nection with these cases. In late December, an official investigation recommended
 official charges against policemen who allegedly raped seven women in a melee that
 occurred  when   the  police  blocked  the movement of demonstrators      near
 Muzaffargarh on October 2. There were also many reports of rapes committed by
 security forces and militants in Kashmir and the Northeast.
 Confessions extracted by force are generally inadmissible in court. Under the Ter-
 rorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), a confession made to an
 officer above the rank of superintendent of police is admissible as evidence-pro-
 
 
 1223
 
 vided the police believe the confession was voluntary. However, the use of torture
 to obtain confessions under TADA is common.
 Prison guards have abused inmates for reasons unrelated to interrogation. In one
 particularly serious case, 7 prisoners died and 27 were injured as a result of beat-
 rngs by guards in Pilibhit Jail on the night of November 8. Criminal charges have
 been brught against guards and other officials involved.
 Although custodial abuse is deeply rooted in police practices, there is evidence of
 owing public awareness of the problem. The NHRC has identified torture and
 deaths in detention as one of its priority concerns. It has directed district mag-
 istrates to report all custodial deaths within 24 hours and staed that failure t
 so will be interpreted as an attempted cdverup. Magistrates appear to be complying
 with this directive.
 The courts also have been more active in prosecuting cases of custodial abuse.
 Many cases are old and iustrate the slowness of the judicial system in custodial
 cases. Early in the year, five Delhi constables were sentenced to 5 years' rigorous
 imprisonment for illegally" confining and beating to death Kamal Kumar in July
 1979. In January the Supreme Court sentenced three Uttar Pradesh policemen to
 imprisonment and fined two CB1 inspectors for beating a suspect on the steps of
 the Supreme Court. In April the Punjab High Court ordered $1,700 in compensation
 to 4 women who had the word "pickpocket  tattooed on their foreheads by Punjab
 police.
 There are three classes of p rison facilities. Prisoners are not classified by the na-
 ture of their crimes, but by their stnding in society. Class "C" prisoners are those
 who cannot prove they are college graduates or income taxpayers. Their cells are
 overcrowded, often have dirt floors, no furnishings, and poor quality food. The use
 of handcuffs and fetters is common. Class "B" prisoners--college graduates and tax-
 payers--are held under markedly better conditions. Class "A% prisoners are promi-
 nent persons, as designated by the Government, and are accorded private rooms,
 visits, and ad equate Iood, which may be supplemented by their families. Class "A"
 prisoners are usually held in government guest houses. The authorities do not al-
 ways follow this classification: following their arrest in October 1993, Kashmiri po-
 litical leaders Abdul Gani Lone and Syed Ali Shah Gilani were held for months as
 class "C" prisoners before they were moved to a gueat house (see also Section i.e.).
 According to a statement in Parliament by Minister of State for Home Affairs,
 P.M. Sayeed, New Delhi's Tihar Jail, consideyed one of the best-run in India, housed
 in March 8,577 prisoners-in facilities designed to hold 2,487. According to Sayeed,
 7,505 detainees awaited the completion of their trials, while 672 others have been
 in trial for 3 years or longer.
 The Government does not allow NGO's to monitor prison conditions. Nevertheless,
 prison conditions are a subject of press reports and have received greater attention
 from human rights groups. Press accounts of prison conditions include reports of
 sexual abuse of prisoners, the use of prisoners by prison officials as domestic ser-
 ants, the sale of food and milk for priseners on the a  market, the sale of female
 prisoners to brothels, and the marketing and export of prison-made goods.
 Women constitute 2 to 6 percent of the total prion population, according to the
 1987 Justice Krishna Iyer Report. Although Par ament passed a Children's Act in
 1960 to safeguard young prisoners against abuse and exploitation, and a Juvenile
 Justice Act in 1986 provides that boys under 16 and  rs under 18 are notto be
 held in prison, most states have not implemented these Acts. The Supreme Court
 has criticized the state governments for not providing reformatories and separate
 detention facilities for children.
 d. Arbitrroy Arrest, Detention, or Exiie.-Over the past decade, the Government
 implemented a variety of special security laws intended to help law enforcement au-
 thorities fight searatist insurgency. There are credible reports of widespread arbi-
 trayarrest and detent ion under these laws.
 The Constitution requires that detainees have the right to be informed of the
 grounds for arrest, have the right to be represented by counsel, and, unless the per-
 son is held under a preventive detention law, the right to appear before a mag-
 istrate within 24 hours of arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused must either
 be remanded for further investigation or release d. The Supreme Court hasupheld
 these prvisions. An accused person must be informed of his right to bail at the time
 of arrest and may, unless he is held on a nonbailable offense, apply for bail at any
 time. The police must ifie a charge sheet within 60 to 90 days of arrest; if they fail
 to do so, court approval of a bail application becomes mandatory.
 The Constitution permits preventive detention laws in the event of threats to pub-
 li order and national security. These laws provide for limits on the length of deten-
 tion and for judicial review. Several laws of this type remain in effect.
 
 
 1224
 The National Security Act (NSA) of 1980 permits detention of persons considered
 security risks; police anywhere in India (except Kashmir) may detain suspects under
 NSA provisions. Under these provisions, the authorities may detain a suspect with-
 out charge or trial as long as 1 year on loosely defined security grounds. The state
 government must confirm the detention order which is reviewed by an advisory
 board of three High Court judges within 7 weels of arrest. NSA detainees are per-
 mitted visits by family members and lawyers and must be informed of the grounds
 for detention within 5 days (10 to 15 days in exceptional circumstances). Nation-
 wide, more than two-thirds of the 16,000 people detained under NSA since 1980
 have been released by order of the state government or an advisory board.
 The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) of 1978 covers corresponding
 procedures for that state. In May the authorities released and immediately
 rearrested Kashmiri political leaders Abdul Gani Lone and Syed Ali Shah Gilan,
 who had been detained under the PSA in October 1993. The move followed a deci-
 sion by the Supreme Court which ruled that the authorities did not have sufficient
 grounds to detain Lone and Gilani. However, they and 376 other Kashmiri detainees
 were released in October. Over half of the detainees in Jammu and Kashmir are
 held under the PSA.
 The TADA was enacted in 1985 to fight insurgency in Punjab, but has been in-
 voked by almost every state, including those in which there is no insurgency (see
 also Sections 1.c. and .e.). TADA stipulates that those found guilty of terrorist and
 disruptive acts, or membership in a terrorist gang, may be sentenced to no less than
 5 years. It also carries the death penalty for certain terrorist crimes. Disruptive ac-
 tivities are defined broadly to include speech or actions that disrupt or challenge
 the sovereignty or territorial integrity of India.
 The TADA extends the period to 60 days during which a detaine" may be held
 in police custody after remand by the court, and it allows administrative detention
 up to 180 days (1 year in special circumstances). Suspects held under TADA must
 be presented within 24 hours before an executive magistrate who reviews the deten-
 tion order, but human rights groups say this requirement is frequently ignored. The
 TADA was extended for 2 years in May 1993, at which time an amendment was
 added requiring authorization from a state police inspector general before a court
 takes cognizance of a TADA case.
 According to the Government, there were 8,742 TADA arrests in 21 states in
 1993, the latest year for which information is available. In May the Home Ministry
 informed Parliament that 61,843 persons had been detained under TADA since the
 law's enactment in 1985, and 48,502 had been released on bail. While the Ministry
 said it did not maintain information on the numbers of cases that resulted in convic-
 tion, the Minister of State conceded that the number was very low.
 Press reports claim that, on the basis of official figures, 626 persons have been
 convicted under TADA in all of India since 1986. According to a study by one human
 rights group, 18 of 11,957 detainees arrested under the TADA have been convicted
 in the state of Gujarat, even though that state has not experienced any insurgency.
 The vast majority of TADA detainees are eventually freed on bail or released with-
 out charges being filed.
 There are widespread accusations that the special security laws have been mis-
 used in states not experiencing civil unrest as aconvenient way to hold people with-
 out trial. These accusations are borne out by government data showing T A and
 NSA arrests by state. In 1993 more persons were detained under TAA in Gujarat
 and Maharashtra than in Punjab, which was the Act's original target. The authori-
 ties in Gujarat detained 2,902 persons under TADA in 1993-roughly one third of
 the nationwide total. Detentions under NSA in 1993 were highest in Gujarat and
 Uttar Pradesh.
 Public opposition to TADA rose after a Supreme Court decision in March upheld
 the Act's constitutionality. The press, human rights groups, and lawyers' organiza-
 tions criticized the decision. The National Minorities Commission and prominent
 Muslim members of the Ruling Congress (I) Party, includin  a sitting minister,
 claimed that TADA is used disproportionately against minorities, Muslims in par-
 ticular, and called for its repal. In July the Supreme Court issued another decision
 that restricted the use of TADA to terrorist crimes and called for the release of
 those detained under TADA after 180 days if no charges have been brought.
 The Home Minister acknowledged that there has been widespread abuse of TADA
 and directed the chief ministers of the states to correct these practices. The pace
 of releases subsequently accelerated and, by the end of November, the nationwide
 total of persons detained under TADA was reduced to 6,432. The largest number
 of those still held are in Kashmir and the northeastern states in Maharashtra,
 where religious riots occurred in January 1993.
 
 
 1225
 The Minister of State for Home Affairs stated in July that the Government might
 not renew TADA when it expires in April 1995, if the Government found that the
 states have misused the Act. The NHRC announced in August that it would ask the
 Supreme Court to review its March decision. In September the NHRC entered a
 plea before the Court challengin  one of TADA's provisions. The Court denied
 NHRC's standing but allowed its lawyrto advise the Court.
 The court system is overloaded.    e result has been the detention of persons
 awaiting trial for periods longer than they would receive if convicted. Prisoners may
 be held months or even years before obtaining a trial date. According to a reply to
 a parliamentary qestion in July, more than 111,000 criminal cases were pending
 in the Allahabad High Court, the most serious case backlog in the country, of which
 nearly 29,000 cases had been pending for 5 to 8 years.
 Eleven detained foreigners petitioned the Delhi  gh Court in Jul to investigate
 the delay in their trials and threatened a hunger strike. Four had been held for 4
 to 7 years pending completion of their trials.
 The Government does not practice exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-India has an independent judiciary with strong
 constitutional safeguards. Under a Supreme Court ruling, the Chief Justice, in con-
 sultation with his colleagues, has a decisive voice in selecting judicial candidates.
 The President appoints the judges, and they serve up to age 62 in the state high
 courts and 65 in the Supreme Court.
 When legal procedures function normally, they generally assure a fair trial, but
 the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel from a bar that is fully independent of the Government.
 ere are effective channels for appeal at most levels of the judicial system. This
 is not true for cases tried under TADA, which may be appealed only to the Supreme
 Court. Since many TADA detainees lack the resources to appeal to the Supreme
 Courit, the Act effectively limits appeal.
 The Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial in most cases, but it al-
 lows exceptions in proceedings involving official secrets, trials in which statements
 prejudicial to the safety of the State might be made, or under provisions of special
 security legislation such as TADA. Sentences must be announced in public. TADA
 authorizes secret testimony toprotect witnesses and suspends the usual prohibition
 on the use of evidence gatheredthrough police interrogation. Persons charged under
 TADA with certain crimes are presumed guilty and carry the burden of proving
 their innocence. Human rights groups credibly charge that these categories are so
 broad that they can be man.pulated to fit any case. TADA trials are held before spe-
 cial courts, which may sit "in camera" in any district of the state where the crime
 was committed.
 Constitutional challenges to the TADA have been raised on the premise that it
 violates the defendant's right to due process, abrogates the jurisdictional rights of
 the states by eliminating appeal to the High Court, and that it is incompatible with
 the constitutional guarantee of free speech.
 Muslim personal status law governs many noncriminal matters involving Mus-
 lims-including family law, inheritance, and divorce. The Government does not
 interfere in the personal laws of the minority communities, with the result that laws
 that discriminate against women are upheld.
 In Kashnir, the judicial system barely functions due to threats by militants
 against judges, witnesses, and their family members and because of judicial toler-
 ance of the government's heavy handed anti-militant actions. Courts there are not
 willing to hear cases involving terrorist crimes or fail to act expeditiously on habeas
 cor.us cases. As a result, there were no convictions of alleged terrorists in Kashmir
 duing 1994, even though some militans have been in detention for years. In Pun-
 jab, where a similar situation had existed, the courts began to play a more assertive
 role in 1994 (see Sections 1.b. and 1.c.).
 f. Arbitra y Interference with Privacy Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The po-
 lice must obtain warrants for searches and seizures. In a criminal investigation, the
 police may conduct searches without warrants to avoid undue delay, but they must
 justifv the searches in writing to the nearest magistrate with jurisdiction over the
 offense. The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Assam have special
 powers to search and arrest without a warrant.
 . The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications, includ-
 Ixg monitoring telephone conversation and intercepting personal mail-in cases of
 public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or tranquility." These pow-
 ers have been used by every state government.
 On May 25, the Punjab state government ordered the authorities to intercept any
 mail addressed to or mailed by various Sikh political, student, and lawyer groups,
 persons residing in Pakistan, or any group or person considered a danger to the
 
 
 1226
 state. On July 25, the state High Court ordered the state government to suspend
 implementing the order.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and V'olations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Both government forces and militants continue to commit serious violations
 of humanitanan law in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. Between 400,000
 and 450,000 Indian army and paramilitary forces are deployed in Jamnm and Kash.
 nir, .but their number substantially increased during 199. The Muslim majority
 population in the Kashmir Valley is caught between the repressive tactics of the se-
 curity forces and acts of wanton violence committed by the militants. Under the
 Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act, and the Armed Forces (Jammu and
 Kashmir) Special Powers Act, beth passed in July 1990, security forces personnel
 have extraordinary powers, including authority to shoot to kill suspected
 lawbreakers and those disturbing the peace, and destroy structures suspected of
 harboring militants or arms.
 The nuLmber of cases in which the security forces caused the deaths of civilians
 diminished when compared with 1993. In the most serious case, 18 civilians and 3
 members of the Kashmir police died and 15 were injured in the village of Kupwara
 on January 28. Kashmiri sources claim the deaths, including those of the policemen,
 occurred when security forces fired on a crowd demonstrating near the district mag-
 istrate's office. Security forces claim they returned fire when militants attacked a
 military convoy passing through the town. Results of a magisterial inquiry have not
 been made public.
 In April the NHRC released a report on the October 1993 incident in Bijbehara,
 in which Border Security Force (BSF) personnel killed 41 civilians by gunfire. In
 the report, the NHRC asked the authorities to keep it informed about the discipli-
 nary proceedings initiated against 14 BSF personnel. It also recommended com-
 pensation for the families of the victims and a government review of BSF operations
 in situations in which civilians may be affected. A Commission of Inquiry has not
 completed its investigation of the January 1993 incident in Sopore, in which a BSF
 unit fired on civilians, killing 45, while responding to a hit-and-run attack by mili-
 tants.
 There were credible reports that security forces retaliate against civilians follow-
 ing attacks by Kashmiri militants. In March in Mahand village, seven persons, in-
 cluding two children, died while asleep at home after a paramilitary unit set off
 anexplTsion in apparent reprisal for an earlier landmine attack on their own forces.
 In July a Ministry of Defense spokesman announced in Srinagar that a court-mar-
 tial had sentenced two army enlisted men to 12 years' rigorous imprisonment for
 raping a Kashmiri woman 1 month earlier. The announcement broke with the Gov-
 ernment's previous policy of not announcing the disciplinary sentences handed down
 to security forces personnel in Kashmir.
 Kashmiri militant rups were also guilty of serious human rights abuses. In ad-
 dition to political kimgs and kidnapings (see Sections L.a. and 1.b.), militants en-
 gaged in extortion and carried out acts of random terror that left hundreds of
 Kashmiris dead. A bus bombing near Jammu on July 16 killed 6 and left 27 injured.
 According to the Government, the number of deaths caused by militants, including
 the deaths of hundreds of civilians, continued at a level comparable to 1993. Also,
 according to the Government, these militant groups killed about 70 members of rival
 factions, including 35 militants between January and mid-April 1994. Such deaths
 were said to have totaled about 100 in all of 1993.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution protects these freedoms, and
 with some limitations they are exercised in practice. A vigorous press reflects a wide
 variety of public, social, and economic beliefs. Newspapers and magazines regularly
 publish investigative reports and allegations of government wrongdoing, and the
 press as a whole champions human rights and criticizes perceived government
 lapses.
 The Press Council of India is a statutory body of *urnalists, publishers, academ-
 ics, and politicians, with a chairman appointed by the Government. Designed to be
 a self-regulating mechanism for the press, it investigates complaints of irresponsible
 journalism and sets a code of conduct for publishers. This code includes not publish-
 ing articles or details that might incite caste or communal violence. The Council
 publicly criticizes newspapers or journalists it believes to have broken the code of
 conduct, but its fimdings, while noted by the press community, carry no legal weight.
 National television and radio, which are government monopolies, are frequently
 accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of the Government. However, inter-
 national satellite television is widely distributed in middle class neighborhoods via
 cable and is gradually eroding the Government's monopoly on television.
 
 
 1227-1/
 Under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), the Government may restrict publication of
 sensitive stories, but the Government sometimes interprets this broadly to suppress
 criticism of its policies. In January a ournalist and two other persons were pros-
 ecuted in Kerala under the OSA for photographing and photocopying documenls at
 an All India Radio (AIR) station in a restricted area. The journalist had earlier pub-
 lished a series of articles critical of AIR's broadcasting.
 The 1971 Newspapers Incitements to Offenses Act remains in effect in Jammu
 and Kashmir. Under the Act, a district magistrate may prohibit the press from car-
 rying material resulting in "incitement to murder, or "ay act of violence." As pun-
 ishment, the Act stipulates that the authorities may seize news papers and printing
 presses. Despite these restrictions, newspapers in Srinagar regurly carry militant
 press releases attacking the Government and report in detail on alleged human
 rights abuses.
 The authorities allowed foreign journalists to travel freely in Kashmir, where the,
 regularly spoke with militant leaders, and filed reports on government abuse. Mili-
 tant groups also threatened journalists and editors and even imposed temporary
 bans on some publications.
 In January the Punjab police raided the office of the Punjabi daily Aj Di Awaz
 and arrested several employees under the TADA. The authorities subsequently re-
 leased all the detainees except editor Gurdip Singh on bail, and the newspaper has
 resumed publication. In another incident, the police detained a Punjabi journalist
 for 4 days for questioning about press releases issued by militants. On July 1, police
 officers beat two journalists who had asked Punjab Director General of Police,
 K.P.S. Gill, embarrassing questions at a press conference in Delhi.
 On July 3, the authorities in Assam arrested Ajit Bhuyan and R. N.D. Barua, the
 editors of two local newspapers under the TADA on suspicion of their links with
 Assamese militants. Bhuyan, who also heads a local human rights group, claimed
 he was interrogated about the sources of articles on official corruption but not about
 possible links with militants. At year's end, both were released on bail.
 In late December 1993 the authorities filed charges under the TADA against a
 newspaper editor Par   kumar Das, following his publication of a book advocating
 Assam's independence. The police reportedly confiscated his manuscript and all cop-
 ies of the book.
 A government censorship board reviews films before licensing them for distribu-
 tion. The board deletes material deemed offensive to public morals or communal
 sentiment. Producers of video news magazines must also submit their products to
 a government censorship board, which occasionally censors stories that portray the
 Government in an unfavorable light. The board's ruling may be appealed and over-
 turned. In March the board's decision to ban a film on the 1992-1993 riots in Bom-
 bay was overturned.
 Citizens enjoy complete academic freedom, and students and faculty espouse a
 wide range of views. In addition to 10 national universities and about 160 state uni-
 versities, states are empowered to accredit locally run private institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution protects the
 right of peaceful assembly and the right to form associations, and these rights are
 generally respected in practice.
 Authorities sometimes   -ire permits and notification prior to holding parades
 or demonstrations, but local governments ordinarily respect the right to protest
 peacefully. At times of civil tension, authorities may ban public assemblies or im-
 pose curfew under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The authorities in
 Punjab frequently imposed such restrictions in previous years but limited their use
 in 1994; opposition Akali parties were permitted to hold public rallies and conduct
 membership drives.
 However, in Andhra Pradesh the authorities arrested 400 persons in February for
 violating Section 144 in an effort to prevent a conference on "Suppression of People's
 Movements," sponsored by the Communist Party-Marxist Leninit. In northeastern
 India, the authorities used Section 144 to prohibit members of the Bodo tribe from
 entering the Darrang District and to prohibit rallies by the All Assam Students'
 Union. The authorities also invoked Section 144 to prohibit entry into the Dhule
 District by activists opposing construction of the Narmada dam.
 The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act prohibits the establishment of organiza-
 tions that promote communal hatred. The Government has used this Act to prohibit
 two organizations, one Hindu and one Muslim, after Hindus destroyed a mosque in
 Ayodhya in December 1992. However, the authorities do not rigorously enforce this
 law. Srinagar and other parts of Jammu and Kashmir were under sporadic curfew
 during much of the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-India is a secular state in which all faiths generally enjoy
 freedom of worship. Government policy does not favor any religious group. There is
 
 
 1228
 no national law to bar proselytizing by Indian Christians. Foreign missionaries can
 generally renew their visas, but since the mid-1960's the Government has refused
 to admit new resident missionaries. Those who arrive now do so as tourists and stay
 for short periods. As of January 1993, there were 1,923 registered foreign Christian
 missionaries in India. As in the past, state officials refused to issue permits for for-
 eign Christian missionaries to enter some northeastern states. Tensions between
 Hindus and Muslims continue to pose a challenge to the secular foundation of the
 State (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country except in cer-
 tain border areas where, for security reasons, special permits are required. Under
 the Passports Act of 1967, the Government may deny a passport to any applicant
 who "may or is likely to engage outside India in activities prejudicial to the sov-
 ereignty and integrity of India. The Government uses this provision to prohibit the
 foreign travel of some government critics, especially those advocating Sikh indo.
 pendence.
 Citizens may emigrate without restriction. Millions of people of Indian origin live
 abroad.
 Although India is not a signatory to the UN. Convention and Protocol on Refu-
 gees, the Government follows its general principles. The Government recognizes cer-
 tain groups, including Chakmas and Tamils from Sri Lanka, as refugees by provid-
 ing assistance in refugee camps or in resettlement areas, as in the case of Tibetans.
 The Government neither deports Afghans, Burmese, and other nationalities nor rec-
 ognizes them as refugees. Instead, these people receive renewable residence permits
 and are recognized as refugees by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), or are ignored.
 Pursuant to a 1993 agreement with the Government of Bangladesh for expeditious
 repatriation of Chakma refugees, 1,850 were repatriated in February and some
 3,000 mere were repatriated in July and August. Some human rights groups claim
 that in many cases these repatriations were nvoluntary and refugees staged a hun-
 ger strike to protest them. The Government has rejected offers  the UNHCR to
 monitor these repatriations. Human rights organizations and the press corroborate
 claims by refugees that the Government has reduced rations and cash assistance to
 refugee camps holding Chakmas to encourage their repatriation.
 According to the UNHCR, 102,437 Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka were living in
 India in early September. Of the total, 69,150 lived in 122 cam pa in the state of
 Tamil Nadu, 31,668 more are living with friends and relatives, and11,629 suspected
 of militant activities are detained in special camps. The state government, using
 central Government resources, provides shelter and subsidizes food to those in the
 camps. Enforcement of a Tamil Nadu government ban on nongovernmental organi-
 zation (NGO) assistance to the camps has been relaxed. NGO's visited the camps
 in 1994. Voluntary repatriation under UNHCR supervision continues. According to
 the Government, 7,000 were scheduled to be repatriated to Sri Lanka in early fall.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right freely. India has a democratic, parliamentary system
 of government with representatives elected in multiparty elections under universal
 adult suffrage. A Parliament sits for 5 years unless dissolved earlier for new elec-
 tions, except under constitutionally defined emergency situations. State govern-
 ments are elected at regular intervals except in states under President's rule, i.e.,
 rule from the center.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may proclaim a state of emer-
 gency in any state in the event of war, external aggression, or armed rebellion.
 imilarly, President's rule may be declared in the event of a collapse of a state's
 constitutional machinery. The Supreme Court in May upheld the Government's au-
 thority to suspend fundamental rights during an emergency.
 The Home Ministry has indicated its desire to replace President's rule with an
 elected state government in Jammu and Kashmir but says law and order problems
 are an obstacle to the holding of state assembly elections. President's rule remained
 in effect in Jammu and Kashmir throughout the year. President's rule in Manipur
 was extended on May 11 and was in effect through the entire year. President's rule
 in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan,
 invoked following the December 1992 Ayodhya crisis, ended with state assembly
 elections in November 1993. A state assembly for the national capital territory of
 Delhi was elected for the first time in November 1993.
 The Constitution reserves seats in Parliament and state legislatures for "sched-
 uled tribes' and "scheduled castes" in proportion to their population (see Section 5).
 
 
 1229
 Indigenous people participate actively in national and local politics, but their impact
 depends on their numerical strength. In Northeastern states, indigenous peoples are
 a large proportion of the population and consequently exercise a dominant political
 influence in the political process. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, on the other hand,
 tribal peoples are a small minority and have been unsuccessful in blocking projects
 the oppose.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation by women in the political
 process. A large proportion of women participate in voting throughout the country,
 and numerous women represent all major parties in the national and state legisla-
 tures.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights organizations operate throughout India investigating
 abuses and publishing their findngs which are often the basis for reports by inter-
 national human rights groups. However, the police targeted human rights monitors
 for arrest and harassment. As noted in Section 1.b., the police in Punjab abducted
 a lawyer involved in defending accused Punjabi militants, and he subsequently dis-
 appeared.
 The Government appointed a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in Oc-
 tober 1993 with powers to investigate and recommend policy changes, punishment,
 and compensation in cases of police abuse. In addition, the NHRC is directed to con-
 tribute to the establishment, growth and functioning of nongovernmental human
 rights organizations. The Government appoints the members and finances the ac-
 tivities of the NHRC, which is prohibited by statute from investigating allegations
 of abuse involving army and paramilitary forces. Indian human rights groups criti-
 cized the legislation creating the NHRC; they remain skeptical, but have indicated
 that thus far most of their concerns appear to be unfounded. In its first year of oper-
 ation, the NHRC received 3,000 complaints of human rights abuses and investigated
 cases in nearly every state in India. Despite the limitation on its activity, the NHRC
 also investigated allegations of abuse by paramilitary forces.
 Disposition of this case load was not available at year's end. During its first six
 months of operation, The NHRC considered 496 complaints, recommended punish-
 ment and compensation in 174, dismissed 274, and sent 48 to other fora. The
 NHRC's report on the October 1993 killing of 41 civilians in Bibehara, Kashmir
 was described as "hard hitting" by an international human rightsgrup. In addition
 to closely following court martial proceedings initiated against 14 BSF members, the
 NHRC recommended that the BSF conduct a full review of force deployment in civil-
 ian areas and pay compensation to the families of the victims. The Commission di-
 rected district magistrates nationwide to report all cases of custodial death to it
 within 24 hours or be presumed to have attempted a coverup. A typical example
 inquiry into a custodial death by the NHRC was that of the case of Madan Lal The
 Delhi police complied with all the Commission's recommendations including the in-
 stitution of departmental proceedings against a police officer who had threatened
 witnesses (See Section 1.a.).
 The Commission's report on its visit to Punjab strongly criticized the state govern-
 ment for abuses by police and recommended corrective measures. At year's end, the
 state government had not responded to the NHRC's recommendations.
 The Government granted requests for visits to India by some international human
 rights organizations but refused others. In January it permitted Amnesty Inter-
 national to visit Bombay, the first such visit in 14 years to visit to India.
 In March the Government permitted representatives of the International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to make a humanitarian needs survey in Jammu and
 Kashmir. The survey resulted in a formal offer of ICRC's services. Discussions were
 not concluded at year's end. ICRC representatives also conducted training of police
 and border security force personnel in international humanitarian law.
 However, the Government refused a requested visit by the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission's Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Execu-
 tions to evaluate reported violations of the right to life in Kashmir. The Government
 stated that the NHRC will undertake such investigations. It also denied entry visas
 to two Human Rights Watch researchers.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of ethnicity, religion, and lan-
 guage deeply divide Indian society. Despite laws designed to prevent discrimination,
 mere are other laws as well as social and cultural practices that have a profound
 discriminatory impact.
 
 
 1230
 Women.-India has an elaborate system of laws to protect the rights of women,
 including the Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act, and
 the Sati (widow burning) Prevention Act and the Dowry Prohibition Act. However,
 the Government often is unable to enforce these laws, especially in rural areas
 where traditions are deeply rooted. Female bondage and forced prostitution are
 widespread in parts of Indian society. According to a government study, borne out
 by press reporting, violence against women-incuding molestation, rape, kidnaping,
 and wife murder' dowry deaths )-has increased over the past decade.
 Domestic violence in the context of dowry disputes is a serious problem. In the
 typical dowry dispute, a groom's family will harass a woman they believe has not
 provided sufficient dowry. This harassment sometimes ends in the woman's death,
 which family members often try to portray as a suicide or kitchen accident. Al-
 though most "dowry deaths" involve lower and middle-class families, the phenome-
 non crosses both caste and religious lines.
 Government figures show a total of 5,377 dowry deaths in 1993, an increase of
 about 12 percent from 1992. Under a 1986 amendment to the Penal Code, the court
 must presume the husband or the wife's in-laws are responsible for every unnatural
 death of a woman in the first 7 years of marriage-provided that harassment is
 proven. In such cases, police procedures require that an officer of deputy super-
 intendent rank or above conduct the investigation and that a team of two or more
 doctors perform the postmortem procedures.
 Nonetheless, convictions in dowry death cases are rare. Lawyers note that judges
 and prosecutors, usually men, are uninterested in cases of domestic violence and
 susceptible to bribes. In May the Law Ministry stated that in the Uttar Pradesh
 High Court, 33 dowry death cases were pending from 1985, 26 from 1986 35 from
 1987, 54 from 1988, and 56 from 1989. With few exceptions, the accused are free
 on bail.
 The personal status laws of the religious communities discriminate against
 women. Under the Indian Divorce Act of 1869, a Christian woman may demand di-
 vorce only in the case of spousal abuse and certain categories of adultery, while for
 a man adultery alone is sufficient. Under Islamic law, a Muslim husband may di-
 vorce his wife spontaneously and unilaterally;, there is no such provision for women.
 Islamic law also allows a man to have up to four wives but prohibits polyandry.
 The Hindu Succession Act provides equal inheritance rights for Hindu women, but
 married daughters are seldom given a sare in parental property. Islamic law recog-
 nizes a woman's right of inheritance but specifies that a daughter's share should
 be only one half a son's. Under tribal land systems, notably in Bihar, tribal women
 do not have the right to own land. Other laws relating to the ownership of assets
 and land accord Women little control over land use, retention, or sale.
 There are thousands of grassroots organizations working for social justice and eco-
 nomic advancement of women, in addition to the National Commission for Women.
 The Government usually supports these efforts despite strong resistance from tradi-
 tionally privileged groups. This resistance is illustrated by a September 1992 inci-
 dent in rural Rajasthan when a women's rights monitors was gang-raped by men
 who objected to her work against child marriage. Five accused persons were ar-
 rested in December 1993; three were released on bail in April. The court case con-
 tinues.
 Children.-There are an estimated 500,000 street children nationwide. Child pros-
 titution in the cities is rampant, and there is a growing pattern of traffic in child
 prostitutes from Nepal. According to one estimate, 5,000 to 7,000 children, mostly
 aged 10 to 18, are victims of this traffic.
 The Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act of 1976 prohibits child marriage,
 a traditional practice in northern India. The Act raises the age of marriage for girls
 to 18 from 15, but the Government does not enforce it effectively. According to one
 report, 50 percent of the girls in Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya
 Pradesh are married at or before age 16.
 Amniocentesis and sonogram tests are widely misused for sex determination, re-
 suiting in a disproportionate number of abortions of female fetuses. In July a bill
 was introduced into Parliament that would prohibit the use of these tests for sex
 determination. Human rights groups estimate that at least 10,000 cases of female
 infanticide occur yearly, primarily in poor rural areas.
 Female foeticide and infanticide have produced a steady decline in the ratio of fe-
 males to males. This ratio has decreased to 927 per 1,000 in 1991, from 955 per
 1,000 in 1981, and 972 per 1,000 at the turn of the century. Parents often give prior-
 ity in health care and nutrition to male infants. Women's rights groups point out
 that the burden of providing girls with an adequate dowry is one factor that makes
 daughters less desirable. Although abetting or taking dowry is theoretically illegal
 under the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961, it is still widely practiced.
 
 
 1231
 Indigenous People.-The Innerline Regulations, enacted by the British in 1873,
 still provide the basis for safeguarding tribal rights in most of the border states of
 northeastern India. These regulations prohibit any person, including Indians from
 other states, from going beyond an inner boundary without a valid permit. No rub-
 ber wax, ivory or other forest products may be removed from the protected areas
 witihout prior authorization. No outsiders are allowed to own land in the tribal areas
 without approval from tribal authorities.
 Despite constitutional safeguards, the rights of indigenous groups in eastern India
 are often ignored. There has been encroachment on tribal land in almost all the
 states of eastern India, including by illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and busi-
 nesses which have removed forest and mineral products without authorization.
 Moreover, persons from other backgrounds often usurp places reserved for members
 of tribes and lower castes in national education institutions.
 Such violations have given rise to numerous tribal movements demandingrrtec-
 tion of land and property rights. The Jharkhand movement in Bihar any OrIsa,
 and the Bode movement in Assam, reflect deep economic and social grievances
 among indigenous peoples. In the Jharkhand area, tribal people complain that they
 have been relegated to unskilled mining jobs, have lost their forests to industrial
 construction, and have been displaced by development projects. The Government
 has considered the creation of an independent Jharkand state, hut the affected state
 governments oppose the idea.
 However, there is some local autonomy in the region. In Meghalaya tribal chiefs
 still wield influence in certain villages. The Nagaland government controls the
 rights to certain mineral resources, and autonomous district councils in Tripura,
 Assam, and Meghalaya control matters such as education, rural development, and
 forestry i  cooperation with the state governors.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution gives the President author-
 ity to specify historically disadvantaged castes and tribes which are entitled to af-
 firmative action in employment and other benefits. These so-called "scheduled"
 tribes constitute about 8 percent of the Indian population and "scheduled castes
 about 16 percent. Scheduled tribes and castes benefit from special development
 funds, government hiring quotas, and special traiming programs. A national commis-
 sion investigates specific complaints about deprivation of the rights of scheduled
 castes and tribes and submits an annual report.
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989
 specifies new offenses against disadvantaged people and provides stiffer penalties
 for offenders. However, this law has had only a modest effect in curbing abuse. Gov-
 emnent statistics indicate that 19,774 cases of "atrocities" were committed against
 members of scheduled castes tribes in 1993, as compared with 20,834 in 1992 and
 21,505 in 1991. A Government commission is charged with giving special attention
 to the problems of those minorities.
 The practice of untouchabiity was in theory outlawed by the Constitution and the
 1955 Cii  Rights Act, but t remains an important aspect of life in India. Intercaste
 violence claims hundreds of live has a ya The e f a surte of intercaste violence
 in the early months of 1994, following the success of parties rereesenting "back-
 ward" and scheduled castes in November state assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 and their formation of a governing coalition in the state. Members of the scheduled
 castes were disproportionately the victims of this violence, which also occurred
 throughout the country, but especially in Madhey a Pradesh and Maharashtra h
 Religious Minorities.-Controversy between Hindus and Muslims continues over
 whether to build a temple or rebuild the mosque on a disputed site in Ayodhya. The
 potential for renewed  indu-Muslim violence remains high. Muslim oups pro-
 tested the disproportionate number of Muslims detained under the TAsA, particu-
 larly in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtr and the city of Hyderabad (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act makes it an offense to use
 any religious site for political purposes or to use temples for harboring persons ac-
 cused or convicted of crime. While specifically designed to deal with Sild places of
 worshipin the Punjab, the law technically applies to all reiious sites.
 Peovle. With Disabilities.-The Governments Ministry of  elfare has principalre-
 sponsibility for programs for the disabled, and it delivers comprehensive rehabilita-
 tion services to India's rural population through 16 district centers. A national reha-
 bilitation plan commits the Government to putting a rehabilitation center in each
 of India's more than 400 districts, but services are still concentrated in urban areas.
 The Government reserves 3 percent of positions in official offices and state-owned
 enterprises for people with visual, hearing, or orthopedic disabilities. The Govern-
 ment provides special railway fares, education allowances, scholarships,customs ex-
 
 
 1232
 emptions, and rehabilitation training to assist people with disabilities. There is no
 legislation or otherwise mandated provision of accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion; workers may establish and join unions of their own choosing without prior au-
 thorization. There are five major recognized national trade union centrals, each of
 which is associated with, but not necessarily controlled by, a political party.
 Trade unions often exercise the right to strike, but public sector unions are re-
 quired to give at least 14 days' notice prior to striking. Some states have laws re-
 quiring workers in ertain nonpubic sector industries to give prior strike notie.
 The Essential Services Maintenance Act allows the central Government to ban
 strikes and requires conciliation or arbitration in specified essential industries.
 Legal mechanisms exist for challenging the assertion that a given dispute falls with-
 in the scope of this Act. The IdustrialDisputes Act prohibits retribution by employ-
 ers against employees involved in legal strike actions. This prohibition is observed
 inr ractice.
 wuses  a  st nationally organized unions or unionized workers are generally
 not a problem However, unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers are not
 always able to secure for themselves the protections and rights guaranteed by law.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to barain collec-
 tively has existed for decades. The Trade Union Act prohibits discrimination against
 union members and organizers, and employers may be penalized if they discrimi-
 nate against employees engaged in union activitioes.
 Collectivebargaining is the normal means of setting wages and settling disputes
 in the organized industrial sector. Trade unions vigorously defend worker interests
 in this process. Although a system of specialized labor courts audicates labor dis-
 putes, therecre long delays and a backlog of unresolved cases. When the parties
 are unable to agree on equitable wages, the Government may et up boards of
 union, management, and government representatives to determine them.
 n practice, legal protections of workers' rights are effective only for the 28 million
 workers in the organized industrial sector, out of a total work force of 376 million.
 Outside the modern industrial sector, laws are difficult to enforce. Union member-
 ship is rre inths "informals sector and collective bargaining does not exist.
 There are 7 export processing zones (EPZ's). Entry into the EPZ's is ordinarily
 limited to the employees. Such entry restrictions apply to union organizers. While
 workers in EPZ's have the right to organize and bargain collectively, trade union
 activity is rare. Women workers constitute the bulk of the work force in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, and legislation passed in 1976 specifically bans the practice of "bonded labor."
 A Supreme Court decision defined "forced labor" as work at less than the minimum
 wage, which is usually set by the state governments. Under this definition, which
 differs from that of the International Labor Organization (ILO), "forced labor" is
 widespread, especially in rural areas.
 "Bonded labor," the result of a private contractual relationship whereby a worker
 incurs or inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt plus inter-
 est, is illegal but widespread. The Government estimates that between enactment
 of the Bonded Labor (Regulation and Abolition) Act in 1979 and March 31, 1993,
 approximately 251,424 bonded workers had been released from their obligations.
 Other sources maintain that those released are only one-tenth of the total number
 of bonded laborers. State governments are responsible for enforcing the Act. Offend-
 ers may be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison but prosecutions are rare.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Article 24 of the Constitution pro-
 hibits employent of children under 14 years of age in factories, mines or other haz-
 ardous employment. Article 45 encourages the state governments to provide free
 and compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14. A law passed in 1986
 banned the employment of children under 14 in hazardous occupations, such as
 glass making, fireworks, match factories, and carpet weaving, and regulated their
 employment in others. The Factories Act and the Child Labor Registration Act limit
 the hours of workers below the age of 15 to 4.5 hours per day.
 The Government estimates that there were 17.5 million child workers in 1985.
 The ILO estimates the number at 44 million, while NGO's claim the figure is 55
 million. The enforcement of child labor laws is the responsibility of the state govern-
 ments. Enforcement is not effective, especially in the informal sector where most of
 the children are employed. The continuing prevalence of child labor may be attrib-
 uted to social acceptance of the practice, the widespread belief that poverty causes

 child labor, and the failure of the state governments to make primary school edu-
 cation compulsory.
 In September a group of carpet manufacturers and exporters, in cooperation with
 NGO's and an export promotion project with Germany, introduced a program to
 label export carpets as -being "child-labor free." This initiative is being undertaken
 on a trial basis in response to consumer pressure in Germany.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages vary according to the state
 and sector of industry. Such wages are considered adequate only for a minimal
 standard of living. Most unionized workers receive much more than the minimum
 wage, including mandated bonuses and other benefits. The state governments set
 a separate minimum wage for agricultural workers but do not enforce it well.
 The Factories Act established an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour workweek, and var-
 ious standards for working conditions. These standards are generally enforced and
 accepted in the modern industrial sector, but tend not to be observed in older and
 less economically robust industries. State governments are responsible for enforce-
 ment of the Factories Act. However, the large number of industries covered by a
 small cadre of factory inspectors and their limited training and susceptibility to
 bribery make for lax enforcement.
 Although occupational safety and health measures vary widely, in general neither
 state nor central government resources for inspection and enforcement of standards
 are adequate. Safety conditions tend to be better in the EPZ's.
