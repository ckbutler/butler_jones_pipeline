 INDIA
 India follows a multiparty democratic system based on the
 British parliamentary model, with an independent judiciary and
 a free press. Free elections take place regularly, with the
 most recent national parliamentary elections held as scheduled
 December 24, 1984, only 7 weeks after the assassination of
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
 The Congress (I) Party headed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 holds nearly 80 percent of the seats in the lower house of
 India's Parliament. Congress (I) also controls the largely
 ceremonial upper house, as well as the legislatures of 13 of
 the 22 states. Another state's coalition government is led by
 Congress (I). Other parties (in two states with Congress (I)
 support) control the eight remaining states. Punjab and
 Sikkim, which were under direct control by the central
 Government ("President's Rule") at the beginning of the year,
 elected state and parliamentary representatives in 1985, as
 did Assam where elections had previously been postponed
 because of the unsettled communal situation.
 India's economy is mixed, with banks, air and rail transport,
 public utilities, and much heavy industry in government
 hands. The agricultural sector, the manufacture of consumer
 goods, and the supply of services are largely privately held.
 The Government has relaxed regulation of private business
 activity in recent years.
 India is a secular state. Although 83 percent Hindu, India
 has a large Muslim population (about 80 million, or 11
 percent). There are also sizable populations of Sikhs,
 Christians, Jains, Buddhists, and Parsis. In some outlying
 regions, there are locally important minorities or tribal
 groups, such as the Nagas. The new Punjab state government
 has also helped settle in Punjab a large number of Sikh
 families who fled there following the 1984 riots.
 The upheaval in the Sikh-majority state of Punjab remained
 India's most serious human rights concern in 1985 although the
 situation improved markedly compared to 1984. In 1984, the
 Government, in response to Sikh-separatist agitation, sent
 army units into the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the Sikhs' most
 holy shrine. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by
 two of her Sikh bodyguards in apparent revenge for the attack
 on the temple. Over 2,000 persons, mostly Sikhs, died in
 postassassination rioting and many others lost their homes.
 Most of those Sikhs whose homes were destroyed during the
 postassassination violence have since been resettled,
 generally in the same urban areas where they previously lived.
 The release from detention of Sant Harchand Singh Longowal and
 other prominent leaders of the Akali Dal (the primary Sikh
 political party) in March end April helped create a climate in
 Punjab conducive to discussions between the Government and the
 Akali Dal. An agreement between the two sides was announced
 on July 24 following meetings between the Prime Minister and
 Longowal. The accords, which contained provisions for
 settling the major points of contention between the Sikhs and
 the Government, appear to be broadly acceptable to the
 majority of Sikhs as well'as to Indian citizens of other
 religions.
 Other incidents of communal violence were reported in several
 parts of India in 1985. There were clashes both between
 
 
 1222
 INDIA
 religious communities (generally Hindu-Muslim) and between
 castes of different economic levels, particularly attacks on
 untouchables by higher-caste Hindus.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not engage in political killing. Communal
 or caste differences, exacerbated by the competing economic
 and political goals of various religious and ethnic groups,
 often result in intercommunal and intercaste violence,
 increasing the occurence of politically motivated killing.
 There are allegations that some of these deaths occur at the
 hands of various security forces, but there is no evidence
 that the government sanctions such violence.
 Both Hindus and Sikhs were murdered in violence related to the
 unrest in Punjab in 1985. Victims included prominent
 politicians working for Hindu-Sikh unity as well as several
 allegedly involved in the anti-Sikh rioting of November 1984.
 The head of the Akali Dal, Harchand Singh Longowal, was
 assassinated on August 20 by Sikhs opposed to the accords
 reached between the Sikh leadership and the Government in July.
 There were other terrorist incidents not aimed at specific
 targets. In early May, Delhi and other northern Indian
 centers witnessed a spate of random bombings when terrorists
 rigged small transistor radio bombs to explode on buses,
 trains, and in other public places.
 In response to these incidents, Parliament passed the
 Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act. Human
 rights activists voiced concern that this law might allow
 undue government interference in the legitimate activities of
 citizens. To date the Government has not invoked this Act.
 In April, the Government charged a judicial commission with
 the investigation of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi. The
 commission's mandate was extended under the terms of the
 Punjab Accords to include investigation of riots in other
 north Indian cities.
 Communal riots and violence based on caste considerations are
 longstanding problems in India. In 1985, such incidents took
 place in widely separated parts of India. The 4-month long
 agitation over the minority "reservations" issue in Gujarat,
 where higher-caste groups agitated against expanded quotas for
 lower caste students in the state's professional schools, was
 the most serious and violent of these disturbances, resulting
 in over 200 deaths. The situation come to a head when police
 attacked newspaper offices and journalists who they suspected
 of exacerbating communal and intercaste tensions. The
 Government then called in the army to restore law and order.
 b. Disappearance
 Some Sikhs dispute government assertions that all those
 arrested in Punjab following the June 1984 army operation in
 the Sikh Golden Temple are accounted for: The number of such
 disputed cases is small, and it is possible that those
 involved are either underground in Punjab or have left the
 state.
 
 
 1223
 INDIA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government does not condone torture or cruel treatment,
 which are prohibited by law. Indian case law, extending over
 many decades, excludes from admission in court any confessions
 or information extracted through the use of force or torture.
 Police brutality against prisoners and suspects was reported
 by the press in 1985 in a number of states. Police are
 sometimes accused of staging mock "encounters" with suspects
 to conceal the fact that the victims had previously died in
 police custody, or of attributing deaths of suspects in police
 custody to causes such as "suicide," "disease," "shock," or
 "injuries received prior to arrest." One such incident
 occurred in 1985 when a Sikh suspect arrested in connection
 with the May "transistor" bombings in New Delhi died in police
 custody, although he reportedly had only minor injuries when
 arrested the day before. The postmortem showed that his death
 was due to physical abuse. Two others arrested at the same
 time also showed signs of physical abuse when they appeared in
 court. There is no evidence that the state or central
 governments condone police brutality. At the same time, there
 have been few official inquiries into allegations of police
 brutality.
 Prison facilities are crowded and pretrial detention may last
 for months or years. Press accounts report the use of
 convicts for domestic work by jail officials in contravention
 of regulations, sexual abuse of some prisoners, and lengthy
 detention "for their own protection" of some women who had
 reported rapes to police.
 According to a classification system dating from the colonial
 period, prison authorities grant varying privileges to
 prisoners of different social status. Foreign nationals and
 political prisoners are entitled to larger or less crowded
 cells, better food, and other amenities than ordinary
 prisoners; some middle-class prisoners are segregated from
 other prisoners and given more privileges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that a person in custody be told of
 the grounds for arrest, be given the right to be represented
 by counsel, and be brought before a magistrate within 24 hours
 of arrest. At his initial appearance, the accused must be
 either remanded for further investigation or released on
 bail. These provisions are generally respected.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention
 laws against threats to the public welfare and to the national
 security. Such laws provide for limits on the length of
 detention, generally not to exceed 12 months, and for review
 of such detention. Two preventive detention laws are
 currently in force. One, rarely used, permits the arrest of
 suspected "economic offenders." The other is the National
 Security Act (NSA), intended to permit the detention of
 security risks, which stipulates that the courts, in order to
 release a detainee, must determine that all grounds for
 detention are invalid, rather than simply any one of them.
 When a detention order expires, another can be issued,
 extending detention by up to another 12 months. If
 authorities add new grounds for detention for each extension,
 
 
 1224
 INDIA
 a detainee theoretically can be held indefinitely through a
 series of extensions.
 The NSA has been used in Punjab but, according to official
 government sources, Punjab's newly-elected state government
 revoked detention orders against 224 of the 233 people held
 under this law. The remaining nine detainees have been
 accused of spying, espionage, and seditious activity. Central
 government authorities have given the Punjab government
 responsibility for deciding whether to continue detention of
 these individuals.
 Except as permitted by the Terrorist Affected Areas Act, which
 still applies to Punjab and Chandigargh, incommunicado
 detention is not practiced. The right of habeas corpus is
 available so that a detainee or his representative can
 petition for the detainee's release.
 Exile is not a legally sanctioned punishment in India; there
 is no evidence that any Indian citizen was exiled in 1985.
 Although there is no specific law in India against "forced
 labor," Article 23 of the Constitution dealing with the
 fundamental rights of citizens includes the "right against
 exploitation"; under its terms, forced labor is prohibited.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no constitutional guarantee of public trial. The
 criminal procedure code provides for open trial, but also
 permits the judiciary to close the proceedings under
 relatively narrow circumstances. For example, the Official
 Secrets Act permits closed proceedings on the plea that
 publication of any evidence or statements would be prejudicial
 to the safety of the State. The Act requires, however, that
 the passing of sentence take place in public.
 The 1984 Terrorist Affected Areas Act amends the Evidence Act
 in areas declared "terrorist affected" by placing the burden
 of proof of innocence on the accused. Terrorist affected
 areas are defined as areas where there have been extensive
 disturbances of public peace for more than 1 month, and where
 violence was directed against peacekeeping forces. Trials
 under this act are held in camera. A few special courts were
 set up under provisions of the Act, trials were held, and
 convictions made. Many of those convicted were later released
 after the Akali Dal government came to power in Punjab in
 September 1984.
 In 1985, courts martial and other judicial procedures have
 continued to deal with those Sikh military members--some 2,733
 according to Defense Ministry sources--who deserted their
 units after the June 1984 military action against the Golden
 Temple in Amritsar. Some Sikhs have argued that these
 deserters were following their religious dictates and had
 acted to protect their religious freedom. In some cases these
 soldiers have been sentenced to up to 14 years imprisonment.
 The Punjab Accords provide that Sikh soldiers discharged from
 the army (presumably following their desertion) will be
 "rehabilitated."
 As a general rule, Indian legal procedures assure fair trial.
 Defendants have the right to choose counsel, and effective
 appeal channels are available at each stage of the judicial
 process.
 
 
 1225
 INDIA
 The Indian bar is independent of government at all levels.
 Judges of the state high courts and the Supreme Court are
 selected by the Law Ministry, following consultations with the
 Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The central Government
 since 1983 has reversed previous practice and now generally
 appoints chief justices in states other than their states of
 residence. Although there was some apprehension among high
 court justices that the new practice could be used to remove
 judges who had given verdicts unfavorable to government, there
 has been no indication of any such abuse..
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Indian law requires warrants for searches and seizures but
 also permits the police in a criminal investigation to
 institute searches without warrant if otherwise there would be
 undue delay. The officer must state in writing the grounds
 for making the search without a warrant and specify the object
 of the search. There is no indication that this provision has
 been abused.
 The authorities continued to invoke special powers during 1985
 in the "disturbed areas" of Assam and Punjab, although
 "disturbed areas" legislation on Assam was lifted in July.
 Under the provisions of law governing disturbed areas,
 civilian authorities down to the rank of subinspector of
 police, and military authorities down to noncommissioned
 officer, are given exceptional authority, including to search
 and arrest without warrant and to shoot to kill in some
 circumstances.
 The press has reported allegations of the tapping of
 telephones and interception of personal mail. Such
 surveillance is authorized by law "on the occurrence of any
 public emergency or in the interest of the public safety or
 tranquility." These terms are not specifically defined and
 thus lend themselves to a broad interpretation. Censorship of
 mails under certain circumstances, such as public emergency,
 is legal. Aside from these instances, the Government does not
 routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and, by
 extension, of the press. However, material which, in the view
 of government authorities, may incite religious or communal
 hatred is proscribed from print. A booklet published by a
 human rights group entitled "Report to the Nation: Oppression
 in Punjab" was banned in this manner. A 1984 case registered
 against an Indian journalist remains unresolved. The
 journalist, who reported that some Sikhs arrested during the
 army's assault on the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 1984 were
 summarily executed, was charged with provoking riot and
 disaffection among communal groups. By late 1985, the
 journalist's passport had been returned, but his press
 credentials had not been renewed and the case against him was
 still pending.
 A film censorship board reviews all films before they are
 licensed for distribution. The board excises material deemed
 overly violent or offensive to public morals or to religious
 
 
 1226
 INDIA
 and communal sentiment. Radio and television are government
 monopolies, and opposition parties often accuse both of
 favoring the ruling party.
 Opposition viewpoints enjoy wide dissemination in the print
 media, and many political parties control their own newspapers
 or journals. The press in general is lively and free, and
 there are no restrictions relating to criticism of the
 Government. Press censorship, imposed in Punjab following the
 Army action in June 1984, is no longer in force.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right of peaceful assembly and
 the right to form associations and unions. These rights are
 respected in practice. For reasons of crowd control,
 authorities sometimes require permits and notification to
 police prior to demonstrations, parades or similar
 gatherings. There are no prohibitions against Indians joining
 any association, union, and professional or social welfare
 organization.
 The right to organize, bargain collectively, and strike is
 recognized in the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 (as amended)
 and the Indian Trade Union Act of 1926. However, the
 Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), renewed in 1985,
 permits government intervention to ban strikes and immediately
 to institute conciliation in 16 industries identified as
 essential for the public welfare. The National Security Act
 empowers the central Government to curb strikes in the same 16
 industries. In September, Parliament enacted legislation
 which denies employees of intelligence agencies the right to
 organize and strike. In 1985, the Government invoked ESMA
 during the agitation in Gujarat when the entire state
 government work force went on a 72-day strike over the issue
 of "reservations," i.e., the percentage of promotion and
 employment opportunities set aside for backward classes. The
 Government also invoked ESMA when electricity and waterworks
 employees and the employees of the Food Corporation of India
 threatened to strike. Under ESMA the Government provides for
 alternate resolution of disputes through conciliation,
 mediation, or, ultimately, referral to arbitration or
 adjudication.
 India's unions claim a membership of approximately 14 million
 or about 5 percent of the total work force. This claimed
 membership represents approximately 50 percent of the workers
 in the "modern sector" of the economy. Four-fifths of the
 labor force is in the rural sector, where unemployment and
 underemployment are endemic and where organization into
 effective unions is difficult. Employer associations and
 trade unions, as well as government labor officials and
 mediators, play a prominent role in developing industrial
 relations norms in both the private and public sectors.
 There is heavy emphasis on political activity by unions
 representing the relatively few workers in the economy's
 modern sector. The labor movement wields influence
 disproportionate to its numbers because of its organization of
 strategic sectors of the economy such as government,
 transportation, and basic industries, and because of the
 unions' association with various political parties.
 
 
 1227
 INDIA
 The political parties exercise strong influence on their trade
 union wings but, except for the Commrnist unions, India's
 national labor centers exercise considerable independence in
 their internal affairs and in the re.resentation of worker
 interests.
 Unions and professional bodies are f:ee to maintain contact
 with international bodies. The Indian National Trade Union
 Congress and the Hind Mazdoor Sabha are affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The
 All-India Trade Union Congress is affiliated with the
 Soviet-supported World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and
 the Center of Indian Trade Unions attends WFTU meetings as an
 observer.
 Indian trade unions have complained several times in recent
 years to the International Labor Organization's (ILO)
 Committee on Freedom of Association, charging violations in
 India of ILO conventions and recommendations. The two Marxist
 trade unions usually have presented these complaints.
 According to ILO documents, the Government has cooperated in
 the Committee's investigations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religious groups are allowed to worship freely and
 government policy favors no one religious community. However,
 communal tensions and violence based on religious differences
 continue as a serious social problem. The Government limits
 the number of foreign Christian missionaries, but there is no
 legal bar against proselytizing by Indian Christians.
 Although Sikhs generally are treated equally under the law,
 Sikhs, particularly young males, were subjected in 1985 to
 more rigorous security precautions than others in certain
 circumstances (e.g., airport security).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is full freedom of movement within India for all
 citizens with the caveat that travelers to certain sensitive
 border areas must obtain special permits. Foreign travel and
 emigration are without political restrictions. More than 3
 million Indian citizens now live abroad. There are no special
 restrictions of movement applied to women or other groups. In
 mid-1984 the Government tightened visa requirements for
 foreigners coming to India so that virtually every non-Indian
 must now have an entry visa. Foreigners are also not allowed
 to travel to a number of sensitive border areas. Punjab has
 been off-limits to foreigners without special permission since
 mid-1984, although the restriction was lifted for foreign
 journalists in July 1985.
 Since independence in 1947 India has admitted millions of
 refugees. Most who wanted to remain have been granted
 citizenship and integrated into the society.
 A large number of Bengali-speaking people moved from Assam
 into West Bengal in 1983 as a result of violent agitation in
 Assam against alleged migrants from Bangladesh. West Bengal
 authorities report that the 23,000 people who had been in
 relief camps had returned to Assam by early 1985.
 
 
 1228
 INDIA
 An estimated 100,000 Tamils have entered India from Sri Lanka
 since 1982. Most arrived since the current ethnic
 disturbances. in Sri Lanka began in mid-1983 and have remained
 in the state of Tamil Nadu. The Government provides them
 shelter and subsistence. The Government has denied Indian
 press reports that it has also provided training to members of
 certain Sri Lankan armed Tamil separatist groups.
 Several thousand Afghans have entered India since the Soviet
 invasion in 1979. Many have since departed to other
 countries. Although India does not formally recognize these
 Afghans as refugees, there has been very little evidence of
 forcible repatriation. The 1984 World Refugee Report listed
 two cases of United Nations High Commisssioner for
 Refugees-mandated Afghan refugees, who had left India for
 third countries (Sweden and Saudi Arabia), being denied
 admission to India upon their return. Failing admission to
 India, each was returned to Afghanistan by the responsible
 airline. The passengers' destination was determined by the
 airline, not by the Government of India.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution grants universal adult suffrage to all
 citizens over 21. Regular elections are held at every level.
 By law, Parliament can be constituted for no more than 5 years.
 The election law was amended in 1985 to provide that the death
 during an election campaign of a candidate not representing a
 major political party would no longer annul that election.
 The Constitution empowers the President to declare an
 emergency or "President's Rule", on the advice of the Prime
 Minister in the event of war, external aggression, or internal
 disruption; collapse of the constitutional machinery in any
 state; or the financial breakdown of the federal or any state
 government. President's Rule, in effect in Punjab since
 October 1983 and in Sikkim since May 1984, was lifted in both
 states during the year. The return to representative
 government in Punjab followed state elections there on
 September 25 in which the Akali Dal (the primary Sikh party)
 won a massive victory, securing nearly two-thirds of the state
 assembly seats and a majority of Punjab's parliamentary
 seats. The elections were peaceful and the turnout high.
 A multitude of state and national parties are in active
 opposition to the Congress (I) Party, which holds power at the
 national level and in the majority of India's 22 state
 governments. The parties represent every shade of the
 ideological spectrum and freely contest elections at all
 levels. No social, religious, or linguistic group is denied
 political participation or suffrage.
 There are no legal barriers to female candidates, although
 their numbers have remained small since independence. The
 late Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, was a woman. There are
 44 women in the lower house of Parliament, and 24 in the upper
 house (of authorized memberships of 544 and 244 respectively).
 
 
 1229
 INDIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international investigations of the human rights situation
 in India are known to have been conducted since 1978. India
 is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
 There are several independent Indian human rights
 organizations, including the People's Union for Civil
 Liberties and the People's Union for Democratic Rights. These
 organizations periodically send study teams to report on
 specific situations. In September, the Citizens for Democracy
 (CFD) released a booklet, "Report to the Nation: Oppression in
 Punjab." The document, billed as a response to the 1984
 government White Paper on the army operation against
 dissidents in the Sikh Golden Temple, was banned the day after
 its release. Several members of the five-person study team
 who provided interview material for the booklet, as well as
 the owner of the printing press involved in its publication,
 were arrested on charges of sedition and "spreading
 disaffection among the communities." All were later released
 on bail pending trial. Both the media and some opposition
 politicians have condemned the Government's harsh response.
 Several women's groups monitor the status of women and were
 active in 1985 in agitating against "dowry deaths". Both
 women's groups and human rights groups welcomed the Supreme
 Court's decision that divorced Muslim women are entitled to
 maintenance and support from their former husbands despite the
 constraints of Muslim personal law. But the Muslim community
 as a whole resented the Supreme Court judgment, decrying it as
 interference in the Muslim personal law. Some of these groups
 have also recommended that Muslims be covered under a
 nationwide civil law for all communities.
 The Parliament and press continue to be the most significant
 channels for reporting human rights violations. In 1985, the
 press focused attention on human rights violations against
 Sikhs; violence against women, including "dowry deaths", rape
 and other physical violence; police brutality; conditions in
 jails; and exploitation of low-caste, harijan (untouchable),
 or tribal people in rural areas.
 In its 1985 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the detention of prisoners of conscience and about large
 numbers of political detainees held without trial under
 preventive detention legislation or awaiting trial under
 special legislation permitting trial in camera; allegations of
 torture; reports that alleged extremists were shot dead by
 security forces after capture; and judicial executions.
 Freedom House calls India "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 India's population is estimated to be 767,768,000 with an
 annual growth rate of approximately 2 percent. Per capita
 gross national product was $260 as of 1983.
 The Indian Constitution calls on the Government to minimize
 inequalities in income, facilities, and opportunities for all
 citizens. Indian economic policies have been defined in a
 series of 5-year plans since 1950, which have sought to
 establish a framework for realization of these objectives. In
 
 
 INDIA
 India's mixed economy, the private sector produces 80 percent
 of the gross national product (GNP) and accounts for 93
 percent of employment.
 Life expectancy at birth is 56 years, and the infant mortality
 rate is 101 per 1,000 live births. Adult literacy is about 36
 percent. Only 41 percent of the population have access to
 safe drinking water. The ratio of calorie supply relative to
 nutritional requirements is 89 percent. In both health
 services and education, there are great differences between
 rural and urban areas. The difficulty in providing adequate
 health, nutritional, and family planning services in the
 countryside continues to be a serious constraint to reducing
 both mortality and fertility rates among the rural poor.
 Education and literacy have expanded rapidly since
 independence. Primary school enrollment, which was 43 percent
 in the 1950-51 school year, rose to 69 percent in 1980.
 School enrollments are higher for males (78 percent) than for
 females (55 percent), and are lower for children from
 disadvantaged groups such as scheduled castes and tribes.
 Although proscribed by law, both child labor and bonded labor
 persist in India. Employment of children (i.e., under 15
 years of age) is exacerbated by poverty and the absence of
 compulsory education. A survey conducted by the Labor
 Ministry estimates that every fourth child between the ages of
 5 and 15 is employed, i.e., approximately 44 million
 children. Child labor is extensive in rural areas
 (approximately 90 percent according to government estimates),
 particularly in agriculture and cattle tending and in such
 activities as carpet weaving, wool cleaning, and the
 manufacture of matches and fireworks. In the modern
 manufacturing sector, child labor is virtually nonexistent.
 The Labor Ministry has blamed the persistence of child labor
 on economic realities--the cheapness of such labor for
 employers and economic necessity for parents.
 Bonded labor, although prohibited under the Bonded Labour
 System Act of 1976, continues despite efforts to eliminate the
 practice. Bondage typically arises when an individual borrows
 money, at usurious rates, and is unable to repay the debt.
 Most vulnerable are landless, unemployed rural workers hired
 by small enterprises, particularly in the construction
 industry. The workers are placed in debt and are kept there
 by revolving loans from employers. Under these circumstances
 bondage can last a lifetime. Estimates of the number of
 affected laborers vary between 500,000 and 2.5 million,
 depending partly on the definition used. The central
 Government has repeatedly urged the states to detect, release,
 and rehabilitate bonded laborers; the Government has also
 offered matching contributions to meet financial outlays for
 the purpose. As of December 31, 1984, according to Ministry
 of Labour statistics, 173,814 cases of bonded labor had been
 identified, of which 131,407 had received rehabilitation
 assistance. A 1982 Supreme Court decision defined the term
 "forced labor" to include labor or service to another for
 remuneration which is less than the minimum wage. In this
 context, "forced labor" occurs throughout India, particularly
 in rural areas.
 India has no national minimum wage. Minimum wages, under the
 Minimum Wages Act, are established by the various state
 governments through tripartite minimum wage advisory boards
 
 
 1231
 INDIA
 for the "nonmodern" sector of the economy, i.e. stone-
 breaking, agriculture, edible oils. As a result, minimum
 wages in these sectors vary widely from state to state. In
 the agricultural sector, day wages range from 7 to 12 rupees
 ($1=12.2 rupees); in the edible oils industry, from 4.25 to 9
 rupees. Enforcement of these rates is poor. In urban areas,
 where unions are more common, wages are set through collective
 bargaining or the supply and demand mechanism.
 The Factories Act of 1948 prescribes minimum standards for
 safety and occupational health and established the 8-hour day
 and 48-hour workweek. Industrial health and safety standards
 are enforced and accepted as good management practice in the
 more modern sector of the economy that includes steel plants
 and petrochemical complexes. Enforcement of minimum standards
 is exceedingly poor in the older, less cost-effective plants
 involving textiles and chemicals. Safety standards are
 generally flouted in the small-scale sector, i.e., businesses
 having less than 400 workers, due in part to the growth in
 this sector together with an inadequate number of trained
 inspectors.
 There has been a steady decline over many decades in the ratio
 of women to men. Women die earlier than men, and the female
 infant mortality rate is higher. Both phenomena may reflect
 the greater economic value associated with males, especially
 in northern India, and consequent nutritional and health-care
 neglect of females in poorer homes.
 Although women are guaranteed equal rights and protection
 under the law in India, longstanding cultural biases cause
 them, in practice, to have fewer educational and career
 opportunities. In 1985, public attention was again focused on
 "dowry deaths," the death under suspicious circumstances of
 women whose parents have been unable to pay a supplementary
 dowry demanded by the husband's family after marriage. Most
 reported cases of "dowry deaths" occurred in northern India,
 in lower middle-class urban families. There has been
 increasing agitation for legal protection, but most suspected
 cases of dowry deaths are investigated as accidents by the
 police rather than as murder. Lobbying by women's groups on
 this issue led Parliament to pass an amendment to the Dowry
 Prohibition Act which became effective in October and provided
 stringent punishment for those convicted in dowry death cases.
 Certain castes and tribes are "scheduled" for the purpose of
 assigning benefits of governmental action to relieve
 disadvantages resulting from social factors. Scheduled castes
 make up 15 percent of the population. The tribal people are
 an estimated 7 percent. The Government has met only modest
 success in its efforts to improve the positions of these
 groups, and some programs have had the unintentional effect of
 mobilizing the upper castes against efforts to benefit the
 disadvantaged. These programs include a quota system in
 educational enrollment, preferences for housing and government
 jobs, and reserved seats in Parliament for members of the
 scheduled groups.
 Violence directed against scheduled castes or scheduled tribes
 persists. The basis of such violence is often economic,
 involving perceived threats to the economic position of higher
 castes by lower economic groups demanding legal minimum wages
 or land tenancy. The Government attempts to provide legal and
 physical protection to victimized groups, and in the last 3

 years the judiciary has taken a harder line, including the
 handing down of death sentences, against those accused of
 participating in mob violence against harijans.
 The report of the Backward Classes Commission, released in
 mid-1982, remains under consideration at both state and
 national levels. The report covers not only the scheduled
 castes and tribes, but a number of other communities
 considered "backward." A number of castes are trying to be
 included on the growing list of "backward" communities in the
 hope of obtaining special government compensation and
 consideration for jobs. The Commission's main recommendations
 involve more than doubling the number of reserved seats in
 education and government employment from the 22.5 percent
 provided under the Constitution to 49.5 percent.
