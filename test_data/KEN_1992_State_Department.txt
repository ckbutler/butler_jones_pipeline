 KENYA
 After 10 years as a de jure one-party state, Kenya reintroduced multiparty democ-
 racy in December 1991. However, Kenyan President Daniel T. arap Moi continued
 to control a governing system in which power was centered in the Office of the
 President. The unicameral legislature is empowered constitutionally to pass all laws
 but in practice is controlled through the ruling Kenya African National Union
 {KANU) party and the President and wields virtually no independent power. Be-
 cause the President has authority over judicial tenure, the court system too has
 been beholden to the Office of the President.
 Kenya held general elections on December 29 for the Presidency, Members of Par-
 liament (M.P.'s), and local government officials; however, the conduct of these elec-
 tions left unclear the ability of the Kenyan people to change their government by
 democratic means. International monitoring groups reported serious procedural
 faults in the preelection period and vote-counting operation. For example, the Gov-
 ernment delayed in responding to issues concerning domestic monitors, ballots, and
 boxes and the registration of some parties. It showed an intolerance of the political
 opposition inconsistent with political pluralism. A statement issued by one observer
 mission called the electoral process "seriously flawed" and indicated that these flaws
 "raised questions about the validity of the election." Nevertheless, large numbers of
 Kenyans voted in what was the first multiparty balloting in recent Kenyan history
 which resulted in the election of many opposition candidates.
 Kenya has a large internal security apparatus that includes the police Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID), the paramilitary General Services Unit (GSU), and
 the Directorate of Security and Intelligence (DSI or Special Branch). The CID and
 Special Branch investigate criminal activity and also monitor persons the State con-
 siders subversive. The internal security apparatus has been used to intimidate and
 harass politicians, opponents of the Government, and dissidents, sometimes employ-
 ing torture or other mistreatment. Kenya's total military expenditures for 1989, the
 last year for which the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a
 detailed analysis, were $210 million. Due to economic problems, the Government
 has been initiating efforts to reduce these expnditures.
 Kenya's economy, despite the dominance of public and state-owned enterprises, in-
 cludes a well-developed private sector for trade and light manufacturing as well as
 an agricultural sector that provides food for local consumption and substantial ex-
 ports of coffee, tea, and other commodities. Kenya's tourism industry surpasses cof-
 ee and tea exports as the top foreign exchange earner but suffered reduced growth
 in 1992, inpart because of concerns over political violence and an upsurge in crime.
 The rate of economic growth declined in 1992, and a persistently high population
 growth rate contributed to a serious and growing problem of unemployment.
 Kenyans are free to engage in private economic activity and own property, with lim-
 ited government interference.
 Although basic freedoms were more widely exercised in Kenya than in the recent
 past, the Government continued seriously to abridge human rights in 1992. Follow-
 ing mass protests within the country andpressure from foreign donors, the Govern-
 ment acquiesced in the reestablishment of a multiparty political system (after 29
 years of one-party rule). As a result, political oppsition parties were legally able
 to form, to put forth candidates, and to present their views; further, the Goverment
 permitted greater latitude ii' fredoms of speech and press, assembl ', and fair trial.
 owe       ese same freedoms were undercut by the Government s unwillingness
 to implement reform measures uniformly and its repeated efforts to inhibit legiti-
 mate opposition activities. Among the most egregious abuses was government-in-
 spired or -assisted violence which was direted both at political opponents and at
 certain ethnic groups and which resulted in hundreds of casualties and thousands
 of displaced persons. While freedoms of speech and press are protected by the Con-
 stitution, in practice the Government used the assets of the State, including the ju-
 dicial system, to clamp down on dissent. There were many incidents of arrest on
 grounds of rumormongering, sedition, incitement to violence, and the like, which
 were political in nature.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Exrajudicial Killing.-The most serious human rights
 issue in 1992 was that of the so-called tribal clashes in several regions in which 800
 people were killed and thousands made homeless. In September 1991, a group of
 it Valley KANU politicians attended a political rally at which they purported to
 "ban" members of the opposition from entering the Rift Valley and threatened re-
 prisals against Kikuyus, Luos, and LuIhyas resident in those areas because they
 were presumed to support opposition parties. Without any rebuke from President
 Moi or other high level government officials, KANU M.P.'s continued in 1992 to en-
 courage the heightening of tribal tensions by making threats and issuing ulti-
 matums.
 For example, in June Minister of Local Government William Ole Ntimama de-
 clared at a public meeting that non-Maasais in Narok (a traditionally Maasai area
 southwest of Nairobi with a gwing non-Maasai population) who did not own land
 or property there would notbe allowed to vote. The next week Maasai "warriors"
 attacked Kikuyus at a voting registration center in Narok, killing three and injuring
 four more. Although many opposition members were arrested for inciting violence,
 no action was taken against Ntimama. Tribal fighting, which began with sporadic
 incidents as early as  ptember 1991, reached a peak in April and later continued
 on a smaller scale. In sections of the Rift Valley and the West, so-called Kalenjin
 warriors targeted residents of other ethnic groups, especially Kikuyus, Luos, and
 Luhyas, burning homes and farms and trrorizing people into fleeing the area.
 Many observers charged that the Government instigated the clashes to prove its
 oft-repeated assertion that poitical pluraism would inevitably lead to tribal vio-
 lence and political instability. A consequence of the clashes was the displacement
 of thousands of voters from tribally mixed, key electoral districts. Residency require-
 ments for voter registration were enforced during the June/July registration period,
 thus disenfranchising the displaced.
 According to a report by the nation's largest religious body, the National Council
 of Churches of Kenya (NCCK), a report of the Catholic bishops, and the findings
 of the parliamentary Kiliku Commission, high-level government officials organized
 and carried out a systematic campaign of ethnic terror in parts of Rif Valley,
 Nyanza, Western, and Central provinces. The reports charge that government offi-
 cials provded financingfor armed groups government vehicles were used to trans-
 port fighters, and combatants were hidden on private farms. The Kiliku report
 which names former minister Nicholas Biwott, Vice President George Saitoti, and
 a number of government and KANU officials (though not Moi, who has denied in-
 volvement) as the chief culprits, was rejected by Parlient on October 14. The vote
 was far from unanimous, a highly unusual occurrence, but further official investiga-
 tion or indictments seemed unlikely.
 The Government made little progress in the case against the killer (or killers) of
 former Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Ouko. Jonah Anguka, held without bail
 since late 1991, stands solely accused of the killing. President Moi terminated a spe-
 cial investigation, and the Government suddenly dropped charges against two
 former senior-level officials, minister Nicholas Biwott and internal security chief
 Hezekih Oyugi, shortly after they had been identified as chief suspcts. Anguka
 was finally brought o t  h rial in Otober, but an agreement between the prosecution
 and defense resulted in an adjournment until January 18. Opposition politicians
 charged that the Government had delayed bringing the case against Anguka be-
 cause it feared evidence would be introduced implicatig high-level government fig-
 ures in the killing.
 In March, while tribal clashes were occurring in western Kenya, police in Kisumu
 responded to rock thrwing by jeering crowds by shooting at least a dozen unarmed
 Kenyans, killing two, and beating bystanders at random. Police violence in response
 to civil disturbances continued to be a problem, as in Mombasa in May, when police
 killed four bystanders and injured dozens of others in demonstrations surrounding
 the arrest of Muslim religious figures, including sheik Khalid Salim Balala.
 On May 10, Rosemary Nambura died in police custody at the Kasarani police
 station. The  enya Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA/K) released a postmortem
 report charging that Ms. Nyamura had bled to death after suffering a ruptured
 spleen and kidneys. The Government failed to investigate adequately charges that
 she was beaten to death in detention.
 During 1992 there was an increase in the already alarming number of public exe-
 cautions by civilians. Mob justice in the form of community revenge on local bandits
 aprehension of street criminals, or the burning of those accused of sorcery, claimed
 t        livci. Thd stondiant 0f contirnut v fnbe a  wap mrvpre as inn Mawhen flie

 braved violence themselves to rescue would-be victims, while in other incidents
 there were reports of police turning a blind eye to such activity.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is proscribed under the Constitution, but police brutality and abuse of pris-
 oners continued in 1992, including credible evidence of torture presented before the
 courts.
 Former political prisoners consistently and credibly reported abuses in prison.
 Methods of torture used in past years, including flooded cells and beatings, contin-
 ued to be employed. There were credible reports that police tortured at least one
 of the four prisoners in the Koigi wa Wamwere treason case; methods included
 burns and inserting pins under his fingernails.
 International human rights and opposition     ups   rtested the treatment of
 Rumba Kinuthia, one of the treason suspects along wit Wamwere. Kinuthia, who
 suffers from high blood pressure, was chained to his hospital bed 23 hours a day.
 He was also denied medical treatment prescribed by his doctors but unavailable in
 Kenyatta National Hospital. His condition reportedly resulted from numerous beat-
 ings he received while in custody. In light of his condition, his attorneys made re-
 peated but unsuccessful requests for bail. Kinuthia has been awaiting trial since
 1990.
 Conditions in prison are harsh. Standards of food and health care fall short of the
 basic provisions in the Prisons Act, especially for nursing mothers, who have their
 infants with them. Bedding is often in short supply and toilet facilities are often in-
 adequate. Torture in prison is rare, though beating of suspects in police custody con-
 tinues, often to coerce confessions. Sexual abuse is common in Kenyan prisons and
 rarely punished. Prisoners have been incarcerated in cells reserved for the crimi-
 nally insane, especially as punishment for political offenses. Women prisoners are
 subject to the same harsh prison conditions as men but are subject to even greater
 sexual abuse.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that most ar-
 rested or detained persons (other than those detained under the Preservation of
 Public Security Act or PPSA) shall be brought before a court "as soon as is reason-
 ably practicable," which would be within 24 hours of the arrest or from the start
 of detention.
 The Constitution was amended in 1988 to allow the police to hold people sus-
 pected of capital offenses for 14 days before being brought before a court. Capital
 offenses include such crimes as murder and treason. n practice, suspects of all
 types are often held incommunicado for 2 to 3 weeks before being brought before
 a court. Often, family members bring law suits to compel authorities to produce
 "missing prisoners.
 Kenya's PPSA allows the State to detain a person indefinitely without charges or
 trial upon a determination "that it is necessary for the preservation of public secu-
 rity."  reservation of public security" includes 'prevention and suppression of rebel-
 lion, mutiny, violence, intimidation, disorder and crime, unlawful attempts and con-
 spiracies to overthrow the Government or the constitution," and several other
 grounds. No persons were detained under the PPSA in 1992. Furthermore, the
 courts evidenced an increased willingness to grant bail in political cases.
 In June the Court of Appeals reversed the convictions of George Anyona and his
 three codefendants for sedition in a 1991 trial that depended heavily on question-
 able evidence. They had been released on bail 4 months earlier by Justice Oguk,
 who said the offense for which they were convicted was politically motivated and
 that he was convinced their pending appeal had an overwhelming chance of success.
 Also in June, the Attorney General withdrew charges against four of the seven men
 arrested in October 1990 along with Koigi wa Wamwere on sedition charges. The
 trial of wa Wamwere and his remaining three codefendants began on December 23.
 But the Government continued to use arrest and detention, particularly on sedi-
 tion and rumormongering charges, to harass opposition figures or those critical of
 government policies. No convictions resulted from those cases. In some instances, no
 charges were brought; in others, the accused were released on bail. The most promi-
 nent incident took place at a January 10 Nairobi press conference, in which a num-
 ber of members of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) accused
 President Moi of planning to turn over the Government to the military (see Section
 2.a.). They were arrested on charges of rumormongering-charges that are still
 pending before the court.
 Njenga Mungai, the M.P. for Molo district until his resignation to join the Demo-
 cratic Party (DP), was brought in for questioning after he accused the Government
 of conniving with Kalenjins to attack Kikuyus during the tribal clashes, a charge
 later made by the reports compiled by the NCCK, the Catholic bishops, and the par-
 
 
 liamentary Kiliku Committee itself. Mungai was subsequently charged with "incite-
 ment" (charges which are still pending) and jailed. He was subsequently released
 on bond and was therefore able to continue his successful campaign for the Mole
 parliamentary seat. The opposition pointed out that the Government was far from
 evenhanded in bringing charges of incitement to violence, and many government fig-
 ures made blatantly inflammatory statements without being charged (see Section 3).
 Less influential opposition figures were also harassed. There were numerous cases
 of members of opposition parties being picked up, interrogated by police, held for
 several days, andthen released without charges. In one case, a witness at the Ouku
 inquiry, James Matthew Onyango K'yoo, was held by the police for 6 days. He was
 not charged with any offense.
 There are currently no detainees held in Kenyan jails under the PPSA or other
 legislation. However there are a number of prisoners convicted in criminal cases
 which seem to have been politically motivated. The Government used charges of se-
 dition, incitement of violence and rumormongering to jail political opponents and
 members of the press. Though no evidence has been presented yet by the prosecu-
 tion or defense, opposition and human rights groups charged that the treason trial
 of former M.P. Koigi wa Wamwere and his three codefendants has no legal merit
 and is politically motivated.
 A number of Kenyans who went into self-exile out of fear of prosecution have re-
 turned safely to Kenya, including Kiraitu Murungi, a Meru attorney now on the
 FORD executive committee, and human rights attorney Gibson Kuria. The most fa-
 mous returnee was Oginga Odinga's son Raila Odinga, who returned in January
 from self-exile in Norway. He fled in October 1991 after a number of physical at-
 tacks, one of which resulted in his hospitalization, and all perpetrated, according to
 Odinga, by Kenyan security forces. He had been detained three separate times total-
 ing almost 10 years under the PPSA.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Kenya's legal system, as defined in the Judicature
 Act of 1967, is based on the Kenyan Constitution, laws passed by Parliament, and
 common law or court precedent. Customary law is used as a guide in civil matters
 affecting people of the same ethnic group so long as it does not conflict with statu-
 tory law. Kenya does not have a jury system. The court system consists of a Court
 of Appeals, a High Court, and two levels of magistrates' courts where most criminal
 and civil cases originate. In 1989 High Court Justice Norbury Dugdale ruled that
 the courts have no power to enforce the Kenyan Bill of Rights. In spite of numerous
 legal challenges that the ruling effectively subsumes the judicial branch of govern-
 ment under the executive, his decision has not been overruled.
 Civilians are tried in civilian courts, and verdicts may be appealed to the Kenyan
 High Court and ultimately to the Court of Appeals. Kenyans do not have a right
 to government-provided legal counsel except in certain capital cases. Most persons
 tried for capital offenses are provided counsel free of charge if they cannot afford
 it. Military personnel are tried by courts-martial, and verdicts may be appealed. At-
 torneys for military personnel are appointed on a case-by-case basis by the Chief
 Justice.
 The President has extensive powers over the judiciary. He appoints the Chief Jus-
 tice and the Attorney General and appoints High Court judges with the advice of
 the Judicial Service Commission. His power was significantly increased through con-
 stitutional amendments adopted in 1986 and 1988 which gave him discretionary au-
 thority to dismiss judges, the Attorney General and certain other officials. In late
 1990, this power of dismissal was restricted, when Parliament adopted a constitu-
 tional amendment specifying that the President may only dismiss those officials
 upon the recommendation of a special presidentially appointed tribunal. Some
 hailed this as a restoration of the security of judicial tenure, but many lawyers criti-
 cized it as inadequate to restore judicial independence and have objected to a gov-
 ernment bias on the part of some justices. The amendments have not yet been test-
 ed as there has been no government effort to date to remove an officer affected. Ad-
 ditionally, the practice of using judges on short-term contracts is a serious threat
 to their independence.
 For noncapital charges, free legal aid is not generally available outside of Nairobi,
 where only one overstretched organization dedicates itself solely to this service. In
 the absence of legal advice from Kituo cha Sheria ("The Law Center" in Swahili),
 poor people sometimes plead guilty to a variety of offenses, including political of-
 fenses. Still, free legal aid is sometimes given by a number of legal organizations,
 including the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), Federation of Women Law-
 yers (FIDA/K), and by private lawyers, in addition to Kituo cha Sheria.
 In some cases, legislation precludes a fair trial. A relic of the colonial period, the
 Chief's Authority Act, gives low-level administration officials, called chiefs, wide-
 ranging powers, including the power to arrest and hold individuals and to restrict
 
 
 122
 a person's movement without trial. The Kenya Law Reform Commission has rec-
 ommended thit the law be abolished.
 Defendants have occasionally been denied the right to employ legal counsel of
 their choice. Kenya theoretically permits all Commonwealth lawyers to practice and
 also employs British judges, including the Chief Justice. Yet in 1991, two defend-
 ants, Miurgi Kariuki and Paul Muite, were denied the right to employ British bar-
 risters in their defense. As of December 31, 1992, the Attorney General still had not
 complied with a court order of November 25, 1992, to allow Queen's Counsel Mr.
 Michael Manfield to represent Kariuki (who is charged with treason along with
 Koigi wa Wamwere).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Gen-
 erally, judicially issued search warrants are required and obtained, but searches
 without warrants are allowed under the Constitution in certain instances "to pro-
 mote the public benefit," including in security cases. Security officials also conduct
 searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or to seize property
 suspected of having been stolen. Homes of suspected dissidents have been searched
 without warrants, and evidence so obtained has been admitted to support convic-
 tions. When an issue of Society magazine was impounded in January, it was con-
 fiscated from the offices of the publisher before the issuance of a warrant by the
 court (see Section 2.a.). Security forces reportedly employ a variety of surveillance
 techniques, including electronic surveillance and a network of informers. Political
 opponents have been subject to police surveillance, as have some of their visitors.
 Opposition leaders and human rights monitors also charge the Government with
 staging or promoting physical attacks on those critical of the Government. In April
 labor [eader Dennis Akumu and FORD member James Orengo experienced similar
 physical attacks which appear to have had a political motivation. Former Vice Presi-
 dent Oginga Odinga alleges that his farm was burnt by government agents in Janu-
 ary. The authorities have not yet identified the culprits.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press and outlaws discrimination against any Kenyan on the grounds of politi-
 cal opinion. However, there are numerous de jure and de facto restrictions and inhi-
 bitions on the exercise of free speech.
 The Government continues to try to stifle freedom of speech by arbitrary arrest.
 It brought charges of rumormongering to threaten critics but repeatedly failed to
 prosecute. In January, 10 members of FORD called a press conference to issue a
 warning that President Moi planned to turn the Government over to the military.
 The Government arrested eight of the participants, including former Vice President
 Josephat Karanja, on charges of rumormongering. Similarly, it arrested KANU M.P.
 Njenga Mungai (who has since defected to the Democratic Party) in March and
 charged him with rumormongering, following his accusations that the Government
 connived with Kalenjins to attack Kikuyus in Molo district, an accusation later lent
 credence by the Kiliku parliamentary report. Charges were dropped soon after.
 When MP Abdi Ogle tabled a report that most heads of state-owned companies were
 from the President's own ethnic group, he was prevented from bringing the matter
 to the floor for debate.
 Kenyan church leaders are generally free to comment on religious and political
 topics and are often vocal in their criticism of the Government. However, the Presi-
 dent and other government figures have denounced church leaders who take stands
 on public issues. For example, after the release of the National Council of Churches
 of Kenya (NCCK) report on the tribal clashes, President Moi threatened the NCCK
 with deregistration.
 The Government introduced a sweeping new libel law, which would mandate crip-
 pling minimum penalties for' offenders. It would impose a minimum penalty of
 $30,000 on anyone convicted in a case where the defamation or libel concerns an
 offense punishable by death. Other minimum penalties are assessed for different
 categories of libel. Because or the precarious financial situation of most private press
 organs in Kenya, the likely effect would be to dampen press criticism of the Govern-
 ment and the ruling party and to restrict the overall quantity of public information
 in the media.
 Although there was no systematic censorship of the press during the year, the
 Government attempted to set limits on public discourse and to intimidate editors
 into self-censorship. After the advent of a multiparty system in late 1991, the press
 began to cover political events in a more vigorous and critical spirit. National news-
 papers criticized the President and his associates in terms that would have con-
 stituted sedition a year earlier. Several new publications were launched. They
 voiced often extreme criticism of government policies. Yet the Government continued
 
 
 123
 to harass and intimidate the press through threats of physical violence, arbitrary
 arrests, impoundment of printed materiaL and pressure on those making editorial
 decisions.
 The Government owns and controls the single radio station and its affiliate tele-
 vision station, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. They typically avoid stories crit-
 ical of the Government, give a large share of news time to government or ruling
 party functions, and have consistently failed to give equal and accurate coverage to
 opposition activities. A second television station,-Kenya Television Network, adheres
 to self-imposed guidelines. Government influence on editorial content, both directly
 and through the chairman of the board, increased markedly in 1992. Most blatantly
 on Christmas day, 1991, a Kenya Television Network (KTN) news editor was sacked
 for airing a news item embarrassing to the Government, ostensibly for failing to
 clear it with 'authorities." The Government has not issued a license for a private
 radio station, though there has been at least one application. Radio is the medium
 through which most Kenyans get their news.
 The KANU-owned televison outlet carries Cable News Network programs, gen-
 erally without restriction, though at times stories about Kenya have been deleted.
 Nairobi's extensive international press corps has not been restricted in its move-
 ments or reporting. However, foreign journals containing unflattering accounts of
 Kenya have been seized at the airport. A number of books remain banned, including
 a Kiswahili edition of George Orwell's "Animal Farm."
 That said, the independent printed press, in particular the Nation and the Stand-
 ard newspaper, gave extensive coverage to charges of government involvement in
 tribal clashes, government failure to respond to the drought conditions in the North,
 allegations of financial mismanagement or malfeasance by senior government offi-
 cials, police brutality at opposition political rallies, and otier stories critical of the
 Government. Overall, the extension of multiparty politics gave the newspapers
 much freer rein to report news items and express opinions critical of the Govern-
 ment. However, the Government often took an adversarial stance towards the inde-
 pendent press and continued to use official intimidation to temper news content. Po-
 ice held senior editors and local reporters of the Nation and the Standard for ques-
 tioning, one overnight, after the two papers carried graphic reports of the ethnic
 fighting in Western and Nyanza provinces. None were charged, but the Standard
 bowed to government pressure by suspending two editors. Provincial officials and
 M.P.'s issued death threats against reporters from the Nation for writing stories
 without seeking government clearance. Police have physically assaulted or otherwise
 harassed reporters covering events embarrassing to the Government.
 Weekly magazines, which were more strident in their criticism of the Govern-
 ment, bore the brunt of the government backlash. In January police impounded an
 entire issue of Society magazine, even before an injunction was obtained through
 the court. They impounded later issues of the weekly magazine in March and again
 in June, and the authorities arrested and arraigned the editors and the publisher
 for sedition. In July the police arrested the publisher of Finance magazine on simi-
 lar charges. All were released on exorbitant bond soon after the arrest, but the At-
 torney General has still not signed the prosecution orders in either case. Further,
 two consecutive issues of Finance magazine were impounded by the Government in
 November, the second before it had been released by the printer.
 A number of academics voiced public criticism of government policies despite a
 continuing government effort to control dissent among both faculty and students at
 the countrys major universities. College students in Nairobi fought a losing battle
 to get their Students of Nairobi University (SONI) organization recognized by the
 school administration. Although the organization is called for under university
 rules, the Government has banned the organization off and on for years, in conjunc-
 tion with variations in the level of antigovernment agitation at the school.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly, while
 provided for in the Constitution, is seriously limited by the Public Order and Police
 Act, which gives authorities power to control public gatherings. The Act makes it
 illegal to ho d an unlicensed meeting of three or more persons but does not apply
 to persons meeting on church property for religious purposes.
 Though the beginning of 1992 was notable for large and peaceful opposition rallies
 around the country, the Government denied official permission for many opposition
 rallies, often at the last moment. For example, the authorities revoked official per-
 mits for DP and Kenya National Democratic Party (KENDA) rallies on May 30 at
 the last minute for "security reasons." Opposition candidates were often barred from
 speaking at public meetings in strategic electoral areas, even at meetings which had
 previously received administrative approval from the Government. Opposition par-
 ties were almost completely denied access to Northeast Province, for example. Local
 government officers, who are responsible for the regulation of public meetings, did
 
 
 124
 not perform impartially. The International Republican Institute elections observa-
 tion team said, "The discretion and selectivity with which local administrative offi-
 cials have granted licenses (for public rallies) has severely hampered the ability of
 opposition parties to communicate their message to the people of Kenya." At a DP
 rally in Western Province in December, police disobeyed an order by the District Of-
 ricer to shoot attendants who had assembled for an unauthorized meeting.
 The Government and the security forces were generally hostile to demonstrations,
 and police often broke up unapproved (and some approved) rallies brutally. On
 March 2, baton-wielding riot police forcibly dispersed a 2,000-person rally to free po-
 litical prisoners. The Nairobi police commissioner justified the clubbing of unarmed,
 peaceful demonstrators on the grounds that the participants had failed to obtain a
 license. The next day, citing a threat to public order and security, the police and
 the paramilitary General Services Unit descended on a gathering at Uhuru Park,
 where the "Mothers of Political Prisoners" group was staging a hunger strike. Secu-
 rity forces beat the hunger strikers supporters, and bystanders, and injured many,
 including Professor Wangari Maatiai and British Broadcasting Corporation cor-
 respondent Lucy Hannah. The Government then announced a 20-day moratorium
 on all political meetings.
 The Societies Act governs freedom of association; it states that every association
 must be registered or exempted from registration by the Registrar of Societies. Non-
 governmental organizations have protested requirements that they register every 5
 years, as an attempt by the Government to control human rights and charitable ac-
 tivities. Since the repeal of Section 2(a) of the Constitution in November 1991,
 Kenyans have been free to join the political party of their choice, and 10 parties
 have been registered.
 Nine registered parties in Kenya participated in the December elections: KANU,
 FORD Kenya, FORD Asili the DP the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Kenya Na-
 tional Democratic Party (kENDA), Kenya National Congre  (KNC), Labor Party
 Democracy (LPD), Kenya Social Congress, and Party of Indepndent Candidates of
 Kenya    CK). The Government refused to registerat least  e, including the Is-
 lamic Party of Kenya (IPK), the Democratic Movement (DEMO), and the Socialist
 Alliance of Peasants and the Proletariats (sic) of Kenya (SOPPOK). At least 14 other
 parties applied but did not receive a response from the Government, including at
 least 2 environmental parties, which were refused registration by the Attorney Gen-
 eral as threats t the security of the State.
 The argistration of party branches did not proceed without government harass-
 ment. (Without branches open parties are unable to hold grassroots elections or
 conduct local meetings.) Both FORD and DP publicly complained that the Govern-
 ment was stalling the registration of branch offices. After a meeting between the
 Attorney General and opposition leaders,the proces went more smoothly.
 More serious was the inflammatory rhetoric of some KANU leaders and senior
 government officials which appeared to spark violence at the opening of opposition
 party branch offices and at political rallies. For example, on Febuary 23, MIP Wil-
 liam Ole Ntimama declared Narek a K         zone, and Vice President George
 Saitoti openly boasted that noFORD office would be opened there. Within a week
 an attack on a FORD convoy seeking to open an office in Ngng sent some FORD
 officials to the hospital, including Ms. Wambui Otieno with a broken wrist. Violent
 attacks by KANU partisans were repeated when FORD went to open offices in
 Nakuru, Garissa, and Kiambu.
 Senior Government and KANU officials consistently betrayed an animosity toward
 oppsition political activities, calling for constituents, to "slap" FORD adherents,
 warning opposition members to stay out of "KANU zones," and ordering FORD to
 close its offc in Aagoro within ten days or it would be burned down. Ethnic fight-
 ing closely followed such statements in Nandi district, Uasin Gishu, Narok, and
 M ount  Elgon.        p      e                              '
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Kenya has no state religion. Freedom of worship is ac-
 knowledged in the Constitution and generally allowed but churches new to Kenya
 must obtain government apphaoval to be registered.
 Muslims were incensed by the insensitivity of police who, in May, broke into a
 Mombasa mosque to arrest preachers who had made speeches denouncing the Gov-
 ernment's refusal to register the Islamic Party of Kenya. Church figures remain con-
 cerned about last year's new law to regulate nongovernmental organizations in
 Kenya, which might in some cases impose government controls over church projects.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigation, and Re-
 patriation.-Kenyan law gives all Kenyans the riht to travel freery, to settle, and
 to conduct business, which includes obtaining lantitles, in any area of the country.
 Kenya does not generally prohibit emigration of its citizens but has in the past pre-
 vented travel abroad usualy by critics of the Government. In 1992 the Government
 
 
 relaxed its restrictive travel policies, even allowing vocal government critic Wangari
 Maathai to travel to the Rio de Janeiro environmental conference in May, while out
 on bail on charges of rumormongering (see Section 2.a.). It is highly unlikely she
 would have been allowed to travel before the political reforms of late 1991.
 The Government does not regard issuance of passports to its citizens as a right
 and reserves the authority to issue or deny passports at its discretion. The Govern-
 ment restored the citizenship of Kenyan citizen Salim Lone by formally publishing
 notice in the Kenya Gazette. It had revoked his citizenship in 1986 on grounds of
 "disloyal speech."
 In 1991 Kenya was inundated by a flood of Somali, Ethiopian, and Sudanese refu-
 gees, fleeing chaos and conflict in their home countries. Kenya has accepted most
 asylum seekers, though sometimes entry is delayed, resulting in hardship and de-
 nial of assistance. None of these refugees has been granted legal status, other than
 that of asylum seeker. In 1990 there were only 14,000 refugees; at the end of 1992
 there were about 400,000 refugees residing in camps, and the Government esti-
 mated that 100,000 refugees were living outside the camps in cities and rural areas.
 (The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees puts the latter figure at about 20,000.)
 Somalis account for about 75 percent of the total. Refugees outside of the camps are
 extremely vulnerable to arrest. The Government organized a roundup of about 2,000
 people in August. Refugees who purchase fake indentification documents and visas
 put themselves even further at risk. There is increasing violence in the northeast,
 where most of the camps are situated, and there were cross-border incursions by
 armed Somalis.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Kenya held general elections on December 29 for the Presidency, Members of Par-
 liament, and local government officials; however, the conduct of these elections in-
 volved serious faults which at year's end left unclear the ability of the Kenyan peo-
 ple to change their government by democratic means. One observer mission called
 the electoral process "seriously flawed." Nevertheless, a large number of Kenyans
 participated in a multiparty process which resulted in the election of many opposi-
 tion candidates at both the local and national levels.
 In late 1991 after mass street protests and pressure from foreign donors, Presi-
 dent Moi agreed to permit multiparty democracy in Kenya. Opposition parties were
 registered, and in April the National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act was
 amended. In practice, Kenyans are generally free to take part in the political proc-
 ess, to run for office, and to support candidates or parties, in spite of government
 interference. The opposition was active, opening branch offices, holding public ral-
 lies, and fielding candidates, but did face attempts by the Government to limit its
 activities.
 During the campaign, government officials at a number of levels were intolerant
 of opposition activities. For example, President Moi announced on October 5 that
 any public servant found supporting the opposition would be fired. In October Min-
 ister of Agriculture Elijah Mwangale called on his fellow Luhyas to chase the oppo-
 sition from Western province. And the press reported in September that local offi-
 cials in Machakos were distributing famine aid to people based on party affiliation,
 refusing it to those who did not support the ruling party (see also Section 2.b.).
 The opposition argued that the voter registrationprocess was flawed and may
 have prerigged the election. There were reports in the press that members of the
 Government were handing out voter registration cards to KANU supporters, while
 people in opposition groups were denied cards. There were also reports that officials
 distributed registration cards afer the end of the registrationTperiod. However, the
 process registered a large number and a wide cross-section of Kenyans; the Govern-
 ment estimated that 8 million of Kenya's 11 million eligible voters were registered.
 The Government twice extended the registration deadline after the opposition called
 off its boycott.
 The opposition also charged that the Electoral Commission, largely unchanged
 from its composition during the previous, one-party election, could not be impartial.
 A law suit by the opposition to replace the Commission Chairman, Justice Z.R.
 Chesoni, was dismissed by the court. Although there was widespread criticism dur-
 ing the registration and campaign periods, the Electoral Commission performed
 moderately better as the election date approached and was able to correct the most
 glaring instances of electoral irregularities. However, the Commission's unwilling-
 ness to address the numerous claims of irregularities during the vote-counting proc-
 ess on and after election day provoked fresh criticism from the opposition and
 human rights groups and called into question its commitment to impartiality.
 
 
 126
 Seeking to respond to the concerns of Kenyans and foreign donors that past elec-
 tions had been rigged, President Moi invited international observers and asked
 "nonpartisan" groups within Kenya to apply to the Electoral Commission in order
 to witness the elections. Some international observers were denied visas, and some
 potential election observer groups were denied registration by the Electoral Commis-
 sion. Nevertheless, there was a large international observer presence, and the Na-
 tional Elections Monitoring Unit (NEMU) fielded local election monitors in approxi-
 mately 70 to 80 percent of the nation's pollingplaces.
 The elections took place without violence. Voters remained patient in the face of
 long lines and widespread administrative confusion, including a number of irreg-
 ularities such as the absence of ballots and boxes at some polling stations 9 hours
 after polls were to have opened. The vote-counting process was more gravely flawed.
 Opposition parties and local monitors charged that ballot boxes were introduced into
 some counting halls with broken seals or without any seals at all, ballot papers were
 found bound together by counting officers, party agents and election observers were
 thrown out of counting halls during the counting process, and there were vote totals
 in some constituencies exceeding the number of registered voters. The Electoral
 Commission decided that such irregularities could not be addressed by the Commis-
 sion, but must go through the courts.
 Women political figures made substantial gains in 1992. A record number of
 women vied for Parliament in the general election, and six were elected (in the last
 Parliament, there were only two women members). Women's issues were not central
 to the campaign but did receive substantial press coverage.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Before 1992 there were no local organizations solely devoted to investigating
 human rights abuses. Lawyers, church groups, and elements of the printed press
 functioned as de facto human rights monitors, but they faced serious obstacles, in-
 cluding harsh government criticism, restrictions on free speech and assembly, and
 in the case of some attorneys, harassment by the police and the courts. In 1992
 Makao wa Mutua, a former Kenyan human rights lawyer who now works at Har-
 vard University, founded the Kenya Human Rights Commission. While the organi-
 zation is new, in 1992 the Government allowed it to work free of harassment.
 The Government reacts negatively to criticism of its human rights record, at home
 and abroad. Through its accusations of association with "foreign masters," the Gov-
 ernment discourages Kenyans from providing outside human rights groups with in-
 formation. When the NCCK released a report on the ethnic clashes which harshly
 criticised the Government's role in the troubles, President Moi threatened the
 NCCK with deregistration. Other government officials have criticized "foreign med-
 dling" from international human rights groups and the diplomatic community. Dur-
 ing 1992 the Government denied the National Democratic Institute, a nonpartisan
 elections observer group, permission to register as election monitors. A visit by a
 delegation from the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights was also
 not permitted.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Kenya is an ethnically diverse country; the Constitution and laws prohibit dis-
 crimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, language, or social status.
 Members of all ethnic groups may run for office, and ethnic representation at the
 minister and assistant minister level is broad. The Asian community, numbering
 about 65,000, accounts for a disproportionate share of the nation's economic wealth
 and output, but very few Asians participate in electoral politics. The Kikuyu remain
 the largest and richest indigenous ethnic group in Kenya. Ministers and other offi-
 cials employed anti-Kikuyu language without official rebuke, particularly in connec-
 tion with Kikuyu voter registration in areas of the country traditionally inhabited
 by other tribes. (See Section l.a. on government involvement in tribal clashes.)
 The Government singled oiit ethnic Somalis as the only ethnic group in Kenya re-
 quired to carry an additional form of identification stating that they are Kenyan
 citizens. In 1990 the Government required ethnic Somalis to have their claim to
 Kenyan citizenship verified by a panel of Somali elders through a "screening" proc-
 ess. This screening effort continued through the first 3 months of 1990 and then was
 phased out, although its practical effects remained. The screening has been widely
 criticized as discriminatory, unconstitutional and without a basis in law. Ethnic So-
 malis must still produce upon demand their Kenyan identification card and a second
 identification verifying "screening." Both cards are also required in order to apply
 for a passport, and airlines have en required to submit passports held by Kcnyan
 Somalis for verification before issuing tickets to such persons.

 Some Muslim Kenyans argue that the Government's refusal to register the Is-
 lamic Party of Kenya is discriminatory, although the Attorney General maintains
 that the ban is necessary to ensure peace and security. In a public speech on
 Madaraka Day in June, President Moi linked Kenya's coastal Muslims to the slave
 trade. Many Muslims interpreted those comments, as well as severe police violence
 against political protesters in Mombasa and the arrest of religious leader sheik
 Balala in July, as evidence of a policy of discrimination.
 While there is no legal discrimination against women, and they may own property
 and businesses, traditional culture and attitudes have long prescribed limited roles
 for women. Women's roles are particularly restricted in rural areas where they ac-
 count for 75 percent of the total agricultural work force. Rural families are more
 reluctant to invest in educating girls than in educating boys, especially at the higher
 levels. The number of girls and boys in school are roughly equal at the primary and
 secondary levels, but men outnumber women almost two to one in higher education.
 According to 1990 estimates, only 58 percent of the women over 15 can read and
 write, while 80 percent of the men are literate.
 Though women are increasingly active in the modern economy, the number of
 women in professional roles is still limited. The number of female unemployed is
 double that of men. Women sometimes receive lower rates of pay than men perform-
 ing the same job, and disparities in fringe benefits occur eg., some businesses give
 housing allowances to men but not to married women. Women constitute about 60
 percent of the work force.
 Polygamy is not legal for people married under the Christian Marriage Act, but
 it is permitted for those who marry under African customary law. Kenya's law of
 succession, which governs inheritance rights, provides for equal treatment of male
 and female children.
 The Government strongly condemns extreme violence towards women, specifically
 murder, female genital mutilation (circumcision), rape, and incest. In many cases,
 rapists particularly of minors, are given sentences of up to 14 years in prison. How-
 ever, tle ambivalence of many Kenyans to the abuse of women was demonstrated
 by a case of multiple rape and manslaughter in 1991, when a group of 50 adolescent
 boys attending St. Kizito boarding school broke into the crowded dormitory housing
 their female contemporaries. In the panic that ensued, 19 girls were suffocate  and
 medical evidence indicated that 71 girls were raped. Only four of the defendants
 were convicted, none for rape. Despite public expressions of horror at the event,
 tany Kenyans acknowledge that rapes occur frequentlyin Kenyoan schools.
 Domestic violence, such as wife beating, occurs in Kenya, but little information
 is available on the extent of the problem. Women's groups report that domestic vio-
 lence is widespread and have launched education efforts to ombat it. In practice
 most cases of domestic violence are settled outside of the courts. The maximum legal
 penalty is 5 years in prisn. Women can also sue for civil damages.
 Female genital mutilation is illegal but still practiced by some Kenyan ethnic
 goups, usually performed on girls under the abe of 16. The Government officially
 discourages the practice but leaves it to women a groups to oppose such mutlation
 through health education programs. Murder or manslaughter charges are brought
 when the practice results in death. There are press reports of community-forced mu-
 tilations, but charges are seldom brought in such cases.
 Section 6. Worker Rights      p
 a. The Right of Association.--Save for central government civil servants, all work-
 ors are free to join unions of their own choosing. The law provides that as few as
 seven workers may establish a union, provided that objectives of the uniondo not
 contravene Kenyan law and another union is not already representative of the em-
 ployes in question. The Government may deregister a union, but the Registrar of
 Trode Unions must give the union 60 days to challenge the deregistration notice:
 an aeal of the Registrar's final decision may be brought before the High Court.
 Present Moi deregistered the Kenya Civil Servants Union more than 10 years ago.
 Since 1989 the Central Oranization of Trade Unions (COTU) sought to reverse this
 decision, and in 1991 Prsident Moi reinstated the Civil Servants Union.
 There are at least 33 unions in Kenya representing approximately 350,0000 to
 385,000 workers, or about 25 percent of the country's industrialized work force. Ex-
 cept for the 150,000 to 200,000 teachers believed to be members of the Kenya Na-
 tional Union of Teachers and four other smaller unions, which the Government has
 registered, all other unions are afliated with one central body, the COTU. The Gov-
 ernment created COTU in 1965 as the successor to both the Kenya Federation of
 Labor and the Kenya African Workers Congress. This amalgamation was effected
 allegedly to eliminate instability and rivalries within the nation's trade union move-
 ment.
 
 
 128
 Although it is claimed that COTU is independent of the Government and KANU,
 the 1965 decree establishing COTU gives the President the authority to remove
 from offlice the central body's senior leaders. The COTU constitution accords
 nonvoting membership on the executive board (COTU's managing body) to a rep-
 resentative of the Labor Ministry as well as of KANU. COTU Secretary General o-
 seph Mugalla supports President Moi, and many-who serve on COTU's board are
 life members of KANU. Mugalla was reelected Secretary General in 1991, and a suit
 brought by his opponents challenging his reelection was dismissed.
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike provided that 21 days have
 elapsed following the submission to the Minister of Labor of a written report detail-
 ing the nature of the dispute. During this 21-day period, the Minister may either
 mediate the dispute himself, nominate a person to investigate and propose a solu-
 tion, or refer the matter to the Industrial Court, a body of five judges appointed by
 the President, for binding arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to either mediation,
 fact.finding, or arbitration, any'subsequent strike is illegal.
 The military, police, prison quards, and members of the National Youth Service
 are precluded by law from striking. Other civil servants like their private sector
 counterparts, may strike following the 21-day notice period (28 days if it is an essen-
 tial service, e.g., water, health, education, air traffic control). However, the Labor
 Minister may at any time preempt a strike involving civil servants by referring the
 dispute to the Industrial ourt or resolution. There were no significant strikes in
 1992. A threatened strike by 200,000 teachers was averted when President Moi took
 unilateral action to accede to their demands.
 Internationally, COTU is afftliated with both the continentwide Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity and the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. Its affiliates freely join international trade secretariats of their choosing.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-While not having the force
 of law, the 1962 Industrial Relations Charter, executed by the Government, COTU,
 and the Federation of Kenya Employers, gives workers the right to engage in legiti-
 mate trade union organizational activities.
 Both the Trade Disputes Act and the Charter authorize collective bargaining be-
 tween unions and employers. Wages and conditions of employment are established
 in the context of negotiations between unions and management. The Government
 has promulgated wage policy guidelines limiting wage increases to 75 percent of the
 annual rate of inflation. Coetive bargaining agreements must be registered with
 the Industrial Court for the purpose of guaranteeing adherence to these guidelines.
 In 1992 there were 1,875 agreements registered with the Court. Some 1 million
 workers (union and nonunion) are covered by these accords. The Trade Disputes Act
 makes it. illegal for employers to intimidate workers. Employees wrongfully dis-
 missed for union activities are generally awarded damages in the form of lost wages
 by the Industrial Court; reinstatement is not a common remedy. This is due in large
 measure to the fact that most aggrieved workers have found alternative employment
 in the lengthy period prior to the hearing of their cases.
 The International Labor. Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) ob-
 served in its 1992 report that the Government of Kenya, in accordance with Article
 10 of ILO Convention 143, should promote equality of opportunity and treatment
 for migrant workers, including trade union rights.
 Legislation authorizing the creation of export processing zones (EPZ) waspassed
 in November 1990; one has been established to date. The EPZ Authority has decided
 that local labor laws will apply generally in the zones, including the right to orga-
 nize and bargain collectively. In practice, it grants many exemptions. For example,
 the Government is waiving aspects of the law that prevent women from working at
 night because of the large number of women employed in a number of industries
 in the zones (see also Section 6.e.).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, servitude, and forced labor. Under the Chiefs' Authority Act, a local authority
 can require people to perforinj community services in an emergency, but there were
 no known instances of this practice in 1992. People so employed must be paid the
 prevailing wage for such employment. The IL COE has, found these and other pro-
 visions of Kenyan law to contravene ILO Conventions 29 and 105 concerning forced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment Act of 1976 pro-
 scribes the employment in any industrial undertaking of children under the age of
 16. This enactment applies neither to the agricultural sector, where about 70 per-
 cent of the labor force is employed, nor to children serving as apprentices under the
 terms of the Industrial Training Act. Ministry of Labor officers nominally enforce
 the minimum age statute. Given the high levels of adult unemployment and
 
 
 underemployment, the employment of children in the formal wage sector in violation
 of the Employment Act is not a significant problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for blue-collar work-
 ers in the wage sector varies by location, age, and skills. Vioations of the minimum
 wage guidlines sre not a recurring problem in the modern wage sector. Despite
 nominal wages increases inflation on the order of 25 or 30 percent and a decline
 in the value of the shilling eroded workers' living standards during 1992. Most
 workers continued to lead a marginal existence and had to rely on second jobs, some
 ubsistence farming, or the extended family.
 The Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits the standard
 workweek to 52 hours. Nighttime employees, however, may be employed up to 60
 hours a week. As is the case with respect to minimum age limitations, the Act
 specificially excludes agricultural workers from its purview. An employee in the non-
 agricultural sector is entitled to 1 rest day in a week. There are also prvisions for
 1 month of annual leave and sick leave. Concerning limits on overtime, Kenyan law
 provides that the total hours worked (i.e., regular time plus overtime) in any 2-week
 period for nightworkers may not exceed 144 hours; the limit is 120 hours for other
 workers. The Labor Ministry is tasked with enforcing these regulations, and reports
 of violations are few.
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and safety standards; the Act
 was amended in 1990 to encompass the agriculture, service, and government sec-
 tors. The 65 health and safety inspectors attached to the Ministry of Labor's Direc-
 torate of Occupational Health and Safety Services have the authority to inspect fac-
 tories and work sites if they have reason to believe that a violation of the Act has
 occurred or upon receipt of a complaint from a worker. As a result of the 1990
 amendments, the Directorate's inspectors may now issue notices eroining employ-
 er from practices or activities which involve a risk of serious personal injuries.PVre-
 viously, only magistrates were vested with this authority.
 Such notices can be appealed to the Factories Appeals Court, a body of four mem-
 bers, one of whonvmust be a High Court judge. In practice, inspectors, who conduct
 2,000 to 3,000 inspections annually, generally respond onlyr to worker complaints.
 "WVhistle blowers" are not protected by the Factories Act. Kenya's workmen s com-
 pensation regulations do not yet comply with provisions of ILO Convention 17.
