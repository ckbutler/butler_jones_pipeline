 BHUTAN*
 Bhutan is a Buddhist kingdom of some 18,000 square miles,
 bordering India and China. According to national census
 estimates the population is around 1.4 million. During the
 rule (1952-72) of King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, Bhutan began to
 emerge from centuries of medieval seclusion and progressed
 toward a more representative political system. Although the
 King, a hereditary monarch, retained strong executive powers,
 he created several important institutions such as the National
 Assembly (1953), the Royal Advisory Council (1965), and the
 Council of Ministers (1968) to provide broader participation
 in the Government. Serfdom was abolished, land reform
 introduced, codification of laws begun, and the judiciary
 separated from the executive. The present monarch, Jigme
 Singye Wangchuck, has continued Bhutan's social and political
 evolution. Bhutan maintains diplomatic relations with India,
 Bangladesh, and Nepal and is a member of the U.N. Although a
 1949 treaty obligates Bhutan to consult with India concerning
 the conduct of its foreign affairs, Bhutan is not compelled to
 follow India's guidance and does, for example, vote
 independently from India in international fora.
 There was little apparent change in the human rights situation
 in Bhutan in 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment or treatment. Bhutanese society, largely agrarian
 and traditional, is peaceful and has a very low crime rate.
 Punishment for most crimes ranges from fines to imprisonment.
 Mutilation was outlawed in 1965.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no special or preventive detention, and arrests can
 be made only under legal authority. As far as is known, exile
 is not employed as a form of punishment.
 *Bhutan and the U.S. do not maintain formal diplomatic
 relations, and U.S. officials rarely travel there.
 Information on Bhutanese practices in connection with human
 rights matters is, therefore, neither readily available nor
 complete.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bhutan has no written constitution; instead, justice is
 administered under an eighteenth century legal code which has
 been revised in recent years. Criminal cases and a variety of
 civil matters as well are treated under the code which applies
 to all Bhutanese. Traditional law still governs familial
 matters, however. Approximately 25 percent of the population
 is of Nepalese origin and, in ethnic Nepali areas, traditional
 Hindu law is administered. Buddhist norms are applied in
 other regions. Although the country's legal system does not
 provide for juries or the right to be represented by legal
 counsel, trials are generally expeditious and public;
 qualified observers report that they conform to the local
 population's concept of impartiality and justice. A separate
 judiciary was established in 1968 which provides for local,
 district, and national courts with original and appellate
 jurisdiction. Final appeals may be made to the King.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are no written guarantees for privacy in the Bhutanese
 system, but tradition has bolstered the concept. In practice,
 the Government does not intervene arbitrarily or unreasonably
 in the lives of the people.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The only publications currently produced are a weekly and a
 monthly government journal and a weekly private newspaper.
 Indian newspapers and Western news magazines are also
 distributed in Bhutan without apparent government
 control. India has agreed to assist Bhutan construct a radio
 transmitter for a national radio station. Indian and other
 foreign newspapers and publications are allowed free access.
 Criticism of the King is permitted in the National Assembly,
 but civil and political liberties are not guaranteed in a
 written constitution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No written guarantees of these freedoms exist, but Bhutanese
 generally enjoy the freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Buddhism is the state religion, members of other
 faiths, who are mainly Hindus of Nepali origin, enjoy freedom
 of worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for Bhutanese
 citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel.
 Permanent residence for Nepalis and Indians in Bhutan (except
 those in government service) is restricted to the southern
 hill region. Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and
 exiles from other countries in the region. Some 6,000 Tibetan
 refugees sought refuge in Bhutan after 1959, joining
 
 
 1199
 BHUTAN
 approximately 4,000 Tibetans already in the country.
 Because it perceived threats to national security resulting
 from the Tibetan refugees' lack of allegiance to Bhutan, the
 Government required in 1979-80 that they either accept
 Bhutanese citizenship or face expulsion. When India and other
 countries initially refused to accept them, Bhutan's policy
 raised the possibility of forcible repatriation. However, the
 Government decided not to carry out its threat. Most Tibetans
 in Bhutan have accepted Bhutanese citizenship. They have been
 assured by the Bhutanese Government that they will always be
 free to return to their homeland.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There are no political parties and their formation appears to
 be discouraged. The 150-member National Assembly is composed
 of 100 members elected on a limited franchise (heads of family
 in Hindu areas, village headmen in Buddhist regions), 10
 elected by the organization of lamas (Buddhist leaders), 2
 elected by the business community, and the remainder appointed
 by the King. Though the King's executive powers dominate inj
 the Government, the Assembly enacts laws, approves senior
 appointments, and advises the King on matters of national
 importance. It also provides a forum for ventilating
 grievances and rectifying cases of maladministraton. The King
 cannot veto legislation passed by the National Assembly,
 although he can refer bills back to it for further
 consideration. Local administration is carried out by
 centrally appointed government officials. Villages, however,
 have the traditional right to elect their own headmen, who
 form the lowest rung of the administrative hierarchy.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international agency or group is known to have sought entry
 into Bhutan to investigate alleged violations of human
 rights. Amnesty International does not report on Bhutan;
 Freedom House calls the country 'partly free." No
 non-governmental human rights groups are known to exist in
 Bhutan.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The vast majority of the population is illiterate and rural,
 following traditional agricultural and pastoral pursuits in a
 largely barter economy. Virtually all families own enough
 land to feed and clothe themselves adequately by local
 standards. While poverty exists in remote areas, the
 destitution sometimes found in other parts of the subcontinent
 is absent. The Government has set land taxes low enough not
 to burden even small landholders. It has abolished the
 traditional and substantial payment in kind by local populaces
 to monastic organizations. Under successive five-year
 development plans begun in 1961, Bhutan has improved its
 agriculture, roads and freight ropeways, communications,
 education, and health.
 Although comprehensive economic and social statistics do not
 exist, World Bank figures give some indication of Bhutan's
 development over the last 20 years. Bhutan is one of the
 
 
 1200
 BHUTAN
 world's least developed nations, with an annual per capita
 gross national product (GNP) in 1982 of only $132, and a ratio
 of calorie supply for consumption (relative to nutritional
 requirements) of about 88 percent (in 1977). Life expectancy
 at birth has risen from 36 years (in 1960) to over 44 years.
 The infant mortality rate is 124 per 1,000 live births.
 Estimated net annual population increase is 2.1 percent.
 Smallpox has been eradicated, and programs launched to control
 malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, and goiter. Bhutan receives
 some financial and technical assistance through the U.N.
 Development Program and the Colombo Plan. Primary education
 is free, and higher level students often receive free board
 and lodging. Although primary school enrollment quadrupled
 between 1960 and 1979, the ratio to the primary school-age
 population was still only 13 percent in 1979, and boys tend to
 outnumber girls by about two to one. Adult literacy stood at
 only 5 percent in 1970.
 There are few social and economic indicators available on the
 status of women. Under Bhutanese law, no distinction is made
 between the status of men and women. The general impression
 given by the literature on Bhutan suggests that the society
 and economy are relatively egalitarian.
