 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is the newest independent country in sub-Saharan Africa,
 having achieved internationally-recognized independence from
 Great Britain in 1980. Internationally-supervised general
 elections were held in February 1980, leading to a victory for
 the Zimbabwe African National Union Party led by Robert Mugabe,
 who formed a coalition government with Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe
 African People's Union. The Zimbabwe Constitution was developed
 with international supervision prior to independence, and con-
 tains protection for individual, political, and property rights.
 Legislative authority in Zimbabwe's parliamentary democracy
 resides in a Parliament consisting of a 100-member House of
 Assembly and a 40-member Senate. Executive authority lies with
 a Cabinet led by the Prime Minister.
 The new Government has followed a policy of national reconcilia-
 tion and respect for human rights throughout its first two and a
 half years, although recent tensions and internal violence have
 produced violations of that position. In February 1982, Prime
 Minister Mugabe ousted Joshua Nkomo and four of his party
 colleagues from the Cabinet after large caches of arms were
 found on properties belonging to the party. Two former leaders
 of the party's military wing were arrested at approximately the
 same time and were subsequently charged with treason and unlawful
 possession of arms of war. The breakup of the two-party coali-
 tion has led to increased tensions in the predominantly Ndebele
 populated southwest of the country, where Nkomo's party is
 based. Efforts by the Government to control this dissident
 activity have led to increased friction between the Ndebele
 minority (roughly 17 percent of the population) and the Shona
 majority (some 70 percent) which mainly supports Mugabe's party
 and the Government.
 Prime Minister Mugabe has repeatedly stated that he intends to
 transform Zimbabwe into a one-party state. However, he has
 pledged to abide by the popular consensus, and to act in
 conformity with the provisions of the Constitution, which would
 appear to rule out a one-party state in the near future unless
 all 100 members of the Parliament voted to amend the Constitu-
 tion, a highly unlikely occurrence.
 At independence, the new Government affirmed its socialist
 ideology, but set out to build on and develop the existing
 (primarily capitalist and highly-developed) system as the best
 way to extend economic benefits to the poor majority. Prime
 Minister Mugabe emphasized racial, tribal, and political recon-
 ciliation, and assured whites that jobs and property would be
 secure if they remained in the country and supported the new
 Government. The predominantly white civil service and judiciary
 were retained, but qualified blacks have been promoted or hired
 to fill vacancies which have occurred.
 The economy was functioning well at independence. Despite set-
 backs caused by serious foreign exchange shortages, transport
 bottlenecks, and the shortage of a large highly-skilled labor
 force as the result of white emigration, the economy is still
 very much intact. Although Zimbabwe has not reached the level
 of economic growth the Government had hoped to achieve by this
 time, the prognosis is good, and the Government's continuing
 pragmatism towards the private sector is a good omen for the
 economic future of the country.
 
 
 The Government has charged that South Africa is attempting to
 destabilize Zimbabwe and that domestic political opponents are
 wittingly or unwittingly aiding South African efforts in both
 the political and economic fields. The Emergency Powers Act,
 a measure adopted during the guerrilla war prior to independence
 and allowing suspension of certain political and civil liberties,
 has been extended by the present Government. The principal
 extra-constitutional power exercised by the Government has been
 the ability to detain people deemed to be threats to security or
 public order, subject to judicial review.
 Zimbabwe inherited a legal system based on the British common
 law tradition. The judiciary remains independent. Aside from
 matters the Government regards as directly related to the
 security situation, the rights of the person are generally
 respected, and in detention cases the courts make an effort to
 assure that the established norms are followed. However, there
 have been recent credible reports of torture of certain detainees
 during interrogation by security forces. Press freedom has
 diminished since independence, although criticism of government
 officers and policies still appears. A machine-gun attack on
 Prime Minister Mugabe's residence in June 1982, the kidnapping
 of six foreign tourists, and the destruction by sabotage of
 roughly one-fourth of Zimbabwe's air force in late July have
 been cause for concern by the Government. Excesses, which have
 occurred, appear to have resulted from the Government's efforts
 to track down and punish the perpetrators of these and other
 deeds. However, allegations of torture, if the torture proves
 to have had approval at senior government levels, would suggest
 a serious new breach of human rights in Zimbabwe.
 Prime Minister Mugabe has evinced pragmatism and a commitment to
 reconciliation throughout his term of office. Of late, however,
 Zimbabwe has experienced an increasing breakdown of law and
 order. Mounting violence coupled with disrespect for law and
 order is causing some members of the white community, including
 the vital commercial farmers, to begin to consider the possi-
 bility of making plans to leave.
 The trend for continued respect for human rights will depend to
 a large extent on whether the Government is able to bring about
 a solution to one of Zimbabwe's major problems, which is politi-
 cal tensions between the Shona and Ndebele peoples. Government
 efforts to impose its will on the people of Matabeleland by force
 have resulted in infringements of their civil and political
 rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Killing
 There have been no allegations or reports of officially-supported
 or sanctioned killings for political purposes in Zimbabwe. There
 have been numerous killings throughout the year by elements re-
 ferred to by the Government as "bandits," meaning common thieves
 motivated by economic pressures, and "dissidents," meaning law-
 less elements motivated by political or ethnic considerations.
 Some of these killings have been political and included the
 settling of old scores from the independence struggle. Others
 appear to have been victims of circumstance; robbery victims who
 resisted and were slain, for example. The total number of such
 killings was probably no more than 35 in the first category, and
 perhaps 150 in the second. Precise figures are difficult to
 obtain.
 
 
 371
 Government security forces have mounted a vigorous anti-
 dissident campaign which has had some success in controlling
 the security situation. There have been allegations that some
 of the dissident activities are supported by the South African
 Government, but Zimbabwe officials have stated that other
 neighboring countries have been cooperating with their security
 efforts.
 b. Disappearance
 There were several cases in 1982 in which people were arrested or
 detained by official security forces without public knowledge or
 announcement. However, the fact of a detention usually has come
 to public attention quickly. There have been no known cases of
 government-sanctioned "disappearance' for prolonged periods.
 There is no confirmation that any detained persons are in fact
 dead, but there have been allegations that this is the case. On
 several occasions members of Parliament have called for an
 accounting of persons in detention, but the Home Affairs Minister
 has refused to respond to such questions.
 There have been some instances of disappearance resulting from
 dissident activity, most notably the kidnapping in late July of
 six foreign tourists, including two Americans. The ransom
 demands issued at the time of the kidnapping were political in
 nature.
 c. Torture
 The Constitution states "no person shall be subjected to torture
 or to inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment."
 There have, however, been allegations that various prisoners,
 including senior Zimbabwe air force officers arrested in an
 investigation of the sabotage of aircraft in July, were tortured
 during their interrogation. Attorneys for the officers have
 alleged that torture was carried out. Methods used reportedly
 included disorientation techniques such as sleep deprivation as
 well as electric shocks. Insofar as the Government has addressed
 the charges publicly, it has denied them, although there is a
 judicial inquiry into this matter.
 The trial of a former Member of Parliament was thrown out of
 court when the main prosecution witness recanted the allegation
 he had earlier made to police. He stated in court that his
 earlier statements were made "under wallops," but that he was
 telling the truth in open court. He and two other witnesses,
 whose testimony was much less damaging to the defendant than
 the prosecution expected, have been arrested and may be indicted
 for perjury. The charges of torture during interrogation in
 this case appear to be true. The Government has stated that any-
 one found guilty of mistreatment of prisoners will be punished.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 As noted above, there have been credible allegations of torture
 during interrogation. There have been no reports, however, of
 summary executions or severe physical punishments administered
 as sentences for crimes during 1982.
 Prison conditions are spartan but not unusually harsh. Diet,
 clothing, and exercise are governed by regulations; deprivation
 of necessities is not used as a disciplinary measure. Living
 conditions are sometimes crowded, with as many as 100 prisoners
 sharing a large room. More than 60 percent of black prisoners
 now sleep on beds -- virtually none did before independence.
 
 
 372
 The diet of all prisoners has been raised to that served to
 white prisoners at independence. Some 85 percent of the senior
 officers in the prison service are now black. Many prisoners
 are required to do manual or farm labor at prison facilities.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have been several reported cases of arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. The Constitution guarantees that no person shall
 be arrested or detained except by court order or "reasonable
 suspicion of his having committed or being about to commit a
 criminal offense." The Constitution also provides that a state
 of emergency may be declared by the Government, enabling the
 Prebident to enact Emergency Powers regulations. Such a decla-
 ration is still in effect, having been carried over basically
 intact from the Smith Government at independence. One section
 of the Emergency Powers regulations provides detention powers
 for the Home Affairs Minister and police officials acting under
 his authority. Any police officer may arrest and detain, without
 a warrant, a person he believes deserves detention. The Home
 Affairs Minister may also arrest and detain any person if this
 action appears expedient in the interests of public order and
 public safety. Any detention order, by a police officer or by
 the Minister, must be examined by a review tribunal within 30
 days. If the tribunal finds no merit to the case, the detainee
 is released, unless the Minister persuades the President to over-
 ride the tribunal's decision. If the tribunal recommends that
 detention continue, it does so until revoked by the Minister, or
 until the detainee is indicted. Detention orders must be re-
 viewed by the tribunal every 180 days.
 A detained person is entitled to hear the reasons for his
 detention "as soon as reasonably practicable -- but in any case
 not later than seven days" after arrest. The detainee is also
 entitled "to obtain and instruct without delay a legal repre-
 sentative," and is entitled to compensation for unlawful arrest
 and/or detention.* Exact figures on the number of people detained
 under the Emergency Powers Act are not available because of the
 Government's refusal to divulge this information. Approximately
 200 people are believed to be detained without trial. Procedures
 for an appeal of habeas corpus in Zimbabwe are virtually the same
 as in the United States and the United Kingdom. Any arrested
 person may demand, in court, that the evidence leading to his
 arrest may be presented. In the case of detention orders, as a
 matter of practical politics, the writ issued by the Minister of
 Home Affairs ordering a detention is usually sufficient to meet
 the requirement for evidence.
 Two journalists of the country's main newspaper were detained in
 August 1982. No charges were brought against them, and they were
 released after nearly one month. Both subsequently left the
 country, and there have been credible reports that they were
 "encouraged" to do so at the time of their release.
 Two brothers were held without charges for several months, after
 having been acquitted in court of charges of plotting against
 the Government. They were released from detention when the
 courts ruled that they should have been informed of the reason
 for the detention, but the Home Affairs Minister immediately had
 them rearrested and subsequently refused to produce them in
 court when ordered to do so. They were finally released after a
 direct appeal to Prime Minister Mugabe by their parents.
 
 
 373
 Several leaders of the Nkomo party and its military wing were
 held without formal charges from early 1982 until the fall,
 pending investigations. The Home Affairs Minister issued a writ
 preventing bail during their detention, and ultimately they were
 charged on counts of treason and possessing arms of war.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution outlines rights of defendants in the Zimbabwe
 court system. The accused is guaranteed a "fair hearing with-
 in a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court,"
 the presumption of innocence, the right to counsel of his choice,
 clear and detailed charges, the right of cross-examination of
 witnesses, the right of appeal, and freedom from double jeopardy.
 The accused is not guaranteed the right to refuse to testify at
 his own trial. The accused also does not have the right to re-
 main silent, but must make a public statement to the authorities.
 If the accused is asked to testify at his own trial and refuses,
 according to the law an adverse inference will be drawn.
 The Constitution requires that all trials end verdicts be pub-
 lic, except where the interests of justice, the national
 interest, or the private lives of people involved would be un-
 necessarily prejudiced. In practice, there have been instances
 where hearings and trials were closed to the public and the
 results handed down in a sealed verdict. Defendants are accorded
 the right of counsel, although occasionally they do not have
 access to a lawyer immediately upon being detained. When formal
 charges are brought, they are formally and clearly stated, but
 there are several persons who have been held for lengthy periods
 without being formally charged under the detention provision of
 the.Emergency Powers Act.
 The judiciary is independent from the executive and the military.
 There was some controversy in 1982 between the courts and the
 executive over the refusal of the Home Affairs Minister to
 release the brothers mentioned above, but a final showdown was
 averted. The Chief Justice ordered that the Home Affairs
 Ministry pay all court costs in that case, since the Minister
 was found to be at fault. Military courts deal entirely with
 military matters and do not hear civilian cases.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution protects citizens from arbitrary search or
 entry. Entry without a warrant is permitted when "reasonably
 justifiable" in the interest of "defense, public safety, public
 order, public health, or town and country planning," as "for the
 enforcement of law in circumstances when there are reasonable
 grounds for believing that a search or entry is necessary for the
 prevention, investigation, or detection of a criminal offense."
 Otherwise warrants would be issued by the court in the jurisdic-
 tion involved. There have been some allegations of abuse of
 this authority by government officials. There have been no
 allegations of other violations of the home, such as "bugging,"
 by Zimbabwean officials.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Government supports freedom of speech and of the
 press in principle, there were instances in 1982 where these
 freedoms were somewhat abridged. Opposition viewpoints are
 freely and frequently ventilated, both in the Parliament and,
 
 
 374
 less frequently, in the press. Criticism of the Government is
 tolerated, providing the level of rhetoric does not pass beyond
 certain bounds. The only known censorship of publications or
 films is the banning of certain works ruled to be excessively
 violent or pornographic. Otherwise, books and magazines appear
 to enter the country freely. Academic freedom permits wide-
 ranging and lively debate at the university and among scholars
 in the country.
 The major newspapers in the country, which used to belong to a
 South African-based group, are controlled by the government-
 established mass media trust. The trust has not exercised
 direct editorial control, and appears presently to confine itself
 to managing the financial side of the publications. Nonetheless,
 there has been considerable turnover in editorial personnel at
 the papers. Those presently in charge reflect and support, to a
 greater or lesser extent, the Government's policies and programs.
 The radio and television stations are government-owned and
 controlled, and generally base their coverage on the official
 version of events. There is still much greater reflection of
 the Government's views on the airwaves than in print.
 The most flagrant example of government intimidation of the
 press occurred with the arrest of two journalists, a deputy
 editor and a senior reporter for Harare's daily newspaper,
 the "Herald". No charges were ever filed against them, and
 rumors abounded as to the reasons for their arrest. They
 were finally released after almost a month in detention.
 Although the director of the mass media trust said they were
 free to return to their jobs immediately, both apparently
 chose instead to heed an unofficial warning and promptly
 left the country.
 In another instance, the "Herald" ran an editorial strongly
 critical of reports by foreign journalists based in Harare.
 The proximate cause was a press conference held in a journal-
 ist's office, at which attorneys accused the Government of
 torturing their clients during interrogation. The editorial
 writer accused the foreign journalist of blocking attendance
 by Zimbabwean reporters, and called on the Government to re-
 examine its procedures for granting accreditation to foreign
 reporters. Nothing has come of this call, but it can only
 have a dampening effect on journalistic freedom in Zimbabwe.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides that "no person shall be hindered in
 the enjoyment of his freedom of assembly and association.. .right
 to assemble freely and associate with other persons, to form or
 belong to political parties or trade unions or other associations
 for the protection of his interests." There are restrictions on
 peaceful public assembly, and persons who intend to hold public
 political meetings must obtain the prior approval of the Ministry
 of Home Affairs. There have been several cases where police
 authorities have refused with no explanation requests by Joshua
 Nkomo's party or Bishop Muzorewa's party for permission to hold
 political rallies in Harare. In general such rallies are
 approved without comment.
 An umbrella labor body, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
 was formed in 1981 and is trying to consolidate what it calls
 "splinter unions." Prior to independence, there were, in many
 
 
 375
 industries, parallel unions -- those with a small, white member-
 ship and large financial resources, and black unions with large
 membership and few resources. The Government has now stated
 that there should be only one union per industry, and these
 rival unions are slowly uniting and trying to find a modus
 vivendi. Organizations known as "workers' committees-'ao
 exist at some workplaces, and have taken responsibility for on-
 the-job issues such as worker safety. Their formal relationship
 with the labor unions remains to be established. Only about one-
 quarter of the work force in the modern sector is organized.
 The Industrial Conciliation Act prohibits both spontaneous
 strikes and lockouts, requiring instead that parties must first
 negotiate disputes and refer them to arbitration by a court if
 various bodies created by that law cannot get the parties to
 agree. If a union rejects the final arbitration decision, it
 may, after a 30-day cooling off period, signal its intention to
 strike. Since independence, labor disputes have never reached
 that stage, nor has anyone been prosecuted for striking.
 Strikes have generally achieved their purpose of highlighting
 grievances and achieving wage and benefit increases. It has
 been government policy to take no action against these labor
 actions.
 No professional groups or scientific bodies have been persecuted
 by the Government. All unions and professional bodies are per-
 mitted to maintain active relations with relevant international
 bodies. There are no known International Labor Organization
 concerns.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is fully respected in Zimbabwe. There is no
 state religion, nor is any one sect or belief favored by govern-
 ment policies. All religious denominations are permitted openly
 to practice and to teach their beliefs. There are no restric-
 tions on conversion between religions, and there have been no
 reports of any discrimination, harassment, or persecution of
 persons within Zimbabwe for their religious beliefs. Likewise,
 there is no known advantage or disadvantage resulting from
 adherence to any particular faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Apart from occasional imposition of curfew restrictions on
 certain areas of the country because of security concerns, there
 are no restrictions on travel within Zimbabwe, or on areas of
 residence. Emigration is not restricted, although there is a
 limit to the amount of currency and personal property which an
 emigrant may take out of the country. The majority of emigrants
 since independence have been whites. The Government has taken no
 steps to impede their departure. Likewise, the Government has
 welcomed back into the country the repatriates, most of whom
 were in exile during the independence struggle. The Government
 maintains a list of prohibited immigrants, but all names put on
 the list by the previous Government have been removed.
 The Government is considering a bill at present which would
 modify the Lancaster House Constitution to permit revoking the
 clause which permits dual citizenship. This is intended to
 oblige those in the country who hold foreign passports to choose
 which country has the true claim to their loyalty. The proposal
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 25
 
 
 376
 of this bill has caused concern among many whites, who fear that
 those who chose nationalities other than Zimbabwean would there-
 after be subject to economic or political persecution or dis-
 crimination. The Government, however, has repeatedly stated that
 there is no such intent behind the bill.
 Many members of the current Government spent some time as
 refugees themselves, and government policy towards refugees has
 generally been good. Over 100 South Africans have sought and
 been granted refuge in Zimbabwe since independence. More
 recently, refugees fleeing instability in Mozambique are reported
 to have crossed the border into Zimbabwe, where many of them have
 historical or family ties. The Government does not yet have an
 organized program for dealing with these refugees, but is taking
 steps to meet their needs.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Nine parties contested the February 1980 elections which brought
 Robert Mugabe's party to power. All the contending parties
 were given free media time and held campaign rallies. Most
 of those parties continue to exist, including the Republican
 Front, the major white party. Party politics, switches of
 allegiance such as the breakaway of nine white members of
 parliament now known as the "Independents," and the fortunes
 of various leaders, are the topics of animated conversation
 and media coverage throughout Zimbabwe.
 When Mugabe was chosen as Prime Minister he formed a government
 including members of Joshua Nkomo's rival party. In February
 1982, Mugabe ousted Nkomo and four other members of Nkomo's
 party from the Cabinet after large arms caches were reportedly
 found on the party's property. The present Government is
 controlled by the Zimbabwe African National Union, with token
 representation by the Zimbabwe African People's Union and
 independent whites.
 The Government has become increasingly intolerant of the opposi-
 tion. Mugabe has warned that the policy of reconciliation with
 former opponents, while still a cornerstone of official thinking,
 will be applied only to those who are willing to reciprocate and
 accept that the country should be changed along the lines of the
 Government's program. Mugabe has said that he favors creation
 of a one-party state. He has repeatedly stated, however, that
 he will only move in this direction in accordance with the
 Lancaster House Constitution, and provided he receives a popular
 mandate to do so. Such a mandate would be sought probably
 through a referendum, and probably not until after the
 general elections of 1985 at the earliest.
 Those elections which have been held since independence have
 reflected the freedom of choice of the 1980 general elections.
 Voting patterns continue largely to reflect ethnic division,
 with the majority of local offices and municipal councillorships
 being won by Zimbabwe African National Union candidates, with
 a sprinkling of Zimbabwe African People's Union victories.
 In balloting by white members of parliament to replace a white
 senator who had retired, the Independents carried over the
 Republican Front, and a white female took over the vacant seat.
 On the other hand, a by-election among white voters in the
 Bulawayo area, to replace a white member of parliament who had
 fled the country, led to a victory for the Front candidate, who
 won 54 percent of the votes cast. The Republican Front has won
 all the by-elections for white assembly seats.
 
 
 377
 Debates in the 100-member House of Assembly are lively and well-
 attended, especially by the white members of parliament (who
 hold 20 of the seats under the Lancaster House Constitution).
 There have been several instances, including a bill to revise
 the university charter, where it became evident from the debate
 that the legislation being discussed was either badly written or
 controversial, and the Government has withdrawn it from consid-
 eration. Improved versions submitted later passed.
 Women are active in politics in both major parties, and to a
 lesser extent in the white parties as well. There are two
 women ministers and one woman deputy minister.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Investigations for alleged violations of human rights by the
 Government of Zimbabwe have not been sought by any international
 or non-governmental organization, insofar as is known. Press
 reports of alleged violations of human rights have produced
 occasional calls for stricter controls on reporters in Zimbabwe.
 There appear to be no organizations monitoring human rights
 located within the country. In its 1982 Report, covering 1981
 events, Amnesty International expressed its continuing concern
 about the existence of emergency legislation providing for deten-
 tion without trial. In its 1982 survey, Freedom House   cate-
 gorized Zimbabwe as "Partly Free."
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Since independence, the Government has taken important steps to
 improve the living standards of Zimbabwe's blacks by developing
 and implementing plans to reduce the substantial inequality
 between blacks and whites. The minimum wage has been raised
 twice, and the Government has begun a deliberate program of
 Africanization. It has decreed that primary education shall be
 available for all children, and has cared for and resettled over
 a million war refugees.
 The total population is estimated by the Government to be 7.9
 million and by the World Bank to be 8.2 million. Estimates of
 the population growth rate range between 3.4 and 4.3 percent.
 Life expectancy at birth is estimated by UNICEF to be 55 years,
 and UNICEF also estimates the infant mortality rate at between
 100 and 120 per 1000 live births. The end of the war and the
 Government's efforts to provide greater health care services to
 all Zimbabweans may continue gradually to expand life expectancy.
 If present trends continue, Zimbabwe's population could reach
 20 million by the year 2000 A.D. The present adequate supply
 of food cannot meet the needs of so large a population, and the
 Government has started a child-spacing project to slow the
 population growth rate.
 More than 50 percent of the population is reportedly below the
 age of 15. This has meant a phenomenal increase in school en-
 rollment since independence. Primary school enrollment is esti-
 mated to be at least 90 percent, and the total number of children
 enrolled in primary schools doubled from 1981 to 1982. Enroll-
 ment at entry level in secondary schools is reported to have
 risen from 27 percent to 73 percent in the same year. The
 adult literacy rate, on the other hand, is about 45 percent
 for the total population. The Government is supporting
 programs to increase literacy among the black population.
 
 
 378
 The nationwide per capita GNP is estimated at between $628 and
 $460, depending on the population figure used. In fact, these
 figures are misleading, for there are, in effect, two Zimbabwean
 economies -- the wage or modern economy and the subsistence or
 traditional economy. The median income for whites is over ten
 times that for blacks. Until the results of the 1982 Zimbabwe
 census have been analyzed, it is impossible to estimate
 accurately the percentage of the population below the absolute
 poverty level.
 Under the present Government, most efforts to create infrastruc-
 ture to meet the economic and social needs of the population are
 concentrated on the black population, in an attempt to redress
 the serious racial imbalance of the pre-independence regimes.
 The Government has stated repeatedly, however, that it does not
 intend to practice racial discrimination in the delivery of
 services, and there is no evidence of such discrimination occurr-
 ing in practice. The right to own property alone or with others
 is well established in Zimbabwe and there are no efforts to
 change the system in that regard.
