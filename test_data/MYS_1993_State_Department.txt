 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states with a parliamentary system of government
 based on periodic multiparty elections. The ruling National Front Coalition has held
 power since 1957. There is political competition within the United Malaya National
 Organization (UMNO), the major partner in the coalition, and opposition parties ac-
 tively contest elections, currently controlling two state governments.
 The Government justifies internal security laws allowing preventive detention
 (and arrests under such laws) by citing the long-defunct Communist insurgency, the
 need to ensure that the peace and stability of the country are protected, and concern
 about longstanding racial tensions and endemic narcotics traficking problems. How-
 ever the Government also has used these laws more broadly to detain persons when
 available evidence is insufficient to bring formal charges under the Criminal Code,
 as well as to detain political opponents. The existence of these laws therefore serves
 to inhibit active opposition to government policies.
 The Royal Malaysian Police has primary responsibility for internal security mat-
 ters; it reports to the Minister of Home Affairs. Prime Minister Mahathir also holds
 the Hiome Affairs portfolio. Credible reports of mistreatment of prisoners and detain-
 ees by the police and prison officials continued in 1993. Such mistreatment was not
 widespread.
 Rapidly expanding exports of manufactured goods, especially in the electronics
 sector, are a major source of the country's vibrant economic growth. Crude oil ex-
 ports and traditional commodities (tropical logs, palm oil, rubber) add to Malaysia's
 trade revenues. Malaysia's strong economic performance in recent years has led to
 dramatic reductions in poverty, a rise in the standard of living, and more equal in-
 come distribution.
 There is an effective system of justice based on common law principles. The Gov-
 ernment, however, continues arbitrarily to arrest and detain citizens without trial.
 The Government also limits judicial independence and restricts freedom of associa-
 tion and of the press.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by the Government or any other political organization.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance attributable to the
 Government or an y other political organization.
 c. Torture and Other Crue, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible reports of abuses by police officers interrogating criminal suspects contin-
 ued during 1993, including strong paychological pressure and instances of physical
 abuse. In some cases, oice officials have been investigated for such abuses. How-
 ever, information on whether the investigations led to further action is unavailable.
 For example, three police officers were charged with "culpable homicide not amount-
 ing to murder" after a burglary suspect died in police custody. In another case, po-
 lice set up a special team to investigate the death, apparently while in police cus-
 tody,of an alleged drug addict suspected of burglary.
 alaysian cminal lawprescribes caning as an additional punishment to impris-
 onment for those convicted of crimes such as narcotics possession. Judges routinely
 include caning in sentencing those convicted of such crimes as kidnaping, rape, and
 robbery. The caning, which is normally carried out with a  -inch thick wooden
 cane, commonly causes welts and scarring.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Three laws permit the Government to de-
 tain suspects without judicial review or filing formal charges: the 1960 Internal Se-
 curity Act (ISA), the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance
 of 1969, and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985. The Government continued to use
 long-term detentions without trial in cases alleged to involve national security, as
 well as in narcotics trafficking and other cases. According to the Home Affairs Min-
 istry, as of July, there were 1,947 people in Malaysia being detained without trial;
 most of those detainees are being held under the Dangemus Drugs Act.
 
 
 Passed more than 30 years ago when there was an active Communist insurgency,
 the ISA empowers the police to hold any person who may act "in a manner preju-
 dicial to the security of Malaysia" for up to 60 days. According to the Government,
 the goal of the ISA is to control internal subversion, although there is now no seri-
 ous threat to national stability in Malaysia. The Government also uses the ISA
 against passport and identity card forgers, 37 of whom were being held as of July
 21. Security authorities sometimes wait several days after a detention before in-
 forming the detainee's family. The Minister of Home Affairs may authorize, in writ-
 ing, further detention for periods up to 2 years. Even when there are no formal
 charges, the authorities must inform detainees of the accusations against them and
 ermit them to appeal to an advisory board for review every 6 months. Advisory
 board decisions and recommendations, however, are not binding on the Home Min-
 ister, are not made public, and are often not shown to the detainee. A number of
 ISA detainees have refused to participate in the review process under these cir-
 cumstances.
 In response to a question from an opposition Member of Parliament (M.P.), the
 Home Ministry reported in December that there were 51 ISA detainees at that time,
 down from 128 as of December 1992. Approximately 27 former detainees have been
 released subject to "imposed restricted conditions, which will be in effect for the
 balance of their detention periods. Most of these ISA detainees were released subject
 to conditions limiting their rights to freedom of speech, association, and travel out-
 side the country.
 During 1990 and 1991 the Government detained under the ISA seven Malaysians
 from the east Malaysian state of Sabah, including the brother of the chief minister,
 for alleged involvement in a secessionist plot. The Government released one de-
 tainee in March 1991 upon expiration of the intitial order. The remaining six were
 released in 1993 when their detention orders were suspended. There are conditions
 attached to their freedom, however.
 Amendments to the ISA severely limit judicial review of detentions, contravening
 international standards of due process. During 1993 opposition leaders and human
 rights organizations called on the Government to repeal the ISA and other legisla-
 tion that deprives individuals of the right to defend themselves in court. Senior gov-
 ernment officials explain that the ISA in its present form continues to be necessary
 to preserve peace and harmony in a multiracial society. The Government did not
 detain anyone in 1993 for political activities. However, the threat of detention re-
 mains and serves to constrain participation in political activities.
 The Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance was instituted
 after intercommunal riots in 1969. Although Parliament regained its legislative
 power in 1971, the state of emergency declared at the time of the riots has never
 been lifted. The Home Affairs Minister can issue a detention order for up to 2 years
 against a person if he deems it necessary to protect public order or for the "suppres-
 sion of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence." According to figures
 released by the Home Ministry, as of July 21, 93 people were in detention under
 the Emergency Ordinance, down from 114 people in 1992.
 Drug suspects are detained under provisions of the 1985 amendments to the Dan-
 gerous Drugs Act, which give the Government specific power to detain suspected
 drug traffickers. Many of these detainees are suspected members of organized crime
 gangs or secret societies. The suspects may be held up to 39 days before the Home
 Minister must issue a detention order. Once the ministry has issued an order, the
 detainee is entitled to a habeas corpus hearing before a court. In some instances,
 the judge may order the detainee's release. Suspects may be held without charge
 for successive 2-year intervals, with periodic review by an advisory board, whose
 opinion is binding on the Home Minister. However, the review process contains none
 of the due process rights that a defendant would have in a court proceeding. As of
 July 21, approximately 1,750 drug suspects remained under detention or under re-
 strictions equivalent to house arrest under this statute. Suspected narcotics traffick-
 ers and firearms offenders are frequently rearrested under the preventive measures
 clauses of the Dangerous Drugs Act or the ISA after an acquittal in court on formal
 charges under separate provisions of those acts.
 A 1989 peace agreement allows members of the Communist Party of Malaya
 (CPM) to return to Malaysia. According to the Government, the agreement stipu-
 lates that they satisfy certain conditions, including taking a loyalty oath "to king
 and country" and renouncing the CPM in writing. Since 1989 at least 608 former
 CPM members have applied for return to Malaysia under the agreement. Sixty-six
 subsequently withdrew their applications because they objected to the conditions on
 their repatriation imposed by the Government. The Government has rejected an un-
 known number of applications by former CPM members to return to Malaysia. Since
 December 1989, 338 former Communists and 50 dependents have been "rehabili-
 
 
 685
 tated" by the Malaysian security authorities and resettled in Malaysia. A credible
 report indicates that this rehabilitation consists of detention without trial under the
 ISA at the Kamunting detention center in Perak state. In addition, rehabilitated
 former CPM members who have reintegrated into Malaysian society are subject to
 being restricted to certain areas where security authorities watch them carefully for
 up to 6 years. These rehabilitated persons cannot resume full participation in Ma-
 laysia's political life until this period of surveillance demonstrates that they have
 abandoned their former ideology.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Most civil and criminal cases are fair and open.
 The accused must be brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest, and charges
 must be levied within 14 days. Defendants have the right to counsel, bail is avail-
 able, and strict rules of evidence apply in court. Defendants may appeal court deci-
 sions to higher courts and, in criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the
 King or local state rulers as appropriate. Criminal trials are heard by a single judge
 without a jury, except in murder trials where juries are the norm. The defense in
 both ordinary criminal cases and the special security cases described above is not
 entitled to a statement of evidence before the trial.
 The right to a fair trial is restricted in criminal cases where the Attorney General
 invokes the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. These regulations gov-
 erning trial procedure normalI apply only in firearms cases. In cases tried under
 these regulations, the standards for accepting self-incriminating statements by de-
 fendants as evidence are less stringent than in normal criminal cases. Also, the au-
 thorities may hold the accused for an unspecified period of time before making for-
 mal charges. The Attorney General also has the authority to invoke these regula-
 tions in other criminal cases if the Government determines that the crime involves
 national security considerations, but such cases are rare.
 The public and the legal community have long regarded the Malaysian judiciary
 as committed to the rule of law. The judicial system traditionally exhibited a high
 degree of independence, seldom hesitating to rule against the Government in crimi-
 nal, civil, or occasionally even politically sensitive cases. For example, the High
 Court ruled in February 1988 that the dominant party in the Government coalition
 was illegally constituted. However, the Government's dismissal of the Supreme
 Court Lord President and two other justices in 1988, along with a Constitutional
 amendment and legislation restricting judicial review, resulted in less judicial inde-
 pendence and stronger executive influence over the judiciary in politically sensitive
 cases. These developments created the possibility that Malaysians who might other-
 wise seek legal remedies against government actions would be reluctant to do so.
 The 1988 changes have also resulted in less willingness by the courts to challenge
 the Government's legal interpretations in politically sensitive cases.
 The Government, following criticism of some of its policies by the Malaysian Bar
 Council, attempted to gain greater control over the Council in 1991 and early 1992.
 Although there was concern that the Bar Council's freedom of expression and inde-
 pendence were being threatened, government criticism of the Bar Council has since
 ebbed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-These
 rights are normally respected and protected by law. Provisions in the security legis-
 lation (see Section 1.d.), however, allow the police to enter and search without a
 warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national security. Police may
 also confiscate evidence under these acts. In a limited number of cases each year,
 police have used this legal authority to search homes and offices, seize books and
 papers, monitor conversations, and take people into custody without a warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and press, some important limitations exist, and over the years the Gov-
 ernment has restricted freedom of expression of media organizations and individ-
 uals. For example, the Constitution provides that freedom of speech may be re-
 stricted by legislation "in the interest of security . . . (or) public order." Thus, the
 Sedition Act amendments of 1970 prohibit public comment on issues defined as sen-
 sitive, such as citizenship rights for non-Malays and the special position of Malays
 in society. The Government has not brought charges under the Sedition Act since
 1986, when a trial court acquitted a former president of the Bar Council.
 Press freedom is subject to important limitations in the Printing Presses and Pub-
 lications Act of 1984, under which domestic and foreign publications must apply an-
 nually to the Government for a permit. The act was amended in 1987 to make the
 publication of "malicious news" a punishable offense, expand the Government's
 power to ban or restrict publications, and prohibit court challenges to suspension
 or revocation of publication permits. Government policies create a chilling atmos-
 
 
 686
 phere for independent journalism and result in self-censorship of issues the Govern-
 ment might consider sensitive.
 In practice, press freedom is also limited by the fact that leading political figures
 or companies controlled by the leading political figures in the ruling coalition own
 all the major newspapers and all radio and television stations. These mass media
 provide generally laudatory, noncritical coverage of government officials and govern-
 ment policies, and give only limited and selective coverage to political views of the
 opposition or political rivals. Editorial opinion in these mass media frequently re-
 flects government positions on domestic and international issues. Because they can
 be read only by a minority of Malaysians (chiefly ethnic Chinese), Chinese-language
 newspapers are generally more free in reporting and commenting on sensitive politi-
 cal and social issues.
 Despite strong political influence on the editorial decisions of major publications
 small-circulation publications of opposition parties, social action groups, unions, and
 other private groups actively cover opposition parties and frequently print views
 critical of government policies. The Government does retain significant influence
 over these publications by requiring annual renewal of publishing permits. During
 1992 the Government acted to revoke the permits of at least two newspapers. In
 one case, credible allegations suggest that the Government revoked the newspaper's
 permit because it printed articles critical of the Prime Minister and government
 policies. In the other case, a tabloid weekly's permit was revoked evidently for pub-
 lishin embarrassing gossip about members of several of Malaysia's roya famClies.
 The Government continued to withhold a publishing permit for those papers in
 1993. In addition, a newspaper editor in the east Malaysian state of Sabah was
 charged in 1992 with printing "malicious news" about an alleged ISA detention of
 a Roman Catholic clergyman. The editor challenged the charges on constitutional
 grounds. In August the Supreme Court ruled that the Printing Presses and Publica-
 tions Act is valid although it imposes restrictions on the right to freedom of speech
 and expression conferred by the Constitution. The Supreme Court decided that in
 this case Parliament could impose such restrictions under another constitutional
 clause that permits certain restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and ex-
 pression. The editor still faces trial.
 Since 1991 the Government has warned two newspapers published by opposition
 parties that the terms of their licenses limited distribution to party members only.
 A legal challenge to quash enforcement of the license limitation failed, resulting in
 limiting circulation of these publications during 1992 and 1993. In 1993 the Home
 Affairs Ministry sent a final warning to one opposition party regarding the distribu-
 tion and sales to the public of its paper, informing the permit   that the Min-
 istry would take stern action for any future violation of the rules. The paper has
 since disappeared from newsstands.
 In June 1990, Parliament enacted legislation making the Government-controlled
 Malaysian News Agency (BERNAMA) the sole distributor of foreign news in Malay-
 sia, formalizing previous practice. The parliamentary opposition opposed the bill, ar-
 guing that it would increase government control over foreign news. Although the
 vernment has not to date used this law to restrict foreign news coverage or avail-
 ability, in the past the Government has banned under separate legislation individ-
 ual editions of foreign publications. In 1993 the Government censored portions of
 photographs and a text in issues of foreign news magazines.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association, but there are significant
 restrictions. These rights can be limited in the interest of security and public order,
 and the 1967 Police Act requires police permits for all public assemblies with the
 exception of workers on picket lines. Spontaneous demonstrations occur periodically
 without permission, but they are limited in scope and generally occur with the tacit
 consent of the police. In the east Malaysian state of Sarawak, groups of indigenous
 people have held peaceful demonstrations to protest government policies and ac-
 tions.
 In the aftermath of the intercommunal riots in 1969, the Government banned po-
 litical rallies. While the formal ban has not been rescinded, both government and
 oppositionparties have held large indoor political gatherings dubbed "discussion
 sessions." Government and opposition candidates campaign actively. There are, how-
 ever, some restrictions on freedom of assembly during campaigns. During the actual
 campaign period, political parties submit lists of times and places for their "discus-
 sion groups." Although theoretically no police permit is required, some opposition
 discussion group meetings in past campaigns have been canceled for lack of a police
 permit. Outside of the campaign period, a permit is required, with most applications
 routinely approved.
 
 
 Other statutes limit the right of association, such as the Societies Act of 1966,
 under which any association of seven or more members must register with the Gov-
 ernment as a society. The Government may refuse to register a new society or may
 impose conditions when allowing a society to register. The Government also has the
 power to revoke the registration of an existing society for violations of the act, a
 power it has selectively enforced against political oposition groups. In 1993 the
 Registrar of Societies deregistered a political party o  ong stanng in the east Ma-
 laysian state of Sabah when it formed a oalition with the ruling opposition party,
 and threatened to do the sae to the national opposition party Semangat '46 if it
 continued to claim that it was the legitimate successor to the original UMNO party.
 The threat of possible deregistration inhibits political activism by public or special
 interest organizations. Another law affecting freedom of association is the Univer-
 sities and University Colleges Act; it mandates government approval for student as-
 sociations and prohibits student associations, as well as faculty members, from en-
 gaging in political activity. Campus demonstrations must be approved by a univer-
 sity vice chancellor.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. Reli ious minorities, which
 include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities, generally are per-
 mitted to worship freely but are subject to some restrictions. Ethnic Malays are le-
 gally bound in some civil matters, such as family relations and diet, by Islamic reli-
 gious laws administered by state authorities through Islamic courts. An Islamic reli-
 ious establishment is supported with jgovernment funds, and it is official policy to
 infuse Islamic values" into the administration of Malaysia. At the same time, the
 Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government has refused to
 accede to pressures for the imposition of Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim
 community.
 The Government opposes what it considers extremist or deviant interpretations
 of Islam. In the past the Government has imposed restrictions on certain Islamic
 sects. It continues to monitor activities of the Shi'ite minority.
 There are persistent allegations that some state governments are slow in approv-
 ing building permits for non-Muslim places of worship. In one instance, a municipal
 council hayapproved the construction of a Catholic church headquarters. In August
 1993, after a public outcry by the predominantly Muslim local community, the state
 government rescinded its approval. The Government has limited the circulation of
 a popular Malay-language translation of the Bible, and some states restrict the use
 of religious terms by Christians in the Malay language.
 Conversion to religions other than Islam is permitted but discouraged. Proselytiz-
 ing of Muslims has ong been proscribed by law in some states and strongly discour-
 aged in other parts of the country. In a March 1990 decision, the Supreme Court
 upheld the primacy of the Constitution over inconsistent state laws by ruling that
 parents have the right to determine the religion of their minor children under the
 age of 18. The decision eased fears of the non-Muslim community over state laws
 that in religious conversion cases set the age of majority at puberty based on Islamic
 law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Malaysians generally have the right to travel within the country and
 live and work where they please, but the Government restricts these rights in some
 circumstances. The states of Sabah and Sarawak have the independent right to con-
 trol immigration into their territories; Malaysians from peninsular west Malaysia
 and foreigners are required to present passports for entry. The power to regulate
 internal movement is exercised for provisionally released ISA detainees. The Gov-
 ernment limits the movement of some released ISA detainees to a designated city
 or state. As of December 1993, approximately 27 former ISA detainees were under
 "imposed restricted conditions," which will last for the remainder of their detention
 periods.
 Malaysians generally are free to travel abroad, although in some cases the Gov-
 ernment has refused to issue or has withheld passports on security grounds or in
 the belief that the trip will be detrimental to the country's image. Most government
 action is taken because of drug trafficking offenses or involvement in serious crimes.
 In July, immigration authorities withdrew the passport of a lawyer and poet alleg-
 edly to prevent him from reading his poems, which supported antilogging activities.
 Immigration authorities returned his passport in late August. The Immigration De-
 partment in the east Malaysian state of Sarawa, on instructions from the Home
 Ministry, in August confiscated the passport of a Sarawak native who was on his
 way to an international conference of indigenous peoples. Two other Sarawak na-
 tives who planned to attend conferences had their passports confiscated in 1992;
 government authorities still have not returned their passports. In 1992 the Govern-
 ment began confiscating the passports of returning Malaysians who had overstayed
 
 
 688
 their visitors' visas when abroad, on the grounds that violating the immigration
 laws of foreign countries is an embarrassment to Malaysia. Malaysians are not per-
 mitted to travel to Israel. Former restrictions on travel to South Africa and to sev-
 eral Communist countries, including China, were eliminated in 1990 and 1991. Gen-
 erally, the Government does not restrict emigration.
 There are estimates of up to 1 million foreign workers in Malaysia, many
 "illegals," who work in low-skill jobs in the plantation and construction sectors of
 the economy. Although some illegal workers ultimately are able to regularize their
 immigration status, others depart voluntarily after a few months, while some are
 formally deported as illegal migrants. In 1992 the Government conducted a registra-
 tion program designed to regularize the immigration status of illegal workers. After
 the registration program ended, however, the Government launched combined police
 and military operations to enforce immigration and passport laws. According to gov-
 ernment officials, by April 1993, 50,000 illegal immigrants had returned voluntarily
 to their countries of origin, while 40,000 others had been arrested and repatriated.
 In 1993 at least 3,000 people deemed to be illegal foreign workers were detained.
 There have been some credible reports of inadequate rations in the temporary
 camps. In 1991 and 1992, separate groups of asylum seekers from the Indonesian
 rovince of Aceh (totaling approximately 300) arrived in northwestern Malaysia, al-
 fegedly fleeing violence stemming from a separatist rebellion in Indonesia. These
 asylum seekers requested refugee status. Despite expressions of concern by local
 and international human rights organizations and foreign governments, the Govern-
 ment denied their requests, ruling that the asylum seekers were "illegal immi-
 grants" subject to deportation. According to government sources, approximately 163
 Acehnese asylum seekers had returned home voluntarily as of June 1993. The Gov-
 ernment is holding 131 Acehnese in immigration detention facilities.
 Although there are credible reports of mistreatment of the Acehnese detainees,
 the Government has denied the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and others access to visit the immigration detention sites. Government
 officials continued to stress during 1993 that Malaysia would not force Acehnese
 asylum seekers to return against their will but would encourage them to repatriate
 voluntarily. In June 1992, a group of 48 asylum seekers claiming to be Acehnese
 took refuge in the compound outside the UNHCR offices in Kuala Lumpur, demand-
 ing refugee status; 45 still live there. While it regards this group as illegal immi-
 grants, the Government declared its readiness to assist in their repatriation to Indo-
 nesia if they wish to return and said the Indonesian Government had provided as-
 surances that the group would face no government oppression if they chose to re-
 turn home. Members of the group living in the UNHCR compound come and go free-
 ly.
 Having provided first asylum to more than 254,000 Vietnamese boat refugees
 since 1975, the Government began to deny first asylum to virtually all arriving Viet-
 namese in May 1989, in contravention of its commitments under the Comprehensive
 Plan of Action (CPA) on Indochinese refugees adopted in 1989. Since May 1989, Ma-
 laysia denied first asylum to 10,495, of which all but 145 arrived in 1989-90. Credi-
 ble reports indicate that Malaysian authorities put back to sea a vessel bearing 23
 Vietnamese asylum seekers in May 1993. Historically, Malaysian authorities allow
 Vietnamese boats to land and normally hold asylum seekers in temporary camps
 closed to observers. The Government provides life jackets, boats, and essential sup-
 plies to asylum seekers put back to sea. Interviews with asylum seekers indicate
 that the Government takes positive steps to safeguard the lives and welfare of those
 denied first asylum and disciplines personnel involved in abusive behavior. Re-
 cently, however, there are indications that Malaysia has ceased its policy of
 redirecting boats.
 In accordance with the CPA, Malaysia continued to screen Vietnamese boat people
 in its first-asylum camps. Malaysian military officers do the screening, with legal
 consultants from the UNHCR present during each interview. As of December 1993,
 about 7,500 Vietnamese remained in camps in Malaysia. The Government has reit-
 erated that it will not forcibly return screened-out asylum seekers but will continue
 to urge voluntary repatriation.
 The Malaysian screeners and UNHCR consultants make every effort to develop
 the asylum seekers' claims to refugee status. The Government discusses all disputed
 cases with the UNHCR before announcing a decision. An administrative appeal is
 available to denied cases. UNHCR officials have praised the Government's treat-
 ment of Vietnamese asylum seekers in Malaysia under provisions of the CPA.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Cttizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 By law Malaysians have the right to change their government through periodic
 elections. Malaysian elections are procedurally free and fair, with votes recorded ac-
 curately. However electoral irregularities detract from the overall fairness of the
 electoral process. Legal restrictions on campaigning and government influence over
 the media contribute to UMNO's continuing political dominance. Malaysia has a
 Westminster-style parliamentary system of government. National elections, required
 at least every 5years, have been held regularly since independence in 1957.
 Through UO, Malays dominate the ruling national front oalition of ethnic-based
 parties that has controlled Parliament since independence. Within UMNO there is
 active political debate.
 Non-7Malays fill 8 of the 25 cabinet posts. The government coalition currently con-
 trols 11 of 13 states. Ethnic Chinese leaders of a member party of the government
 coalition hold executive power in the state of Penang. In opposition-ruled Sabah the
 party in power is controlled by Sabah's predominant indigenous ethnic group and
 headed by a Christian. An Islamic opposition party controls the northern state of
 Kelantan.
 Women face no legal limits on participation in government Lnd politics, but there
 are practical impediments. Women are represented in senior leadership positions in
 the Government in small numbers. Women comprise approximately 6 percent (hold-
 ing 11 seats out of 180) in the elected lower house of Parliament and approximately
 19 percent (holding 13 seats out of 68) of the appointed upper house. They also hold
 high-level judgeships.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 After a 2-year struggle for registration, the National Human Rights Association,
 a local human rights society of prominent Malaysians, began operating in 1991. This
 association publicly criticizes the Government, although it does not investigate the
 Government except in response to individual complaints. Currently, it is pushing
 hard against the ISA and it is also reviewing Kelantan's efforts to impose Islamic
 restrictions in that state. A number of other organizations, including the Bar Coun-
 cil and public interest groups, devote attention to human rights activities. The Gov-
 ernment tolerates their activities but rarely responds to their inquiries or occasional
 press statements. Malaysian officials criticize local groups for collaborating with
 international human rights organizations, representatives of which have visited and
 traveled in Malaysia but rarely are given access to government officials. In 1992 a
 group seeking to form a local chapter of a prominent international human rights or-
 ganization appealed a government rejection of their application under the Societies
 AtIn193 the Government rejected the appeal.
 The Government has not acceded to any of the major international covenants on
 human rights, generally maintaining that such issues are internal matters. It re-
 jects criticism of its human rights record by international human rights organiza-
 tions and foreign governments. However, during 1992 and 1993 the Prime Minister
 and other Cabinet officials were vocal advocates of human rights with respect to
 Serbian atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the plight of the Rohingyas in
 Burma.
 Foreign government officials have discussed human rights with their Malaysian
 counterparts, and private groups occasionally have done so.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The cultural and religious traditions of Malaysia's major ethnic groups
 heavily influence the condition of women in Malaysian society. In family and reli-
 gious matters, Muslim women are subject to Islamic law. Polygyny is allowed and
 practiced, and inheritance law favors male offspring and relatives. Some Malay fain-
 ilies practice a modified form of female genital mutilation (circumcision) involving
 the removal of a small piece of the prepuce. The Government has not commented
 publicly on this practice. The Islamic family law was revised in 1989 to provide bet-
 ter protection for the property rights of married Muslim women and to make more
 equitable a Muslim woman's right to divorce.
 on- uslii women are subject to civil law. Changes in the Civil Marriage and
 Divorce Act in the early 1980s increased protection o mared women's rights, espe-
 cially those married under customary rites.
 Many government-sanctioned nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)push for
 legislative and social reforms to improve the status of women in Malaysia. Statistics
 on domestic violence in Malaysia are sketchy, but both the Government and wom-
 
 
 690
 
 en's organizations agree that the problem is growing. With no specific laws in force
 on domestic violence, cases of wife beating or child abuse normally are tried under
 prvisions of the Penal Code governing assault and battery, which carry penalties
 of 3 months to 1 year in prison and fines up to $750. Women's groups have collabo-
 rated in lobbying for a domestic violence bill since 1985 but have had no success
 to date. Women's issues were the subject of a number of public seminars and media
 specials in the government-dominated media during 1993.
 There are no national laws or regulations restricting the economic rights of
 women. Government policy supports women's full and equal participation n edu-
 cation and the work force. Women are represented in the professions, although their
 participation as of 1990 in the administrative and managerial occupations was less
 than 1 percent, and they generally receive lower wages. In the opposition-controlled
 state of Kelantan, the state government has imposed restrictions on all female work-
 er, including non-Muslims. Female workers cannot work at night and are restricted
 in the dress they must wear in the workplace. The state government justifies these
 restrictions as reflecting Islamic values. Given Malaysia's federal structure of gov-
 ernment, there are no legal means by which the central Government can overturn
 such state laws.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's human rights and welfare;
 it spends 23 percent of its current budget on education. According to statistics pub-
 licized by the National Unity and Social Development Ministry, there were 588
 cases of child abuse from January to October 1993. The Government has taken some
 steps to deal with abuse directed against children. Parliament passed the Children's
 Protection Act in 1991 which went into force in 1993 after the Attorney General pre-
 pared implementing regulations. Since 1992 public attention and debate on child
 abuse have increased significantly. In 1993 Malaysian news media featured regular
 reports, commentary, and graphic public service announcements on these social
 problems, and pubhic symposia sponsored by social and political organizations dis-
 cussed their policy implications.
 Statistics on the extent of child prostitution are not available. The Health Min-
 istry announced that it would work closely with the police to stamp out child pros-
 titution. Although there are no official statistics about child labor, the Government
 has regulations governing child labor (see Section 6,d.).
 Ind1igenus People.-In theory indigenous groups and persons are accorded the
 same Constitutional protection of their civil and political rights, along with the same
 limitations. In practice, federal laws pertaining to indigenous people vest almost
 total power in the Minister of Rural Development to protect, control, and otherwise
 decide issues concerning indigenous people. Decisions affecting land rights of the in-
 digenous people in peninsular Malaysia are left to the state governments. In east
 Malaysia, although state law recognizes indigenous people's right to land under "na-
 tive customary rights," the definition and extent of these lands are in dispute. Indig-
 enous people in the state of Sarawak continue to protest the alleged encroachment
 by the state or private logging companies onto land that they consider customary
 territory. In 1992 the Government arrested 95 indigenous people in Sarawak who
 protested these alleged encroachments. The protests and arrests continued in 1993.
 According to government figures, the indigenous people in peninsular Malaysia, who
 number fewer than 100,000, are the poorest group in Malaysia.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities are represented in cabi-
 net-level positions in government, as well as in senior civil service positions. Never-
 theless, the political dominance of the Malay majority means in practice that the
 most powerful senior leadership positions in government will be held by ethnic Ma-
 la ie' Government implements extensive "affirmative action" programs designed to
 boost the economic position of the ethnic Malay majority, which remains poorer, on
 average, than the Chinese minority despite the former s political dominance. Such
 government affirmative action programs and policies do, however, limit opportuni-
 ties for non-Malays in higher education, government employment, business permits
 and licenses, and ownership of newly developed agricultural lands. Indian Malay-
 sians continue to lag behind in Malaysia's economic development, although the na-
 tional economic policies target less advantaged populations regardless of ethnicity.
 These programs, which have operated since the 1969 riots, are widely credited with
 helping assure the generally strife-free ethnic balance.
 People with Disabilities.-While physically disabled persons are not subject to
 legal discrimination in employment, education, and provision of other state services,
 governmental budgetary allotments for people with disabilities are very small. Pub-
 Tic transportation is not adapted to the needs of the disabled. Special education
 schools exist, but they are not sufficient to meet needs. Disabled persons work in
 all sectors of the economy, but the prevalent feeling in society remains that disabled
 
 
 691
 people cannot work. A campaign through the government-dominated Malaysian
 news media encouraged businesses and private individuals to increase their under-
 standing and volunteer activities to assist disabled people. The Government allo-
 cates money for the administrative expenses of rehabilitation centers for the handi-
 capped across Malaysia. The Government has not mandated accessibility for the dis-
 abled, either legislatively or otherwise.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Asociation.-By law workers have the right to engage in trade
 union activity, and tens of thousands of workers in both the public and private sec-
 tr are members of trade unions, including at least 14 national unions. Within cer-
 tain limitations, umons may organize workplaces, bargain collectively with employ-
 ers, and form federations.
 The Industrial Relations Act prohibits interfering with, restraining, or coercing a
 worker in the exercise of the right to form trade unions or in participating in lawul
 trade union activities. The Trade Unions Act, administered by the Director General
 of Trade Unions (DGTU), sets rules for the organization of unions, recognition of
 unions in the workplace, the content of union constitutions, election of officers, and
 financial reporting. The act's definition of a trade union, however, restricts a union
 to representing workers in a particular establishment, trade, occupation, or indus-
 try or within any similar trades, occupations, or industries," contrary to Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO) guide lines.
 The DGTU may refuse to register a trade union and, in some circumstances, ma
 also withdraw the registration of a trade union. When registration has been refuse
 withdrawn, or canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful association. Nation-
 wide congresses of trade unions from different industries are required by law to reg-
 ister as societies under the Societies Act rather than as trade unions under the
 Trade Unions Act. During 1993, acting on complaints by private parties alleging
 electoral and constitutional irregularities, the Registrar of Societies required  ot
 major trade union congrsses, the Malaysian Trades Union Conrss (MTUC) and
 the Malaysian Labor Organization (MLO), to show cause why they should not be
 deregistered. In their answers, bth grups admitted not having followed their own
 constitutional procedures and agreed to correct the irregularities. Having done so,
 bth bodies retained their registrations.
 Government policy discourages the formation of national unions. The Government
 posits a social compact where in each sector, government, employer, and worker are
 part of an overall effort to create jobs, train workers, boost productivity and profit-
 ability, and ultimately provide the resources necessary to fund human resource de-
 velopment and a national social safety net. The Government has used its power to
 prevent the Electrical Industry Workers Union, an MTUC affiliate, from organizing
 national unions in the American and Japanese dominated electronics industry on
 the grounds that electrical industry workers and electronics industry workers are
 not similar" as required by the Trade Union Act. The Government permits only "in-
 house unions" in the electronics industry. At year's end, there were six such unions
 registered in the electronics industry, of which four were recognized by the compa-
 nies involved, and two had collective bargaining agreements negotiated with their
 employers. All members of one of these unions were dismissed in 1990 following re-
 organization of its American-owned company's structure. The union charged the
 company with union-busting and wrongfuldismissal. The case was filed in Septem-
 ber 1990; an appeal from an Industrial Court decision is pending in the High Court.
 Malaysia's restrictions on freedom of association in the electronics industry have
 been the subject of complaints in the ILO.
 Unions maintain inde   dence both from the Government and from the political
 parties, but individual union members may belong to political parties. Although
 union officers are forbidden to hold principal offices in political parties, individual
 trade union leaders have served and currently serve in Parliament as opposition
 Soliticians. Malaysian trade unions are free to associate with international labr
 odies and actively do so. Although strikes are legal, the right to strike is severely
 restricted in practice. Malaysian law contains a list of "essential services" in which
 unions must give advance notice of any industrial action. The list includes sectors
 not normally deemed "essential" under LO definitions. The Industrial Relations Act
 of 1967 requires the parties to notify the Ministry of Human Resources that a dis-
 pUte exists before any industrial action (strike or lockout) may be taken. The Min-
 itry's Industrial Relations Department may then become actively involved in concil-
 iation efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve a settlement, the Minister has the
 power t       io  the   e     Industrial Court. Strikes or lockouts are prohibited
 while the dispute is before the industrial court. The result, i effect, is compulsory
 arbitration The Industrial Relations Act prohibits employers from taking retribu-
 
 
 692
 tion against a worker for participating in the lawful activities of a trade union.
 Where a strike is legal, these provisions would prohibit employer retribution against
 strikers and leaders. However, as there are no reports of such cases alleging em-
 ployer retribution against strikers, it is impossible to assess the effectiveness of gov-
 ernment enforcement.
 By law federations of trade unions may represent only a single trade or industry
 or similar trades or industries. Only three national labor federations are currently
 registered: one for public servants, one for teachers, and one consisting of state-
 based textile and garment workers unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Malaysian workers have the
 legal right to organize and bargain collectively, and collective bargaining is wide-
 spread in those sectors where labor is organized. About 860,000 workers are covered
 by collective bargaining agreements, representing 12 percent of the total work force.
 Designed to curb strikes, amendments in 1980 to Malaysia's Labor Law contain pro-
 visions that the MTUC believes erode the basic rights of workers restrict union ac-
 tivities, and result in government and employer interference in the internal admin-
 istration of unions. Despite subsequent amendments, the MTUC charges that the
 Labor Law does not meet ILO standards. Many union leaders also believe that the
 creation of the Industrial Court further weakened their collective bargaining rights.
 Malaysian law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union mem-
 bers and organizers. Complaints of discrimination may be filed with the Ministry
 of Human Resources or the Industrial Court. When conciliation efforts by the Min-
 istry of Human Resources fail, critics note that the Industrial Court is slow in adju-
 dicating worker complaints.
 Companies in free trade zones (FTZ's) must observe labor standards identical to
 those elsewhere in Malaysia. Many workers at FTZ companies are organized, espe-
 cially in the textile and electrical products sectors. Workers in FTZ companies in
 the electronics sector are limited by government policy to forming in-house unions.
 During 1993, amendments to the Industrial Relations Act removed previous restric-
 tions on concluding collective agreements about terms and conditions of service in
 "pioneer industries." Workers in industries granted pioneer status may now con-
 clude collective agreements on all issues permitted to workers in other industries.
 The Government took these measures in part to respond to IL) criticism of its pre-
 vious policy with respect to pioneer industries. The ILO continues to object to other
 legal restrictions on collective bargaining.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-In theory, certain Malaysian laws
 allow the use of imprisonment with compulsory labor as a punishment or persons
 expressing views opposed to the established order or who participate in strikes. The
 Government maintains that the constitutional prohibition on forced or compulsory
 labor renders these laws without effect. In practice, there is no evidence that forced
 or compulsory labor occurs in Malaysia, for either Malaysian or foreign workers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Children and Young Persons
 (Employment) Act of 1966 prohibits the employment of children younger than the
 age of 14. The act permits some exceptions, such as light work in a family enter-
 prise, work in public entertainment, work performed for the Government in a school
 or training institution, or work as an approved apprentice. In no case may children
 work more than 6 hours per day, more than 6 days per week, or at night. Ministry
 of Human Resources inspectors enforce these legal prvisions. However, according
 to credible reports, the Government still needs to take further steps to regulate
 child labor. There is no evidence that child labor is used in industries that export
 to the United States.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-.-Malaysia lacks a national minimum wage, but
 the Wage Councils Act provides for a minimum wage in those sectors or regions of
 the country where a need exists. Under the law, workers in an industry who believe
 they need the protection of a minimum wage may request that a "wage council" be
 established. About 140,000 worliers, or 2 percent of the over 7 million-member labor
 force, are covered by minimum wages set by wage councils. Representatives from
 labor, management and government sit on the wage councils. Not having been re-
 vised for many years, the minimum wages set by wage councils generally do not
 provide for an adequate standard of living for a worker and family. Minimum
 monthly wages for workers covered by wage councils in urban areas range from $70
 to $90; for workers in rural areas, the minimum monthly "council" wage is $60 to
 $80. However, prevailing wages in Malaysia, even in the sectors covered by wage
 councils, are higher than the minimum wages set by the wage councils and do pro-
 vide an adequate living.
 Under the Employment Act of 1955, working hours may not exceed 8 hours per
 day or 44 hours per workweek of 5  days. Each workweek must include one 24-
 hour rest period. The act also sets overtime rates and mandates public holidays, an-
 
 
 693
 nual leave, sick leave, and maternity allowances. The Labor Department of the Min-
 istry of Human Resources enforces these standards, but a shortage of inspectors pre-
 cludes strict enforcement. In October, Parliament adopted a new Occupational Safe-
 ty and Health Act (OSHA), which replaced the Factories and Machinery Act of 1967.
 The new OSHA covers all sectors of the economy, except the maritime sector and
 the military. The act established a National Occupational Safety and Health Council
 composed of workers, employers, and government representatives, to set policy and
 coordinate occupational safety and health measures. The act requires employers to
 identify risks and take precautions, including providing safety training to workers,
 and compels cornpanies having more than 40 workers to establish joint manage-
 ment-employee sarety committees. The act requires workers to use safety equipment
 and to cooperate with employers to create a safe, healthy workplace. There are cur-
 rently no specific statutory or regulatory prvisions which create a positive right for
 a worker to remove himself or herself from dangerous workplace conditions without
 arbitrary dismissal. Employ!ers or employees vio-ating the act are subject to substan-
 tial fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years.
 Significant numbers of contract workers, ineluding numerous illegal immigrants
 from Indonesia, work on plantations. Working conditions for these laborers compare
 poorly with those of direct hire plantation workers, many of whom belong to the Na-
 tional Union of Plantation Workers. Moreover, immigrant workers in the construc-
 tion and other sectors,particularly if illegal entrants, may not have access to Malay-
 sia's system of labor audication. Government investigations into this problem have
 resulted in a number of steps to eliminate the abuse of contract labor. For example,
 in addition to expanding programs to regularize the status of immigrant workers,
 the Government investigates complaints of abuses, endeavors to inform workers of
 their rights, encourages workers to come forward with their complaints, and warns
 employers to end abuses. Like other employers, labor contractors may be prosecuted
 for violating Malaysia's labor laws. The Government has taken action against labor
 contractors who violate the law, and has assessed fines. The minimum fine cur-
 rently assessed by law is $4,000. Effective April 1994, the minimum fine will in-
 crease five-fold. In principle, serious violators can be jailed, but, in practice, such
 punishments are rare.
