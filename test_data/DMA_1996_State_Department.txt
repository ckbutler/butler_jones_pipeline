 DOMINICA
 Dominica is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. A Prime Minister, a Cabinet and a unicameral Legislative
 Assembly compose the Government. A President, nominated by the Prime Minister
 in consultation with the leader of the opposition party, elected for a 5-year term by
 the Parliament, is head of state. The United Workers Party (UWP), led by Prime
 Minister Edison James, won 11 of 21 seats in Parliament in free and fair elections
 in June 1995. The UWP gained an additional seat in 1996 when the party won a
 by-election for a seat vacated by a member of the opposition. The Constitution calls
 for elections at least every 5 years.
 The Dominica Police is the only security force. It is controlled by and responsive
 to the democratically elected Government.
 Dominica's primarily agrarian economy depends on earnings from banana exports.
 The Government is attempting to develop the tourist industry, to diversify agricul-
 tural production, and to promote exports of raw fruits, vegetables, and coconut prod-
 ucts, both within and outside the region. Per capita gross domestic product was
 about $2,400 in 1994.
 
 
 Human rights are generally well respected. The principal human rights problems
 continued to be societal violence against women and children, and occasional in-
 stances of use of excessive force by police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices. There were, however, two reports of police
 brutality during the year. The police allegedly beat a young man in Grand Bay, but
 the Government has not charged anyone in the incident. In another case, police al-
 legedly beat up a suspected drug dealer. The director of public prosecutions decided
 not to file charges in that case.
 Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions continue to be problems in Dominica's
 only prison facility. The prison provides work therapy, sports programs, educational
 opportunities, and counseling for inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law reqiires that police charge per-
 sons with a crime within 24 hours after arrest or detention or release them from
 custody. This is generally honored in practice, although often those arrested on Fri-
 days remain the weekend in jail and are not charged until the following Monday.
 The other exception to usual practice is if the detainee cannot afford legal counsel.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for public trial before an inde-
 pendent, impartial court. Criminal defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty, are allowed legal counsel, and have the right to appeal. Courts provide free
 legal counsel to the indigent only in capital cases.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right of free
 expression, and the Government respects this in practice. The political opposition
 openly criticizes the Government. Dominica's main radio station is state owned and
 has a government-appointed board. There is also an independent radio station
 owned by the Catholic Church.
 The print media consist of three private newspapers. Dominicansenjoy good access
 to independent news sources through cable television and radio reception from
 neighboring islands. The print media consist of two private newspapers and political
 party journals; all publish without censorship or government interference.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and with one exception in 1996, the Government has respected them
 in practice. In August Prime Minister James banned political meetings in the
 Mahaut constituency when the ruling United Workers Party and the opposition
 Dominica Freedom Party failed to reach agreement on the use of a school and school
 grounds for a political rally. Both parties had scheduled a rally at the same time
 and place. Saying that there was a possibility of a breakdown in law and order,
 Prime Minister James banned all political meetings in the constituency for one
 weekend. The opposition Dominica Labour Party called the ban undemocratic. All
 parties, however, respected the order and no incidents were reported.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the authorities respect them in
 practice. The Government may revoke passports if subversion is suspected but has
 not done so in recent times.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however,
 government practice remains undefined.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 In the last national elections in June 1995, the United Workers Party defeated
 the incumbent Dominica Freedom Party, taking 11 of 21 seats in Parliament. In a
 by-election in August, the UWP gainedan additional seat when it won a seat va-
 cated by a member of the Dominica Freedom Party, giving the UWP a total of 12
 seats. The Dominica Freedom Party currently holds four seats, and the Dominica
 Labour Party holds five seats.
 There are no impediments in law or in fact to the participation of women in lead-
 ership roles in government or political parties. Voters elected two women to Par-
 liament in the June 1995 elections. Indigenous Carib Indians participate in national
 political life and enjoy the same civil rights accorded other Dominican nationals.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government restrictions on the formation of local human rights orga-
 nizations, although no such groups exist. Several advocacy groups, such as the Asso-
 ciation of Disabled People and a women's and children's self-help organization, oper-
 ate freely and without government interference. There were no requests for inves-
 tigations of human rights abuses from international or regional human rights
 groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution includes provisions against racial, sexual, and religious discrimi-
 nation, which the authorities respect in practice.
 Women.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, women do not benefit
 from any specific civil rights legislation. There is little open discrimination against
 women, yet sexual harassment and domestic violence cases are common, and there
 is no family court to deal specifically with domestic violence issues. Women can
 bring charges against husbands for battery, and both the police and the courts pros-
 ecute cases of rape and sexual assault, but there are no specific spousal abuse laws.
 The Welfare Department assists victims of abuse by finding temporary shelter, pro-
 viding counseling to both parties, or recommending police action. The Welfare De-
 partment reports all cases of abuse to the police. The courts may issue protective
 orders, but the police do not consistently enforce them.
 Property ownership continues to be deeded to "heads of households," who are usu-
 ally males. When the husband head of household dies without a will, the wife can-
 not inherit the property or sell it, although she can live in it and pass it to her chil-
 dren. In the civil service, the law establishes fixed pay rates for specific jobs, what-
 ever the gender of the incumbent. There is no law requiring equal pay for equal
 work for private sector workers.
 Children.-Various laws enumerate children's rights, but their enforcement is
 hampered by lack of staffing in government agencies. Reported cases of child abuse
 have more than doubled since 1993, when 253 were recorded; the Government has
 not responded with any increase in the number of social workers assigned to handle
 such cases. The Social Welfare Office, which has only six staff members to deal with
 all welfare problems, handles complaints of child abuse.
 Although the maximum sentence for sexual molestation (rape, incest) is life im-
 prisonment, the normal sentence given is 15 years except in the case of murder. The
 age of consent to sexual relations is 16 years.
 People With Disabilities.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, there
 is no specific legislation dealing with the disabled. There is no requirement mandat-
 ing access for those with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.-There is a significant Carib Indian population, estimated at
 3,000, of a total population of 72,000. Most live on a 3,700-acre reservation created
 in 1903. School, water, and health facilities available on the Carib reservation are
 rudimentary but similar to those available to other rural Dominicans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the legal right to organize, to
 choose their representatives, and to strike, but unions represent less than 10 per-
 cent of the work force. All unions are independent of the Government. While there
 are no direct ties, members of certain political parties dominate some unions There
 
 
 428
 is no restriction on forming labor federations, and unions are affiliated with various
 international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have legally defined
 rights to organize workers and to bargain with employers. Collective bargaining is
 widespread in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy, including the government
 service, and there is also recourse to mediation and arbitration by the Government.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and judicial and police au-
 thorities enforce union rights. In addition, employers must reinstate workers fired
 for union activities. It is legally compulsory for employers to recognize unions as
 bargaining agents once both parties have followed appropriate procedures. Depart-
 ment of Labour inspectors under the supervision of the Labour Commissioner en-
 force labor legislation, but the small Labour Inspection Office lacks qualified person-
 nel to carry out its duties.
 Labor regulations and practices governing Dominica's industrial areas and export
 firms do not differ from those prevailing in the rest of the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, andsuch labor is not known to exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment is 15 years. Employers generally observe this law without government en-
 forcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages for various cat-
 egories of workers. These were last revised in November 1989. The minimum wage
 rate for most categories of workers is $0.56 (EC$1.50) per hour, but for domestic
 servants it is $0.37 (EC$1.00) per hour if meals are included, and $0.46 (EC$1.25)
 per hour if meals are not included. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family. However, most workers (includ-
 ing domestics) earn more than the legislated minimum wage.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides for a mini-
 mum of 2 weeks' paid vacation per year. The Employment Safety Act provides occu-
 pational health and safety regulation. Local nongovernmental organizations and one
 major union consider it to be consistent with international standards. The Advisory
 Committee on Safety and Health is an established body but has never met. The
 rarely used enforcement mechanism consists of inspections by the Department of
 Labour, which can and does prescribe specific compliance measures, impose fines,
 and prosecute offenders. Workers have the right to remove themselves from unsafe
 work environments without jeopardy to continued employment.
