 BURUNDI
 In 1992 President Major Pierre Buyoya, who came to power in a bloodless coup
 d'etat in 1987, continued to head the Government and to carry out a controlled polit-
 ical reform program. On March 9, Burundians voted by a nine to one margin in
 favor of a new Constitution, which formally replaced the one-party State with a
 multiparty political system headed by a president, prime minister, council of min-
 isters, and the national assembly. Formal ties between the Government and the
 former ruling party, UPRONA, were officially severed, and, by the end of 1992,
 seven additional parties had been certified by the Government. Local, parliamen-
 tary, and presidential elections were expected in 1993. The President appointed a
 new Government in April, again under Prime Minister Sibomana, but with a change
 in some of the ministers. The President did not appoint any Ministers from opposi-
 tion parties to this Government which will serve until elections ar held. Until a
 Parliament is elected, the President will continue to have the authority to issue de-
 cree-laws, developed in consultation with the 24-member, ethnically balanced and
 predominantly civilian Council of Ministers.
 These changes were designed to help address political and social problems created
 by ethnic tensions which plague Burundi as a result of the traditional social, politi-
 cal, and economic dominance of Tutsis, a minority ethnic group re presenting roughly
 14 percent of the population over the Hutu (approximately 85 percent) and the
 Batwa (Pygmies, 1 percent). key Burundian institutions, including the educational
 system, the judicial system, security forces, and particularly the leadership of the
 military, continued to reflect Tutsi dominance despite efforts by the present Govern-
 ment to increase the participation of other ethnic groups.
 Burundi's approximately 18,000-member security forces, consisting of the military
 (the army and the gendarmerie) the police, and the Surete, continue to be domi-
 nated by the Tutsi ethnic group. lhe Surete is directly accountable to the President.
 While technically the army is responsible for protecting national borders and the
 endarmerie, police, and Suret are responsible for internal security, their roles are
 blurred in periods of crisis, most recently during the ethnic violence in November
 1991. Security~ frces   ommitted   serious human    rights  abuses  including
 extrajudcial killings. Burundi's total military expenditures for 1989, tie last year
 for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed
 analysis, were $28 million. While the Government has been under international
 pressure to reduce the defense share of the budget, it has not done so, in part due
 to reductions in international military assistance. The Government has indicated its
 willingness to confront the issue and in early 1993 will cohost a conference on the
 military's role in a democracy.
 Landlocked Burundi is extremely poor and densely populated. Over four-fifths of
 the working population are engaged in subsistence agrculture, working small, pri-
 vately owned plots. The small monetary economy is based largely on the export of
 coffee, with few other cash crops. In cooperation with the World Bank and the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund, the country has embarked on a structural adjustment pro-
 gram supportd by the donor community, which includes the privatization of a
 range of industries.
 totwithstanding the new Constitution and other reform measures, there were sig-
 nificant human rights abuses in 1992, many related to the outbreak of violence in
 November 1991. Triggered by attacks against civilian and miitarytarets by mem-
 bers of the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People (PALIPEHUTU), the vio-
 lence caused between 500 and 1,000 deaths and over 800 detentions. While some
 deaths occurred during the original attacks, most resulted from reprisals against
 Hutus by civilians and members of the security forces. In 1992 the Government con-
 tinued to detain arbitrarily large numbers of Hutus and prosecute, in trials which
 fell far short of international standards, approximately 300 Hutus for alleged par-
 ticipation in the violence or for providing support to the PALLPEHUTU. Five were
 sentenced to death. With very few exceptions, the Government failed to pursue seri-
 ous criminal investigations of many of the military and civilian personnel accused
 of human rights violations during the retaliatory attacks. Further, security forces
 continued to practice torture, partilcularly at the time of detention or during interro-
 gation.
 At the same time, in 1992 the President ontinued his program of ntnal unity
 and political reform, despite continued insurgent attacks and a coup attempt in
 March by forces that included some within the Government who were opposed to
 his reform efforts. In contrast to 1991, the security forces responded to insurgent
 attacks in Cibitke province in early April in a disciplined manner designed topro-
 tect the population. The Government also promulgated decree-laws, expanding free-
 
 
 doms of speech and assembly. The new Constitutional Court criticized and returned
 to the Government for revision the decree-law concerning the press. In 1992 women
 continued to experience extensive societal and legal discrimination, and workers
 faced a period of transition as the labor confederation attempted to establish a via-
 ble base after gaining its independence from the ruling party.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In late November and early Decem-
 ber of 1991, there were at least 551 Burundians (the number acknowledged by the
 Government) killed during the outbreak of violence triggered by attacks by the
 PALIPEHUTU on military and civilian targets. Other credible sources indicated
 that as many as 1,000 persons died. While Hutu and Tutsi civilians as well as mem-
 bers of the security forces died in the initial attacks, the majority of the deaths re-
 sulted from retaliatory attacks against Hutus, often targeted at suspected
 PALIPEHUTU members or sympathizers by civilians and members of the security
 forces.
 Human rights groups, including ITEKA, one of Burundi's two independent human
 rights leagues organized in 1991, issued reports documenting incidents in which in-
 dividuals were summarily and extrajudicially executed by members of the security
 forces. These included the case of 11 laborers killed by security forces at a Catholic
 boarding school at Kanyosha, south of Bujumbura, and that of 6 members of a fam-
 ily, including 4 children, executed in a private home at Muzinda. There were also
 eyewitness accounts of persons having been summarily executed while in the cus-
 tody of security forces, specifically at the Bubanza Brigade where detainees were re-
 portedly bayoneted or clubbed to death.
 The extent of official responsibility for these and other extrajudicial killings has
 not been determined. The Government insists th   the military high command did
 not orde   r condone the abuses. Nevertheless, the November 1991 violence per-
 sisted for several days until the Prime Minister, and ranking military and civilian
 officials went to the area and gave direct orders which, for the most part, were then
 respected. Moreover, despite many documented cases and direct appeals by human
 rights organizations, by the end of the year the Government could report that only
 three members of the military had been arrested for offenses committed during the
 violence. Its claims that civilian deaths were the result of their being caught in the
 crossfire between terrorists and security forces were inconsistent with confirmed ac-
 counts by eyewitnesses and survivors. Finally, while the Government had an-
 nounced that it intended to establish a commission of inquiry to determine the
 causes of the violence and deaths, no commission was formed, and no comprehensive
 report was made public.
 b. Disappearances.-A significant number of persons disappeared during the No-
 vember 1991 violence. Some may have been (as the Government claims) among the
 40,000 Burundians who fled from the country to Rwanda or Zaire as a result of the
 violence. There were, however, documented cases where persons disappeared after
 having been seen being detained by, or in the custody of, the security forces and
 where there was no available record of their detention or release. One credible re-
 port estimated several dozen disappearances occurred at the hands of the Burundi
 security forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While torture is forbidden by law and, along with cruel, inhuman, and degrading
 treatment, is expressly forbidden under Burundi's new Constitution, it did occur in
 1992 and, in previous years, reportedly resulted in death. Personal and eyewitness
 accounts of treatment during and following detention include descriptions of persons
 being bound so tightly as to cause temporary paralysis and scarring, beatings result-
 ing in broken bones, and starvation. Detainees reported having been held in custody
 without blankets or adequate clothing or food. According to a local human rights
 league, detainees also reported having been forced to kneel whle being interrogated.
 They were also observed being transported bound, gagged, and blindfolded, lying on
 the beds of military trucks.
 Numerous instances of torture were documented in relation to the November 1991
 incidents. Prison conditions are life threatening and characterized by severe over-
 crowding and inadequate hygiene, clothing, medical care, food, and water. Former
 detainees from November's violence reported that four or even five individuals were
 forced to share a poorly ventilated cell 2 meters square, and larger, group cells were
 observed to be very overcrowded. Prisoners had to rely on family members to ensure
 an adequate diet, and officials acknowledged that digestive illness was a major
 
 
 health problem in the prisons. The influx of detainees following the violence of No-
 vember 1991 created an extra burden on the system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Regular police and gendarmerie with ar-
 rest authority are permitted to make arrests without a warrant, but are legally obli-
 gated to submit a written report to a magistrate within 48 hours of the detention.
 The Public Prosecutor is then required to either order the detainee's release or issue
 an arrest warrant valid for 5 days. After an arrest, the charges must be confirmed
 by a magistrate in the presence of the detainee. The magistrate can order the sus-
 pect released or confirm the charges and continued detention, initially for 15 days
 and then subsequently for periods of 30 days as necessary to prepare the case or
 trial. Burundi law allows unlimited pretrial detention. While allowable under the
 law, bail is generally set only in cases involving crimes of financial wrongdoing. The
 Surete, which is under the control of the Presidency, is obligated to follow the same
 laws. However, some persons were detained by the Surete for a number of months
 without having their cases certified and forwarded to the Ministry of Justice as re-
 quired.
 In normal circumstances, prescribed procedures are generally followed in criminal
 cases, though time limits prescribed by law are often exceeded. The quality and
 timeliness of proceedings are constrained by the lack of a well-trained and ade-
 quately supported judiciary.
 During and following the violence of late 1991, members of the security forces (in-
 cluding the regular army), civilian officials, political activists, and private citizens
 arbitrarly detained hundreds of suspeted PALIPEHiUTU sympathizers. Some de-
 tainees disappeared, some were released aftr a review by a military or judicial offi-
 cial (and in some cases rearrested one or more times), and others were imprisoned
 for an extended period without any prsecutorial or judicial review. There are con-
 firmed reports o persons being held in prison for months following the violence
 without a dossier and without their names appearing on any list of detainees.
 The total number of persons detained in connection with the events of November
 1991 exceeded 800 and may have reached 1,000. By the end of 1992, according to
 the Ministry of .Justie, an estimated 250 people were held, either awaiting trial or
 in the process of being tried, all in civilian prisons. Another 131 had been tried,
 found guilty and received sentences (ranging from the death penalty to 1 year in
 prison). Nineteen had been aitted. At least 400 others detained in connection
 with the violence had been released, many after having spent months in prison
 without being charged for any crime. Some of those released expressed fear about
 their safety, and one stated that he felt he could never return this home province
 to reclaim his home and belongngs which had been seized by the security forces.
 During the first months of 1992, activists from political organizations which had
 not yet received certification as political parties were briefly detained by security
 forces for conducting political activities, including distributing political literature
 and campaigning aainst the proposed constitution. Those detained included rep-
 resentatives of the FRODEBU Part and the Royalist Party (which later became the
 Party for the Reconciliation of the People.) The detainees were released within days,
 and the detentions ceased after the parties gained legal status.
 Political exile is forbidden in the new Constitution, and, in general, the Govern-
 ment has not used exile of its nationals as a means of political control. At the same
 time, ex-President Bagaza and his wife have been denied permission to return to
 Burundi since 1987, although the Buyoya Government had stated that it was will-
 ing to negotiate the conditions of their return. Three Bagaza daughters, all minors,
 who remained in Burundi with relatives, are free to leave, according to the Govern-
 ment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Burundi's legal system follows the Napoleonic
 Code and incorporates elements of the Belgian and French systems. It is divided
 into civil and criminal courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex, and military
 courts that have jurisdiction over crimes committed by members of the military or
 those involving actions against the military. Since 1991, when the State Security
 Court was abolished, all political and security cases have been assigned to the ap-
 propriate criminal or military court. The new Constitution provides for a High Court
 to try the President, Prime Minister, or the President of the National Assembly in
 the event of high-level crime while in office. It also established the Constitutional
 Court to review all new laws (including decree-laws) and to preside over other con-
 stitutional issues. By the end of the year, the Court had written a number of deci-
 sions, including one which led the Government to rewrite the decree-law on the
 press which had been promulgated in April.
 Trials in civilian and military courts are technically public, though the public has
 traditionally not had regular access to information about cases (including court
 dates). Burundi law and the Constitution provide for accused persons (whether tried
 
 
 in a civilian or military court) the right to a defense. In practice, only a small per-
 centage of defendants have legal representation. Most defendants are not able to af-
 ford the fees of any of Burundi's 17 private lawyers, and the pro bono work of sev-
 eral did not begin to meet the need for defense counsel.
 The judicial system is constitutionally independent. In practice, however, the per-
 spective and decisions of the system reflect its continued dominance by the country's
 politically dominant ethnic group. The President has the authority to appoint judges
 as well as the power to pardon or reduce sentences. Most Burundians assume the
 courts represent the interests of the dominant Tutsi minority.
 During 1992 Burundi's judicial system was criticized by the Bar Association, the
 independent human rigts leagues, and the increasingly independent press. Major
 shortcomings identified are: the frequent lack of any defense counsel for the ac-
 cused; the [ack of adequate resources to allow the system to function effectively; the
 need for better training and improved awareness of human right issues on the part
 of judicial and enforcement officials; and the need for revisions in the Legal Code
 to bring it into conformity with the new Constitution and international standards.
 For example, confessions made during torture were accepted as evidence in 1992
 trials.
 The many trials that took place in 1992 involving persons accused of crimes relat-
 ed to the November 1991 unrest did not meet international standards. In most
 cases, the authorities brought charges against the accused under the Criminal Code
 for attacks against the security of the State or attacks against the security of the
 public order. All defendants were Hutu, while the judges were, almost without ex-
 ception, Tutsi. A number of defendants, including those who were subsequently sen-
 tenced to death, were tried in proceedings which lasted less than a day. Most de-
 fendants had very little education and had little understanding of either the charges
 against them or their rights under the law. Most did not have benefit of a defense
 attorney during their trials and were unaware of or unable to meet the legal re-
 quirements for filing an appeal. Judges rejected arguments that defendants were
 being tried for their political beliefs or their membership in or support for the
 PALIPEHUTU. Among those sentenced to death in July by the civil court were two
 acknowledged leaders of the PALIPEHUTU, who had been in detention throughout
 the violence.
 In one trial several Hutu defendants, subsequently sentenced to death, refused
 the services of Burundi lawyers in protest against the perceived bias of the justice
 system. Their appeals, which were filed with legal assistance, were pending at the
 end of the year. A second group accepted legal assistance only after a Belgian law-
 yer, supported by a local independent human rights league, joined the team of Bu-
 rundian lawyers.
 The total number of political prisoners held by the Government at the end of the
 year was unknown, although estimated to be at least 80. The figure included many
 of those who had received prison or death sentences in connection with the events
 of November 1991, based on the conclusion that they had been targeted for prosecu-
 tion because of their links to the PALIPEHUTU rather than demonstrated evidence
 of specific criminal actions. In addition, two former ministers and several former
 government officials from the previous government of Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza
 remained in prison at the end of the year. It was widely accepted that they had been
 targeted for prosecution for wrongdoing as public officials to discredit the former
 government. One other former minister who had been in prison since 1988 on simi-
 lar charges was released during 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy is provided for in the Constitution, and the law requiring search
 warrants is generally respected by the authorities. However, persons suspected of
 antigovernment activities, which is broadly interpreted by the Government and the
 courts, are subject to surveillance by security forces. In addition, security forces con-
 fiscated or destroyed personal property during the searches related to the 1991 inci-
 dents.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The right to free opinion and exprcssion is ex-
 plicitly provided for in the new Constitution, as long as these rights are expressed
 lin a manner consistent with the public law and order.* During 1992 Burundians
 witnessed expansion in free speech and press, in part as a result of the activities
 of new political parties and of discussion over decree-laws promulgated to embody
 the rights granted in the new Constitution.
 A new decree-law on the press promulgated in April proved controversial. It called
 for freedom of the press but imposed significant restrictions that were determined
 by the Constitutional Court to be unconstitutional. A new decree-law, promulgated
 
 
 27
 in December and designed to reflect the Court's finding, retained restrictions on per-
 missible criticisms of government policies, the person of the President and state-
 ments which could be construed as contrary to national unity. The law also provided
 for government review and possible censorship of all media prior to distribution.
 O1 four new private French-language newspapers which appeared during 1992 to
 supplement the government-controlled daily Le Renouveau, three survived at year's
 end. There were also four existing Kirundi-language papers, one of which was pro-
 duced by the Government. One of the nongovernment papers was published by the
 Catholic Church, while all the others were at least informally linked to one of the
 political parties. Those newspapers independent of government control dem-
 onstrated a willingness to report and comment on issues and stories that the gov-
 ernment-controlled press had previously been hesitant to cover. In response report-
 ing in Le Renouveau became somewhat less restrained, though still devoted to con-
 vincing the population of the correctness of the Government's policies.
 Newspaper readership remained limited. Le Renouveau had a readership of only
 3,000, concentrated almost exclusively in Bujumbura. Very few Burundians owned
 a television set, and most received only the single government-controlled station
 which produced French and Kirundi programming. The maority of the population
 relied on the government-controlled radio programming in French ad Kirundi for
 information about domestic and international affairs. eporting in both radio and
 television reflects government policies.
 The Government promised all political parties eqcual access to the official media
 and began to produce radio and television debates including representatives of the
 various political parties. At the same time, journalists for the government-controlled
 media continued to practice self-censorship, relative to both what stories they chose
 to report and how they r~ported them. In addition, their editors continued to prac-
 tice censorship. This included canceling programs or stories which the Government
 found unacceptable and altering texts, including direct quotations, to correspond to
 the Government's preferred language.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Burundians' freedom of assem-
 bly and association expanded in 1992. On December 31, 1991, the Government pro-
 mulgated a decree-law establishing clear, liberalized guidelines for granting permits
 for public meetings or parades. The newly formed political parties regularly held
 welf-attended meetings in Bujumbura but reported facing harassment and bureau-
 cratic obstacles when they applied for permits for meetings, particularly in rural
 areas.
 A decree-law on political parties was promulgated in June establishing the spe-
 cific criteria that parties must satisfy to be certified by the Government. These in-
 cluded a statement in support of the principle of national unity and core member-
 ship drawn from each of the provinces and reflecting the country's ethnic diversity.
 By year's end, eight parties, including the former sole party, UPRONA, had been
 certified, and all had begun preparing for national elections. In early December the
 Minister of Interior rejected the application of the Movement for Peace and Democ-
 racy on the grounds that the party's program was not supportive of national unity.
 By the end of the year the Government had not acted on an incomplete application
 submitted by the PALIPEHUTU.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion in Burundi. More than 60 per-
 cent of the population is Catholic, and the Catholic Church plays an important role
 in the lives ofboth rural and urban dwellers. A number of Protestant churches have
 a significant following. In contrast to the previous regime of Colonel Jean-Baptiste
 Bagaza, President Buyoya has freed religious prisoners, reopened closed churches,
 returned confiscated church properties, including houses and schools, allowed ex-
 pelled foreign missionaries to return, authorized workday religious services,
 reinstituted the activities of the catechists, and authorized church schools (including
 seminaries and literary and catechism classes), publications, and broadcasts.
 Religious organizations are subject to the same rules and restrictions that apply
 to secular organizations. They must obtain approval from the Government to oper-
 ate in the country, and a Burundi citizen has to be designated as the legal rep-
 resentative of each organization. During 1992 there were continuing incidents of
 temporary detentions and harassment of Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to comply
 with local and school officials' demands that they recognize secular authority and
 articipate in State-sanctioned practices, including singing the National Anthem.
 Those detained were released without facing formal charges, but at least one stu-
 dent was forced to withdraw permanently from school. The Government has still not
 granted the group legal status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-To control a meningitis epidemic in September and October, the Gov-
 ernment restricted internal travel. In addition, checkpoints and roadblocks manned
 
 
 28
 by security forces were common in areas affected by or suspected to be the source
 of activities of the PALIPEHUTU.
 Early in 1991, the Government began a program to encourage the voluntary repa-
 triation of the approximately 200,000 Burundian refugees who remained outside the
 country after fleeing ethnic violence in 1972 and 1988. Almost all were Hutus, and
 most lived in Tanzania. Approximately 40,000 additional Burundians, again mostly
 Hutus, fled the country during the ethnic violence in November 1991, and they were
 also encouraged to return as the repatriation program continued in 1992. By late
 1992, 50,000 long-term and recent refugees had returned and had been settled ei-
 ther on their former property or on other lands made available by the Government.
 The Government did establish a National Commission whose responsibilities in-
 cluded settling claims dealing with ownership of property. In October the Govern-
 ment issued a statement of its commitment to guarantee the dignity and security
 of returning refugees, allowing the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) to become actively involved in the repatriation proe o1     ,   s
 Approximately 270,000 refugees resided in Burundi at teaend of 1992, mostly
 Rwandan Tutsis who had fled their country in the 1960's. These refugees, for the
 most part, no longer required assistance of the UNHCR, even though they face for-
 mal discrimination relative to access to education employment opportunities, and
 political rights. The Government suspended extending citizenship to these refugees
 until the Government of Rwanda instituted a program of voluntary repatriation.
 Newly arrived refugees were accorded refugee status by the Government based on
 the review and recommendation of the UNHCR. The Government occasionally repa-
 triated Rwandans and Zairians who lacked appropriate documents or who were sus-
 pected of criminal or other activities, such as supporting the Rwandan Patriotic
 Front, which is involved in the armed conflict in Rwanda. In November gendarmes
 and public security police conducted sweeps in Bujumbura and Cibitoke provinces
 against undocumented persons that resulted in 250 detentions.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens To Change Their Gov-
 ernment
 Although in March Burundians voted overwhelmingly for the new Constitution
 which formally provides their right to change their government through direct
 multiparty elections every 5 years, the Buyoya Government remained firmly in
 power, and constitutional provisions remained to be tested in free and fair elections.
 Even under the new Constitution, the President will continue to appoint provincial
 governors and other key officials. UPRONA, the former single party, while formally
 separated from the Government early in 1992, continued to function as the de facto
 ruling party at the end of the year.
 Five of the seven newly certified political parties demanded that there be a formal
 transition government leading up to elections. The President maintained that the
 Constitution ruled out a formal transition government. However, he did establish
 the National Commission on Dialog on Democracy, which included representatives
 from all the parties as well as six key GRB Ministers. The Commission was given
 consultative powers only. An Electoral Commission with party representatives was
 dissolved after opposition party representatives objected to the participation of one
 member. The Government indicated that a schedule for elections would be estab-
 lished based on consultations with party representatives.
 According to the new Constitution, all Burundi citizens at least 18 years old have
 the right to vote, and, except for members of the military and judges, have the right
 to be members of political parties. Women have traditionally not played a significant
 role in public life in Burundi and remain seriously underrepresented in the Govern-
 ment. However, there are two female ministers one ambassador, two presidential
 advisors, several judges, and two members of die National Commission in charge
 of election preparations. The indigenous Pygmy groups living in remote areas have
 difficulty participating in the political process (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In April the Government established a human rights center under the control of
 the Ministry of Justice which was given responsibility for educating Burundians re-
 garding their rights and responsibilities in the area of human rights. The Govern-
 ment also designated officers with command and instructional responsibilities to
 participate in two conferences sponsored by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) dealing with international humanitarian law and the responsibilities
 of security forces.
 The two independent human rights groups faced bureaucratic obstacles, such as
 inordinate delays by Ministry of Justice officials in responding to requests for infor-
 
 
 29
 mation on specific cases or for permission to make visits to prisons, but they were
 not actively impeded from carrying out their activities. These activities incluaed in-
 vestigations and reports on individual human rights cases and civic education pro-
 grams. The two organizations undertook a joint investigation of the violence of No-
 vember 1991. The Government resisted recommendations made by Amnesty Inter-
 national and ITEKA, one of the local human rights organizations, that there be an
 independent, comprehensive investigation to determine responsibility.
 International and local human rights groups were allowed to work in Burundi
 throughout the year. Amnesty International visited the country after the violence
 of November 1991 and in May issued a report documenting human rights abuses
 during the violence, especially the extent of extrajudicial killings. A second report
 issued in late November provided further documentation of abuse and criticized the
 Government for taking no action to discipline officials known to have been involved
 or for tasking measures to prevent future abuse. The ICRC had a representative in
 place during 1992, with access to detainees and prisoners held in connection with
 the violence of 1991 in civilian prisons.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Burundi's new Constitution explicitly provides equal status and protection for all
 citizens, without distinction based on sex, origin, ethnicity, religion, or opinion. In
 practice de facto discrimination against Hutus and Batwas is a parent in many
 areas of society despite government efforts to discourage it by relying on entrance
 requirements based on merit alone as well as positive recruitment programs. As a
 result, Tutsis continued to dominate key institutions, including the military and the
 judicial establishment, particularly at the leadership levels where recent efforts by
 the Government to attract Hutus into the professions had not yet had a significant
 impact. At the same time, Hutus have made significant inroads into the civil serv-
 ice, and the number of Hutus, who represent 85 percent of the population, exceeded
 the number of Tutsis entering secondary school. On the other hand, the indigenous
 Batwa (Pygmy) minority, which comprises perhaps 1 percent of the population, re-
 mained almost completely marginalized, economically, socially, and politically.
 While the Government stated its commitment to serve all Burundians, most Batwa
 continued to live in isolation, without attending school or having access to govern-
 ment services, including health care.
 Despite constitutional guarantees and a commitment on the part of the current
 Government to increased opportunities, women hold a secondary place in Burundi
 society. Although assured of the same pay as men if they held the same job, women
 were far less likely than men to hold midor high-level positions in either the public
 or private sectors. The traditional distinction between men's and women's roles re-
 mained institutionalized in rural areas, where women are responsible for most food-
 crop production, and in the military services, from which they are completely ex-
 cluded. In addition, the explicitly discriminatory elements of inheritance laws and
 those dealing with obtaining credit have not yet been changed.
 Violence against women, including wife beating and rape, is known to take place,
 but there is no documentation of its extent. Police do not normally intervene in do-
 mestic disputes, and the media do not cover incidents of violence against women,
 including rape. There were no known court cases dealing with abuse of women. The
 Government has not addressed the issue of violence against women, and, while
 there were a number of women's organizations, they were involved primarily in eco-
 nomic development activities for women.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The new Constitution and the draft labor code pro-
 tect the rights of Burundi workers to form unions; however, only about 10,000 work-
 ers in the wage economy participate in the new system of voluntary checkoffs put
 in place to help finance union activities. Most workers are from the ranks of urban

 During 1992 Burundi's national umbrella organization of labor unions faced a pe-
 riod of transition, after having been granted its independence from the ruling party
 (and the Government) on December 30, 1991. While government subsidies continued
 for several months in to order ease the transition, the Organization of Free Unions
 of Burundi or CSB (formerly the Union of Burundi Workers or UTB) had to seek
 new sources of financial and organizational support, largely through the new check-
 off system. The CSB represented the interests of labor during negotiations to draft
 a new labor code that is expected to be promulgated as a decree-law in early 1993.
 The planned revisions in the new labor code are expected to reflect the Govern-
 ment s commitment to structural adjustment including privatization, as encouraged
 by donor organizations and countries.

 According to the 1988 Labor Code, workers other than those involved in activities
 related to national security have the right to strike, but the strike must be called
 by a recognized union and cannot take place unless the sponsoring union has given
 15 days' notice of intent to strike. Individuals participating in strikes or labor ac-
 tions not in accordance with the law are subject to arrest. There were no strikes
 during 1992. The draft labor code does not fundamentally alter Burundian workers'
 right to strike.
 The CSB was free to affiliate internationally, and, in addition to membership in
 regional and continentwide trade union bodies, it maintains cooperative relation-
 ships with a number of trade union organizations outside Africa. It also worked with
 the Afro-American Labor Center to sponsor seminars for Burundi union leaders on
 the questions of the role of women in the labor movement and the role of unions
 in the democratization process.
 b. Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--Collective bargaining is not yet
 protected by law, and labor negotiations are conducted largely between unions and
 employers (mainly branches of the Government) under the supervision of the Na-
 tional Labor Council, composed of representatives from labor, the Government, and
 employers. Under the incumbent Code, employers and the State (which were often
 one and the same) are obligated to provide relatively genemus benefits, including
 free health coverage, liberal maternity benefits, and extensive job protection.
 Burundi law   *hibits discrimination against union members and organizers, and
 there were no documented cases of such discrimination in 1992. A three-step process
 was available to resolve complaints regarding labor practices or policies toward a
 union or union member: direct employer-employee negotiations under the auspices
 of the CSB; an administrative hearing before a government labor inspector; and a
 legal proceeding before the Labor Court (or an administrative court in the case of
 a public employee).
 There are no export processing zones in Burundi, though a decree-law making the
 entire nation a free zone for many export-oriented industries was promulgated on
 August   31. The   decree-law  requires  that  salaries  meet  the  minimum
 interprofessional standards fixed by law, but employers are given more latitude in
 negotiations with employees. In addition, the law has made it possible for employers
 to charge employees or a share of the cost of their health benefits. Finally, the law
 contains provisions that make it easier for qualifying enterprises to hire foreign
 workers and exonerate them from the 3-percent tax on the salaries of foreign work-
 ers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced and compulsory labor are
 prohibited by law and not practiced. The International Labor Organization's Com-
 mittee of Experts, however, in its 1992 report reiterated its concerns about various
 decrees and orders still in effect: for example, one requiring obligatory community
 development work and others which provide for prison labor sentences for working
 journalists who violate press restrictions.
 d. Minimum Ae for Employment of Children.-Buruni's 1988 Labor Code states
 that children un er the age of 16 are not allowed to be employed by "an enterprise,"
 even as apprentices, though it also states that they can undertake occasionai work
 which does not damage their health or schooling. Young children are, in fact, often
 seen doing heavy manual labor, including transporting bricks on their heads, in
 rural areas in daytime during the school year. Children are legally forbidden from
 working at night, though many did so in the informal sector. As a practical matter,
 children are obligated by custom and economic necessity to help support their family
 by participating in activities related to subsistence agriculture, production in family
 based enterprises, and the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions ok Work.-The nationally established formal minimum
 wage for unskilled workers oes not meet the daily needs for a family. Employees
 working under contract, particularly in urban areas, generally earn significantly
 more than the minimum wage. Actual salaries are determined based on complex
 schedules applicable to the private and public sectors. All employees in the public
 sector work under contract, while the CSB estimates that 70 percent of employees
 working in the formal private sector are covered by a contract. The 1988 Labor Code
 provides extensive protections regarding job security and maternity and sick leave.
 Most families live outside urban areas and are involved in subsistence agricultural
 production which allows them to supplement their income with homegrown food-
 stuffs. Many urban households rely on more than one wage earner or supplements
 earned from participation in petty commerce.
 The 1988 Labor Code imposes a maximum 8-hour workday and 45-hour workweek
 except in cases when workers are involved in activities related to national security.
 Supplements must be paid for overtime in any case. The Labor Code establishes
 
 
 health and safety standards and assigns enforcement responsibilit to the Ministry
 of Labor. However, enforcement suffers from a shortage of staff and resources.
