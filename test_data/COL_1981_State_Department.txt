 COLOMBIA
 Colombia has been ruled by freely elected governments
 for all but five years (1953-57) of the present century.
 Colombian politics have been dominated by two political
 parties, the Liberal and Conservative, since the mid-
 19th century. Colombia's constitution provides for
 a popularly elected president and congress and an independent
 judiciary. According to the constitution, the president's
 party must give the second principal party "adequate
 and equitable" representation in the government. However,
 during the second half of 1981, both parties began
 giving serious consideration to changing this constitutional
 provision to allow a clearer delineation between the
 policies of the ruling party and the opposition. Minor
 parties exist and are legal in Colombia, but none has
 attracted widespread popular support in recent years.
 Civil and political liberties are guaranteed by the
 constitution. A constitutionally authorized state
 of siege, which permits the curtailment of some civil
 and political freedoms, has been imposed in varying
 degrees for the last 30 years and is currently in effect.
 The constitution enables the president, with the concurrence
 of his ministers, to declare a state of siege in event
 of foreign war or domestic strife. In 1978 the government
 decreed a security statute, which provides for military
 trials of civilians accused of a wide range of crimes
 against the public order. Both the state of siege
 and the security statute have been severely criticized
 by human rights and opposition groups as denying basic
 human rights. The government has argued that these
 measures are necessary because of numerous terrorist
 attacks and other threats against public order by insurgent
 groups.
 In March 1981 guerrillas of the April 19th Movement
 (M-19) launched an incursion in southern Colombia with
 Cuban support, primarily training and logistics. That
 attack, and an M-19 mortar assault on the presidential
 palace in July, led to increased military and police
 operations against the M-19 and other subversive groups.
 Almost all M-19 members captured in the attempted incursion
 in southern Colombia were brought before military courts
 and found guilty of rebellion. The remaining handful
 of M-19 members were brought before an on-going trial
 in Bogota, where they faced an assortment of charges
 for previous crimes. Approximately 80 people were
 detained for questioning or arrested following the
 assault on the presidential palace. Local human rights
 groups charged that there were irregularities in the
 trial procedures of those captured in southern Colombia
 and cases of harassment and torture in the round-up
 of suspects after the mortar assault.
 The congressionally-approved limited amnesty (which
 excluded serious crimes, such as murder, robbery and
 assault) ended on July 22, with only 20 subversives
 taking advantage of it. The M-19 and most other subver-
 (880)
 
 
 381
 sive groups rejected the amnesty offer and indicated
 that the increased armed attacks were their response.
 They also promised to disrupt the 1982 presidential
 and congressional elections.
 As part of the settlement which led to the release
 of the diplomatic hostages held by the M-19 in the
 Dominican Republic embassy in 1980, the Inter-American
 Human Rights Commission completed an investigation
 of human rights in Colombia. In-August 1981 the commission
 reported that Colombia was a nation respecting the
 rule of law, but that the prolonged enforcement of
 the state of siege and the security statute endangered
 citizens' rights as guaranteed by the constitution.
 The Commission's investigation found some cases of
 torture and illegal searches and detentions, but concluded
 that these did not reflect official policy. The commission
 urged the government to pursue and punish expeditiously
 officials guilty of such acts and to take stronger
 measures to protect campesinos' rights during military
 operations in the countryside. The commission recommended
 that the state of siege be lifted and that the security
 statute be abolished as soon as conditions permitted.
 The Turbay administration has consistently expressed
 its willingness to lift the state of siege and abolish
 the security statute, when the insurgents lay down
 their arms. It has argued that the rule of law and
 the Colombian constitution must be respected, and that
 the government has an obligation to protect society
 as a whole from those who rob, murder, maim and kidnap.
 During the last quarter of 1981 the president convoked
 a summit meeting of leaders of labor organizations,
 business associations, the church and military to discuss
 social and economic problems. At the same time, the
 president agreed to the establishment of a committee
 comprising eminent figures of Colombian society, includ-
 ing the left, to discuss the public order situation.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution states that public officials may be
 held responsible for abuses of authority and for acts
 of omission in the exercise of their authority. Torture
 is forbidden by law and is contrary to custom. High-
 ranking Colombian officials have decried its use.
 During the-past year, the government hoped that its
 amnesty offer would be accepted, at least by a respect-
 able number of subversives, and for this reason attempted
 to ensure that subversives who were taken into custody
 or captured-were treated fairly. However, during the
 initial stages of the battle between the M-19 and the
 armed forces-in southern Colombia, there were charges
 of newly-captured prisoners being tied to stakes in
 open fields before they were transferred to regular
 prisons. A prominent sculptress who was detained follow-
 ing the M-19 mortar attack on the presidential palace
 claimed that she was blindfolded during her 12 hours
 of interrogation. The head of an athletic association,
 who was arrested and charged with aiding the guerrillas,
 claims that he was blindfolded and tortured.
 
 
 382
 In April 1981, the president of a union of doctors
 employed by the government charged that some doctors
 had participated in a cover-up by signing false medical
 reports on prisoners' health -- a charge later denied
 by the Colombian Medical Association. The report of
 the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, which was
 released in August 1981, indicated there have been
 cases of torture, although this abuse is contrary to
 official policy, and recommended that the government
 act more swiftly to investigate and punish those responsible.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 The Colombian constitution specifically proscribes
 the death penalty. The Colombian council of state,
 the organization ultimately responsible for adjudicating
 administrative abuses, has awarded indemnities for
 wrongful death at the hands of government forces found
 guilty of having abused their authority.
 Following the armed forces' battle with the M-19 in
 southern Colombia, the family of a female leader of
 the M-19 who was killed requested her remains from
 the government. The authoritites stated that it was
 impossible to comply since she had been hastily buried
 in a mass grave owing to the tropical climate and remote
 location. The family has expressed concern about the
 circumstances of this guerrilla's death.
 The M-19, FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia)
 and other guerrilla bands committed hundreds of terrorist
 acts against government officials, businessmen, campesinos
 and ordinary citizens during 1981. In the first half
 of 1981 a reportedly renegade branch of the M-19 kidnapped
 and then murdered a United States citizen official
 of the Summer Institute of Linguistics after the institute
 refused to abandon its work with Indians. Approximately
 150 campesinos have been killed by the guerrilla groups
 for refusing to cooperate with them.
 In August 1981, a serious riot took place in one of
 Botota's prisons in protest of prison conditions.
 Generally, Colombia's prisons are badly overcrowded,
 but the facilities vary greatly in quality. Normally,
 prisoners have access to cafeterias, barbershops, stores,
 medical treatment and recreational facilities. Prisoners
 are fed a typical Colombian diet and can supplement
 it with purchases from prison stores. Family members
 and friends are normally allowed to visit prisoners
 regularly and to bring them food and clothes. The
 government's budget for 1981 includes funds for improvements
 in medical, recreational and work facilities at prisons.
 Most prisoners accused of security-related crimes are
 held in regular prisons and segregated from common
 criminals, but some have been held in military installations
 where conditions are at least equal to regular prisons.
 
 
 383
 .c. Disappearances
 While allegations have been made, there were no confirmed
 .cases. of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The government bas-broad powers of arrest and detention
 .under the existing state of-siege. The government
 has-repeatedly stated, however, that no one is arrested
 simply for political-beliefs, and that all those who
 have been detained are suspected of committing crimes
 such as rebellion or acts of violence. Those accused
 or. convicted of "sedition, rebellion and uprising,"
 but who have not also committed violent crimes, could
 have-benefited from the government's amnesty offer,
 which expired in July 1981.
 Colombia's constitution provides for habeas corpus
 within 72 hours of arrest in most cases. However,
 habeas corpus does not apply to persons detained under
 article 28 (relatLng to disturbance of public order)
 during the first ten days of detention. Thus, in practice,
 prisoners are often held incommunicado for at least
 the first 72 hours and, in cases under article 28,
 ,for much longer.
 Following the M-19 incursion in southern Colombia and
 its mortar assault on the presidential palace, a number
 -of suspects were detained for questioning or arrested.
 In two highly publicized events, Gabriel Garcia Marquez,
 Colombia's.well-known author, and FelLsa Bursztyn,
 a sculptress, sought asylum in Mexico, charging that
 they anticipated capricious arrests. In both cases,
 the government stated that they were free to leave
 .the country, although Colombian military sources claimed
 proof axisted that Felisa Bursztyn had acted as a courier
 between-the M-19 and its Cuban supporters.
 In addition to the kidnapping and murder of the American
 Summer Institute of Linguistics official, the M-19,
 FARC and other guerrilla groups have repeatedly kidnapped
 persons for ransom or propaganda. In some cases, those
 kidnapped have-been held and tortured in so-called
 people's prisons without consideration for civil or
 human rights.
 e. Denial of FaLr Public Trial
 The rights of public access to a trial and due process
 .are guaranteed by the constitution and are generally
 honored in practice. In late February 1981, however,
 the authorities barred the press from the military
 courts and censored television and radio coverage of
 the M-19 trials. While the press was barred from the
 courts, it was allowed to report extensively on progress
 of the trials, using eyewitness and other accounts.
 Prisoners may be represented by attorneys of their
 choice,-and, if they have none, the court will appoint
 one. Court proceedings are:closed until the investigation
 of the circumstances is completed and an indictment
 is handed down. Owing to an overburdened judicial
 system, many persons indicted for common crimes never
 come to trial, but are'simply released after serving
 
 
 384
 the minimum sentence applicable to the crime in question.
 Under a recently-enacted "judicial emergency program,"
 the government appointed 800 auxiliary judges to hear
 three million pending cases -- nearly two million of
 them criminal matters. The minister of justice reported
 that, under the judicial emergency program, over 6,000
 prisoners have been released since January 1981.
 Under the 1978 security statute, the following offenses
 are tried by military courts: kidnapping for political
 purposes; promoting or leading an armed uprising; commktting
 violent acts against collective security or integrity;
 causing public disturbances; damaging property by the
 use of explosives; delivering, sending or storing illegal
 goods, money or documents, or forcing any other person
 to do so; and crimes against the military.
 Whether tried in civil or military courts, the accused
 is entitled to counsel, and counsel has free access
 to the defendant for private consultations. Defendants
 are made fully aware of the charges brought against
 them, and they and their lawyers may inform themselves
 of the evidence on which the charges are based.
 The recent trials of the M-19 members captured during
 the attempted incursion in southern Colombia have been
 concluded more rapidly than those of the subversives
 arrested in 1979, following the robbery of military
 weapons in Bogota. Although the original reason for
 the involvement of military courts in trials for security-
 related offenses was to permit more prompt trials than
 was possible by the overburdened civil court system,
 the trials of those arrested in 1979 became encumbered
 in the effort to try a large group on a variety of
 charges. Those captured in the south faced the single
 charge of rebellion and were caught in the act. Their
 trials lasted an average of six weeks, whereas the
 trials of those captured in 1979 following the arms
 robbery still continue. The defense lawyers of the
 M-19 guerrillas captured in the south are appealing,
 as provided for in the military code, because of alleged
 procedural irregularities and harassment of defense
 lawyers.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution requires a court order before the
 authorities can enter a private home, except in the
 case of hot pursuit of a person seen committing a crime,
 who attempts to seek refuge in his own home. While
 there have been sporadic abuses of this right in remote
 areas of the country, the concept is widely respected
 in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These constitutionally-guaranteed rights have been
 generally respected, in spite of the state of siege.
 The press often vigorously attacks the government and
 its leaders. However, the 1978 security statute gives
 the government authority to ban radio and television
 broadcasts dealing with subversive activities and public
 order.
 
 
 Public meetings, marches and demonstrations are normally
 and frequently held without interference, although
 the government can impede public assembly when it anticipates
 violence. Generally, prior permission is required
 for large demonstrations.
 The Colombian constitution guarantees freedom of religion.
 Although an overwhelming majority of Colombians are
 Roman Catholics, there is no discrimination against
 others.
 Colombian workers freely exercise the right to form
 unions and, in the private sector, to bargain collectively
 and strike. In the public sector, "public employees"
 do not have the legal right to negotiate or strike,
 and "official employees" may negotiate, but not strike.
 In practice, however, they both negotiate and strike.
 The labor code is administered impartially, regardless
 of the ideology of the union. Some labor organizations
 have charged that the government has misused the security
 statute's restriction on the right of assembly to hamper
 legitimate trade union activity. Trade union leaders
 fully participate in the electoral process and are
 often members of the national congress and municipal
 assemblies.
 Native Colombians enjoy all rights and privileges of
 full citizenship, including the right to vote. Notwithstanding
 their constitutional rights, Colombian Indians have
 suffered abuses at the hands of local landowners, cattlemen
 and prospectors seeking to expand their own fortunes
 at the expense of the Indians. The government, working
 through two public institutions to enhance the welfare
 and protection of Indians, has constrained the worst
 of such abuses and is now seeking to promote greater
 local accommodation through community action, public
 education, legal aid etc.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Internal travel controls consist of airport and highway
 document checks and inspection for illegal arms. Foreign
 residents leaving the country must have an exit permit.
 Under a special decree aimed at controlling drug traffic,
 there are increased restrictions on the movement of
 aircraft and ships. In areas under military control,
 because of efforts against rural guerrilla groups,
 the movement of civilians has been subjected to more
 severe restrictions.
 Colombians who have sought asylum in foreign embassies
 have been free to leave Colombia, e.g., Gabriel Garcia
 Marquez and Felisa Bursztyn. Expatriate citizens are
 allowed by law to repatriate. Any Colombian with a
 valid passport and proof that he has paid his taxes
 is free to leave the country without unusual restrictions.
 Colombian minors must have written permission of both
 parents to leave the country. Foreigners who are found
 guilty of misdemeanors are usually deported.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Colombia has a democratic system of government, and
 elections are generally honest. The authorities respect
 the constitutional right of persons over age 18 to
 
 
 386
 vote. Persons convicted of certain crimes can be disfranchised.
 Public employees are forbidden by law to participate
 in political campaigns, but can vote. National elections
 are held every four years and local elections every
 two years. Extremely high rates of voter abstention
 appear to indicate that in practice the extent of popular
 interest in politics is limited.
 Colombian politics are dominated by two major parties,
 the Liberal and the Conservative. The current chief
 executive is a Liberal, as was his predecessor. The
 major political parties encompass sectors with widely
 divergent political views. Opposition parties function
 freely, are allowed to raise funds, field candidates,
 hold public meetings and have access to the media.
 Some groups publish their own newspapers.
 In October 1981, in order to examine Colombia's social
 and economic problems, President Turbay convoked a
 meeting of leaders of labor organizations, business
 associations, the church and military. It is expected
 that some of the recommendations stemming from the
 meeting will lead to new economic and social legislation.
 In a further effort to bring harmony to Colombian society,
 the Turbay administration agreed to sponsor a commission
 to examine the public order situation. The commission
 is expected to make recommendations on how all Colombians,
 including those engaged in subversive activities, can
 better participate in society within a constitutional
 framework.
 As more Colombian women graduate from universities
 and participate in the work force, they are increasingly
 active at all levels of society. They serve as legislators,
 judges, departmental governors, party leaders, government
 officials and diplomats. The Turbay administration
 currently has a female minister of labor, the third
 woman to hold this post. Women's organizations are
 actively engaged in the current political campaign
 focusing on the 1982 elections. Colombia signed the
 convention calling for the elimination of all forms
 of discrimination against women at the United Nations
 Conference on the Decade for Women.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Colombian government has actively participated
 in international and regional human rights bodies.
 Colombia was one of the first nations to ratify the
 American Convention on Human Rights. It has submitted
 reports to the United Nations Committee on Human Rights,
 and under article 4 of the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights, it has notified the United
 Nations that'extraordinary measures, such as the state
 of siege and the security statute, are necessary in
 Colombia.
 As previously mentioned, the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commision (IAHRC) of the Organization of American States
 submitted a report on human rights in Colombia to the
 government in August 1981. This report followed one
 submitted the year before by Amnesty International.
 Both human rights organizations were given broad access
 to prisons, prisoners, officials and human rights activists.
 
 
 387
 As a result of continued insurgency, the government
 has argued that, at this time, it is not able to lift
 the state of siege or abolish the security statute,
 as recommended by both human rights organizations.
 While giving access to international human rights organizations
 to investigate allegations of human rights violations,
 the government has stressed Colombia's national sovereignty
 and its ultimate responsibility for protecting its
 citizens' rights.
 Nationally, the Permanent Committee for the Defense
 of Human Rights is the most active organization in
 monitoring the local human rights situation. In its
 task it is often joined by the Political Prisoners'
 Solidarity Committee and the Committee of Relatives
 of Political Prisoners. Colombian human rights organizations
 follow trials of those accused of security offenses,
 investigate reports of human rights violations, provide
 defense lawyers and publish newsletters. Periodic
 human rights forums are also held.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The slowdown in economic activity occurring in 1980
 has extended into 1981. It is most likely that the
 growth rate during 1981 will not exceed the four percent
 reached in 1980. However, it is expected that a frost
 in Brazil during 1981 will boost the price of coffee
 and help revitalize Colombia's slack economy in 1982.
 Per capita gross national product was $1,010 in 1979.
 An acceleration in the rate of inflation, estimated
 at 30 percent in 1981, has exacerbated the economy's
 problems, and has had a particularly harmful effect
 on the lower-middle class and the poorest, particularly
 farmers, who cannot defend their incomes against declining
 purchasing power. Their plight has been aggravated
 by the fall in prices of such crops as coffee, sugar
 and cotton. Economic policymakers continued to pursue
 an essentially anti-inflationary policy. However,
 these efforts to slow price increases included restrictive
 monetary and fiscal policies which not only reduced
 public sector spending to meet acknowledged social
 needs but also slowed employment-creating investment.
 According to Colombian government statistics, unemployment
 fluctuated between 8.8 and 9.5 percent during 1981.
 That is a modest improvement over the ten percent registered
 the previous year. Underemployment was at another
 12-14 percent. Usually omitted from any official labor
 statistics are the estimated 2.5 million children under
 age 15 in Colombia who work under poor salary and work
 conditions and without the protection of the Colombian
 labor code. The national salary council periodically
 establishes minimum wage levels for both industry and
 agriculture. While increases in minimum wages have
 kept pace.with increases in the cost of living in recent
 years, workers have not recuperated from losses experienced
 in 1968-75.
 Another negative feature of the Colombian economy is
 the inequality in the distribution of the nation's
 .wealth. According to a 1979 World Bank Report, the
 wealthiest four percent of Colombians receive 28 percent
 . of the national income, while the poorest 40 percent
 receive only.ten percent. Colombia has a highly progressive
 income tax, but tax evasion is believed to be widespread,
 
 
 388
 and direct taxation is declining as a proportion of
 government revenue. Land tenure shows similar distortions:
 the top ten percent of the landowners hold 80 percent
 of the land, while the bottom ten percent own only
 0.2 percent. A notable exception to income maldistribution
 is in Colombia's important coffee growing regions,
 where farms have traditionally been medium to small-
 sized. Significant regional inequalities also exist,
 with the best economic opportunities, health care facilities
 and education available in the largest cities. This
 has contributed to the problem of heavy, though decreasing,
 migration from the countryside to urban areas.
 Colombia has made great progress in recent years in
 social services, although there is considerable room
 for improvement in meeting the basic human needs of
 significant portions of the population. According
 to the most recent World Bank statistics, 73 percent
 of city dwellers and 46 percent of the rural population
 have access to safe water -- a significant improvement
 over 1964, when only 30 percent of the total population
 had such access. There is a severe teacher shortage,
 particularly in the countryside where, compared to
 the cities, educational facilities are substandard,
 and teachers' qualifications are poor. The adult literacy
 rate was estimated at 81 percent in 1970, a significant
 improvement over the 63 percent registered in 1960.
 Colombia's infant mortality rate was 65 per 1,000 live
 births in 1978, and average life expectancy was 62.7
 years in 1979. Total fertility rate was 3.9 percent
 in 1979. Again, however, regional differences are
 substantial. The country's housing deficit is growing
 at an annual rate of 5.3 percent. The average number
 of persons per room was 1.8. The vast majority of
 Colombians over age 65 do not receive any social security
 benefits.
 In the 1980 budget the social sector ministries (labor,
 health and government) accounted for some 30 percent
 of government expenditures. As two specilic examples
 of current social sector spending, primary health services
 have been established in 1,037 localities since 1979,
 and the government institution which finances low-cost
 housing had a budget in 1980 almost four times as large
 as the year before. During the last half of 1980,
 the government instituted a major adult literacy campaign
 and approved legislation which would extend social
 security benefits to retirees and family members.
 The economic situation of the Colombian woman, though
 improving, is not equal to that of the Colombian man.
 Women have equal civil and property rights. They comprise
 just over 25 percent of the economically active population
 but are concentrated in low-productivity and low-income
 sectors. Historically, the unemployment rate for women
 has been higher than for men, but this difference has
 decreased in recent years. Although Colombian women
 are legally entitled to equal pay and are normally
 paid equal salaries when employed by the government,
 in private industry they are almost always paid less
 than men for the same work. A private survey conducted
 in Cali in 1980 showed that women with the same age,
 education, experience and jobs earned only 75 percent
 as much as their male counterparts.
 There is no discrimination against women in the education
 system. An increasing number of females are receiving
 higher education, and women currently comprise 30 percent
 of the university population. President Turbay has
 created a national council for the integration of women
 in development, a public body directly under the presidency
 whose functions are to advise the president and collaborate
 with the government on programs aimed at achieving
 greater female participation in the public and private
 sectors.
