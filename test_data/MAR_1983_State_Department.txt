 MOROCCO*
 The Moroccan political system is a constitutional monarchy
 under which the King holds vast powers. In practice the King's
 power is limited by personal, familial, tribal, and economic
 ties and interests. The King is not only temporal leader of
 the country but is also the religious leader of the Muslim
 community of Morocco which encompasses virtually the entire
 population. As the latest in a long line (since 1649) of heads
 of the Alaouite dynasty, King Hassan II inherits a special
 stature in the country. Some decisions are made primarily by
 the King, for example, in the area of foreign policy. Policy
 on many other matters is drawn up by the Government and
 requires the approval of the Parliament. The Government is
 named by the King, who pays attention to the relative weights
 of political parties in choosing his Cabinet.
 Morocco is a traditional society in the process of rapid modern-
 ization. Since obtaining independence from French protection
 in 1956, the Government has attempted to transform the admini-
 strative system into one more responsive to evolving popular
 requirements and demands. Although the Government likes to
 define its political system as a "developing democracy," in
 many areas traditional, hierarchical relationships still pre-
 vail.
 On balance, there was progress on human rights in Morocco
 during 1983. A number of Socialist political and labor acti-
 vists who had been imprisoned at various stages of recent
 Moroccan political history were released, although 21 indivi-
 duals, claiming to be dissident members of the Socialist Union
 of Popular Forces (USFP) were arrested in May for disturbing
 the peace. Political activity heightened in connection with
 the June municipal elections. New political journals appeared
 and those already in existence continued active debate on
 virtually all questions of political interest. Charges of
 violations of human rights are generally dealt with openly and
 fully by the Moroccan judicial system, except for charges of
 inhumane prison conditions. Similarly, where there have been
 charges of violation of political rights, those charges have
 generally been subject to full, public debate.
 The press is active and vocal, expressing opinions daily on a
 wide range of subjects. There are limits on the freedom of
 expression in Morocco, however. No one is permitted to criti-
 cize the monarchy, the decisions of the Crown, or the Islamic
 religion. Religions other than Islam may be practiced freely.
 Non-Muslims, including people of the Jewish faith, are
 permitted citizenship.
 The judicial system derives its authority directly from the
 King and is not subject to the orders of the Prime Minister or
 any other government office. The presence of the security
 apparatus in Morocco is noticeable, but not all-pervasive.
 Coordination of the central Government's efforts is often
 carried out through the appointed officials of the Ministry of
 the Interior (governors and others) who wield considerable
 power in association with locally elected municipal councils.

 Women have only recently begun to enter into the more visible
 levels of government in Morocco. Leading members of the Govern-
 ment actively seek to promote the role of women in various
 spheres. Women play increasingly important roles in a number
 of key ministries, including the Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
 Plan, and Justice. The public role of women has yet to expand
 much beyond the major cities, however, and in many parts of
 Morocco women retain subordinate political and social status.
 Arabs'and Berbers constitute the two largest ethnic groups in
 Morocco's heterogeneous society. In the early years of the
 post-independence period, the Government faced considerable
 rural unrest. In the early 1970s, two coup d'etats were
 attempted. In 1965, and again in 1981, serious civil dis-
 turbances centered in Casablanca occurred, leading in the
 former case to the declaration of a "state of exception." In
 the latter, 66 people among the rioters and security forces
 were killed, according to official figures. Political life
 remains active. Local elections were held in June 1983 and
 Parliamentary elections are scheduled for late February or
 early March 1984. Several major labor unions vie to represent
 the industrial workforce and defend worker interests in Morocco.
 Morocco's economy is mixed, with a broad measure of free enter-
 prise in most areas. Key industries and sectors, such as the
 mining and processing of phosphates, communications, and trans-
 portation, are in the Government's hands. The Government
 regulates activity in many other sectors, including banking,
 insurance, tourism, oil and gas, and industries producing for
 domestic consumption. The level of industrialization is consid-
 erable in comparison with most African countries. Nonetheless,
 Morocco remains a predominatly rural nation with over 55 per-
 cent of the population engaged in agriculture. The illiteracy
 rate is 70-75 percent (as high as 86 percent for women
 according to reliable estimates).
 The Government places high priority on job creation and con-
 tinuing development of the agricultural sector to reduce social
 and economic disparities between the urbanized coastal plains
 and the interior and to upgrade nutrition and food production.
 Although severe financial constraints are impeding this effort,
 Morocco expects its mineral wealth (including 70 percent of the
 world's proven phosphate reserves) and a potentially rich
 fisheries resource to provide for future development.
 At present, Moroccan politics-are focussed on the future of the
 Western Sahara. Moroccans believe deeply that the region is an
 integral part of Morocco and the issue is apparently an impor-
 tant unifying factor across the political spectrum. In June
 1981, the Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.), acting on
 King Hassan's proposal, resolved that a ceasefire followed by a
 referendum to allow the Saharan population to decide its poli-
 tical future should be the mandated solution to the conflict.
 The O.A.U. in June 1983 further resolved that the referendum
 take place by December 1983. As of year's end, however, this
 referendum had not been held.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom fromt
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no known instances of unlawful or arbitrary depri-
 vation of life in Morocco during 1983. The one instance in
 which there were allegations of foul play for political reasons
 was the death of the senior government official and Royal
 Advisor General Ahmed Dlimi in January 1983. All available
 information indicates that General Dlimi died in an automobile
 accident near Marrakesh, notwithstanding allegations that
 unspecified "elements" had sought General Dlimi's elimination.
 b. Disappearance
 Pretrial detention with limited access to lawyers is common.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report, which covers 1982,
 states its concern for the disappearance of "60 Saharans whose
 detention has never been acknowledged by the authorities."
 There have been no known charges of "disappearance" during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In recent years, Amnesty International's headquarters in London
 and Freedom House have charged that torture occurs in Morocco.
 The most prominent alleged instance in this category during
 1983 concerned the investigation and trial on drug charges of
 76 individuals in August and September 1983. A number of
 defense lawyers alleged that their clients had been mistreated
 by police officials in the course of the investigations. The
 lawyers' charges were openly aired and the courts found them to
 be without basis. Where the courts have judged accusations of
 rough treatment by the police to be well-founded, charges
 against the accused have often been reduced or thrown out.
 Conditions in many Moroccan prisons are poor. Most prisoners,
 however, excluding those tried and sentenced for involvment in
 the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts and others cases involving
 internal security, receive visits from family members, who are
 allowed to bring food and other goods to the prisoners. In
 apparent violation of the United Nations' standard minimum
 rules for the treatment of prisoners, a number of the prisoners
 convicted of involvment in the two coups continue to be held
 without family visitation rights and without the right to reply
 to mail received.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Moroccan Constitution states that no one shall be arrested,
 detained, or punished other than as prescribed by law. The
 detainee ip Morocco has the right to a lawyer during the judi-
 cial processing of his case, but not during the preceding
 period of investigation. The individual can choose his own
 lawyer, or if lacking means, may request a court-appointed
 lawyer. Police authorities may legally hold a suspect for 48
 hours without charging him, and can request from the courts a
 
 
 1359
 96-hour extension of that period. Such mandated maximum
 periods of detention without charges are not always observed,
 in which case the family or friends of the detainee can ask the
 courts to intercede on his behalf. There have been instances
 in which the courts have dismissed charges against suspects who
 were detained beyond the legally prescribed period of time.
 Habeas corpus, however, is not enshrined in Moroccan law.
 The decision to set bail is made during the initial judicial
 review of a case. In all except the most serious cases,
 authorities release the suspect on his own recognizance,
 summoning him to appear for trial on a prescribed date. Only
 in serious crimes is a deposit of bond required.
 Generally, citizens are not detained, punished, or tried for
 expressing views critical of the Government. Such criticism
 occurs daily in the press and in political circles. When
 individuals are detained for allegedly violating constitutional
 strictures against making statements or taking actions against
 either the monarchy or the Islamic faith, they are usually
 charged with "threatening public order." Warrants are not
 always issued for such arrests, but they are not secret and are
 followed by a public trial.
 The arrests of a number of Socialist and Democratic Confedera-
 tion party leaders, following incidents at the May Day march,
 were on "public order" grounds, as was the detention of 21
 Socialist Union of Popular Forces party dissidents on May 8,
 1983. A number of those arrested in connection with a highly
 publicized drugs case were held for several days before charges
 were presented. A journalist working for the Communist daily
 Al Bayane was reportedly held several days before being charged
 with public drunkenness, although the journalist's newspaper
 alleged that his detention was political harassment.
 Approximately 140-300 prisoners are being held for activities
 associated with their political beliefs. That number includes
 individuals tried and convicted as criminals for involvement in
 the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts (some of whom have been detain-
 ed for years beyond the expiration of their sentences) and
 others arrested and tried for alleged criminal participation in
 the June 1981 riots. Two leading leftwing figures, Mounir
 Amaoui and Mustapha Karchaou, and five others who had been
 arrested and convicted for alleged involvment in the riots were
 released from prison November 19.
 There are no known instances of political activists having been
 exiled from Morocco. Some activists have, however, preferred
 to remain in voluntary exile.
 Although most cases are handled by civilian courts, Morocco
 employs a dual judicial system, with modern courts based
 largely on French legal practice and parallel Shari'a or
 Islamic courts dealing with "interpersonal relations" such as
 marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance. The judges
 in the Shari'a system are appointed by the Palace on recommen-
 dations from the Ministry of Justice and local religious coun-
 cils. While safeguards to human rights applicable to the
 civilian court system do not apply within the Shari's courts,
 Koranic principles and the limited scope of cases considered
 reduce possibilities of abuse. Under a separate military code
 of justice, a number of military personnel accused of corrup-
 tion during 1983 were detained without warrants or announcement
 of a trial.
 
 
 1360
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Charges of abuse of the right to fair trial, if made, normally
 focus on the pretrial period. The Moroccan judicial system has
 dealt with every known case in 1983 of charges of pretrial
 abuse according to established procedure. There were no known
 instances of politically influenced trials in 1983.
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered fair and
 is independent of political control. Cases are brought before
 an initial review court, which can call for a hearing. At this
 juncture the detainee is informed of the charges against him.
 The court questions the detainee to decide if the charges have
 merit. If not, or if the infraction is minor, the court can
 release the detainee or impose light punishment. If a lengthy
 investigation is required, the court may release the detainee
 on his own recognizance. In cases involving serious crimes,
 the courts generally move quickly to bring the case to trial.
 If convicted by the court of first instance, the accused has
 the right of appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 The Constitution states that the home is inviolable, and that
 no search or investigation can be made without a judicial
 warrant. There are charges that this constitutional dictum is
 not always observed. The Government of Morocco engages
 selectively in various security practices which monitor the
 behavior of individuals, such as review of telephone conver-
 sations, as deemed consonant with applicable law. The 1981
 arrest of Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP) leader
 Abderrahim Bouabid (who was made a Minister of State in the
 all-party Cabinet which took office November 30) in his home
 and without a warrant continues to be cited as an example of
 Moroccan police malpractice. In general, however, the Moroccan
 Government does not interfere with the private lives of its
 citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech, including freedgm of the press, is guar-
 anteed under the Constitution as long as no criticism is made
 of the monarch, the Crown, or of Islam. Mild criticism by the
 media of the Government, the bureaucracy, social conditions,
 and many other public institutions is frequent. Eleven daily
 newspapers, as well as numerous magazines, express views
 covering a wide political and ideological spectrum. During the
 campaign for seats in the June 10 municipal elections, debate
 among the political parties was extensive.
 In 1983 the newly-formed Constitutional Union Party started its
 own Arabic language newspaper Rissalat al Oumma and a French-
 language weekly Le Message de la Nation. The Socialist Party,
 whoge daily'newspapers Al Moutahhir and Liberation were
 suspended in June 1981, began publishing again in May 1983
 under the title Al Ittihad al Ichtiraki.
 
 
 1361
 Advance censorship is formally forbidden, although the dis-
 tribution of some publications, in particular editions of Al
 Bayane, the daily paper of the Communist Party of Progress and
 Socialism (PPS), has occasionally been prevented, especially
 when they contain articles critical of the monarchy. The paper
 has also complained of government review prior to publication.
 However, Al Bayane is allowed to print those charges in its
 daily editions. More recently the editors of a satirical,
 anti-establishment journal. Houd-Houd, and of a left-of-center
 practical political journal, Al Balagh, were allegedly
 detained. Charges were not brought against the journalists,
 who were reportedly released three days later.
 Many foreign journals are available but are occasionally
 withheld from wide distribution. Following the death of Royal
 Advisor Dlimi in January 1983, the French correspondent for the
 Paris daily Le Monde, Roland Delcours, was expelled for report-
 ing allegations of foul play in the death of the General. The
 Paris Herald Tribune occasionally is "not available" because it
 contains material judged objectionable by the Government.
 Moroccan newspapers are privately owned and usually controlled
 by individual political parties. The Government controls
 television and radio, which generally reflect its views.
 Books and articles critical of the monarchy or Islam are
 banned. With the same caveat, academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association operate. Private associations of all kinds are
 permitted and Morocco has hundreds of professional, business,
 and religious associations as well as one of the largest and
 most independent trade union movements in the Arab-African
 world.
 Three major trade union federations operate in Morocco: the
 "Union Marocaine du Travail" (UMT);  the "Confederation Demo-
 cratique du Travail" (COT);  and the "Union Generale des
 Travailleurs Marocains" (UGMT). The UMT is the largest with
 over 60 percent of Morocco's half-million organized workers,
 primarily from the industrial and commercial sectors. Union
 effectiveness as workers' representatives varies. The UMT is
 active internationally and annually represents Moroccan workers
 at the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 Unions may strike, a right frequently exercised in 1983, most
 notably in a successful three-week strike against the national
 railroad system by the UMT-led union. The CDT, which had been
 generally blamed for the 1981 Casablanca riots following which
 several of its leaders were jailed, was very successful in
 trade union representation and "worker delegate" elections,
 regaining second place among the major labor groupings in
 Morocco. Several leading CDT members were released from prison
 in May, including the Federation's treasurer, Abderrahman
 Chennaf. The CDT Secretary General, Mounir Amaoui, was
 released November 19.
 The Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP) has also experi-
 enced official interference with its activities since 1981.
 However, a number of USFP leaders arrested after the June 1981
 disturbances or following the USFP's criticisms of policy on
 the Western Sahara, were released from prison near the time of
 the January 1983 visit of French President Mitterrand.
 
 
 1362
 Student unions continue to be active, although they are moni-
 tored more closely in the wake of student disturbances in
 December 1981. Other professional, academic, and scientific
 groups are numerous, and remain quite active.
 In January 1983, students of the University at Oujda, in
 northeast Morocco, struck to protest reductions in student
 aid. When the strike led to violent action by student groups,
 the government sent police on campus to restore order. In the
 ensuing confrontation, at least six students died.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides that "the state guarantees the indivi-
 dual's freedom of worship," a prescription which is followed
 closely in practice. Islam is the religion of the state and
 significantly affects Moroccan society, which is 99 percent
 Islamic and functions in an Islamic manner. Although Islamic
 fundamentalism has not come to the fore as much as in other
 Muslim countries, there is a small but growing strain of
 fundamentalist ideology. Active communities of other religions
 also exist in Morocco. Publications in Hebrew are permitted
 and rabbis serving the Jewish community are trained in
 Morocco. The Jewish community has extensive links to its
 coreligionists elsewhere, especially in Israel. Although the
 number of Moroccan Jews has dwindled over the years as a result
 of voluntary emigration, more than 20 major synagogues operate
 in Morocco. The Government has explicitly encouraged Jews who
 voluntarily departed to return to Morocco.
 GoVernment relations with Christian churches, and especially
 the Roman Catholic Church which ministers to some 100,000
 foreign residents, are cordial. The Christian clergy, who
 generally come from abroad, minister to parishes in most major
 cities. Although Roman Catholic and Protestant churches are
 not permitted to proselytize, they operate freely throughout
 the country and the Government encourages them to administer
 schools, hospitals, and other institutions. Like the Jewish
 community, the Christian communities maintain close inter-
 national ties.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco. As the
 administering authority, Morocco does, however, restrict move-
 ment in those areas of the Western Sahara which are militarily
 contested. No cases of restrictions on foreign travel for '
 political reasons were known in 1983. However, as part of an
 austerity program imposed to address its current financial
 crisis, the Government instituted on August 1 a 500 dirham
 (approximately $65) exit tax on all persons travelling abroad
 other than those departing for educational or professional
 reasons. There are no formal restrictions on emigration.
 Morocco specifically encourages voluntary repatriation for two
 groups: members of the Jewish community who voluntarily
 departed the country for Israel after that country's founding
 and members of the Saharaoui population who migrated from the
 Western Sahara to Algeria. In a speech on July 9, 1983 the
 King specifically welcomed the return of even those individuals
 who had opposed his regime. Former Polisario members returning
 
 
 1363
 to Morocco have been reintegrated into either civilian or mili-
 tary life. The Government as a policy accepts refugees,
 although there is no sizable refugee population at this time.
 Moroccan policy on political asylum follows Western European
 practice. The Government does not use exile as a punishment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Rights of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Morocco is a constitutional monarchy. Executive power is
 vested in the King as temporal and spiritual leader.
 The King determines government policy and chooses the members
 of the Cabinet. Day-to-day administration of that policy is
 left to the Government, which under the direction of Cabinet
 ministers, directs affairs of state, proposes legislation to
 the Parliament, and oversees its implementation. In choosing
 his Cabinet, the King pays close attention to the political
 make-up of the 267-deputy Parliament, which passes on all
 laws. Candidates nominated by the various political parties
 compete for two-thirds of the seats in country-wide elections
 in which all Moroccan citizens 21 years or older may vote. The
 other one-third is selected by chambers of commerce and from
 artisan, labor and professional groups. The Parliament also
 asks government ministers to answer questions regarding matters
 affecting the governing of the country. While the Parliament
 rarely, if ever, explicitly rejects government policy outright,
 the process of extensive debate often affects its evolution.
 The term of Morocco's Parliament expired October 13, 1983. The
 Parliament had adjourned in early June but was recalled briefly
 in late July for an extraordinary session to consider proposed
 amendments to the 1983 budget. Parliamentary elections tenta-
 tively scheduled for September 1983 were deferred by King
 Hassan in early July, pending holding of the referendum on the
 Western Sahara which the O.A.U. Summit in June 1983 had
 resolved should take place by the end of that year. On
 November 5, the King announced that he would enlist the support
 of all parties for a coalition Cabinet which would prepare for
 Parliamentary elections to take place in late February or early
 March 1984. A new Prime Minister was announced on November 20,
 and after all parties agreed to participate, a new all-party
 Cabinet was sworn in on November 30.
 Municipal councils exercise considerable authority in the
 day-to-day running of their jurisdictions. Council members are
 chosen by direct suffrage. On June 10, 1983, voters elected
 nearly 15,000 representatives from among over 57,000 candi-
 dates. Following the election, some charges of fraud were
 leveled which were fully ventilated in the press and debated
 formally in the Parliament. The courts reviewed all such
 accusations, and where the cases were found to have merit, the
 election result was invalidated.
 
 
 1364
 Some 14 political parties are active in Morocco, from the
 Communist Party of Progress and Socialism on the left to the
 Monarchist National Rally of Independents on the right, as well
 as a Berber nationalist party. Six of these parties were
 represented in the Parliament which ended October 13. A
 seventh, the Constitutional Union Party formed in March 1983 by
 Prime Minister Bouabid, garnered third place in the June muni-
 cipal elections. Even in areas in which overall policy gui-
 dance comes from the King, he frequently consults political
 leaders, including leftist opposition, on matters of vital
 national interest.
 No one group rules the country and virtually all significant
 groups are represented in the Parliament. In the Moroccan
 population, a wide diversity of political viewpoint exists.
 Ethnic and tribal distinctions remain and the mountainous
 terrain of Morocco maintains the populations of separate
 regions in relative isolation. The King does not rely on any
 one segment of the population to oversee the governing of the
 country.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no instances from 1974-83 when Morocco has
 refused to allow international or nongovernmental investigation
 of its human rights situation. In January 1983, during the
 visit of French President Mitterand, King Hassan renewed his
 pledge to receive a team of jurists to examine human rights in
 Morocco.
 The Moroccan Government frequently is the recipient of appeals
 on behalf of individuals in human rights cases, either sent
 directly to the Government or indirectly through diplomatic
 representations in Rabat. The Government, generally through
 the Ministries of Justice or Interior, answers requests for
 information, although responses may take some time.
 Amnesty International's May 1982 special report on Morocco and
 its 1983 report expressed concern about political prisoners,
 the length of pretrial detentions, "disappearances," alleged
 deaths of some detainees and prisoners, and the use of tor-
 ture. Those reports and the accusations they contained have
 received wide publicity in the Moroccan press, as do all
 reports on and debates over the human rights situation in
 Morocco. Nevertheless, Amnesty contends that the Government
 has never responded to its charges, although the Government
 issued a statement in 1982 which purported to do so.
 The Government has in the past allowed outside observers at
 various trials perceived as having political content. In 1983
 the trials of those arrested on drug charges as well as the
 trials of the USFP dissidents (see Section 1. d.) were attended
 by outside observers and covered widely in the press.
 
 
 1365
 Two major human rights associations function in Morocco, the
 League for the Defense of Human Rights and the Association for
 Human Rights. Both are affiliated with political p4rties, the
 former with the Istiqlal Party and the latter with the USFP.
 Although independent groups, their efforts to\obtain informa-
 tion on specific human rights cases tend to overlap with their
 affiliated parties. Both groups publish documents and periodic
 reports. They occasionally intercede with the Government and
 the courts on behalf of individuals without retaliation. While
 neither organization is widely known among the general popula-
 tion, in past years they have been instrumental in bringing
 about the release of certain prisoners.
 Morocco evinces concern with international human rights within
 the United Nations and regional bodies. Resolutions dealing
 with Morocco in the United Nations and the O.A.U. have related
 to the conflict in the Western Sahara rather than to human
 rights per se.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Moroccan economy is undergoing severe crisis, the result
 among other things of three years of drought, poor export per-
 formance, increased import bills for energy (80 percent of
 annual requirements must be imported) and food, the debilita-
 ting effect of the Saharan war, and a spiralling external debt
 burden. To address the crisis, and to permit an orderly
 rescheduling of much of its official foreign debt, the Govern-
 ment has been working with the International Monetary Fund
 (IMP) on an austerity program designed to reduce the country's
 severe trade and budgetary deficits.
 This austerity program, first announced in July, will substan-
 tially reduce government investment spending through 1984.
 Virtually all new major government-funded projects have been
 shelved until 1984/1985. Postponement of health, education and
 housing projects will impact on the country's poorest citizens
 who are totally dependent on centrally-provided social services
 for many of their basic human needs. On August 1, the Govern-
 ment reduced subsidies between 15 and 65 percent on basic
 foodstuffs (flour, bread, sugar, cooking oil, butter and tea).
 In an effort to minimize the effect on the poor, a 20 percent
 jump in the minimum wage for agricultural and industrial
 workers was also announced. At the same time, the Government
 increased selected taxes payable by upper and middle income
 groups and large business.
 Morocco's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.6 percent
 and per capita income grew from 9718 to $748 in 1982. Adverse
 factors suggest, however, that GDP growth for-1983 will once
 again slip below the country's 2.9 percent population growth
 rate (population circa 22 million).
 
 
 1366
 The Government attempts to improve the living standard of
 disadvantaged Moroccans through distribution of government-
 owned land, construction of low-cost housing, schools, clinics,
 hospitals, minimum wage policies, payment of monthly family
 allowances/and continued although reduced subsidies on basic
 foodstuffS. Despite these efforts and others at generating
 employme t, serious maldistribution of income remains. An
 estimate 40 percent of all Moroccans, including most of the
 rural population, are believed to have an annual per capita
 income of less than $200.
 Over the last 10 years, Morocco has built new educational faci-
 lities throughout the country, from one-room primary schools in
 mountain villages to impressive vocational institutions and
 university campuses in the cities. Attendance in the primary
 school system has increased over last year, and secondary
 enrollment continues to grow faster than in the lower grades.
 The most recent literacy estimate (1982) is 28 percent compared
 to 21 percent in 1971. An estimated 93 percent of boys and 55
 percent of girls attend primary school for some period, as
 contrasted to the 67 and 35 percent figures of 10 years ago.
 At the end of 1980, Morocco had some 23,000 hospital beds (one
 for every 875 people);  more than 25,000 beds should be avail-
 able by the end of 1984. Educational and health programs, ham-
 pered by inadequate professional and administrative staffing,
 have not kept pace with the rapid growth in physical plant.
 The government is trying to rectify this situation with the aid
 of major bilateral and multilateral donors. Although health
 services lag behind need, the nutritional level is adequate.
 Caloric intake is an estimated 105 percent of requirements.
 The Constitution repeatedly reaffirms the equality of all
 Moroccans before the law and specifically provides that "men
 and women enjoy equal political rights." While men and women
 in this Islamic society constitute largely separate subcul-
 tures, French educational traditions have opened many doors to
 Moroccan women, particularly in urban areas. The role of women
 in the predominantly rural and traditional Muslim environment
 remains more restricted, as it has been over the centuries.
 No women hold seats in the 267-member Parliament. Women were
 elected to the Saharan consultative council in voting in the
 Western Sahara in 1981. Encouraged by the Government, women
 continue to assume more active roles in society. Some 10 per
 cent of the Moroccan Air Force is staffed by females. The
 Government supports labor and family planning projects designed
 to improve the lot of women.
 Female enrollment in state educational institutions is growing
 faster than that of males. Females now make up 38 percent of
 all primary students, more than 40 percent of all pupils in
 secondary school, and 25 percent of university enrollees. In
 rural areas, however, enrollment of girls is unusual, attri-
 butable by and large to the traditional attitudes of the Berber
 population. Employment opportunities for women continue to
 expand in the modern sector, and the Government exerts special
 effort to train female workers. No discernable discrimination
 exists in the urban job market, although nonfarm employment for
 women in rural areas is limited by traditional Islamic values.
