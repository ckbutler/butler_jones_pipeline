 ANGOLA*
 Since its independence from Portugal in 1975 the People's
 Republic of Angola has been ruled by the small group who lead
 its only recognized political party, the Marxist-Leninist
 Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). All
 major policy decisions are made by the party central committee
 and the political bureau. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is
 both Head of State and chief of the MPLA. In December, the
 MPLA held its Second Party Congress and enlarged the central
 committee to 90 members.
 In 1985, there was further intensification and expansion of the
 civil war, now in its 10th year, between the Government and the
 main opposition force, the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola (UNITA), with drastic effects in terms
 of human suffering. Reportedly more than 2,000 persons on
 either side were killed in the fighting in 1985. Each side
 accused the other of killing civilians and committing
 atrocities. The government forces undertook a major offensive
 during the dry season (July-September), recapturing the Cazombo
 salient, but suffering defeat at Mavinga. UNITA continued
 guerrilla activities throughout the country directed at the
 political and economic infrastructure.
 A number of civilians also died in the hostilities between the
 Southwest Africa People's Organization (SWAPO--a Namibian
 resistance movement with bases in Angola) and South Africa,
 which illegally controls the territory of Namibia on Angola's
 southern border. During 1985, South Africa conducted repeated
 cross-border raids into Angola, including an unsuccessful
 commando attack in May on the U.S. oil facilities in Cabinda
 and two major interventions in southern Angola during the dry
 season offensive in September.
 The Angolan Government receives extensive military assistance
 from the Soviet Union, estimated at more than $2 billion in the
 past two years, and in the 1985 offensive Soviet advisors
 played an increased role in planning and directing military
 operations. An estimated 35,000 Cuban military personnel
 provide logistical support, training, and advice to government
 forces and garrison key strategic population and economic
 centers. They also occassionally take part in combat
 operations. UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, apparently has the
 allegiance of a substantial portion of the population and now
 controls approximately one-third of Angola's territory. UNITA
 has stated publicly that it favors a government of national
 unity and has not sought to establish an alternate government.
 The escalation of the war has severely disrupted the economy
 and government administration. The low world market prices of
 oil and diamonds, the two principal sources of Angola's
 revenue, and the serious disruption in food production and
 transportation infrastructure caused by the hostilities have
 exacerbated this serious economic situation. Drought has also
 been a factor in reducing food supplies. Oil provides the
 country with 90 percent of its foreign exchange, and oil
 production and exploration have continued, with new discoveries
 reported in 1985 off the northwestern coast of Angola. As
 *The United States does not maintain diplomatic relations with
 the People's Republic of Angola and thus has no diplomatic
 personnel in country to monitor human rights conditions or to
 evaluate allegations of abuses.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 fighting has escalated, the Government has devoted an even
 larger portion of its financial resources to the military.
 The increased fighting in 1985 also led to a continued
 deterioration in respect for human rights. Some
 200,000-500,000 persons in central, eastern, and southern
 Angola have been displaced from their homes as a result of
 civil strife and drought. Both the MPLA and UNITA have made
 efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to these displaced
 persons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The escalation of the war in Angola has resulted in numerous
 allegations that government, UNITA, and South African forces
 have killed civilians and that the MPLA and UNITA have executed
 political prisoners. While there is little specific
 substantiation of the various claims and counterclaims,
 circumstantial evidence indicates that the internal parties
 have on some occasions arbitrarily executed prisoners.
 The fighting has also resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths.
 Undoubtedly, some of these deaths were inadvertently caused by
 military operations, but others have been deliberately
 perpetrated by the opposing forces in order to intimidate
 civilian populations. Roads are mined in many places, and
 civilians have died as a result of guerrilla actions, such as
 attacks on trains. There are no reliable casualty figures.
 UNITA and the MPLA have both publicly and repeatedly accused
 each other of practicing terrorism against their respective
 supporters, including killing or maiming civilians. UNITA has
 also charged that Cuban forces have been involved in attacks on
 civilians.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information to confirm that abductions, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions are practiced by government
 security agencies or by UNITA, although both sides have accused
 each other of such practices.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Persistent allegations have been made of torture and
 mistreatment in Angolan prisons, but information is
 insufficient to determine the extent to which torture is
 practiced by the police, security services, and armed forces.
 Angolan prisons are overcrowded, with substandard diet and
 sanitation, but these conditions seem to reflect the poor state
 of the economy rather than deliberate maltreatment. Some
 reports have alleged that foreigners are not well treated, but
 Americans who have been imprisoned in Angola have been
 relatively well-treated and have had access to medical care.
 Prison authorities reportedly have wide latitude in the
 treatment of prisoners. Treatment of political prisoners in
 the prisons controlled by the Ministry of State Security is
 
 
 ANGOLA
 alleged to be harsher than treatment in the regular prisons.
 Mistreatment reportedly includes solitary confinement,
 confiscation of personal effects, physical intimidation,
 including beatings and threats, and prolonged interrogation
 with the use of force. Prison visits appear to be arbitrarily
 restricted in many instances. Foreign advisors, including
 Cubans and East Germans, are involved in assisting Angolan
 state security services and may be involved in helping to run
 state security prisons. The Government continues to put
 captured UNITA supporters on public display. Amnesty
 International protested the parading of five UNITA soldiers in
 front of a stadium crowd in Benguela after their trial in April.
 Very limited information is available on the situation and
 administrative structure within UNITA-held areas. It is known,
 however, that UNITA holds a number of foreign and government
 prisoners, captured in the course of military operations, in
 makeshift facilities in its areas of control in Southeastern
 Angola. There are no reports that UNITA has mistreated its
 prisoners. During 1985 UNITA cooperated with the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in releasing foreign
 prisoners it held. None of the released alleged mistreatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Two of the most persistently and frequently reported charges of
 human rights violations have been arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment without due process. Numerous reports allege that
 individuals are arrested and imprisoned on suspicion or
 denunciation by others and, in some cases, held for years
 without being notified of the charges against them. In its
 1985 report, Amnesty International stated that unofficial
 sources estimated that more than 1,000 political detainees were
 held in detention centers in Luanda and provincial capitals and
 in rural detention camps in 1984.
 Under Angolan law, persons suspected of committing serious acts
 against the security of the State may be held by the Ministry
 of State Security without charge for an initial period of 3
 months, renewable for a further period of 3 months. Such
 detainees need not be presented to a judge within 48 hours of
 their arrest, as otherwise stipulated in the code of criminal
 procedure, and apparently have no right to challenge the
 grounds of their detention by invoking provisions of the habeas
 corpus code. After 6 months' detention without charge, the
 detainee must be informed of the accusations against him, with
 the state security service either informing the public
 prosecutor of the charges against the suspect or releasing
 him. Once the case is presented to the public prosecutor,
 there does not appear to be a specific time limit within which
 the suspect must be brought to trial. Many political detainees
 have reportedly been held for years without being tried. The
 exact number is not known.
 The deterioration of the security situation has contributed to
 demise of judicial safeguards and due process. The Government
 has established regional military councils throughout much of
 Angola. They are responsible directly to President Dos Santos
 and have broad authority to restrict the movement of people and
 goods, to requisition people and goods without compensation,
 and to try crimes against the security of the State. The
 Government has also created "people's vigilance brigades" for
 urban areas, whose powers are not clear, but include general
 administration and "protecting the people and ensuring public
 order and stability."

 ANGOLA
 In 1984, the Angolan Government was cited by the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) in Geneva for being in violation of
 ILO Convention 105, which prohibits forced labor. The basis of
 this citation is Angolan legislation, still in force, which
 provides for the imposition of penal sanctions involving
 compulsory labor for breaches of labor discipline and
 participation in strikes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution states that no citizen shall be arrested and
 brought to trial except under the terms of the law, and it
 guarantees the right of the accused to defense counsel. There
 is, however, insufficient evidence to determine to what extent
 these rights exist in practice. Amnesty International
 expressed concern in its 1985 report that trials of government
 opponents do not conform to internationally recognized trial
 standards. In particular, defendants reportedly were not given
 adequate opportunity to present their defense or appeal their
 cases. The right of appeal exists in some cases, but Amnesty
 International reports that some political prisoners were
 apparently executed in 1984 without appeal. Judicial lines of
 authority are unclear, especially since the new regional
 military councils have been given responsibility for the trial
 of offenses against the security of the State, including
 "economic crimes." It is not known which trials are open to
 the public and under what rules of procedure the various
 military and civilian courts operate. The Constitution
 provides for a People's Supreme Court, but its jurisdiction is
 not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 home and privacy of correspondence, arbitrary searches of homes
 have been reported, and there is some interference with private
 correspondence, either through censorship or interruption of
 mail delivery.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression "in the
 context of the achievement of the basic objectives of the
 People's Republic of Angola." Censorship exists, and the
 Government runs the media. Opposition views are not
 tolerated. The prominent Angolan writer Fernando Costa de
 Andrade Ndunduma, who was arrested in. late 1982 for a play
 critical of the President, was never brought to trial and was
 held uncharged for 2-1/2 years before being released in
 January. Amnesty International is investigating the case of
 Bartolomeu Dias Fernandes, accused of "insulting the head of
 state" and of "fractionalism" and sentenced in April to 6 years
 in prison.
 The Government is especially sensitive to criticism in the
 foreign press. Since independence in 1975, Angola has
 restricted the travel of foreign correspondents to Angola and
 has occasionally expelled foreign reporters, e.g., a reporter
 from Agence France-Presse was expelled in November. Angola
 endorsed the Kadoma Declaration in July 1983, banning the
 travel of South Africa-based correspondents to the "Front Line"
 
 
 ANGOLA
 States, (Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia,
 Zimbabwe). The circulation of Western journals and periodicals
 in Angola is tightly restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is denied to any political group or
 movement other than the MPLA. All other political movements
 have been banned. There are numerous unconfirmed reports of
 arrests of people who voice support of opposition movements or
 alternative political systems. The recently established
 people's vigilance brigades and the martial-law climate
 throughout the country tend further to restrict freedom of
 assembly and association.
 The only trade union movement in Angola is the National Union
 of Angolan Workers, which is controlled by the MPLA and is a
 member of the continent-wide, Ghana-based Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity. Traditional labor union activities
 are tightly controlled by the Government. Strikes are
 prohibited by law as a crime against the security of the
 State.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Alth6ugh the Constitution guarantees the inviolability of
 freedom of conscience and belief and provides for separation of
 church and state, the Government publicly emphasizes the
 importance of propagating "atheism" and has been critical of
 religious activities. The overwhelming majority of the Angolan
 population is Christian, however, and the Government has not
 moved to close down churches. Church services are regularly
 held, and there is widespread attendance. Foreign and Angolan
 missionaries are allowed to carry out their normal activities.
 Reportedly UNITA respects the freedom of religion in the areas
 it controls, but the ability of religious personnel to carry
 out activities in Angola has certainly been circumscribed by
 the intensification of the civil war.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a result of the increased fighting, the Government is
 acutely security-conscious and has tightly restricted travel,
 notably through the regional military councils. Travel by road
 in most areas of Angola is dangerous. There is a pass system
 within Angola, and foreigners are generally prohibited from
 traveling outside the principal cities. UNITA has publicly
 warned that it considers all of Angola to be a war zone and
 that it cannot guarantee the safety of persons traveling there.
 Angolan citizens are allowed to travel abroad, but this travel
 is carefully controlled by restrictions on issuance of
 passports and exit visas and by currency restrictions.
 Emigration is restricted. The Government limits travel to
 Angola through a selective and stringent visa policy. Angola
 is a signatory to the U.N. Protocol Relating to the Status of
 Refugees. There are currently approximately 70,000 Namibian,
 20,000 Zairian, and 6,000 South African refugees in Angola.
 Since mid-1980, between 120,000 and 150,000 former Zairian
 refugees in Angola returned home under the auspices of the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Approximately 200,000 Angolans have taken refuge in Zaire since
 1975, and an estimated 73,000 have taken refuge in Zambia. Of
 
 
 10
 ANGOLA
 the estimate total of 400,000 Angolans who have left the
 country since independence, the Government claims that 180,000
 have returned, but this claim cannot be verified.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government.
 Angola is ruled by a small group of officials within the party
 apparatus of the ruling Marxist-Leninist MPLA. The
 Constitution provides for popular participation in the
 political process, but the MPLA is the only legal party, and
 activities by all opposition groups have been banned.
 In effect, political activity is limited to participation in
 the party or in one of its controlled and sanctioned
 organizations such as its youth wing, the Angolan Women's
 Organization, or the trade union movement. Political power is
 centered in the elite membership of the politburo and the
 somewhat larger central committee. Party membership is very
 restricted, with under 30,000 members out of a population of 7
 million, according to the official media. The Constitution
 provides that the popularly elected national People's Assembly,
 established in 1981, is to be the supreme organ of state
 power. There are also people's assemblies at the provincial
 and local level. Only candidates chosen and endorsed by the
 party are elected to the people's assemblies, and key members
 of the party also hold leadership positions in the people's
 assemblies. The people's assemblies endorse measures proposed
 by the party at the national and local levels.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has allowed the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) and United Nations International Children's
 Emergency Fund (UNICEF) to operate in areas it controls, and
 UNITA allows the ICRC to operate in areas it controls or is
 contesting. Amnesty International stated in its 1985 Report
 that it is concerned about the imprisonment of people for
 criticizing government policies or officials, long-term
 detention without trial, unfair political trials, and
 mistreatment of prisoners. Amnesty International has also
 appealed for commutation of death sentences imposed by the
 People's Revolutionary Tribunal and military courts and the
 need to respect the right of appeal, especially in capital
 cases. Amnesty International was also concerned over
 apparently arbitrary detention by UNITA forces of civilians not
 involved in the conflict. Freedom House rated Angola "not
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Angola's population of 7.9 million is growing at the rate of 3
 percent a year. Gross national product per capita in 1983 was
 approximately $888, but this reflects the oil revenues from the
 Cabinda field and has little meaning to the bulk of the
 population in the midst of civil war. Many rural inhabitants
 have abandoned the countryside to seek food and safety in urban
 areas, such as Luanda, which have been overwhelmed by the
 influx. As a result of the rural exodus, crops are not being
 planted. There are severe food shortages in urban areas, and
 public services are severely taxed. In these circumstances,
 
 
 ANGOLA
 Angola in 1985 continued efforts to obtain food assistance from
 Western countries and various international organizations.
 The MPLA has established as its goal the transformation of
 Angola into a "socialist" economy, and the major sectors of the
 economy--oil, diamonds, and banking--have been nationalized.
 However, the Government has encouraged substantial Western
 investment, notably in oil production, in order to develop its
 economic and industrial infrastructure. The right to private
 property is guaranteed by the Constitution, and a small portion
 of the economy, mainly in the agricultural sector, still
 operates under private ownership.
 The intensification of the fighting has devastated the
 country's infrastructure and has forced the Government to
 divert most of its assets to the military. Payments to the
 Soviet bloc for military equipment and for the Cuban combat
 troops have become a recognized burden on the economy.
 Although thousands of civilian Cuban and East European advisors
 are working in technical and professional positions, Angola
 still faces a critical shortage of skilled manpower. Of the
 approximately 500,000 Portuguese residents prior to
 independence, only 30,000 remain.
 With a high infant mortality rate of 143 per 1,000 live births,
 life expectancy at birth is only 43 years. Adequate health
 care is available to only a small fraction of the total
 population. The current literacy rate is estimated at about 30
 percent, and there is high level--90 percent--enrollment in
 primary schools in noncombat areas. In 1982, there were more
 female children in primary school (92 percent) than male (85
 percent).
 There is no information-available on working conditions in
 Angola.
 Women participate in the MPLA, not only in the Angolan Women's
 Organization, but also in the higher levels of the party.
 Women were given more positions in the top leadership by the
 Second Party Congress.
 Both the MPLA and UNITA have primarily ethnic bases of
 support--the MPLA among the Kimbundu, and UNITA among the
 Ovimbundu. While they have worked with mixed success to
 broaden popular support, both groups show political favoritism
 towards their own ethnic group. There are no formal ethnic or
 racial restrictions on participation in the political process,
 and whites and mesticos occupy a number of high-level positions
 within the MPLA.
