 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. For almost three decades (except during 1979-82) the Gov-
 ernment has been led by Prime Minister John Compton, whose United Workers
 Party (UWP) first came to power in 1964. His party defeated the main opposition
 St. Lucia Labour Party in elections in April. The UWP currently holds 11 seats in
 the 17-member House of Assembly.
 The Royal St. Lucia Police, which is the only security force in the ountr
 cludes a small Special Service Unit with some paramilitary training and aroast
 Guard Unit. The police have traditionally demonstrated respect for human rights
 and are controlledby and responsive to elected government officials. However, there
 continued to be instances of abuse of detainees and prisoners by police and prison
 officials.
 St. Lucia's economy is largely based on the export of bananas, but the country
 is gradually diversifying into other types of agriculture, tourism, and, more recently,
 into light manufacturing and construction. Economic performance in all sectors was
 relatively strong during 1992. Unemployment, estimated at as high as 18 percent,
 remained a source of potential instability.
 Human rights continued to be generally respected during 1992, although there
 was one extrajudicial killing, credible allegations of harsh treatment to extract con-
 fessions, and denial of parade permits to the opposition party.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political killings. There was, however, one instance of an extrajudicial killing.
 In August 1992, a Dominica-born prison officer in Castries shot dead an inmate
 serving a 20-year jail term for rape, then was himself found dead in an apparent
 suicide. The prison officer had intervened in an altercation between two inmates
 and was attacked by one of the prisoners. The officer left the prison, returned with
 his personal firearm, and shot the prisoner who assaulted him. A police report on
 the incident was pending at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances or politically moti-
 vated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and no such incidents were reported.
 However, there has been an increase in convictions based on confessions in St. Lucia
 in recent years, which informed observers believe reflects police efforts to force con-
 fessions in lieu of other investigative approaches. There continued to be occasional
 
 
 credible allegations of harsh treatment of prisoners by law enforcement officials
 prior to and during incarceration. In one incident, a former St. Lucian government
 minister accused police of beating his two sons at a public event in September and
 filed a civil suit against the officer allegedly involved.
 A 1990 request by the regional human rights organization, Caribbean Rights, to
 survey the prisons in St. Lucia was never approved by the Government, despite a
 renewed request in 1991. Prison officials have more recently adopted a more cooper.
 ative approach and sent a high-level prison official to attend a training course, in-
 cluding human rights awareness, for Caribbean prison officials.
 Another case involved a man who died in police custody in September 1992. Al-
 though it was initially alleged that he had been fatally beaten, a post-mortem re-
 vealed that the man died of asphyxia from attempting to swallow a plastic bag, ap-
 parently containing drugs--the offense for which he was arrested. Both the prisoner
 and the accused police officer received injuries from the altercation that preceded
 the prisoner's death, but the death of the prisoner was determined to be self-in-
 duced.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government adheres to the constitu-
 tional provision prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a court
 hearing within 72 hours after detention. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest
 or other forms of extralegal detention, or of forced exile in 1992.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tral.-The Constitution requires public trials before an
 independent and impartial court and, in cases involving capital punishment, the
 provision of legal counsel for those who cannot afford a defense attorney. Criminal
 defendants are entitled to select their own legal counsel, are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty, and have the right of appeal. Both constitutional and statutory
 requirements for fair public trials are followed. The regional West Indies Court of
 Appeal, a circuit court long noted for its impartiality, serves as St. Lucia's Appeals
 Court. The Privy Council in the United Kingdom serves as the ultimate court of ap-
 peal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private lives of individ-
 ual citizens. Authorities consistently observe constitutional prohibitions against ar-
 bitrary search, seizure, and entry.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 . a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Constitutional provisions for free speech and
 press are respected in practice. The Government neither interferes with the oper-
 ations of the press nor censors the content of the three privately owned major news-
 papers, which cover the spectrum of political opinion and are often highly critical
 of the Government. The one local television station is also privately owned and cov-
 ers a wide range of views. In addition, viewers may receive cable television service
 which provides broadcasting from a variety of sources. Radio St. Lucia is govern-
 ment owned and operated, but the programming staff has been allowed a large
 measure of autonomy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of association and of
 assembly are provided for by the  nstitution. Permits for public meetings and dem-
 onstrations are necessary if meetings are to be held in public places suchas streets,
 sidewalks, or parks. Permits are routinely granted and are not normally denied for
 political reasons. Refusal to issue a permit is rare and generally stems from the fail-
 ure of the organizers to request a permit in a timely manner, normally defined as
 a 48-hour notice.
 In 1991 and 1992, however, requests for permission to stage protest marches by
 the opposition St. Lucia Labour Party were refused on a few occasions by the Police
 Commissioner. Denial of the marching permits was described as "repression" by the
 party leader and was generally justified by the Police Commissioner on grounds of
 provisions in the Public Order Act, which forbid public protests near buildings hous-
 ing public offices and government officials. Opposition politicians objected strongly
 to what they considered suppression of their democratic rights, and the party occa-
 sionally disregarded the decision and held their demonstrations anyway.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The majority of the population is Roman Catholic. Other
 denominations are free to maintain places of worship, train clergy, establish reli-
 gious schools, and engage in the full range of activities normally associated with re-
 ligious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-These rights are provided for in the Constitution and honored in prac-
 tice.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Right. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 St. Lucia's parliamentary system provides for genuine choices among parties, poli-
 cies, and officials. Although currently there are two main parties, several other po-
 litical organizations also prticipate in free elections, which are held at least every
 5 years by secret ballot. The opposition St. Lucia Labour Party plays a significant
 role in the country's political life and presently holds 6 out of 17 seats in the House
 of Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no local human rights grou   in St. Lucia, there are no govern-
 ment restrictions which would impede the e   bishment of human rights organiza-
 tions. International human rights organizations filed no reports or requests for in-
 vestigations in 1992.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sej; Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Government policy is basically nondiscriminatory in the areas of housing, jobs,
 education, and advancement opportunities. There are no legal restrictions on the
 role of women or minorities. Violence directed specifically against women, including
 domestic violence such as wife beating, has recently become more of a public policy
 issue in St. Lucia. Lack of statistical data and possible reluctance on the part of
 some victims to report cases or to press charges make it difficult to gauge its true
 extent. Police and courts do enforce laws to protect women against abuse, although
 police generally tend to be reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes.
 In 1989 a women's rights organization called the "St. Lucia Crisis Center" was
 established to monitor existing abuses (physical mental, and emotional), and deal
 with issues including incest, non-payment of chiid support, alcohol and drug abuse,
 homelessness, visitation rights and custody. The group publicized the plight of bat-
 tered women, and has protested killings of women who were victims of domestic vio-
 lence. Extreme cases of this sort are not common, but the Government responded
 by establishing a Women's Affairs Division of the Ministry of Community Develop-
 ment and Social Affairs. That desk, together with the Crisis Center, developed a
 "National Policy Statement on Women" which was adopted by Parliament in March
 1991.
 The women's office is now working on implementation of the policy, which in-
 cludes among its objectives protecting the rights of women in domestic violence
 cases, preventing discrimination against women, and guaranteeing equal treatment
 in employment and overall equal status with men. A project developed in late 1991
 includes a review of laws considered to discriminate against women and the devel-
 oment of alternative legislation to remove such provisions. Undertaken by the
 men' Action Council in collaboration with the Women's Affairs Division, it is
 part of a regional program organized by the the Trinidad-based Caribbean Associa-
 tion for Feminist          and Action (CAFRA). In conjunction with the legal re-
 forms, CAFRA stresses the importance of sensitizing the police, the public and legal
 practitioners to cultural norms and social attitudes which support gender biases.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies the right of workers to
 form or belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right of association.
 Unions are independent of the Government and are free to choose their own rep-
 resentatives. Union elections are often vigorously contested. All unions are free to
 publicize their views and choose policies to advance their members' interests. There
 is no restriction on formin a national labor federation, and several of the major
 unions in St. Lucia have joined together to form an umbrella grouping, called the
 "Industrial Solidarity Pact." Unions are free to affiliate with international organiza-
 tions, and some have done so.
 Strikes in both public and private sectors are legal if efforts by the Government
 to resolve disputes fail. Strikes, as well as go-slows and total work stoppages, do
 occur from time to time. In 1992, there were disputes between two unions over rep-
 resentation in the electricity company and in some hotels. The industrial disputes
 were resolved after the Labor Department conducted polls of employees to deter-
 mine which union had collective bargaining rights. Because St. Lucia does not have
 trade union recognition legislation, the polls were based on precedent rather than
 on local labor law.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the legal right
 to engage in collective bargaining and fully exercise that right. The majority of wage
 and salary earners belong to unions. During 1989 the Government negotiated a 6-
 
 
 488
 
 year wage agreement with 6 unions representing public servants, resulting in un-
 usually harmonious government-labor relations. In the private sector, some compa-
 nies offer packages of benefits with terms of employment better than, or comparable
 to, what a union can obtain through negotiation. This is especially true in export
 processing or industrial free zones (EPZ's) in St. Lucia. Antiunion discrimination by
 employers against union members is prohibited by law, and there are effective
 mechanisms for resolving complaints. Union organizing and collective bargaining
 are neither legally nor administratively discouraged in the EPZ's.
 Although labor law is applicable in the EP-Ts, in practice many firms do not wel-
 come union efforts to organize in the EPZ's. Some of these firms are under foreign
 management and employ a young, female labor force at relatively low wages. Occa-
 sionally a persistent umon is successful in winning a poll in an EPZ, in which case
 labor law applies to collective bargaining agreements in that company.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Ale for Employinent of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 14 years as stipulated by the Women and Young Persons Act. The law is enforced
 effectively by Labor Ministry officials.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--St. Lucia has legislated minimum wage rates
 for certain occupations only, set by the Wages Regulations (Clerks) Orders, effective
 since February 1985. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent stand-
 ard of living for a worker and family, but almost all categories of workers are paid
 much mere than this legislative minimum, which is used only as a guide.
 There is no legislatedmaximum workweek, although common practice is 40 hours
 in 5 days. Shop assistants, agricultural laborers, domestics, and young persons in
 industrial establishments have special legislation for hours.
 Occupational health and safety regulations are relativey well developed. The
 Labor Ministry periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places of em-
 ployment under the Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1985. The Act
 is enforced through threat of closure of business if violations are discovered and not
 corrected.
