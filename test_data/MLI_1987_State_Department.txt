 MALI
 Mali is a single party state in which effective authority is
 exercised by General Moussa Traore, President of the Republic
 and Secretary General of the Democratic Union of the Malian
 People (UDPM). President Traore assumed power in 1968 through
 a military-led coup, and the military Government adopted a new
 Constitution in 1974. Since then, under Traore's leadership,
 the military has continued to exercise influence in party and
 civilian affairs but increasingly has turned over day-to-day
 operations to civilians and encouraged civilian participation
 in the country's political life at all levels of society. In
 1987 military officers held approximately 22 percent of cabinet
 portfolios, and 20 percent of the seats in the party's Central
 Executive Bureau. Military officers occupied 4 of the 7
 governorships, 11 of the 46 districts, and an important portion
 of lower-level administrative posts, particularly in the border
 areas.
 Mali maintains an army and air force, and the mission of the
 armed forces is to provide both external and internal security.
 The gendarmerie (paramilitary police) assists in the latter
 effort. There is a presidential guard. Mali has no special
 internal security force.
 With an annual per capita gross national product of $190, Mali
 is among the world's 10 poorest countries. It is landlocked
 and lacks easily exploitable mineral resources. Its economy
 rests on subsistence farming and animal husbandry, both of
 which have been adversely affected by severe droughts in the
 1970's and 1980's. Cotton and cattle are the major exports.
 While its economic situation remains precarious, its population
 continues to increase rapidly. In 1987 the Government
 struggled to implement an economic structural adjustment
 program but remained dependent on external aid.
 The political and human rights situation did not change
 significantly in 1987. Organized political opposition groups
 are not permitted in Mali. However, in the context of
 preparation for the March 1987 extraordinary party congress,
 public party and union meetings provided arenas for citizens
 to criticize government economic reform policies, corruption,
 inefficiency, and acquisition of illicit wealth by government
 officials and private citizens. The President appointed a
 special investigating commission, authorized and endorsed by
 the extraordinary party congress, to delve into corruption
 charges in the Government and business. The commission has
 extensive authority to examine documents and individuals. The
 commission is not a party body, although its members belong to
 the ruling UDPM. It submitted its initial report in November.
 On the basis of that report, a special court examined 47 cases
 against 71 persons accused of embezzling public funds.
 RESPECTS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No politically motivated killings were reported in 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 No incidents of disappearance, abduction, or hostage-taking
 were reported in 1987.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 .Treatment or Punishment
 The Government of Mali does not cdndone police brutality, and
 has issued specific instructions prohibiting brutality against
 suspects. However, physical abuse of suspected persons
 sometimes occurs during police interrogation. Torture is
 rare, but public beatings by the citizenry of persons
 identified as thieves occasionally take place.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Lack of resources results in
 inadequate facilities. Prisoners can be sentenced to hard
 labor, and they sometimes perform road maintenance work
 Several prisons are located in isolated inhospitable northern
 desert *regions.
 In its 1987 Report (covering 1986), Amnesty International
 expressed concern about the harsh conditions'at Taoudenit
 prison camp. There is no evidence that any political
 prisoners are being held at Taoudenit. Prisoners there have
 been sentenced to hard labor in the local salt mine. Amnesty
 also noted that it had -received reports that eight persons,
 who had helped a student leader escape the country in 1986,
 had been held incommunieado by police for 10 weeks. Several
 were reported to have been hung by their hands or feet and'
 denied adequate food and medical attention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 No incident of arbitrary arrests, detention, or -exile, was
 reported in 1987. The Malian judicial system is based on the
 French model. 'Vetained persons do not have the right to a
 judicial deterrminatior of the legalityof their detention, but
 arrests cannot be-made without-formal charges. However, in
 political cases, the authorities do not always-follow this
 practice. For example, Amnesty International received reports
 that six persons arrested in 1986 in connection 'with alleged
 student opposition to the Government were held for over 5
 months before a formal order authorizing their detention was
 issued. The students were tried, sentenced, and released with
 all the time spent in prison applied to reduction of their
 sentences.            -
 Malian law does-not provide for release on bail,'but detainees
 are sometimes released on their own recognizance. Prisoners;
 are usually allowed access to a lawyer of their choosing.
 Administrative backlogs cause frequent delays in scheduling
 trials.
 -Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited except in cases of
 convicted criminals.
 e. Denial of Fair Public'Trial
 New laws have been enacted to make the judicial system conform
 to Malian fife, but French colonial-laws not abrogated still
 have the force of law. The judiciary is not independent but
 rather part of the executive branch. At the apex is the
 Supreme Court with both judicial and administrative powers.
 Trials generally are of short duration. While confessions are
 generally not coerced, in practice defendants usually admit
 guilt in the hope of receiving a more lenient sentence and
 allow their lawyers to argue mitigating circumstances. The
 verdict and sentence are rendered by a panel of three judges.
 Once convicted, redress depends on an appeal for a presidential
 
 
 178
 MALI
 pardon or a request for a new trial. The Constitution
 stipulates that the National Assembly can convene a High Court
 of Justice to hear cases against state ministers, but this
 court did not meet in 1987.
 Although the exact number of political prisoners is not known,
 it is believed to be very low. The Government uses its
 Independence Day celebrations as an annual occasion to grant a
 limited number of pardons, including to selected political
 prisoners. In September 1987, presidential pardons were
 granted to five men convicted in 1976 for their role in an
 attempted coup. In its 1987 Report, Amnesty International
 stated that all "prisoners of conscience" had been released by
 the end of 1986.
 Corruption has become a major issue in Malian political life,
 and has been discussed in a number of different public forums.
 In 1987 the President appointed a special commission to
 investigate accusations of corruption in 47 cases against 71
 persons. The commission reported its findings in November,
 and a special court rendered judgments in December. Nine
 persons were sentenced to death, some in absentia, while those
 who repaid embezzled fxnds were reprimanded or lightly
 sentence. The death sentences have not been carried out and
 may be commuted. While the commission mandate does not limit
 its investigations to government officials, no private
 businessmen have been arrested.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Inviolability of the home is provided for in the Constitution
 and generally respected in practice. Police searches are
 infrequent, and warrants must be issued and recorded. However,
 this occasionally occurs after the fact.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Malian Constitution does not ensure freedom of speech and
 press. The Government controls all Malian media, and all
 journalists are government employees. General public
 questioning of government authority is not permitted.
 However, Criticism of specific programs, aspects of society,
 or the performance of government offices and office-holders is
 permitted. Prior to the 1987 extraordinary party congress,
 the President himself participated in a series of public
 meetings in which charges of corruption were leveled against
 his Government. Academic freedom does not extend to criticism
 of the Government or its policies. Private antigovernment
 Malian publications are not tolerated, but international
 publications, even those critical of Mali and its Government,
 are readily available and circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malian Constitution assures the liberty of citizens to
 form organizations to protect their "professional interests,"
 but, in reality, only selected organizations, such as urban
 professional associations, qualify. Only the women's, youth,
 and labor associations of the UDPM assemble freely.
 The National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM), composed of 12
 unions, is the only recognized workers' organization. It
 
 
 179
 MALI
 maintains, contacts with international labor organizations.
 The UNTM.claims to maintain a degree of autonomy from the
 Government, and it enjoys limited freedom to criticize some.
 government programs. Its Secretary General is a party member
 but is not a member of the party's Central Executive Council.
 Under close government monitoring and guidelines, limited
 collective bargaining is permitted. Strikes seldom occur.
 There were a series of minor strikes by teachers in December
 1986 and again in December 1987 to protest repeated delayed
 payment of government salaries. In contrast to 1986, when
 several strike leaders were arrested, there were no arrests in
 1987. Strikes for political reasons are illegal.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali is a pecular-state. Although 90 percent of Malians are
 Muslim, most other religions may practice their faiths freely
 and are permitted to establish houses of worship as well as
 schools. Christian missionaries of various faiths-enjoy
 government cooperation. Proselytizing and conversion are
 permitted, except in the case of the Baha'i, who may practice,
 at home but may not proselytize or establish houses of
 worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 travelers are -sometimes--subject to police-checks, especially
 at night. These checks are legal and are used as a means to
 restrict the movement of-contraband goods.  In practice, some
 poliqe.-probably supplement their frequently delayed salaries
 by assessing ad hoc fines or confiscating goods. Malians are
 free to--change residence or workplace. Foreign travel requires
 an exit isa,. but this is easy to obtain. Repatriation is not
 restricted.
 During the recent drought years, Mali both accepted and
 generated.displaced p4rsons. Several thousand Malians were
 repatriated from Algeria in 1986 and 1987. In 1987 Mali also
 welcomed back over 100 Malians deported from France.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have limited and infrequent opportunity to influence
 their government and no ability to change it. The military
 role in governing Mali remains important, but civilian
 participation in the leadership groups has been growing.
 Important policies and decisions are made by a small group
 composed of the President, the party's Central Executive
 Bureau, and the Council of Ministers. The memberships of
 these groups overlap. Party congresses, such as the one held
 in March 1987, are called by the President to consider special
 issues. In 1987 the issues included political participation
 and corruption, and the congress adopted a new National Charter
 of National Reorientation of Public Life, calling on Malians
 to dedicate efforts to economic development. One of the
 mandates of the new Charter, and of the newly appointed
 special commission to assist the Secretary General of the
 party, is to recruit new leadership and encourage greater
 public participation in the party, and, by extension, the
 Government.

 MALI
 Within the one-party system, multiple candidates often contest
 party elections at the local level, but for National Assembly
 elections, which are held every 4 years, one carefully
 selected party'candidate runs for each seat. The National
 Assembly debates proposed legislation after its acceptance by
 the Council of Ministers and review by the Supreme Court. The
 Assembly's role is to endorse the decisions taken by the
 Council.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is generally responsive to calls by recognized
 human rights groups. There are no local organizations to
 monitor human rights. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles
 human rights-related inquiries from Amnesty International or
 other international human rights organizations. The Ministry
 of Justice, with jurisdiction over the courts, administers
 Malian law. Mali does not play a major role in international
 human rights forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Virtually all Mali's ethnic groups are represented at the
 highest state and party levels. Although some nomadic groups
 such as the Tuaregs remain outside the economic and political
 mainstream, Mali is relatively free of ethnic tensions.
 Social and cultural factors place men in the dominant position
 in Mali. However, women play an important economic role, both
 in market life and in farming. While underrepresented, women
 are present at all levels of the Government and in the party.
 Two women are cabinet ministers, and one is in the party's
 Central Executive Bureau. Three are members of the National
 Assembly. Nonetheless, custom tends to restrict women to
 "women's issues" when they participate in politics. The
 women's union focuses primarily on establishing cooperatives,
 improving health programs, fostering education, and campaigning
 against female circumcision, which is still widely practiced.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Mali has a detailed labor code specifying conditions of
 employment, including hours, wages, and social security
 benefits. The minimum wage is approximately $142.50 per
 month. Health and safety standards vary depending upon the
 category of work, but there is limited enfogcement due to the
 lack of inspectors. Employers are required to pay into a
 National Social Security Fund. While the minimum age for
 employment is 14, with parents' permission children can be
 apprenticed at 12. In practice, children in rural areas join
 the work force at a much younger age, and workers in the
 informal sector are not protected by laws against unjust
 compensation, excessive hours, and capricious discharge.
