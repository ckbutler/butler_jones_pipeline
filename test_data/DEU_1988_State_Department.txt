 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) is a democratic society
 with a modern parliamentary system. Its industrialized
 economy provides one of the highest standards of living in the
 world.
 National power is divided among executive, legislative, and
 judicial branches. The head of the Federal Government, the
 Chancellor, is elected by the Bundestag, the lower house of
 Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor and of the
 Parliament, which are substantial, are set down in the Basic
 Law (constitution). The Bundestag is elected through a
 mixture of direct constituency candidates and party lists.
 Members of the upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, are
 appointed by the state governments. There is also division of
 governmental authority between national and state
 governments. The latter retain significant autonomy,
 especially in matters relating to law enforcement and the
 courts, culture and education, the environment, and social
 assistance.
 The Federal Republic has been ruled since its creation by
 governments headed by one of the two major parties, the
 Christian Democratic Union (CDU) or the Social Democratic
 Party (SPD). The current Government is led by a coalition of
 the Christian Democratic Union, joined by its Bavarian sister
 party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Free
 Democratic Party (FDP). The SPD and the Greens, a party
 represented in the Bundestag since the elections of March
 1983, comprise the opposition.
 Organized essentially at the state (Land) level and operating
 under the direction of state governments, the police are well
 trained and disciplined, and scrupulously respect citizens'
 rights, as well as those of other persons resident in the FRG
 to the extent they are protected by law. In dealing with
 hostile elements, including terrorists, special care is taken
 to respect the rights of the accused.
 The foundation of the Basic Law, adopted in 1949, rests firmly
 on the principles of liberty, equality, and the free exercise
 of individual rights. Although the "basic rights" enumerated
 in that law are theoretically subject to interference only on
 the basis of a law, in practice these human rights are
 scrupulously protected.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killing by the Government or by
 mainstream political organizat-ions is unknown. Terrorist
 groups on the far left '(the Red Army Fraktion--RAF) and the
 far right (neo-Nazi groups) and Middle Eastern terrorists
 continue to engage in political violence. In September
 high-ranking Finance Ministry official Hans Tietmeyer was shot
 at by persons claiming to belong to the RAF.

 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or police authorities do not abduct, secretly
 arrest, or otherwise illegally detain persons. There have
 been no kidnapings by political terrorist groups for several
 years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police authorities do not physically or mentally torture
 prisoners, nor do they engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment short of torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person may be arrested in the Federal Republic except on
 the basis of an arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial
 authority. Any person detained by the police must be brought
 before a judge and charged no later than :th'e'day following the
 day of apprehension. The court must then issue an arrest
 warrant with stated reasons or order the persbn's release.
 There is no preventive detention except that a prisoner may be
 held in custody no longer that 24 hours while awaiting a
 formal charge if there is evidence that he might seek to flee
 the country to avoid prosecution. The right of free access to
 legal counsel has been restricted only in the cases of some
 terrorists who have used contacts with lawyers to promote and
 continue terrorist activity even while in prison. Only judges
 may decide on the validity of any deprivation of liberty.
 Bail bond exists in the Federal Republic but is seldom
 employed. There is no exile. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due process and
 prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both
 government interference and intimidation by terrorists. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is ensured by the Basic Law and
 fully respected in practice. Prior to forcible entry by
 police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance
 or monitoring of mail may be undertaken only after
 authorization by a court order.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The provisions of the Basic Law, an independent press, an
 effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political
 system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press.
 Criticism of the Government is unrestricted. The media and
 artistic works are not censored. Academic freedom is
 complete. There is no censorship of foreign or domestic
 books. Newspapers and magazines are privately owned.
 Radio and television networks and stations function, for the
 most part, as corporations under special public laws. They
 
 
 1071
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 are governed by independent boards made up of representatives
 of churches, political parties, and other organizations.
 A few experimental private television cable stations and local
 television cable networks have been set up. Legislation has
 been enacted in all states except Bremen and Hesse to
 facilitate and encourage private television stations using
 cable, satellites, and other "new" media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are fully respected, as
 is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain police permits
 beforehand and may be asked to pay a deposit to cover the
 repair of any damage to public facilities. When demonstrators
 have not obtained the required permits, police have exercised
 considerable restraint, showing concer ultimately only for
 the continued functioning of public facilities and for the
 safety of the general public.
 Membership in nongovernmental organization of all types,
 including political parties, is entirely open. Parties found
 to be "fundamentally antidemocratic" may be outlawed. Under
 this constitutionally based provision, the Federal
 Constitutional Court, in the 1950's, declared both a neo-Nazi
 and a Communist party to be illegal.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The full practice of religion is allowed. Major religious
 groups benefit from a state-administered church tax system.
 The Government subsidizes church-affiliated schools. Personal
 religious affiliation today plays an insignificant role in
 politics and in other walks of life. Members of all religions
 may be found in all political parties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country
 and to leave and return at any time. Germans who arrive in
 the Federal Republic from the German Democratic Republic (GDR)
 are treated as German citizens and therefore may take up
 residence without restrictions. There was a dramatic increase
 in 1988 in the number of ethnic Germans coming to settle in
 the FRG. By September 1, 1988, 128,000 ethnic Germans had
 come, representing a three-fold increase over the same period
 in 1987. Of this number, 72,000 came from Poland, 25,000 from
 the USSR, 8,000 from Romania, and 22,000 from the GDR. Part
 of the increase is due to the new Soviet Entry and Exit Act.
 Effective January 1, 1987, ethnic Germans living in the Soviet
 Union with first degree relatives in the FRG were given exit
 visas on a priority basis.
 The right of asylum fof those who are politically persecuted
 is guaranteed by the Basic Law and respected in practice. The
 FRG is also experiencing dramatically higher numbers of asylum
 seekers. For the period January-June 1988, asylum status was
 granted to 39,885 foreigners with the largest numbers coming
 from Poland and Turkey. Once formally granted asylum status
 and to a lesser extent while being processed, asylees have
 
 
 1072
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 essentially the same access to social welfare benefits as
 German citizens. Short of the right to vote, they also enjoy
 complete civil rights.
 The explosion of asylum seekers since 1979 prompted enactment
 of the Asylum Procedural Law in November 1986. The Law
 included provisions to discourage emigration to the Federal
 Republic on the part of so-called economic refugees--fully 80
 percent of all who apply. Work prohibitions for asylum
 seekers were institutionalized for airlines bringing in
 foreigners without valid entry visas.
 Denial of political asylum does not automatically result in
 deportation. Eighty percent of those whose petitions are
 denied are typically allowed to remain in the country for
 other, humanitarian reasons. Persons from Eastern European
 countries are normally allowed to remain whether or not
 official asylum status is granted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the parliamentary democracy established by the Basic
 Law, the Federal Republic is ruled by a government chosen by
 the people through orderly elections based on universal
 suffrage. Around 87 percent of voters normally participate in
 national elections, but local contests attract significantly
 lower participation. Candidates for public office are usually
 members of political parties but are not required to be. The
 Basic Law and the state constitutions contain provisions that
 only parties achieving at least 5 percent of the vote can be
 represented in the Federal and state parliaments. New
 political parties are free to form and enter the political
 process. Although party discipline plays an important role,
 voting on issues in the Bundestag is ultimately a matter of
 individual decision.
 Women are entitled by law to full participation in political
 life, and all parties are committed to encouraging their
 greater participation. The SPD, for example, has changed its
 rules to require a 40 percent quota for women on all party
 committees and governing bodies. The Cabinet Minister for
 Youth, Family, Women, and Health is responsible for furthering
 women's interests in both the public and private spheres.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The International Society for Human Rights, Amnesty
 International, and other smaller human rights organizations
 freely conduct their activities in the Federal Republic. The
 Government considers the international promotion of human
 rights one of its highest priorities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no discrimination in the availability of shelter,
 health care, and education to all inhabitants, regardless of
 race, religion, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or
 citizenship.
 Due to increased unemployment, the Government has pursued a
 three-pronged policy with regard to foreign workers:
 
 
 1073
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 integration of longtime residents, limitation of further
 entries, and repatriation aid for those willing to return to
 their home countries. At the end of June 1988, foreign
 workers totalled 1.6 million, or 7.5 percent of the work
 force, and 36 percent were organized in trade unions. A
 national debate has been under way over whether the rights of
 guest workers should be broadened to permit unlimited
 residence and the right to vote or reduced by limiting the
 right of entry for dependent children.
 Since the passage of an equal employment rights law in 1982,
 women are guaranteed equal employment at the workplace. They
 are increasingly rising to management and leadership positions
 in the private and public sectors. In organized labor, about
 26 percent of union members are women, and a woman has served
 as president of the second largest trade union since 1982.
 A majority of women do not work outside the home. The rate of
 participation of women in the labor force, about 38 percent,
 is below the average in the European Economic Community, and
 most working women are employed in traditional fields.
 Protective legislation bars women from working in certain
 heavy industrial occupations and also generally bans night /
 work. Young women experience difficulties in gaining access
 to training in some traditionally male fields. Recent court
 rulings and government pilot programs, however, have helped
 break down some of these attitudinal and institutional
 barriers. Women enjoy full and equal protection under the
 law, including property and inheritance rights. However,
 salaries for women in the private sector tend to be lower than
 salaries for men in similar jobs. Consistent with the special
 status which mothers enjoy pursuant to the terms of the Basic
 Law, the Government provides financial benefits for mothers,
 including maternity leave and child allowances. There are
 several active women's rights groups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to associate freely, choose representatives,
 determine programs and policies to represent members'
 interests, and to publicize views is recognized and exercised
 freely in the Federal Republic. The right to strike is
 guaranteed by law, except for civil servants and personnel in
 sensitive positions, such as members of the armed forces. The
 country has a long-established and highly organized labor
 movement, with about 42 percent of the eligible work force
 unionized. The German Trade Union Federation represents over
 83 percent of organized workers. Reborn in the wake of World
 War II, the unions are particularly conscious of their
 historic role as the protector of workers' rights and a
 bulwark of the democratic system. They actively participate
 in the International Labor Organization and in international
 and European trade union organizations.
 b. Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is guaranteed
 by law and is widely practiced. Each year approximately 7,000
 contracts are renegotiated, affecting some 20 million workers,
 or 90 percent of the dependent work force. No government
 mechanism to promote voluntary worker-employer negotiations is
 required because of a well-developed system of autonomous
