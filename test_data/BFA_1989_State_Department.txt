 BURKINA FASO
 Burkina Faso is ruled by a military regime headed by Captain
 Blaise Compaore, who took power from Thomas Sankara on October
 15, 1987 in the country's fourth military coup since 1980.
 The new military regime continued the ban on political parties
 and activities and gave no indication that the country will
 return to constitutional rule. Instead, President Compaore
 moved to firm up a narrow political base by forming a "popular
 front" of various leftwing and centrist groups, military
 officers, and miscellaneous civilians to assist in running the
 Government. He has also formed a network of Revolutionary
 Committees (CR's), loosely organized at national, regional,
 and local levels, to mobilize the population and promote
 revolutionary goals.
 The Burkina Faso armed forces number about 7,500 members,
 including 5,200 in the army, 100 in the air force, and 2,200
 in the paramilitary gendarmerie and the police. All police
 and internal security forces are controlled by the Ministry of
 Defense.
 Burkina Faso, one of the world's poorer countries, is
 overwhelmingly tied to subsistence agriculture, with 90
 percent of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture
 is, however, highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall.
 Frequent drought, lack of communications and other
 infrastructure, a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy
 are all longstanding problems. The country has a per capita
 income of about $180 per year.
 Human rights continued to be circumscribed in 1989. Problem
 areas were extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions,
 mistreatment of detainees, and restrictions on press, speech,
 assembly, and the right of citizens to change their government
 through peaceful means. The Government did allow the
 establishment of a local human rights organization (which
 intervened in some specific cases), permitted some political
 groupings to form and distribute pamphlets discreetly, and
 released all political opponents held in prison.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Four members of the armed forces were summarily executed
 without trial in September 1989 after allegedly plotting a
 coup d'etat. The four were Minister of Defense Major
 Jean-Baptiste Lengani, Minister of Economic Promotion Captain
 Henri Zongo, the officer in charge of the communications unit,
 Captain Sabyamba Koundaba, and an unidentified bodyguard of
 the Minister of Defense. After the coup attempt of Christmas
 1989, the Government made a point of denying rumors that 7
 people had been executed and said all arrestees would receive
 trials.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and mistreatment of detainees have been persistent
 problems for a number-of years. Amnesty International
 published a special report in 1988, "Burkina Faso, Political
 Imprisonment and the Use of Torture from 1983 to 1988," giving
 accounts of the imprisonment of political opponents and
 torture under the present and preceding governments. Police
 brutality continued in 1989, although there were fewer
 credible reports, usually involving severe beatings, often at
 the time of apprehension. A Catholic Church-sponsored
 organization has alleged that the police and gendarmerie beat
 and tortured at least 15 people arrested for political reasons
 in 1989. The Government denied that anyone has been tortured.
 Prison conditions are poor, with most prisons holding double
 their design capacity, and are characterized by the lack of
 sufficient food, minimum hygiene, and medical support.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were continuing reports in 1989 of arbitrary arrest.
 The law permits preventive detention without charge for a
 maximum of 72 hours, renewable for a single 72-hour period in
 criminal cases. In practice, there are frequent violations of
 this restriction in cases involving both Burkinabe and foreign
 nationals, especially in political cases. Several
 schoolchildren, for example, were held in.detention without
 charge for a number of months in 1988. In addition, in cases
 of emergency or national security, the -military code, which
 provides for indefinite detention, overrides the civil code.
 Access to lawyers is not.normally permitted in zecurity cases,
 although it is provided for by law.
 The Government detained several persons for political reasons
 during 1989, but by the end of the year all had been released,
 many within a few days of their arrest. Immediately following
 the discovery of the alleged coup plot on September 18, three
 or four government officials were arrested and held briefly
 for questioning. These persons were later released, but four
 others were summarily executed without trial. The Government
 also released a number of persons detained since the overthrow
 of the Sankara government in 1987, including former Interior
 Minister Ernest Nongria Ouedraogo. In this connection, 23
 junior military personnel, detained at various times since
 Sankarals overthrow on suspicion of coup-plotting, were
 released August 4, 1989. An-unknown number of people were
 arrested as a result of a coup attempt over Christmas 1989.
 Numbers rumored range from 5 to 30 prisoners, including
 military personnel. They were still being held at year's end,
 and the Government had provided no names or other information,
 despite requests.
 Some intellectuals, ex-military officers, and former
 government officials remain in self-imposed exile abroad,
 partly due to fear for their safety should .they return.
 Captain Boukary Kabore, leader of resistance at Koudougou
 airforce base against Compoare's coup in 1987, is now exiled
 in Ghana. He charged in 1989 that the popular front
 Government is attempting to liquidate all remaining Sankara
 loyalists. The Government has encouraged opponents of the
 Sankara regime to return home, but few have done so. Kabore
 stated in an interview in November that if he had the chance
 to seize power in Burkina, he would do so.

 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The regular judiciary, patterned after the French system, has
 continued to function for most criminal and civil cases.
 Defendants traditionally receive a fair trial and are
 represented by counsel. In 1987 the Government began the
 practice of appointing civil service attorneys to represent
 those who do not wish to retain, or are unable to afford, a
 private attorney.
 The people's revolutionary courts begun under Sankara
 continued to hear cases primarily involving public
 corruption. The president of each people's court is a
 magistrate appointed by the Government to head a tribunal
 composed of magistrates, military personnel, and members of
 the CR's. The court president asks questions directly of the
 defendant.
 In December 1988, seven soldiers were convicted by a military
 court in Bobo Dioulasso. The trial was held in secret, and
 the seven were executed the day after conviction without an
 opportunity to appeal. In the 1989 case of the four persons
 summarily executed, there was no known trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government authorities generally do not interfere in the daily
 lives of ordinary citizens, and there is no general monitoring
 of private correspondence or telephones. Under the law, homes
 may be searched only under authority of a warrant issued by
 the attorney general. An exception exists, however, in
 national security cases, where a special law permits
 surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and
 correspondence without a warrant. This law is used against
 persons suspected of opposition to-the Government.
 The Government encourages participation in the CR's and also
 in organizations being formed to support the Popular Front.
 However, it was still not clear in 1989 if lack of
 participation will result in dismissals from civil service
 positions, as was the case in previous regimes.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While there is no formal government censorship, the Government
 employs intimidating methods to limit freedom of speech and
 press. For example, repeated references by the regime to
 enemies of the State at home and abroad inhibit both
 government-employed journalists and ordinary citizens from
 expressing critical views. Similarly, it uses occasional
 dismissals from government service and arbitrary arrest to
 quash debate on political topics. In 1989 several persons
 were arrested and held briefly for distributing political
 leaflets.
 Under the control of the Minister of Information, the media,
 which consists of a daily newspaper, a weekly magazine, a
 monthly magazine, and radio and television stations, are all
 government owned, and all journalists are civil servants. The
 media do not engage in serious criticism of the Government and
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 reflects government positions on both international and
 national issues. Journalists who try to report stories
 without political bias may be replaced for failing to support
 sufficiently the political views bf the Government. In 1989 a
 private newspaper, L'Observateur, attempted to publish its
 first edition since it was burned down in 1984. The
 Government quickly cut off the electricity and stationed
 police at the doors, ostensibly because the newspaper did not
 have the proper permits. It subsequently made it clear that
 no permit will be granted. A small, private all-music radio
 station authorized to broadcast in the last days of the
 Sankara administration remains closed as well, after being
 shut down in the first days of the Compaore Government.
 A new information code has been pending, for more than a year.
 A number of proposed provisions involve insuring government
 control of any means of communication, publicly or privately
 owned, and government licensing of journalists. It would also
 institute prison terms or fines for violation of the code.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines entered the country freely
 during 1989. For the most part, foreign journalists traveled
 freely and filed stories without censorship and enjoyed access
 to government officials. Films are subject to censorship by a
 review board which includes religious authorities as well as
 government officials. There were no known instances of
 political censorship of movies. There is no interference with
 international radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under both the Sankara and Compaore Governments, political
 parties as such have been banned, and administrative
 permission is generally required for assemblies of any kind.
 However; in 1989 the Government permitted several small
 political groupings to meet more or less openly, with the more
 centrist groups invited to join the Government's popular
 front. Nonpolitical associations for business, religious,
 cultural, and other purposes exist and experience no
 difficulty in obtaining permission to meet or in associating
 with international bodies in their fields.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burkina Faso is a secular state, and there is no official
 discrimination on religious grounds. Islam and Christianity
 exist side by side, with about 40 percent of the population
 Muslim and about 15 percent Christian. The remainder of the
 population practices traditional African religions. Muslim
 and Christian holidays are recognized as national holidays.
 Social mobility and access to modern sector jobs are neither
 linked to, nor restricted by, religious affiliations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travelers within Burkina Faso are routinely stopped at police
 and military checkpoints. There appears to be little
 restriction on foreign travel for business and tourism. Exit
 permits, once used to limit movements of workers to
 neighboring countries, particularly to Cote dlIvoire where 2
 million or more Burkinabe continue to reside and work, are no
 longer required.

 BURKINA FASO
 Refugees are accepted freely in Burkina Faso, and attempts are
 made to provide for their care in cooperation with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There were
 approximately 270 refugees and displaced persons in Burkina
 Faso at the end of 1989, mainly from Chad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government
 through democratic procedures. The military have dominated
 the political process since 1980 through four changes in
 leadership. To bolster his popular front, President Compaore
 has taken some steps to create an opening to small
 conservative and centrist political forces, but he has not
 publicly indicated any movement toward a constitution,
 national elections, or political parties in the future. He
 relies on an amorphous grouping of people, including military
 officers, to help run the Government and has a loose network
 of Revolutionary Committees throughout the country to mobilize
 support.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no known international investigations of Burkina in
 1989. A new, local human rights organization, the Burkina
 Movement for Human Rights and Rights of Peoples (MBDHP), was
 formed, led publicly by the President, Administrative Chamber
 of the Superior Court. While the MBDHP has not directly
 publicly criticized the Government on specific human rights
 issues, after the September executions it publicly reaffirmed
 its opposition to the death penalty and the need in Burkina
 for fair public trials. Privately, it has brought a number of
 specific issues to the attention of the Government, such as
 the treatment of prisoners immediately after the September
 1989 coup plot. Members were not harassed in 1989.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority ethnic groups are as likely to be represented in the
 inner circles of the Government as are the dominant Mossi, who
 comprise 50 percent of the population. Government decisions
 do not favor one ethnic group over another.
 In the largely rural African society of Burkina Faso, women
 still occupy a subordinate position. Women supply much of the
 labor in family farming and are active in the market economy.
 The Government is committed to expanding opportunities for
 women, including in cabinet and civil service positions.
 Women make up one-fourth of the government work force, which
 represents one-third of the total salaried work force in the
 country. Women make up approximately one-third of the total
 student population in the primary, secondary, and advanced
 school systems. While there is no known discrimination
 against women in the granting of scholarships for advanced
 study, schools in rural areas have disproportionately fewer
 girls than schools in urban areas.
 Violence against women, expecially wife beating, occurs fairly
 frequently in the rural areas, less often in the urban areas.
 The Government is attempting through the National Women's
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 Association (UFB) to educate people on the subject. Specific
 cases can be brought to the UFB which attempts to offer
 protection and counsel. Such cases are sometimes brought
 before a "popular conciliation tribunal" for mediation. The
 Government also sponsors campaigns against female genital
 mutilation, which still occurs in many rural areas, although
 it is becoming less common in urban centers. Another form of
 multilation is by scarring the face of both boys and girls of
 certain ethnic groups, which is rapidly disappearing. The UFB
 also takes the leadership in these campaigns.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have traditionally had the legal right to associate.
 There are a number of autonomous unions and five labor
 federations. Organized labor continues to be an important
 force in Burkina Faso. .All unions jealously guard their
 limited independence from the Government. However, despite
 legal rights, the unions have been prevented from engaging in
 activities.the-Government opposes. Under the previous regime,
 many labor Aeaders were arrested and held for long periods.
 Some were reportedly tortured. One former trade union
 official was detained briefly in September 1989, allegedly in
 connection with a nonunion dispute.
 Organized labor has the legal right to strike, but the Sankara
 government eliminated this right in practice. The Compaore
 Government has not faced major labor unrest, and its attitude
 has yet to be tested. There were several minor strikes in
 1989. The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee
 of Experts noted with satisfaction in 1989 that all the
 teachers dismissed following a strike in 1989 had been
 reinstated, that sanctions against officials had been lifted,
 and that all political prisoners and admistrative detainees
 had been freed.
 The largest federation, the National Organization of Free
 Trade Unions, is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Another federation is
 affiliated with the World Confederation of Labor, and a third
 is affiliated with the Communist-controlled World Federation
 of Trade Unions. The other two federations are unaffiliated.
 The five federations take turns representing labor at the ILO
 meetings and participate in African regional labor meetings as
 well.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to bargain for wages and other benefits
 within a specific bargaining unit, such as a company or
 factory, but cannot bargain industry-wide. They represent the
 interests of their members in the private and public sectors,
 as well as before the labor inspection service of the
 Government and before the courts.
 There are no export processing zones in Burkina Faso.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is not employed and is prohibited by law.
 
 
 36
 BURKINA FASO
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor code sets the minimum age for employment at 14, the
 average age for completion of basic secondary school.
 However, the Government lacks the means to enforce this
 provision adequately, even in the small-wage sector. Most
 children actually begin work at an earlier age owing to the
 large number of small, family subsistence farms and the
 traditional apprenticeship system.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 A minimum monthly wage of about $75 and a maximum workweek of
 48 hours are stipulated by the labor code, as are safety and
 health provisions. This minumum wage is not adequate for a
 worker to support a family, and wage workers usually must rely
 on supplementing income through the extended family and
 subsistence agriculture. A system of government inspections
 and labor courts ensures that these provisions are applied in
 the small industrial and commercial sectors, but they have
 been impossible to enforce in the dominant subsistence
 agriculture sector which involves 90 percent of the population.
