 COLOMBIA
 
 Colombia is a centralized, presidential democracy,
 which has been ruled by freely elected governments
 for all but five years of the present century. The
 Constitution provides for a popularly-elected President
 and Congress and an independent judiciary.
 Two parties, the Liberal and the Conservative, have
 dominated politics since the mid-19th century. From
 1958 to 1974, under the "National Front," they alternated
 in power.. The present chief executive is a Liberal,
 as was his immediate predecessor. In accordance with
 the Constitution, the Cabinet includes opposition party
 members. Third parties have played only a minor role.
 The military in Colombia has a long tradition of non-
 intervention in political affairs; in the present cen-
 tury, the country has experienced military dictatorship
 only once (1953-1957).
 The Constitution guarantees numerous civil and political
 liberties, as well as some social benefits. A constitu-
 tionally authorized state of siege, which permits the
 curtailment of ciyil and political liberties, is cur-
 rently in effect and has been imposed in varying degrees
 for the last 30 years. Since the promulgation of govern-
 ment decrees 1923 of September 6, 1978, covering security
 offenses, and 1244 of October 4, 1978, dealing with
 air and sea traffic, the state of siege has had an
 increased impact on life in Colombia.
 For at least the last three decades, Colombia has had
 serious problems with politically and non-politically
 inspired violence. Several terrorist and guerrilla
 groups, with some 2,000 members, now operate in the
 countryside and to a lesser extent in the larger cities.
 An American Peace Corps volunteer, Richard Starr, continues
 to be held captive by rural guerrillas. After the
 January 1, 1979, theft from an army arsenal of 5,000
 weapons by members of the Movement of the 19th of April,
 the government launched a campaign to eliminate this
 terrorist group. Other terrorist groups, too, have
 been pursued with increased intensity by the government
 during the last 12 months. The increase in anti-terrorist
 operations at the beginning of 1979 continued for approxi-
 mately three months but subsided somewhat during the
 latter half of the year. During the height of the
 government's crackdown a number of charges of human
 rights violations surfaced.
 Colombia is an open society where all political issues
 including human rights matters are debated freely.
 In late 1979, the Congress passed a major judicial
 reform bill which strengthens certain institutional
 safeguards for human rights.
 Despite rapid economic growth and a strong foreign
 exchange situation, Colombia continues to be plagued
 by skewed income distribution and inflation.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity Of The Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a.   Torture
 
 (279)
 
 
 280
 The Constitution states that public officials may be
 held legally responsible for abuses of authority and
 for acts of omission in the exercise of their authority.
 Torture is forbidden by law and is contrary to custom.
 High-ranking officials have publicly decried its use.
 There have nevertheless been a number of reports of
 torture, most of them following the crackdown on ter-
 rorists after the January 1, 1979 arms theft. In gener-
 al, the sources of reports of torture have been the
 alleged victims themselves or representatives of opposition
 groups. The Government has argued that the accusation
 of torture is routinely made in order to embarrass
 the government. Many of the reports of torture have
 been disproven. However, some of them appear credible.
 Torture was reportedly inflicted in the early stages
 of prisoners' incarceration, especially during interrogation.
 Charges of abuse by military personnel are normally
 handled through the military investigation and judicial
 system or in some cases by a representative of the
 Office of the Attorney General. Incidents involving
 the police are investigated by the Office of the Attorney
 General. In recent months, a number of policemen and
 military personnel have been investigated and some
 have been brought to trial and convicted for abuse
 of prisoners.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment:
 Reports of inhuman or degrading treatment are more
 frequent than reports of torture. Such incidents report-
 edly most often occur immediately or shortly after
 arrest, while the prisoner is being interrogated.
 There have been no summary executions --the death penalty
 is specifically proscribed by the Constitution--or
 known deaths as a result of brutal treatment. Nor
 have there been any known cases of disappearances.
 Some detainees suspected of security offenses have
 been held in military installations'not normally used
 as prisons, but most are incarcerated in regular prisons
 segregated from common criminals.
 Normally, prisoners are held in one- or two-person
 cells, and have access to open areas containing stores,
 cafeterias, barbershops, and recreational facilities.
 The larger prisons have resident medical and dental
 staffs. However, an outbreak of tuberculosis in one
 of Bogota's major prisons gave rise to press criticism
 of the system. Prisoners are fed a typically Colombian
 diet, and can supplement it with other foods, either
 purchased in prison stores or brought in from outside.
 Family members are normally allowed to visit prisoners
 regularly. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross, between January 14 and February 2, 1979, visited
 170 prisoners in Bogota and Tunja. Also, the Ministry
 of Justice has developed a program of regular prison
 visits by Ministry officials.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 
 
 281
 Under the existing state of siege, the government has
 broad powers to arrest and detain to preserve public
 order. According to the Minister of Justice, 177 persons
 accused of belonging to subversive organizations were
 being held in September. The Minister also said that
 961 others had been arrested and released. In all,
 more than 350 persons accused of subversive activities
 were arraigned or tried in 1979. The government has
 repeatedly stated that no one is arrested simply for
 holding political beliefs contrary to those of the
 government and that all those detained under Article
 28 of the Constitution (dealing with threats to public
 order) or the Internal Security Statute of September
 6, 1978, have been detained on suspicion of having
 committed acts of violence.
 Colombian law provides for habeas corpus in most cases.
 However, the right of habeas corpus is not applicable
 to the case of any'person detained under Article 28
 for the first ten days of his detention. In recent
 months, some suspected subversives are known to have
 been held without formal charges for as long as 30
 days.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and 'generally honored in practice. Pris-
 oners may be represented by attorneys of their choice,
 but if they have none, the court will designate one.
 Court proceedings are closed until irvestigation of
 the circumstances is completed and an indictment handed
 down. Owing to an overburdened judicial system, many
 persons indicted for common crimes never come to trial
 but are simply released after serving the minimum sen-
 tence applicable to the crime in question.
 In late 1979, the Colombian Congress passed a far-reach-
 ing reform of the judicial system. The new law assigns
 specific responsibility to the Attorney General's office
 for the protection and defense of civil, economic and
 other human rights in all areas of public administration
 and government activities. Under this law, the Attorney
 General would no longer be the principal prosecutor
 for the Government.
 Kidnapping for political purposes, promoting or leading
 an armed uprising, committing violent acts against
 collective security or integrity, causing public distur-
 bances, damaging property by the use of explosives,
 forcing any person to deliver, send or store illegal
 goods, money or documents and crimes against the military
 are crimes for which the accused stand trial in military
 courts in accordance with decree 1923 of 1978.
 Whether tried in civil or military courts, the accused
 is entitled to counsel, counsel has free access to
 the defendant and consultations between the latter
 and counsel may be private. Defendants are made fully
 aware of the charges brought against them, and they
 and their lawyers may inform themselves of the evidence
 on which the charges are based. Uncomfirmed complaints
 have been made of government harassment of defense
 counsel by the government in recent security statute
 cases.
 
 
 282
 The International Commision of Jurists has criticized
 certain provisions of the Security statute citing,
 for example, the removal of the right to appeal convic-
 tion to a higher court.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution requires a legal order before the
 authorities can enter a private home, except in case
 of the hot pursuit of a person seen committing a crime
 who attempts to seek refuge in his own home.
 The sanctity of the home is generally respected in
 practice, though there have been several press accounts
 of instances of alleged illegal search in the last
 few months. Apparently accurate reports have been
 received of patrols damaging houses they had searched.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Colombia has a mixed economy. The Constitution gives
 the government the right to set the general direction
 of the economy and permits it to intervene in the produc-
 tion, distribution, utilization and consumption of
 goods and services. Generally, the State does not
 openly intervene, but rather exercises selective controls
 over private enterprise. The private sector is well
 organized in sectoral interest groups which often exer-
 cise powerful influence over government policy. Special
 problems facing the economy are skewed income distribu-
 tion, the heavy though decreasing internal migration
 from the countryside to the cities, and high rates
 of inflation.
 Urban unemployment is officially 8.5 percent. Emigration
 has provided an important safety valve for both urban
 unemployment and rural underemployment. The middle
 class is growing. However, extreme poverty can be
 found in both urban and rural areas. Despite land
 reform efforts, large land holdings coincident with
 large numbers of landless peasants and subsistence
 plots are the pattern in many regions of Colombia.
 A notable exception to income maldistribution is in
 Colombia's important coffee-growing regions, where
 farms are typically medium -to small-sized. The National
 Salary Council periodically establishes minimum wage
 levels for both industry and agriculture. However,
 increases in minimum wages have failed to keep pace
 with increases in the cost of living. While a majority
 of urban workers are paid above the minimum wage, only
 an estimated one-third of the urban labor force is
 subject to the minimum wage directives. The January
 1979 minimum wage increase had already been mostly
 eroded by mid year.
 While the tax system is a highly progressive one, the
 tax reform act of 1974 sets rates that many Colombians
 feel are confiscatory. Thus, tax evasion is reportedly
 more widespread than previously.
 Most property is privately owned, and the Constitution
 specifically guarantees the ownership of property by
 both natural and juridical persons, but adds that "prop-
 
 
 283
 erty is a social function that implies obligations".
 Similarly, the Constitution guarantees "the freedom
 of business and private initiative within the limits
 of the common good*.
 The Government currently stresses the importance of
 controlling inflation which is probably about 30% for
 1979. The rate of growth of GNP is estimated at 6%
 for 1979. Per capita GNP is $986.
 Although accurate statistics are not available urban
 construction for low-income groups does not appear
 to be keeping up with demand. Industry sources report
 that in the first quarter of 1979, construction in
 Bogota was down 10 percent and for all urban centers,
 down 14 percent.
 The Turbay Administration has projected a vastly increas-
 ed level of public sector investment concentrating
 principally on infrastructure development. The social
 welfare programs of the preceding government have been
 continued. Official statistics suggest that the literacy
 rate is between 72 and 75 percent for persons over
 15 years of age. Free and compulsory education is
 required for the primary grades and most secondary
 schools are free or inexpensive. The quality of educa-
 tion provided by most public schools is mixed. 1975
 statistics from the National University indicate that
 about 77 percent of all primary school-age children
 actually enter school but only 28 percent of those
 who enter continue their studies through the last grade
 of primary school. Of the 28 percent, moreover, only
 36 percent enter secondary school and, of these, only
 31 percent graduate.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Despite the state of siege, the pattern of respect
 for these Constitutionally-guaranteed rights has remained
 essentially unchanged. The 1978 Security Statute gave
 the Government authority to control radio and TV broad-
 casts relating to alleged subversive activities and
 other public order questions. Several stations have
 been fined for broadcasting reports or commentaries
 deemed prejudicial to public order. This restriction
 has been removed. Press censorship does not exist
 and the press often attacks the government and its
 leaders vigorously. However, in the government's cam-
 paign against guerrilla groups, a number of journalists
 representing opposition organizations were arrested
 and held briefly. The editor of a newspaper strongly
 critical of the government's anti-guerrilla campaign
 was sentenced to a year in prison the day after her
 arrest for selling an unregistered firearm to another
 person a year earlier. No newspaper was closed in
 1979.
 The government has impeded public assembly when it
 anticipated violence. For example, in September on
 the second anniversary of a bloody general strike,
 the government prohibited marches and demonstrations
 
 
 284
 but allowed the labor confederations to organize peaceful
 assemblies. A National Forum on Human Rights in March
 was attended by representatives of trade unions, civic
 movements, political parties, peasant and Indian organi-
 zations, Catholic bishops, slum dwellers, professional
 societies, and relatives of prisoners.
 b.   Freedom of-Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Travel controls within Colombia consist of airport
 and highway document checks and inspection for illegal
 arms. Foreign residents leaving the country must have
 an exit permit. Under a special security decree aimed
 at drug trafficking the movement of aircraft and ships
 is restricted in certain geographic areas. There are
 no other restrictions on domestic or foreign travel
 or emigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Colombian political system is democratic. For
 most of the country's independent existence, two parties,
 the Liberal and the Conservative, have dominated poli-
 tics. They encompass sectors with widely divergent
 political views and other parties exist as well, includ-
 ing several of the extreme left. Opposition parties
 function freely, are allowed to raise funds, field
 candidates, hold public meetings and have access to
 the media; some groups publish their own newspapers.
 Guerrilla organizations that carry out acts of violence
 are proscribed by law. The Constitution confers on
 persons of 18 and over the right to vote, and this
 right is respected by the authorities. National elec-
 tions are held every four years and local elections
 every two years. Elections are generally honest.
 Persons convicted of certain crimes can be disenfran-
 chised. Public employees are forbidden by law to parti-
 cipate in political campaigning but can vote.
 While women have equal civil and property rights, their
 role in Colombian society has been limited. With growing
 urbanization and greater educational opportunities,
 however, women are becoming active participants in
 politics and leaders at all levels of society. Although,
 the present Cabinet is all-male, four women have served
 as ministers. The highest ranking women now in govern-
 ment are the Vice Minister of Communications, a Counselor
 of State and the Deputy Attorney General. The newly-
 appointed Secretary General of the Liberal Party is
 a woman. Generally, women are at a distinct disadvantage
 in competing with men for professional positions and
 are nearly always paid less than men for the same work
 (despite the fact that this practice is illegal).
 Colombia has an active trade union movement to which
 perhaps 25 percent of all workers belong. Strikes
 on such issues as wages and working conditions are
 permitted. Those judged to be politically motivated
 are illegal, but nevertheless occur from time to time
 and are not repressed by force unless they become vio-
 lent.
 
 
 285
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 High-ranking Colombian Government officials have often
 gone on record favoring investigations by international
 organizations of alleged violations of human rights.
 At the same time, they have cautioned against undue
 interference in the internal affairs of countries.
 At the invitation of President Turbay, Amnesty Interna-
 tional sent observers to the military trials of those
 accused under the Security Statute, and as noted above
 representatives of the ICRC visited prisoners in January
 and February of 1979. Nevertheless, President Turbay
 has been quoted as saying that Colombia has its own
 means of preventing human rights abuses and that an
 "international investigation" is therefore not "advis-
 able", and the Defense Minister reportedly said on
 April 22 that Colombia would not agree to charges of
 torture being investigated by an international organiza-
 tion, because "we are a nation that has come of age
 and possesses legal instruments to prevent abuses".
 Colombia was one of the first nations to ratify the
 American Convention on Human Rights.
