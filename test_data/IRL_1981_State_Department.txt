 IRELAND
 Ireland attaches great importance to the observance and
 maintenance of human rights. Individual liberties and civil
 rights are guaranteed and protected by the constitution.
 Ireland has signed the International Covenant on Economic.
 Social and Cultural Rights, and plays an active role in human
 rights questions in the United Nations. Political institutions
 are democratic, and political life is orderly. The growth of
 terrorist activities resulting from the civil unrest in
 Northern Ireland, including the murder of the British
 Ambassador and bombings of hotels, stores and pubs in Dublin in
 1976, led to the adoption of legislation to combat terrorism.
 The August 1979 murder of Earl Mountbatten by the Provisional
 Irish Republican Army prompted an Irish Government review of
 security measures but did not result in any new legislation.
 1.       Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from,
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by article 40 of the
 constitution of 1937 and respected in practice.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Constitutional protections against such conduct generally are
 observed. Amnesty International, in a 1977 report, expressed
 concern about alleged maltreatment of detainees or prisoners,
 especially where terrorism or other serious crimes may have
 been involved. In response, the government appointed a special
 committee headed by a retired judge to consider these
 allegations and make recommendations on measures to safeguard
 the rights of prisoners and detainees. Following publication
 of the committee's report in September 1978, the government
 stated that a majority of the recommendations were either
 accepted or already in effect. Recommendations accepted by the
 government included informing those persons needing to know of
 an arrest made, and permitting suspects to write their own
 statements. Recommendations already in effect included
 informing suspects of their rights, maintaining police records
 on all developments in arrest cases, and stressing in police
 training the proper treatment of persons arrested. The
 government withheld application of some committee
 recommendations pending further examination and rejected
 others. Amnesty International issued a statement in October
 1978 urging the government to reconsider several of the
 rejected proposals, such as permitting solicitors to attend
 interrogations and establishment of an independent complaints
 tribunal. While continuing to voice concern about the failure
 of the Irish government to implement fully the committee
 recommendations, the 1980 Amnesty International report on
 Ireland noted that "there was no pattern of allegations of
 police ill-treatment of suspects as in previous years.' As
 part of the working agreement which led to the establishment of
 a coalition government in June 1981, the Fine Gael Party and
 the Labor Party jointly agreed to examine some of the
 recommendations made in that report.
 There is no summary execution and no discrimination in
 treatment of prisoners due to race, religion, sex or social
 class. Conditions in places of detention generally are
 adequate, though several prisons have problems of overcrowding.

 c.   Disappearances
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities, nor does the
 Irish government condone such practices by any element of
 society.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Article 40 of the Irish constitution states that deprivation
 of personal liberty shall be only in accordance with law and
 provides for habeas corpus. In 1976, the spillover of
 terrorist activities arising from the Northern Ireland
 situation led the Irish government to declare a state of
 emergency and to allow police to detain persons up to seven
 days without charge. A party to the European Convention on
 Human Rights, Ireland availed itself of the rights of
 derogation permitted under the convention until security
 conditions improved. In October 1977, however, the Irish
 government returned to procedures in force before the state of
 emergency was declared, limiting detention without charge to a
 maximum of two days. There are no political crimes under Irish
 law and, therefore, no political status for any convicted
 persons. A number of those convicted for terrorist offenses
 are members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other
 illegal organizations.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by articles 38 and 40 of the
 constitution and respected in practice. The courts are
 independent of executive and military control. ,Article 38
 provides, however, for special criminal courts. The Offenses
 against the State Act of 1939 established such courts and
 provided that they may try persons for offenses against
 national security  Trial is by a panel of jurists, not by
 jury. The panel is uneven in number but no less than three;
 and verdict is by majority vote. Rules of evidence generally
 are similar to those of regular courts, but the statement of a
 police chief superintendent that the accused is a member of an
 illegal organization is considered evidence of such
 membership. Court sessions are usually public but may exclude
 certain persons, except genuine press representatives. Amnesty
 International has expressed concern about the operations of
 these courts and in an April 1980scase sent an observer to an
 appeal hearing of such a court. There is provision for free
 legal aid and appeal against conviction of sentence.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by article 40
 of the constitution and respected in practice. Search warrants
 are required for entry to private property and are issued by
 district justices, peace commissioners and, in cases involving
 the Offenses against the State.Act of 1939, by police
 superintendents.

 2.       Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by articles 40 and 44 of the
 constitution and respected in practice. Certain terrorist
 organizations are illegal, and membership in them is an offense
 against national security, but political parties or groups
 associated with terrorist organizations are not proscribed.
 Article 40 (6) of the constitution provides that the state will
 endeavor to ensure that organs of public opinion, while
 preserving liberty of expression, including criticism of
 government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order,
 morality or the authority of the state. The article provides
 further that *publication or utterance of blasphemous,
 seditious or indecent matter" is an offense punishable by law.
 Such censorship as exists in Ireland is directed largely toward
 materials considered to be pornographic.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country,
 foreign travel, emigration and voluntary repatriation. To the
 degree that limited resources permit, Ireland has accepted
 refugees. Ireland welcomed a number of Hungarians following
 the uprising of 1956 and in. 1979-80 received 212 Vietnamese
 refugees. In 1981 an additional 28 Vietnamese refugees, for
 the most part relatives of those admitted previously, were
 allowed to resettle in Ireland.
 C.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All Irish citizens may participate fully in an orderly,
 democratic multi-party political system. The labor movement is
 free and strong, and even government workers have the right to
 strike. A feature of Ireland's labor union movement is the.
 high degree of membership participation and free assembly of
 all members. Women play an increasingly important role in
 Irish society. Theyare represented in.growing numbers in
 positions of executive, legislative and judicial authority, as
 well as in business and.labor organizations. The current
 cabinet, formed in July 1981, again includes a woman member,
 the second woman to serve in this capacity since independence.
 Two successive governments have now included women at both the
 minister and junior minister level. In July 1980, the Irish
 Congress of Trade Unions elected a woman to its executive
 council for the first time in many years, adopted the concept
 of *positive discrimination* to enhance the leadership role of
 women in trade unionism and directed constituent unions to
 increase active participation by women in union affairs.
 Several unions have now made it a matter of policy to include
 women in their individual executive councils.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 The Irish Government has a good record regarding independent
 outside investigations of alleged human rights abuses. A 1977
 Amnesty International report and the government's response to
 it were described in Section l.b above.

 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Irish Government has a good record regarding independent
 outside investigations of alleged human rights abuses. In
 past years, Amnesty International observers have attended
 trials of their choice.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Successive Irish governments have successfully promoted
 industrialization and diversification and have raised living
 standards considerably. Over the last several months Ireland
 has been hurt by rising unemployment and a high rate of
 inflation. Nonetheless, the people of the country enjoy
 reasonably high standards of access to food, shelter, health
 care and education. These services are available without
 regard to race, religion, sex, ethnic background or political
 opinion.
 Itish per capita GNP in 1981 was an estimated $5,000. Life
 expectancy at birth in 1979 was 73 years, while the infant
 mortality rate per 1000 live births in 1978 was 16. The
 average annual population growth rate from 1970 to 1979 was
 1.1 percent. The total fertility rate in 1979 was 3.3
 percent. The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio in 1978
 was 104 (male - 105; female - 104) and the adult literacy rate
 in 1976 was 98 percent.
