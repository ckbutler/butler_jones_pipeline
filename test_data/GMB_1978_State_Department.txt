 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is one of the few functioning multi-party
 democracies in Africa. Respect for human rights is
 guaranteed in the Constitution and observed in practice.
 The Gambia is a strong backer of initiatives by the
 United States to promote the establishment of majority
 rule in southern Africa and is a firm supporter of our
 human rights policies. In Africa, in regional organi-
 zations such as the Organization for African Unity
 (OAU) and the Commonwealth, and in the United Nations,
 The Gambia has been in the forefront of those nations
 which seek to promote human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Statutory prohibitions against the use of torture are
 respected and enforced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment:
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
 are prohibited by law in The Gambia. There are no
 reports of arbitrary deprivation of life.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The right to freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprison-
 ment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are guaranteed by law and provided
 in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home

 The home is not subject to arbitrary intrusion, either
 in law or in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 In this rural, agricultural nation with a small popu-
 lation and limited resources, the needs of the poor are
 the major focus of government activity. Some progress
 has been realized in improving the rural standard of
 living. The Gambian Government is concentrating on
 increased agricultural production and seeking eventual
 food self-sufficiency through emphasis on food crops,
 better cultivation techniques, improved rural infra-
 structure and training. The Government also seeks to
 improve health services to the rural poor.
 Gambian tax laws are fair. Low income persons pay
 minimal or no tax while those with larger incomes carry
 the greater burden.
 Such corruption as exists involves minor smuggling
 across the border from Senegal and probably benefits
 the poor more than any other group. There is no
 wealthy elite in The Gambia.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The Gambia's record and practice reflecting these
 rights are excellent. All these freedoms are protected
 under law. There is no discrimination based upon race,
 ethnic origin or religion, and there are no legal
 restrictions on press freedom.
 The status of women in The Gambia is improving. Women
 hold influential positions within the Government
 including an Assistant Secretary in the Ministry of
 External Affairs.
 
 
 The Gambia has four trade unions. The largest and most
 influential is the Gambia Workers Union.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on these freedoms.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Gambia is a parliamentary democracy. Executive
 power is vested in a President who is popularly elected
 to a five-year term. The legislature is composed of
 forty members. Thirty-five are elected by universal
 suffrage for five-year terms and five are representative
 members selected by the Tribal Chiefs. The judiciary
 consists of a Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals and
 various subordinate courts. Judges are appointed by
 the Government.
 The Gambia has a genuine multi-party system. There are
 four parties: the governing Progressive People's Party
 (PPP); the United Party (UP); the National Convention
 Party (NCP) and the National Liberation Party (NLP).
 The Gambia has no army and depends on a 775-member
 police force for law enforcement and internal security.
 There is full freedom, under the law and in practice,
 to participate in the political process. The Gambia
 has open and free elections in which the four political
 parties participate. Opposing political views are
 broadcast and published freely. There is universal
 adult suffrage.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There has never been to the knowledge of the Department
 of State an allegation of human rights violations in
 The Gambia or a request by any international body to
 inspect or investigate human rights conditions in The
 Gambia. The Government probably would respond affir-
 matively to any reasonable request of this kind.

 The Gambia has always taken a forthright stand on
 human rights issues and could be expected to be sup-
 portive of such issues in the future. During the 1977.
 OAU Conference, President Jawara was noteworthy in his
 call for strict adherence to human rights principles by
 black African leaders.
