 HAITI
 President Rene Preval celebrated his second anniversary in office on February 7,
 the first time a democratically elected president reached that milestone. However,
 the country's fragile progress towards constitutional democratization remains
 threatened by the continuing political impasse that paralyzed its democratic institu-
 tions. Since the resignation of Prime Minister Rosny Smarth in June 1997, Presi-
 dent Preval has governed with a cabinet consisting of only 8 ministers instead of
 the usual 12. Parliament twice rejected the President's nomination of Herve Denis
 to the position of Prime Minister and only approved the subsequent nomination of
 Education Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis to this post in mid-December. Negotia-
 tions to form a cabinet were not complete by year's end, and were complicated by
 President Preval's announcement that he would regard the mandates of all mem-
 bers of Parliament (except for nine senators) and those of all mayors and local and
 regional council members as expiring on January 11, 1999. The Government and
 Parliament did not resolve outstanding disputes from the April 1997 local, regional,
 and legislative elections. Although there has been some improvement in the theo-
 retically independent judiciary, it is still largely weak and corrupt.
 The military was disbanded in January 1995. At that time, the Government es-
 tablished the Haitian National Police (HNP), which continues to gain experience
 and to benefit from training. During the period of political uncertainty in late 1998
 foliowing the disagreement between the President and legislators over the formation
 of a cabinet and continuation of the Parliament, the HNP maintained political neu-
 trality and played a crucial role in preserving internal calm. However, the HNP still
 grappled with problems of corruption and human rights abusers within its ranks.
 Allegations of corruption, incompetence, and narcotics trafficking at all levels of the
 force negatively affected morale. The United Nations Police Mission in Haiti
 (MIPONUH) is composed of 290 civilian police officers from 11 countries; they ad-
 vise and train the HNP and seek to increase its level of professionalism. On Novem-
 ber 30, the U.N. Security Councl extended MIPONUH-I's mandate to November 30,
 1999. The HNP has a variety of specialized units, including a crisis response unit,
 a crowd control unit, a presidential and palace security unit, and a Special Inves-
 tigative Unit (SIUl). The Sill was formed to investigate high-profile political killings,
 but is ill-equipped, inexperienced, and has made limited progress on its cases. Al-
 though the HNP took over administration of the country's prisons in 1997, it ap-
 pears that the prison system retains much of its previous autonomy. The 94-officer
 Coast Guard is also a component of the HNP and is being trained by foreign Coast
 Guard personnel. In addition to the centralized HNP forces, each of the nine admin-
 
 
 istrative regions has its own crowd control force. Several mayors also maintained
 unofficial local law enforcement bodies to serve as municipal police. These groups
 lack legal standing, authority to carry weapons, or legitimate powers of arrest. Some
 members of local government councils (CASEC's) also exercise arrest authority with-
 out legal sanction. Members of the HNP, the other security forces, and the informal
 municipal police committed serious human rights abuses.
 Haiti is an extremely poor country, with a per capita annual income of about
 $500. This figure does not fully include significant unrecorded transfers from the es-
 timated 1 million Haitians living abroad, as well as income from informal sector ac-
 tivities that constitute an estimated 70 percent of actual economic activity. The
 country has a market-based economy with state enterprises controlling tele-
 communications and utilities. A formal privatization strategy is being implemented
 slowly for nine parastatal enterprises. About two-thirds of the population work in
 subsistence agriculture, earn less than the average income, and live in extreme pov-
 erty. A small, traditional elite controls much of the country's wealth. A small part
 of the urban labor force works in the industrial and assembly sectors, with an equal
 number in government or service sector employment. Assembled goods, textiles,
 leather goods, handicrafts, and electronics are a major source of export revenue and
 employment. Other important exports are mangoes and coffee. The Government re-
 lies heavily on international financial assistance.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, a
 number of serious abuses occurred. The police committed extrajudicial killings, al-
 though fewer than in previous years, and were also responsible for mistreatment of
 detainees, including repeated, severe beatings and incidents of torture. Persons re-
 sponsible for human rights abuses rarely are punished. Poor prison conditions and
 arbitrary arrest and detention remained problems. Officials made limited progress
 in addressing the problem of lengthy and unauthorized pretrial detention. The au-
 thorities continued to detain illegally several persons arrested in 1996 who were
 members of the political opposition. The oyerburdened and inadequate judicial sys-
 tem remained incapable of processing detainees in accordance with the law, an( a
 large proportion of crimes, including some that may have had political motivations,
 remain unsolved. The judiciary remained weak and corrupt. The judicial docket re-
 mained clogged, and the courts were unable to ensure fair and expeditious trials.
 There were numerous reports that the authorities infringed upon citizens' privacy
 rights, and of illegal searches and arrests without warrants. Societal discrimination
 against women, violence against women, and abuse of children remain problems.
 The widespread practice of rural families sending young children to the larger cities
 to work as unpaid domestics (restaveks) is also still a problem. Child labor persists.
 Vigilante activity, including killings, remained a common alternative to formal judi-
 cial processes.
 The Governmenfs limited effort to redress the legacy of human rights abuse from
 the 1991-94 period largely has failed. Important cases, such as those from the 1994
 Raboteau killings, languish- in the courts. Judicial officials failed to begin processing
 many other complaints involving human rights abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The police were responsible for
 extrajudicial killings, according to the UN-OAS International Civilian Mission (ICM)
 and the HNP inspector general's office, but the number was significantly lower than
 in previous years. According to statistics gathered by the ICM, the police killed 31
 persons in 1998, compared with 53 in 1997 and 59 in 1996. Reports of deaths result-
 ing from excessive use of force dropped from 20 in 1997 to 11 in 1998. Based on
 evidence gathered by international organizations and nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's), these killings generally were not political in character; however,
 many resulted from excessive use of force and a lack of professionalism on the part
 of the police.
 In January police shot two youths in connection with antigang operations in the
 Port au Prince slum of Cite Soleil, and a third was found shot after last being seen
 as he was placed under arrest. Also in January, police serving summonses shot and
 wounded a 17-year-old boy in St. Marc, and a policeman near Les Cayes shot and
 wounded a man during a fight. In March in Cite Solefl, an employee of the Delmas
 mayor's office was found shot in the head after being questioned by police about sto-
 len motorcycles. In late March, police on patrol in Port an Prince shot and killed
 the driver of a car that had collided with theirs.
 Throughout the year, there were numerous instances of suspects killed in
 shootouts with police. The circumstances of some of these deaths indicated use of
 
 
 excessive force on the part of the HNP and other police officers. For example, on
 February 2, an off-duty member of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team
 in Port au Prince saw a suspected thief and drew his gun and fired, killing the sus-
 pect and wounding a bystander. On April 13, a national park policeman reportedly
 beat a man to death after the policeman had threatened him in connection with the
 illegal cutting of trees. On May 4, an officer from the HNP's specialized crowd con-
 trol unit (CIMO) in Petionville called for assistance after armed men tried to break
 into his home; when police arrived, the officer reported finding two bodies in a near-
 by ravine. The incident was under investigation at year's end.
 In July the Haitian Platform of Human Rights Organizations stated that 154
 human rights violations were committed by police during June, mostly by the HNP
 and justices of the peace. On August 25, poice shot and killed 16-year-old Johnson
 Mercius, whom they had pulled over early that morning. The police claimed that
 he refused orders to raise his hands, and that he made a threatening gesture. Wit-
 nesses asserted that he was shot without provocation. His family demanded an au-
 topsy to verify the allegation that Mercius had been shot in the back, but the body
 disappeared from the hospital morgue.
 Other extrajudicial killings occurred when suspects were already in police cus-
 tody. For example, Dieudonne Pierre died on May 11 at the doors of Cap Haitien
 prison from injuries sustained during beatings administered by police the previous
 night. Although in good condition at the time of his arrest on May 10, he could
 hardly speak or stand at the time of his court appearance the next day. Police then
 took him to the prison, where he was refused admittance due to his poor physical
 condition. He was dumped by the door of the prison registry, where he died. His
 body remained there when ICM officials visited the prison on May 15. The ICM
 voiced concerns about police brutality in its June report. It was especially concerned
 with the number of reports of brutality at the Ouanaminthe police station and with
 reports of retaliation against detainees who dealt with the ICM.
 One inmate reportedly died in the Jeremie prison as a result of beatings while
 in custody. At least one death in prison was attributed to inadequate health care
 (see Section 1.c.).
 Some mayors control unofficial security forces that committed abuses. In Port au
 Prince, a member of Delmas Vice Mayor Ernst Erilus' security force shot and killed
 a man on March 27. The mayor allegedly removed the body before the requisite
 legal procedures had been performed.
 In what may have been a political killing, unknown assailants shot and killed Fa-
 ther Jean Pierre Louis, an outspoken opponent of the 1991-94 military regime, on
 August 3 in the Bizoton area of Port au Prince. Although robbery has not been ruled
 out, Father Pierre Louis' long history of social activism and speaking out on con-
 troversial issues led many persons to believe that his murder was politically moti-
 vated. At year's end, the authorities had arrested three suspects, and the investiga-
 tion continued.
 Vigilante justice remains a widespread problem, especially in rural areas. Angry
 mobs, composed of persons who lack faith in the ability of the police and the courts
 to bring criminals to justice, attack and often kill suspected thieves, bandits, mur-
 derers, rapists, and sorcerers, usually by stoning, beating, or burning. A survey of
 police records and media reports indicated that approximately 100 deaths resulted
 from such incidents during the first half of the year. However, on occasion, timely
 police intervention prevented lynchings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punzshment.-
 The 1987 Constitution prohibits the use of unnecessary force or restraint, psycho-
 logical pressure, or brutality by the security forces; however, members of the secu-
 rity forces frequently violate these provisions. Police officers often use excessive-
 and sometimes deadly-force in making arrests or controlling demonstrations and
 rarely are punished for such acts. Police frequently beat suspects. There were spo-
 radic instances of torture and other forms of abuse. In at least one instance, police
 beatings resulted in death (see Section l.a.).
 The ICM found that police mistreatment of suspects, at both the time of arrest
 and during detention, remained rpe-vasive in all parts of the country. Beating with
 fists, sticks, and belts is by far the most common form of abuse. However, the ICM
 documented other isolated forms of mistreatment, including crushing fingers with
 pliers, burning with cigarettes, and kalot marassa (severe boxing of the ears, which
 can result in eardrum damage). The ICM also was concerned about the practice,
 noted in particular in Cap Haitien, of blindfolding suspects during interrogation. Po-
 lice rarely are prosecuted for the abuse of detainees.
 During the year, there were reports of the use of excessive force by members of
 the HNP, including the CIMO. In January CIMO members arrested and beat sev-
 
 
 eral youths after a policeman allegedly was killed by a gang. In March several dis-
 putes over land in the area around Milot turned violent, resulting in the burning
 of fields, the destruction of property, and the occupation of land. In response, the
 HNP sent SWAT and CIMO-units to the area to restore order. On March 19, mem-
 Vers of the CIMO reportedly entered a peasant-run radio station in Milot, allegedly
 looking for persons suspected in the sabotage of a local factory. After entering the
 radio station late at night, CIMO members ransacked it and shot and injured the
 radio station janitor, who was the only occupant at the time. The Minister of Justice
 later ordered that the radio station be repaired and that an investigation into the
 incident be opened.
 In early February, an extrajudicial killing in the town of Mirebelais led to a mas-
 sive- police deployment, which was accompanied by allegations of human rights vio-
 lations. The episode began on February 5, when local police arrested two members
 of an organization known as Mete Lod Nan Dezod (MLND, or "Putting Order Into
 Disorder") after an altercation about a traffic citation. After the arrest, a crowd of
 MLND members formed outside the police commissariat. Shots were fired, allegedly
 by the police, killing a bystander and wounding an MLND member. Soon after, a
 crowd that blamed police for the death of the bystander stormed the police com-
 missariat, killed police commissioner Ricelin Dorneus, and burned his body. The
 crowd then proceeded to ransack the police station, set fire to vehicles, and steal
 radios and weapons. The crowd then went to Mirebelais prison, where it freed all
 78 inmates. Later that evening, police reinforcements in the form of SWAT and
 CIMO units arrived from Hinche, the provincial capital, and from Port au Prince
 to restore order.
 The ICM subsequently received complaints of human rights violations in connec-
 tion with the authorities' attempts to arrest those responsible for the lynching of
 Dorneus. There were reports of 30 to 40 warrantless arrests in connection with the
 incident, mostly of MLND members. Many were beaten either upon being arrested
 or while in custody at the Mirebelais -police station; three persons required hos-
 pitalization due to severe beatings they received in custody. All but four of the de-
 tainees were released later. Tensions in the area reportedly were running high be-
 tween the MLND, which supports Fanmi Lavalas (FL), and the Mourman Peyizan
 Papaye (MPP or Papaye Peasant Movement) prior to the incident. Investigations
 into the incident were opened by the HNP, the Port au Prince judicial police, the
 Senate, and the permanent Human Rights Committee of the Chamber of Deputies.
 On April 1, a parliamentary committee released a report on the conduct of CIMO
 and other police units in Mirebelais and Milot during the events of early February
 and March. The report-accused the police of illegal arrests, arresting family mem-
 bers of wanted persons when the persons themselves could not be found, arresting
 persons for their apparent political affiliations, torture, and repression. It also rec-
 ommended a redefinition of the CIMO's functions.
 On April 5, members of the CIMO broke into, ransacked, and seriously damaged
 a women's clinic in Port au Prince, alleging that weapons were hidden there. No
 weapons were found. The Government later pledged to repair the damage to the
 clinic. On April 15, two SWAT team members threatened a judge in Petionville with
 their guns in an attempt- to free a friend who was on trial. The two were detained
 in a National Penitentiary Administration (APENA) facility in Petionville. On No-
 vember 18, armed men dressed in black uniforms resembling those of CIMO mem-
 bers entered a moneychanging store in Port au Prince and stole money; on Novem-
 ber 21, approximately 12 armed men also dressed in uniforms similar to those of
 CIMO members entered a brasserie in Plaine on the pretext of conducting a search
 for illegal drugs and stole money from the owners. The head of the CIMO denies
 allegations that men under his command are -conducting such activities, and it is
 unclear whether these two incidents were carried out by CIMO members, former
 CIMO members, or by persons who duplicated CIMO uniforms.
 The HNP Director General and the State Secretary for Public Security cooperated
 with the ICM. In several instances where the ICM presented the HNP leadership
 with credible accounts of police abuses, improvements were noted as a result. The
 HNP's Inspector General's office (IG) has a mandate to investigate human rights
 complaints. During the first half of the year, the IG received 50 reports of human
 rights violations and completed investigations in 33 cases. However, many other
 human rights violations are neither reported nor acted upon by he HNP.
 There continued to be sporadic instances of brutality on the part of local officials
 exercising unauthorized law enforcement functions. Especially in rural areas, the
 ICM has documented brutality by members and agents of the local government
 councils (CASEC's), who tend to assume an illegal law enforcement role in the ab-
 sence of a regular police presence. For example, in the Procy section of Carrefour
 
 
 (on the outskirts of Port au Prince), the bodyguard of a CASEC member shot a man
 in the mouth while arresting him on January 14.
 Unofficial security forces controlled by mayors also committed human rights
 abuses. On August 19, a man attending a concert in a public park in Port au Prince
 became involved in an argument with members of the security detail for the Delmas
 mayor; he was followed home and shot in the leg during a gunfight near his home.
 In early February, State Secretary for Public Security Robert Manuel wrote the
 mayors of Port au Prince, Delmas, and Croix des Bouquets, instructing them to dis-
 arm their unofficial security forces and to turn their weapons over to the HNP by
 February 6. The ICM reported limited compliance with this request.
 Prison conditions remained poor. Prisoners and detainees, held in overcrowded
 and inadequate facilities, continued to suffer from inadequate basic hygiene, poor
 quality health care, and 24-hour confinement to cells in some facilities. Late in the
 year, the 17 prisons held 3,494 inmates, a slight increase over 1997, which resulted
 in considerable overcrowding.
 Fort National prison in Port au Prince is the only prison facility expressly for
 women and juveniles. In other prison facilities, women are housed in cells separate
 from the men. However, overcrowding often prevents strict separation of juveniles
 from adults, convicts from those in pretrial detention, or violent from nonviolent
 prisoners.
 ICM statistics indicated a significant increase in reports of ill treatment by prison
 guards in 1998. It received 191 such reports, compared with 41 in 1997 and 29 in
 1996. One reason for the increase was two separate reports of beatings of large
 groups on inmates in connection with escape attempts at Carrefour and St. Marc
 prisons. In April a guard was arrested after an ICM investigation, conducted with
 the full cooperation of the APENA authorities, found strong evidence that an inmate
 in the Jeremie prison died as a result of multiple beatings in custody. The 1CM has
 expressed concern that allegations of the abuse of detainees by prison officials are
 not dealt with quickly and seriously. The mission stated in a July 1997 report that
 it had encountered only two instances in which prison guards were disciplined for
 the mistreatment of prisoners. On November 13, HNP Director General Pierre
 Denize fired Marceau Jean Lohier, Director of the National Penitentiary, for his al-
 leged role in beatings that took place at Carrefour jail following an escape by in-
 mates on April 29. Lohier fled the country after publicly contending that he really
 was fired for political reasons.
 Prisoners nationwide generally received one or two meals per day, often supple-
 mented with food brought by family members. The authorities were unable to keep
 prison clinics, funded by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), ade-
 quately stocked with medicines and other health care supplies. At least one prison
 death was attributed to inadequate health care.
 Persons detained in politically sensitive cases often were kept in police station
 holding cells, rather than in regular prison facilities. These and other holding cell
 detainees depended largely on their families for food and medicine. In some cases,
 police officers used their personal funds to buy food for such persons.
 The authorities freely permitted the ICRC, the Haitian Red Cross, the ICM, and
 other human rights groups to enter prisons and police stations, to monitor condi-
 tions, and to assist prisoners with medical care, food, and legal aid.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The security forces continued to use arbi-
 trary arrest and detention. The Constitution stipulates that a person may be ar-
 rested only if apprehended during the commission of a crime, or if a judicial warrant
 has been issued. Judicial warrants cannot be executed between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00
 a.m., and the authorities must bring the detainee before a judge within 48 hours
 of arrest In practice, the authorities frequently ignored these provisions. In one
 case, a man arrested on a traffic charge was detained for 5 days without a warrant
 and without seeing a judge or a lawyer. He was released only when his family pro-
 vided a used car to the police station. After the February disorders in Mirebalais,
 there were many cases of arrests made without warrants (see Section 1.c.).
 The HNP frequently detained suspects well beyond the 48 hours in which the au-
 thorities must demonstrate that there is a legal basis for the arrest. Despite this
 practice, respect for the 48-hour rule generally increased.
 Arbitrary arrests by those lacking legal arrest authority, including some elements
 of the security forces, quasi-official forces, and local government councils also oc-
 curred sporadically. Detainees who had never seen a judge or whose cases stagnated
 in the judicial system continued to crowd the prisons nationwide. An estimated 80
 percent of the 3,500 prison inmates are being subjected to illegal or prolonged deten-
 tion. To address this problem, the Ministry of Justice, in cooperation with prison
 authorities, established the Office to Control Preventive Detention (BUCODEP) to
 accelerate review and processing of these cases by improving judges' access to the
 
 
 662
 detainees. The BUCODEP facilitated the review of 1,198 cases, resulting in the re-
 lease of 477 prisoners and the referral of 160 detainees to the courts.
 The authorities have been known to use the criminal justice system to retaliate
 against politically undesirable persons and-have detained such persons in open defi-
 ance of court orders for their release. Persons detained in this manner also may be
 involved in private disputes with influential political figures. As of year's end, the
 ICM was tracking 67 cases in which due process was not followed or persons appar-
 ently were detained for political reasons. During the year, the authorities failed to
 execute release orders issued by judges in at least seven high-profile and politically
 sensitive cases.
 The ICM registered concern regarding irregularities in the authorities' handling
 of the case of former general Claude Raymond, who was arrested in 1996 with two
 others on charges of plotting a coup and threatening the security of the State. Ray-
 mond and his two companions were held in pretrial detention until November 10,
 at which time they were released. While the authorities freed Raymond's two com-
 panions, they immediately rearrested him on charges related to the 1987 Port au
 Prince election day massacre. On March 19, the authorities arrested lawyer Osner
 Fevry in Petionville on charges related to a land dispute. On March 25, a judicial
 release order for Fevry was issued. He remained in custody until November, when,
 as in the case of Raymond, he was released and rearrested on new charges. Fevry
 was released and set free on December 15. Although technically legal, the authori-
 ties' handling of the Raymond and Fevry cases permitted continued detention of two
 persons already detained for months contrary to court rulings, an example of the
 way in which the judicial system remains subject to manipulation by the executive
 in politically sensitive cases.
 The Government also has detained several other political opponents and former
 leading members of the military, including Remy Lucas, Claude Schneider, Evans
 Francois (the brother of former Port au Prince police chief Michel Francois), Phanel
 Dieu, Steve Conserve, and Patrick Moise, on vague charges of plotting against the
 state. None of these individuals were brought to trial. Moise and Conserve were
 being held in contravention of judges' orders for their release. The authorities re-
 leased Schneider and Dieu on November 10.
 The Constitution prohibits involuntary exile of citizens, and there were no reports
 of its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but the judiciary is not independent in practice. Years of rampant corruption
 and governmental neglect have left the judicial system poorly organized and nearly
 moribund. The Constitution sets varying periods of tenure for judges above the level
 of justice of the peace. In practice, however, the Ministry of Justice exercises admin-
 istrative oversight of the judiciary, prosecutors, and court staff. The Ministry of Jus-
 tice can remove justices of the peace and occasionally dismisses judges above this
 level as well.
 At the lowest level of the justice system, the justices of the peace issue warrants,
 adjudicate minor infractions, take depositions, and refer cases to prosecutors or
 higher judicial officials. Investigating magistrates and public prosecutors cooperate
 in the development of more serious cases, which are tried by the judges of the first
 instance courts. Appeals court judges hear cases referred from the first instance
 courts, and the Supreme Court deals with questions of procedure and constitutional-
 ity.
 The judicial apparatus follows a civil law system based on the Napoleonic Code;
 the Criminal Code dates from 1832, although it has been amended on occasion. The
 Constitution provides for the right to a fair public trial, but this right was widely
 abridged in practice. The Constitution also expressly denies police and judicial au-
 thorities the right to interrogate persons charged with a crime unless the suspect
 either has legal counsel, has a chosen representative present, or waives this right.
 While trials are public, most accused persons cannot afford legal counsel for interro-
 gation or trial, and the law does not require that the Government provide legal rep-
 resentation. Despite the efforts of local human rights groups and the international
 community to provide legal aid, many interrogations without counsel continued to
 occur. However, during actual trials, most defendants had access to counsel. Defend-
 ants enjoy a presumption of innocence and the right to be present at trial, to con-
 front witnesses against them, and to present witnesses and evidence in their own
 behalf. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 A shortage of adequately trained judges and prosecutors, among other systemic
 problems, created a huge backlog of criminal cases, with many detainees waiting
 years in pretrial detention for a court date. The serious problem of case backlogs
 is related to the general shortage of qualified judges, prosecutors, and justices of the
 peace, and to inadequate resources and work habits at those levels. In some regions,
 
 
 663
 there are not enough judges to hear cases, and the judges lack adequate resources
 to perform their duties, such as office space, legal reference texts, and supplies. Pro-
 fessional competence sometimes is lacking as well. In at least one case, a lawyer
 complained about a judge's inability to draft basic legal documents. If an accused
 person ultimately is trie  d found innocent, there is no redress against the Gov-
 ernment for time served in detention. The Code of Criminal Procedure does not
 clearly assign responsibility to investigate crimes and divides the authority to pur-
 sue cases among police, justices of the peace, prosecutors, and investigating mag-
 istrates. The code provides for 2 criminal court sessions per year in each of the 15
 first-instance jurisdictions, each session generally lasting 2 weeks, to try all major
 crimes, primarily murder, requiring a jury trial.
 Although the judicial system remains in urgent need of reform, government co-
 operation with international donors resulted in some positive developments in this
 area. International donors assisted the Justice Ministry with its effort to provide
 training to sitting magistrates, in order to improve the administration of the public
 prosecutors' offices, to improve documentation and case presentation, to strengthen
 judicial supervision, and to establish prison registries. During the year, the Justice
 Ministry also trained a corps of 60 new magistrates (all of whom are law school
 graduates). In August the Government enacted a law on judicial reform, but the leg-
 islation lacked specific measures to implement such reform.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although the Government continued
 to hold some political opponents on charges of threatening state security (see Sec-
 tion l.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 However, police and members of other security forces conducted illegal, warrantless
 searches (also see Section 1.c.). Members of quasi-official forces also conducted ille-
 gal searches and seizures of property. The police reportedly arrested family mem-
 ers of wanted persons when the suspects themselves could not be found (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights. The press en-
 ergetically exercises this freedom. Print and electronic media'from opposite ends of
 the political spectrum often criticize the Government.   a
 With a literacy rate of only about 20 percent, broadcast media, especially Creole-
 language radio, have an unusual importance, and some 40 radio stations operate in
 the capital alone. Uncensored foreign satellite television is available. Broadcast
 media tend to criticize the Government less than the press but freely express a wide
 range of political viewpoints.
 However, one major radio station known for its opposition to the Government may
 have been the target of politically motivated bureaucratic harassment during the
 year. The station claimed to have received complaints about its broadcasts from gov-
 ernment authorities on several occasions coupled with threats to terminate the sat-
 ellit uplink it uses to transmit to affiliates in the provinces. The national telephone
 corpany terminated the station's satellite service in August. Despite a court order
 invalidating the grounds for termination, the telephone company did not rescind its
 instructions to the commercial supplier to block the station's satellite service. How-
 ever, the supplier resumed satellite service in October. The Ministry of Public
 Works supported the telephone company and imposed a moratorium on use of sat-
 ellite uplinks pending an act of Parliament.
 Foreign journalists generally circulate without hindrance.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the authorities generally respect this right in practice.
 Popular organizations, including several opposed to the Government or its policies,
 formed and held demonstrations.
 Political parties across the spectrum generally were able to meet and to recruit
 members. However, on July 8 in St. Marc, members of Fanmi Lavalas disrupted and
 forced the cancellation of a multiparty political roundtable sponsored by the Inter-
 national Republican Institute (IRI). In late July, the opposition Movement for Na-
 tional Development (MDN) announced cancellation of its party congress scheduled
 for August, citing the refusal of police authorities to ensure security for the event.
 In December there were reports of more threats against IRI consultants and anti-
 IRI demonstrations in Port au Prince.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice.
 
 
 664
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right to practice all re-
 ligions and faiths, provided-that such practice does not disturb law and order, and
 the Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government respects the right of freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation.  �
 An unknown number of undocumented migrants put to sea seeking better eco-
 nomic opportunities in other countries. The Government operated, with inter-
 national support, a national migration office to assist citizens involuntarily repatri-
 ated from other countries, notably from the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas.
 The Government has no policy regarding foreign nationals seeking refuge or asy-
 lum from third countries. The question of provision of first asylum did not arise.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to countries where they feared
 persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for regular elections for local and parliamentary offices
 and for the presidency, and voters elected President Rene Preval in late 1995 in an
 election regarded by the international community as free and -fair. The Parliament,
 most of whose members were chosen in 1995 in elections that were administratively
 flawed but free and fair, continued to operate independently of the executive branch
 through the end of the year.
 The country remained in a state of political paralysis that originated in a split
 within the ruling Lavalas party, which pitted the Fanmi Lavalas, led by former
 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, against the Organisation du Peuple en Lutte
 (OPL-formerly the Organisation Politique Lavalas). The divisions initially arose
 over economic policy and deepened over the outcome of the 1997 legislative, re-
 gional, and local elections, which led to the resignation of Prime Minister Rosny
 Smarth in June 1997. Parliament failed to approve President Preval's first two
 nominees to replace Smarth and only approved his third nominee, Jacques Edouard
 Alexis, to the post in mid-December. However, the executive and legislative
 branches did not agree on a permanent cabinet or plan of government.
 The continued impasse between the President and the Parliament prevented the
 holding of elections originally scheduled for November to replace mayors, local and
 regional council members, the members of the House of Deputies, and one-third of
 the Senate, all of whose terms were due to end January 11, 1999, under provisions
 of a 1995 electoral law. In November the Parliament passed a resblution to extend
 its mandate until October 1999 and bring parliamentary terms into line with the
 Constitution. However, President Preval announced that he would not recognize the
 extension. President Preval and the political parties began discussions to resolve the
 institutional crisis that resulted from  this disagreement. Negotiations focused,
 among other issues, on the formulation of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP)
 that would organize the delayed elections.
 There was little progress towards resolving questions surrounding April 1997 leg-
 islative, regional, and local elections. At the polls, an OAS observer mission found
 numerous irregularities and instances of fraud. A majority of Parliament contested
 the results, citing deficiencies and irregularities in the electoral process. Over the
 objections of the parliamentary majority, the Ministry of Interior provided funds for
 the local and regional assemblies to begin meeting in July. Although in a disputed
 decision two of the contested senate seats were awarded to the FL, none of the total
 of nine seats actually were filled. A report on the 1997 elections was prepared by
 a presidential commission, but its findings were not made public. There was discus-
 sion that the next CEP would resolve the dispute, in addition to its other respon-
 sibilities.
 There are no legal impediments -to women's participation in politics or govern-
 ment, but they are underrepresented. The election law provides that the deposit re-
 ured of female candidates for political office is half that required of male can-
 ddates, if a recognized party sponsors them. In the recent past, Haiti has had a
 female president, prime minister, foreign minister, and finance minister. However,
 the low- status of women limits their participation in government and politics. Of
 the 80 sitting members of the Chamber of Deputies (3 seats are vacant), 3 are
 women. The Senate has no female members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 .vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 commenting on human rights cases. The Government tolerates their views but rare-
 
 
 665
 ly is responsive to their recommendations. The exception is the HNP Inspector Gen-
 eral's office, which opened a number of investigations at the request of human
 rights groups. About a dozen local human rights groups monitor conditions in the
 country, with some working on civic education and egal aid as well.
 The National Coalition for Haitian Rights, an international human rights organi-
 zation, maintained a permanent presence. Representatives of other international
 human rights organizations visited freely during the year. The ICRC was active
 throughout the year, particularly in prison renovation and assistance to prisoners.
 In August the leader of the Hatin Platform of Human Rights Organizations,
 Chenet Jean-Baptiste, reported receiving politicall motivated death threats follow-
 ing statements he made concerning the murder o Father Pierre Louis (see Section
 The Office of the Protector of Citizens, an autonomous, ombudsman-like office es-
 tablished by the 1987 Constitution, began operating. However, the office's effective-
 ness remained limited by a lack of resources, severe budget constraints, and inexpe-
 rience. The ICM provided consultants to the office to assist in developing a work
 plan and budget and assist in preparing reports.
 Parliamentary committees investigated reports of abuses by security forces in
 Mirebelais and Milot following large-scale disturbances in those areas. These inves-
 tigations were indicative of the developing capacity of the Parliament to monitor the
 human rights situation in the country.
 The UN/OAS International Civilian Mission continued to play a vital and success-
 ful role in monitoring the human rights situation and in promoting adherence to
 human rights norms by the authorities. The ICM investigated all reports of human
 rights violations, issued periodic reports and press releases, conducted civic edu-
 cation, and trained local human rights groups. The ICM also worked with the Gov-
 ernment to develop its institutional capacity to prevent and provide redress for
 human rights abuses. Its mandate expired on December 31. In December the U.N.
 General Assembly extended the U.N. component of the ICM until December 31,
 1999.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1987 Constitution does not specifically prohibit discrimination on the grounds
 of race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. It does provide for equal
 working conditions regardiess of sex, beliefs, or marital status. However, there is
 no effective governmental mechanism to administer or to enforce these provisions.
 Women.-According to women's rights groups, rape and other violence against
 women is common, both within and outside of marriage. A recent study by the Hai-
 tian Center for Research and Action for the Promotion of Women documented wide-
 spread rape and violence agaist women. The report also found that many women
 do not report these forms of abuse due to fear, shame, or lack of confidence in judi-
 cial remedies. A recent survey by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) of
 violence agaist women found that 37 percent of women reported being victims of
 sexual violence or reported knowing a woman who had been; another 33 percent re-
 ported being victims of other types of physical abuse. The law provides penalties for
 these crimes, but the authorities do not enforce these provisions adequately. The
 law excuses a husband if he murders his wife or her lover upon catching them in
 the act of adultery in the home; but a wife who kills her husband upon discovering
 him in the act of adultery is not excused. The National Commission of Truth and
 Justice, formed after the 1991-94 period of military rule, recommended several im-
 provements to existing laws concerning the rape and abuse of women, including the
 amendment of the Penal Code to define rape, to criminalize violence within the fam-
 ily, and to eliminate the distinction between virgins and nonvirgins in rape cases.
 However, Parliament has not enacted any of these proposed changes. There are no
 government-sponsored programs for victims of violence.
 On May 12, 20 women's organizations met with parliamentarians and proposed
 changes to laws that they considered discriminatory. The changes proposed include
 the decriminalization of adultery, the classification of rape as a crime against the
 person rather than as a crime against honor, and the extension of the Labor Code
 to cover domestic work. They also proposed a law on violence against women and
 changes to the family code. Sexual harassment of female workers in the assembly
 sector is a problem (see Section 6.b.).
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs is charged with promoting and defending the
 rights of women and ensuring that they attain an equal statas in society, but it did
 little in this regard.
 Women generally have the same legal status as men. However, women do not
 enjoy thae ae social and economic status as men. In some social strata, tradition
 
 
 limits women's roles. Peasant women, often the breadwinners for their families, re-
 main largely in the traditional occupations of farming, marketing, and domestic
 labor. Very poor urban women, who head their families and serve as their economic
 support, also often find their employment opportunities limited to traditional roles
 in domestic labor and marketing. Female employees in private industry or service
 jobs, including government jobs, seldom are promoted to supervisory positions. Laws
 governing child support recognize the widespread practice of multiple-father families
 but rarely are enforced. However, well-educated women have occupied prominent
 positions in both the private and public sector in recent years. Women's rights
 groups are small and localized, and receive little publicity.
 Children.-The Governments programs do not promote or defend children's rights
 effectively. Government health care and education programs for children are inad-
 equate or nonexistent. Primary education is supposed to be free and compulsory, but
 there are not enough schools to accommodate all children, especially in rural areas.
 Poorer families sometimes ration education money to pay school fees for male chil-
 dren only.
 Rural families continued to send young children to serve as unpaid domestic labor
 for more affluent city dwellers, a practice cited by a 1991 U.N. study as an example
 of slavery in the 20th century. UNICEF estimated that 250,000 to 300,000 children,
 85 percent of them girls, may be victims of this practice, called "restavek" (which
 means "lives with" in Creole). It is primarily lower middle and lower class families
 who use restavek children, as the more well-to-do prefer paid adult employees. The
 Ministry of Social Affairs believes that many employers compel the children to work
 long hours, provide them with little nourishment, and frequently beat and phys-
 ically, emotionally, and sometimes sexually abuse them. The law requires that
 restaveks 15 years of age and older be paid "not less than one half the amount pay-
 able to a hired servant to performing similar work", in addition to room and board.
 To avoid this obligation, many if not most restaveks are kicked out of the employer's
 home before reaching the age of 15.
 Most local human rights groups do not report on the plight of restavek children
 as an abuse or seek to improve their situation. The Ministry of Social Affairs be-
 lieves that it can do little to stop this practice, regarding it as economically moti-
 vated; the Ministry assigned five monitors to oversee the welfare of restavek chil-
 dren. Society holds such children in little regard, and the poor state of the economy
 worsened their situation. Port au Prince's large population of street children in-
 cludes many restaveks who have been kicked out or are runaways.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that disabled persons shall
 have the means to ensure their autonomy, education, and independence. However,
 there is no legislation to implement these constitutional provisions or to mandate
 the provision of access to buildings for the disabled. Although they do not face overt
 mistreatment, given the severe poverty in which most Haitians live, those with dis-
 abilities face a particularly harsh existence.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Some 99 percent of Haitians are descend-
 ants, in whole or in part, of African slaves who won their war of independence from
 France in 1804. The remaining population is of European, Middle Eastern, North
 American, or Latin American origin. The law makes no distinction based on race.
 Longstanding social and political animosities often are tied to cultural identification,
 skin color, and overlapping issues of class in this starkly inegalitarian society. Some
 of these animosities date back to- before-Haiti's revolutionary period.
 The Government recognizes two official languages: Creole, which is spoken by vir-
 tually all Haitians; and French, which is spoken by about 20 percent of the popu-
 lation, including the economic elite. The inability to communicate in French has
 long limited the political and economic opportunities available to the majority of the
 population. The Government prepares most documents only in French, and judges
 conduct most legal proceedings exclusively in French. However, Creole was the lan-
 guage chosen for parliamentary debate in the lower house.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide for the
 right of association and provide workers, including those in the public sector, with
 the right to form and to join unions Without prior government authorization. The
 law protects union activities and prohibits a closed shop. The law also requires a
 union, which must have a minimum of 10 members, to register with the Social Af-
 fairs Ministry within 60 days of its formation.
 Six princpal labor federations represent about 5 percent of the total labor force,
 including about 2 to 3 percent of labor in the industrial sector. Unions are independ-
 ent of the Government and political parties.
 
 
 667
 On January 12-13, public prosecutors and justices of the peace in many towns
 around the country began a strike, demanding higher pay and better working condi-
 tions. Judges joined the strike on January 19. The strike was lifted on January 26.
 On March 30, in response to a directive from the HNP command that police be re-
 quired to increase their hours of work from 8 to 12 hours per day, 6 days per week,
 with no additional pay, some police in Port au Prince and other towns declared a
 work stoppage. The command declared the job action illegal and threatened sanc-
 tions; at least five policemen were suspended in Port au Prince and the work stop-
 page ended on April 3.
 Each of the principal labor federations maintained some fraternal relations with
 various international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code protects
 trade union organizing activities and stipulates fines for those who interfere with
 this right. Unions were generally free to pursue their goals, although the Govern-
 ment made little effort to enforce the law. Union leaders assert that some employers
 in the private industrial sector dismiss individuals who participate in union organiz-
 ing activities. Organized labor activity was concentrated in the Port au Prince area,
 in state enterprises, the civil service, and the assembly sector. The high unemploy-
 ment rate and antiunion sentiment among some factory workers limited the success
 of union organizing efforts.
 Collective bargaining continued to be nonexistent, and employers set wages uni-
 laterally. The Labor Code does not distinguish between industries producing for the
 local market and those producing for export. Employees in the export-oriented as-
 sembly sector enjoyed better-than-average wages and benefits. Female workers in
 the assembly sector report that some employers sexually harass female workers
 with impunity. Women also assert that, while the vast majority of assembly sector
 workers are female, virtually all the supervisors are men.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and applies equally to minors. Such labor is not known to occur
 among adults. However, the Government failed to enforce this law for children, who
 continued to be subjected to forced domestic labor as restaveks in urban households
 (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum employment age in all sectors is 15 years, with the exception of domestic serv-
 ice, where the minimum age is 12. The Labor Code prohibits minors from working
 under dangerous conditions, and it prohibits minors under the age of 18 from work-
 ing at night in industrial enterprises. High levels of adult unemployment and
 underemployment lead to fierce adult competition for jobs, which ensures that child
 labor is not a factor in the industrial sector. Some manufacturing firms that produce
 products for export adhere to a voluntary code of conduct that prohibits the use of
 child labor. However, there is no labeling program to indicate that items were pro-
 duced without child labor. Children under the age of 15 commonly worked at infor-
 mal sector jobs to supplement family income, despite the legal prohibition. Children
 also commonly work on small family farms alongside their parents, even though the
 high unemployment rate among adults keeps children from being employed on com-
 mercial farms in significant numbers. Primary education is supposed to be free and
 compulsory, but there are far too few public schools to accommodate the country's
 children, especially in rural areas. The Labor Code's prohibition of forced or compul-
 sory labor applies equally to minors, but some children are forced to work as unpaid
 domestic servants (see Sections 5 and 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum daily wage, established in
 June 1995, is about $2.18 (36 gourdes). Annually, a minimum wage worker would
 earn about $680 (11,200 gourdes), an income considerably above the national aver-
 age but sufficient only to permit a worker and family to live in very poor conditions.
 The majority of citizens work in subsistence agriculture, a sector where minimum
 wage legislation does not apply.
 The Labor Code governs individual employment contracts. It sets the standard
 workday at 8 hours, and the workweek at 48 hours, with 24 hours of rest on Sun-
 day. However, the officers of the HNP work 12-hour shifts 6 days per week, in ap-
 parent violation of the Labor Code (see Section 6.a.). The code also establishes mini-
 mum health and safety regulations. The industrial and assembly sectors largely ob-
 served these guidelines. The assembly sector published a voluntary code of conduct
 in 1997, committing signatories to a number of measures designed to raise industry
 standards, including paying the minimum wage and the prohibition of child labor.
 However, the Ministry of Social Affairs did not enforce work hours or health and
 safety regulations.
 
 
 With more than 50 percent of the population unemployed, workers were not able
 to exercise the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment.
