 KENYA
 Kenya's Constitution enunciates substantial protection
 for fundamental rights and liberties, and the judicial
 system is independent and impartial. President Daniel arap
 Moi, who succeeded President Kenyatta upon the latter's
 death in August, 1978, acceded to power in accordance with
 the Constitution. The Kenyatta Government had at times used
 detention laws and other restrictive powers in order to
 silence a few critics of the senior leadership, and Presi-
 dent Moi has renewed the Public Security Act, under the
 provisions of which political prisoners can be detained.
 However, he released all 16 political prisoners as of
 December 12, 1978, and the Act has not since been invoked.
 Kenya held Parliamentary elections in November 1979. While
 competition was vigorous, 10 individuals were barred from
 running for political reasons.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not practiced in Kenya. It is specifically
 forbidden by the Kenyan Constitution.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are effective legal safeguards against cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment, although prison
 conditions are often poor.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Political detention is permitted under the Public Security
 Act. Detainees must be informed of the reasons for their
 detention within five days of arrest, and they have the
 right to review of their cases every six months by a special
 tribunal. The tribunal is appointed by the President,
 meets in camera, and the government is not bound to comply
 with its Y-indigs. The incidence of politically motivated
 arrests under these provisions has been low. Cases under the
 former government included two prominent dissident members
 of Parliament arrested in the aftermath of the March 1975
 murder of a leading Parliamentary critic of the regime, the
 arrest in May 1977 of a vocal Parliamentary backbencher who
 had alleged corruption on the part of high government
 officials, and the arrest at the end of 1977 of a prominent
 novelist whose works strongly criticized the Kenyan elite.
 These individuals were among those released by President
 Moi on December 12, 1978. There are no political detainees
 at this time.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is respected in Kenya,
 except for detention cases lodged under the Public Security
 Act. There the authority of the regular courts is limited
 to ensuring compliance with the procedural provisions of the
 Public Security Act which are detailed above in Section l.c.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 The generally high standard of impartiality of the Kenyan
 courts has been paralleled by respect for due process
 on the part of Kenyan authorities. As a consequence, the
 sanctity of the home and other guarantees of English common
 law are respected in Kenya. In a recent case, one judge
 admonished police officers for over-zealous harassment of a
 former detainee while acquitting him of the charges brought
 against him.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Kenya's economic development policies, emphasizing free
 enterprise and the profit motive, have produced a good
 record of economic growth. Distribution of income and
 wealth remain substantially unequal, although the government
 has responded to the needs of the poor and in the current
 five-year development plan, 1979-83, has shifted its develop-
 ment emphasis toward greater equity in the distribution of
 development resources and toward the provisions of basic
 human needs. The government controls the price of basic
 foodstuffs and has programs aimed at providing low-cost
 housing, employment in urban and rural areas, and improve-
 ment in income lvels among small holders. In the rural
 areas, health care and education are priority areas for
 future government development spending. Since January 1979,
 the first seven years of public primary education are pro-
 vided by the government free of charge and milk is available
 at no cost to students. In 1977 approximately 40 percent of
 the adult population were estimated to be literate. The
 level of illiteracy among women (7a percent) is twice the
 percentage among men (35 percent). In recognition of the
 fact that in the past the views of women and their needs had
 not been factored into Kenya's development strategy, the
 government established a women's bureau in the Ministry of
 Housing and Social Services in 1975 tasked with coordinating
 women's projects throughout the country. The reduction of
 high-level corruption, a national problem, is a stated goal
 of the new administration.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of expression and communication in Kenya can be
 restricted under various sections of the penal code.
 The existence and occasional use of the detention laws
 inhibit public exchange of views on sensitive political
 topics. The government discourages student political
 activism. Although there is no formal censorship of the
 press, government guidelines are issued on politically
 sensitive issues and are usually observed by the media.
 In one known instance, the Moi Government has used economic
 pressure to attempt to restrict a journal's discussion
 of politically sensitive internal issues. Kenya's press,
 however, is active and assertive in reporting and commenting
 on internal developments. Freedoms of assembly and associa-
 tion are limited by the Public Order and Police Act which
 gives local administrative authorities and police wide
 
 
 100
 powers to control public meetings. It is an offense to
 convene or attend an unlicensed meeting. With these
 powers, the government can prevent meetings by political
 opponents and labor leaders. It has on occasion done so.
 Under the Societies Act, the government can refuse to regis-
 ter any society which it believes may pursue activities
 harmful to public security. This denial of registry,
 combined with the restrictions of the Public Order and
 Police Act can effectively prevent an organization from
 operating. A former opposition political party, the now
 defunct Kenya Peoples' Union, remains proscribed under this
 act. The government used the same powers to ban the
 Jehovah's Witnesses in 1973, but later revoked the ban
 when threatened with a court test of the constitutionality
 of the Societies Act. Kenya has a relatively free trade
 union movement, but strikes are almost always illegal.
 While little action has been taken against strike leaders,
 it has recently been threatened by the Minister of Labor.
 There is full freedom of religion.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Under Presidential detention power, individuals may be
 restricted in their movements within the country, but
 this power has not been used in recent years. Foreign
 travel and emigration are not restricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Kenya has only one political party, the Kenya African
 National Union (KANU), although there is no law against
 the formation of others. The government has substantial
 powers to restrict political activity. One political
 party was banned in 1969 (See 3.a. above). Ten indi-
 viduals, including five ex-KPU leaders and a political
 detainee released in December 1978, were banned from running
 in Kenya's November 8 Parliamentary elections. Two other
 detainees released in December 1978 were allowed to stand
 for Parliament. Political activity within the KANU frame-
 work is vigorous, however, and about 750 candidates con-
 tested the 158 elected seats of the National Assembly.
 Parliamentary elections in 1969, 1974 and 1979 saw the
 defeat of over 50% of the incumbents. Kenyan society is
 patriarchal, and attitudes toward the role of women reflect
 traditional values. Sexual discrimination is not government
 policy. However, few women hold positions of authority.
 Four women are members of Parliament, and one assistant
 minister is female.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The government barred entry into Kenya of journalists
 who were critical of former President Kenyatta and his
 family. On several occasions Attorney General Charles
 Njonjo has been critical of international bodies such as
 Amnesty International and questioned the right of such
 groups to pass judgment on internal policy of a sovereign
 state such as Kenya.
