 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal structure. Legislative
 power is vested in a bicameral Parliament. Given the nation's linguistic and reli-
 gious diversity, the Swiss political system emphasizes local and national political
 consensus an grants considerable autonomy to individual cantons. Police duties are
 primarily a responsibility of the individual cantons, which have their own distinct
 police forces. The national police authority has a coordinating role and relies on the
 cantons for actual law enforcement.
 Switzerland's free enterprise industrial and service economy, highly dependent on
 international trade, provides a very high standard of living. Although unemploy-
 ment in 1993 reached unusually high levels, traditional labor peace persisted.
 Human rights are widely respected. The headquarters of major international
 human rights and humanitarian affairs organizations are located in Switzerland. In
 June Parliament ratified the 1965 U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
 of Racial Discrimination. However, rightwing opponents are seeking to overturn the
 implementing legislation via a popular referen um. Switzerland has antiforeigner
 elements who express themselves through violence. There were a number of violent
 incidents in 1993, but fewer than in each of the 2 previous years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political or other
 extraju dicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prescribes such practices, and there were no reports of any viola-
 tions. There were no reports of police beatings or other abuse.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention,
 or exile is provided by law. A detained person may not be held longer than 24 hours
 without a warrant of arrest issued by the magistrate conducting the preliminary in-
 vestigation. A suspect must immediately be shown the warrant and has the right
 to contact legal counsel as soon as a warrant is issued. A suspect may be detained
 with a warrant until an investigation is completed, but the length of investigative
 detention is always reviewed by higher judicial authority, and investigations are
 typically completed quickly. Release on personal recognizance or bail is granted un-
 less the examining magistrate believes the person is a danger to society or will not
 appear for trial.
 There is no summary exile, nor is exile used as a means of political control, al-
 though non-Swiss convicted of crimes may receive sentences which include denial
 of reentry for a specific period following completion of a prison sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for public trials. All
 courts of first instance are cantonal courts, with right of appeal to the federal courts
 and freedom from interference by other branches of government. Minor cases are
 tried by a single judge difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder or other
 serious crimes by a public jury. Even the most serious cases are usually brought
 to trial within a few months. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Police
 entry into the premises of a person suspected of a criminal offense is regulated by
 
 
 1073
 cantonal legislation. Regulations differ widely from canton to canton, but not, appar-
 ently, to the extent that they provide potential for abuse. There were no reports of
 abuse in 1993.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, effective judiciary, and
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. Groups
 or associations determined to be a potential threat to the State may have restric-
 tions placed on their freedom of speech and press. No groups were restricted during
 the year.
 Federal antiracism legislation, enacted in June, but not yet in force, would permit
 the Federal Government to place restrictions--including speech and press re-
 straints--on groups engaging in or advocating racial discrimination. No groups are
 currently restricted. The new legislation is controversial and may be submitted to
 Swiss voters for approval-perhaps in mid-1994--prior to its implementation. Most
 broadcast media are government-funded but possess editorial autonomy, and foreign
 broadcast media are freely available. Press and publishing are owned by private en-
 terprises operated without government intervention. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The only restriction on peace-
 ful assembly and association is a requirement to obtain permits from police authori-
 ties before holding public meetings. These are routinely granted unless authorities
 have reason to believe the meeting will lead to violence.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. There is no single
 state church, but individual cantons may support a particular church out of public
 funds, and most cantons do. Foreign clergy are free to perform their duties. The de-
 gree to which minonty religious communities are explicitly recognized in law varies
 among the cantons. Most cantons do not accord Jewish and other non-Christian reli-
 gious communities the specific legal recognition and tax privileges enjoyed by the
 Catholic and Protestant churches.
 The legal requirement for universal male military service provides no exemption
 for conscientious objectors. They may apply for military service which does not en-
 tail bearing arms, but refusal to serve has nearly always led to prosecution and con-
 viction. A 1991 law stipulates that refusal to serve is a punishable offense, but if
 the refusal stems from reasons of conscience, the prescribed sentence is a period of
 alternative community service-up to a maximum of 6 months (which entails no
 criminal record)-rather than prison. Those objecting to military service on grounds
 of conscience which are not recognized by the military tribunals--such as political
 grounds-and those failing to convince the tribunals that their refusal of military
 service is based on fundamental ethical values, continue to receive prison sentences
 and a criminal record. However, Swiss voters gave the Federal Government a man-
 date in May 1992 to draft a new law abolishing the distinction between these two
 categories. The legislation was still in preparation in late 1993.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the country and can
 emigrate without difficulty. Switzerland has traditionally been a haven for refugees,
 but public concern over the growing number of asylum seekers, many of whom ap-
 parently come for economic reasons, generated pressure on the Government to im-
 plement swifter processing of asylum seekers in 1992 and to expel more quickly
 those whose applications are rejected. These expedited procedures remained in effect
 for 1993.
 There were some violent attacks against asylum seekers in 1993, including three
 arson attempts against asylum residences. Fewer such attacks occurred, however,
 than in each of the 2 previous years. Refugees whose applications are rejected are
 allowed to stay temporarily if their home country is torn by war or insurrection.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Switzerland is a highly developed constitutional democracy. There is universal
 adult suffrage by secret ballot in federal elections. There is universal adult suffrage
 in cantonal elections as well, but a few half-cantons still retain the traditional "as-
 sembly of the people" style of voting by raising hands rather than by secret ballot.
 Elections are free and contested actively by four major national parties and at least
 a dozen significant regional or minor parties. Initiative and referendum procedures
 provide unusually intense popular involvement in the legislative process.
 Participation by women in politics has been limited historically but continues to
 expand slowly. Most women who would participate at the top levels of national po-
 litical life continued to face psychological, social, and economic barriers. However,
 gradual improvement has taken place. Although Swiss women have had the vote for
 
 
 1074
 only 22 years, they hold about 16 percent of the seats in Parliament. The Par-
 liamentary Faction Leader of the Social Democrats, one of the four parties in the
 governing coalition, is a woman, six women serve on cantonal executive councils, the
 Department for Foreign Affairs has three female ambassadors, and a woman is Gen-
 eral Secretary of the Federal Assembly, one of the highest offices in the government
 administration. In March Ruth Dreifuss was elected to the seven-member Federal
 Council (cabinet) and named Interior Minister. She is the second woman and first
 Jewish person to reach Switzerland's highest political level.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernment In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights advocacy groups in Switzerland concern themselves almost exclu-
 sively with lobbying the Swiss and other governments about the human rights situ-
 ation in other countries.
 Switzerland cooperates with international bodies and nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) in all areas of human rights. All major international human rights
 groups are active in Switzerland, and some of the leading ones, e.g., the UnitedNa-
 tions Human Rights Commission and the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC), are based there. The ICRC is made up of Swiss nationals, and Swiss play
 prominent roles in other humanitarian nongovernmental organizations.
 Sections 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Women.-Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination against women in
 the work place, the Federal Government concluded in 1992 that additional meas-
 ures, including better implementation of existing legislation, were necessary to en-
 sure equal pay' and other benefits for women. The Federal Minister of Justice pro-
 posed new legislation in February 1993 to implement more effectively constitutional
 prohibitions on discrimination against women. For example, this legislation would
 reverse the burden of proof from the complainant to the accused in workplace dis-
 crimination cases. The legislation is opposed, however, by some business interests
 and has not yet been considered by a parliamentary committee. It is not likely to
 be enacted soon. Several cases brought by women seeking equal pay with men under
 existing law were decided for the complainants by cantonal and federal courts in
 1993. The Federal Commission for Women's Rights and several private groups, e.g.,
 the Federation of Women's Organizations, monitor and promote women's rights.
 They have found that persistent discrimination has more social than legal causes.
 Nevertheless, a significant number of women in recent years have broken barriers
 in traditional male-dominated professions, such as medicine, law, and engineering,
 and the proportion of women to men in these professions has increased markedly
 over the last two decades.
 Women gained equality within the state pension program as a result of par-
 liamentary legislation in June 1992. Married women are thereby entitled in their
 own right to half the benefits the couple receives and have the right to pay for a
 widower's benefit and make up any missed contributions for their husbands, as men
 can for their wives. In addition, divorced women are entitled to half the pension
 rights of a couple, calculated on the highest earnings in the marriage.
 Different treatment between men and women is most pronounced in the salaries
 and wages paid. Despite the statutory requirement of equal pay for equivalent work,
 women's wages for identical work lag an average of 16 percent behind those of men.
 The Government said in 1992 that it planned amendments to the law on sexual
 equality which would bar discrimination in employment, improve protection against
 dismissals, reverse the burden of proof in discrimination cases, and facilitate law
 suits by individual women against discriminatory employers, but no action was
 taken in 1993.
 The only female member of the Federal Council, who is also the Interior Minister,
 citing the paucity of women in high positions in the labor force, stated that an im-
 portant goal wil be to determine how to get more women into positions of respon-
 sibility.
 There is widespread agreement that violence against women is a significant prob-
 lem. The Federation of Women's Organizations and other women's avocacy groups
 have heightened public consciousness. Each city has an emergency telephone num-
 ber through which women who are victims of violence can obtain help and counsel-
 ing, and special homes for abused women. Specialists work with police authorities
 to interview women who report attacks. Laws exist against wife beating and similar
 crimes. At year's end, it was not yet clear what effect these laws and an October
 1992 change in the Penal Code, explicitly making spousal rape a criminal offense,
 would have on deterring violence against women. While the Penal Code is estab-
 
 
 1075
 lished at the federal level, enforcement is the responsibility of the cantons and vari-
 ations occur.
 Children.-Legislation on assistance for victims of violent crimes, which entered
 into force on January 1, 1993, addresses the protection of children from such abuses.
 The Swiss Association for the Protection of Children, an NGO, is active in monitor-
 ing and advocating childrens' rights. It advocates legislation to create and strength-
 en the rights of the children of foreigners including seasonal workers.
 Regarding statutory rape, the Federal Council (Cabinet) proposed lowering the
 age of consent from 16 to 14, but this was rejected by Parliament. Instead, Par-
 liament approved new legislation, which took effect in January 1993, requiring that
 a person accused of statutory rape must be at least 16 and more than 3 years older
 than the accuser.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Citizens comprising Italian and Romansch
 linguistic minorities (respectively about 5 and 1 percent of the population) continued
 to express concern that the limited resources made available to them by the Federal
 Government to support education and media endanger the intellectual vitality of
 these languages. In October 1992, the Federal Government withdrew legislation
 which would have made Romansch an official language. Citing the significant ad-
 ministrative costs of implementing such a measure, the Government held that pres-
 ervation of language was basically a matter for individual cantons to address.
 Foreigners comprise about 18 percent of the population and 27 percent of the total
 work force. Residence permits are limited for foreigners; for example, foreign work-
 err with seasonal stay permits are not allowed to bring their ianu lies. These limita-
 tions apply to all non-Swiss. Parliament approved the country's first federal legisla-
 tion against racial discrimination, based on the 1965 U.N. Convention on the Elimi-
 nation of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in June. It would penalize race-moti-
 vated discrimination and hate speech. Previously, the cantonal governments had ex-
 clusive authority to handle racial discrimination cases. Rightwing groups began to
 collect signatures to bring the antiracism legislation to a national vote. There is no
 discrimination on religious grounds, but taxation privileges accorded to churches
 and religious groups vary according to cantonal practice.
 Although authorities suspect that arson caused the deaths of five asylum-seekers
 in 1992, they never issued a definitive conclusion about the fires, and no arrests
 were made. A Swiss man was sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment in 1993 for a 1991
 arson attack on an asylum residence in Thun in which there were no fatalities.
 Right-wing organizations, especially extremist organizatians, iepresent only a small
 minority. There were spora    violent attacks against foreigners or their property
 in 1933, including 3 firebombings. Although preliminary official figures show a sig-
 nificant decrease in attacks since 1991, statistics are not comprehensive, because
 some incidents are not reported or are ignored by police authorities. A 1993 report
 by state protection forces, commissioned by the Federal Council, concluded that past
 investigations were Emost exclusively directed against leftwing organizations, ig-
 noring any danger from the right. There is also evidence that some police may actu-
 ally sympathize with rightwing groups. A Swiss journalist who wrote sympa-
 thetically about foreigners and documented attacks against them claimed to have
 been beaten and subjected to numerous threats of violence pricr to relocating in an-
 other city.
 People with I)isabilities. -An umbrella organization representing most disabled
 persons' rights associations is active politically. It is particularly involved in issues
 concerning the transport and mobility of disabled persons. It advocates the revision
 of federal legislation on insurance for the disabled, urging better social integration
 and professional training for them. The organization also favors a federal anti-
 discrimination law. The Federal Government has advocated physical accessibility to
 public buildings for the disabled, but no legislation has benn enacted.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ;f Association.-All workers, including foreign workers in Switzer-
 land, have freedom to associate freely, to join unions of their choice, and to select
 their own representatives. However, less than 15 percent of the country's labor force
 belongs to a union. The change from an industrial to a service-based economy, the
 high standard of living shared by a prosperous work force, and the Swiss system
 of referendums and initiatives (which accords citizens a voice on important political,
 social, and economic issues) are among the reasons for the lack of interest in union
 memberslhip. Olficials estimate that about 50 percent of all Swiss workers are cov-
 ered by collective agreements. Unions are free to publicize their views and deter-
 mine their own policies to represent members' interests without government inter-
 ference. Unions may join federations or affiliate with international bodies. The
 Swiss Trade Union Federation belongs to the International Confederation of Free
 
 
 1076
 
 Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labor, as well as to the European
 Trade Union Confederation.
 The right to strike is legally recognized, but a unique informal labor peace agree-
 ment between unions and employers, in existence since the 1930's, has meant fewer
 than 20 strikes per year since 1975. There were no significant strikes in 1993. Fed-
 eral employees and most cantonal and local employees do not have the right to
 strike. The only exception is the Canton of Jura, where both local and cantonal au-
 thorities have this right.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Swiss law gives workers the
 right to organize and bargain collectively and protects them from acts of antiunion
 discrimination. Employers found guilty of such discrimination are not required to
 reinstate workers fired for union activities but must pay an indemnity to the work-
 ers. The Government encourages voluntary negotiations between employer and
 worker organizations, although for the most part employers and workers alike (in
 common with most Swiss institutions) seek to exclude the Government from involve-
 ment in their affairs.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor although there is no specific statute or constitutional ban on it.
 d. kinimum Wage for Employment of Children.-The minimum ag for employ-
 ment of children is 15 years. Children over 13 may be employed in light duties (e.g.,
 helping in retail stores) for not more than 9 hours a week during the school year
 and 15 hours otherwise. Employment between ages 15 and 20 is strictly regulated.
 For example, youths may not work at night, on Sundays, or under hazardous or
 dangerous conditions. These laws are observed in practice and enforced through in-
 spections by the Federal Office of Industry, Trades, and Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Employer
 associations and unions negotiate industrial wages during the collective bargaining
 process. Such wage agreements are also widely observed by nonunion establish-
 ments. The Labor Act established a maximum 45-hour workweek for blue- and
 white-collar workers in industry, services, and retail trades, and a 50-hour work-
 week for all other workers. The workweek for blue-collar workers in most industries
 is 43 hours and for white-collar workers 40 to 43 hours. Overtime is limited by law
 to 120 hours annually. The 1948 Labor Law bans night and Sunday work for women
 in industry. The economy was until recently at or near full employment. The result-
 ing take-home pay provides Swiss workers and their families with a very high
 standard of living.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain extensive regulations
 to protect worker health and safety. The regulations are rigorously enforced by the
 Federal Office of Industry Trades, and Labor, providing a high standard of worker
 health and safety. No expficit provision in Swiss law accords an employee the right
 to leave his place or work without prejudice in case of occupational hazard. Some
 have sought justification for such a right in more general principles of Swiss law,
 but this interpretation remains subject to considerable criticism and controversy.
 Swiss employees have the right to file a complaint with an appropriate govern-
 mental regulatory body against employers who fail to adhere to regulations on em-
 ployee safety. The Government in 1993 continued to work on a complete revision
 of the Labor Law dating from 1948.
 There were no allegations of workers rights abuses from domestic or foreign
 sources.
