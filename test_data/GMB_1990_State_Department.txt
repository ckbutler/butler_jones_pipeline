 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is a parliamentary democracy with an elected
 president and legislature. Except for a coup attempt in 1981,
 The Gambia has had a history of political stability under the
 leadership of its only President since independence in 1965,
 Sir Dawda Jawara. His ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP)
 has dominated the unicameral Parliament, but several
 opposition parties participate in the political process,
 including two parties formed in 1986. The confederation
 between The Gambia and Senegal, established in 1982 following
 the coup attempt, formally ended in September 1989 after
 Senegal's withdrawal of its security forces from The Gambia.
 The two countries disagreed over the function and ultimate
 purpose of the confederation, with The Gambia insisting upon
 its sovereignty and Senegal favoring a more fully integrated
 economic union.
 The Gambia has a small army with an attached naval unit
 organized and trained by British officers. Its gendarmerie
 forces, formerly headed by Senegalese officers, are now under
 the control of and responsive to Gambian civilian leadership.
 The Gambia's estimated population of 784,000 consists largely
 of subsistence farmers growing rice and groundnuts (peanuts),
 the country's primary export crop. In 1990 The Gambia
 continued its stringent economic reform program in cooperation
 with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 The Gambia has made particular efforts to promote observance
 of human rights, which are constitutionally protected and
 generally observed in practice. The Government has actively
 supported the African Center for Democracy and Human Rights
 Studies, which opened in Banjul in 1989 and sponsored a
 program in 1990 of conferences and colloquiums on human rights
 issues.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman,
 and degrading punishment, and there were no allegations of
 torture in 1990.
 However, prison conditions are severe, and there were in past
 years occasional reports of mistreatment of prisoners. After
 the death of several inmates in 1988 due to inadequate diet, a
 presidential commission on prison conditions investigated the
 occurrence, and its recommendations led to prison reforms.
 There have been no further reports of such incidents since the
 reforms. The Government allows prison visits by
 representatives of the local Red Cross and by close family
 members.

 THE GAMBIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Based on British legal practice, well-developed constitutional
 and legal procedures govern the arrest, detention, and trial
 of persons accused of crimes. Under these procedures, a
 detained person must be brought to trial within 1 week of
 arrest. This waiting period, however, can be extended twice,
 making 21 days the maximum period of detention before trial.
 In fact, due to overcrowded court schedules, the detention
 period can be much longer.
 There were no political detainees held during 1990. There are
 some self-exiled opposition elements who would be arrested for
 suspected involvement in the 1981 coup attempt if they
 returned to The Gambia, e.g., the alleged leader of the plot,
 Kukoi Samba Sanyang.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three kinds of law in The Gambia: general, Shari'a
 (Islamic), and customary law. Shari'a, governing Muslims, is
 observed in marriage and divorce proceedings. Customary law
 covers marriage and divorce for non-Muslims, inheritance, land
 tenure and utilization, local tribal government, and all other
 traditional civil and social relations. General law, based on
 English statutes and modified to suit the Gambian context,
 governs criminal cases and trials and most organized business
 practices. If there were a conflict between general law and
 Shari'a, general law would prevail.
 The Constitution provides criminal defendants with the
 traditional rights of the English legal system, such as
 presumption of innocence, the right of the accused to be
 informed promptly of the charges, and the right to a public
 trial. If released on bail, an accused person may face
 charges indefinitely, since there is no maximum time limit for
 completing the investigation and bringing the case to trial.
 Appeals normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the
 Court of Appeals, the country's highest tribunal.
 Judges are appointed by the Government, but the judiciary
 operates independently and is free of government
 interference. Because of the shortage of legal professionals
 in The Gambia, the legal system is staffed in part by judges
 and prosecuting and defense attorneys from other
 English-speaking countries having the same basic legal system
 as The Gambia.
 An opposition journalist, Sana Manneh, editor of The Torch,
 accused four cabinet ministers of corruption in 1988 and
 subsequently was charged with libeling three of them in
 October 1988. A 4-month trial ensued, avidly followed by the
 private press and the public. In April 1989, Manneh was
 acquitted on two counts of libel and given a warning on a
 third, less serious count. The Government in 1990 appealed
 this decision to the Supreme Court, which overturned the
 decision of the magistrate court and found Manneh guilty. The
 Chief Justice held that the magistrate had not sufficiently
 considered the law on criminal libel, particularly with
 reference to the shifting of the burden of proof to the
 defendant if he raises the defense of justification. The
 Supreme Court remitted the case for sentencing to the
 magistrate court, which had not scheduled the case by the end
 of the year. Meanwhile, Sana Manneh appealed the new Supreme
 
 
 THE GAMBIA
 Court verdict to the Court of Appeals, which will likely hear
 his case in May 1991.
 There were no known political prisoners in The Gambia at
 year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides guarantees, which are respected in
 practice, against arbitrary search of person and property. It
 does permit a search to which a suspect submits voluntarily or
 if it is reasonably required in the interest of national
 defense or public welfare. Under the Gambian criminal code,
 search warrants based on probable cause are issued by
 magistrates upon application by the police. The code also
 specifies that police may conduct a search of a private
 residence while a crime is in progress. There are a few
 checkpoints in the country where the police and military
 periodically stop and search drivers and vehicles.
 The rights of family are of great importance in The Gambia's
 conservative Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of
 children, and religious instruction are regulated by a
 combination of personal preference and ethnic and religious
 tradition. The Government does not normally intrude in family
 matters. Family planning is encouraged but not enforced.
 There is no effort to censor or control personal
 correspondence or communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 While opposition parties have been relatively inactive since
 the 1987 elections, members freely express their opinions
 about the Government and ruling party.
 The Government does not attempt to censor published materials,
 whether they originate within or outside the country. In
 practical terms, The Gambia, with its small, mainly rural,
 largely illiterate, multilingual population, does not support
 an active press, though this is slowly changing. The
 Government and the PPP have newspapers which are published on
 a biweekly or monthly basis.
 There are several independent, intermittently published,
 mimeographed newssheets and, more recently, one monthly
 newsmagazine. Both the opposition and the independent press
 are openly critical of the Government. A biweekly
 mimeogiaphed paper, sponsored by a legal Socialist party, has
 been particularly vocal in condemning the governing party.
 There is, however, some degree of self-censorship in the
 government-owned media, which exercises restraint in reporting
 criticism of the Government. During the Manneh libel trial,
 Radio Gambia and the official press ceased coverage after the
 first week of the trial.
 There is no television in The Gambia, although Senegalese
 broadcasts can be received. The Government dominates the
 media through Radio Gambia. There have been no reported
 instances of government interference with the one commercial
 
 
 138
 THE GAMBIA
 radio station, which mainly broadcasts music. Foreign
 magazines and newspapers are available in the capital. There
 is no university in The Gambia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In general, there is no interference with the freedom of
 assembly and association which is provided for in the
 Constitution. The Government almost always grants permits for
 peaceful assembly but requires that these meetings be open to
 the public. Permits for assembly are issued by the police and
 are not denied for political reasons. The permits regulate
 times, places, use of loudspeakers, and the authority to block
 traffic for a parade. The only banned organization in the
 Gambia is the Movement for Justice in Africa, which was
 suspected of involvement in the 1981 coup attempt. The law
 has been amended so that any future bans would be by judicial
 decision rather than a presidential decree. The State would
 apply to the court for a banning order with specified
 grounds. There have been no requests to ban any organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional provisions of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religion are observed in practice. The State is
 secular, although Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the
 population. The schools provide instruction in the Koran for
 Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
 freely practice their religion. There is a small Baha'i
 community in Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to carry on
 their various mission-related activities openly and freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, subject to
 conditions protecting public safety, health, and morals.
 There is no restriction on freedom of emigration or freedom of
 return. Because of historic and ethnic ties with the
 inhabitants of Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and
 Mauritania, people tend to move freely across borders, which
 are poorly marked and difficult to police.
 In 1990 a small number of refugees from Liberia settled in the
 Gambia; official U.N. registration of Liberians in December
 stood at 76. A larger group of refugees crossed into the
 Gambia from the Casamance region of Senegal, with estimates
 ranging from one to two thousand. The Government's attempt to
 register these Senegalese refugees has been difficult since
 many of them are living with Gambian family members. The
 official count is only 369 registered, but many more are
 believed to be in the border villages.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right to change their government through
 peaceful means. The President and the Members of Parliament
 are popularly elected, as are the district councils and the
 chiefs, who exercise traditional authority in the villages and
 compounds. Presidential and parliamentary elections are held
 every 5 years. Citizens must be at least 18 years of age to
 vote. Balloting is secret, and measures are employed to
 assure that illiterate voters understand the choices and
 voting procedure.

 THE GAMBIA
 A functioning multiparty system exists in The Gambia even
 though the People's Progressive Party under the leadership of
 President Jawara has been in power since independence. The
 principal opposition party, the National Convention Party
 (NCP), contests both national and district elections. Two
 newly formed opposition parties, the Gambia People's Party
 (GPP) and the People's Democratic Organization for
 Independence and Socialism (PDOIS), contested for office in
 the March 1987 presidential and parliamentary elections.
 Campaigning was vigorous, active, and open to all parties.
 The ruling PPP won by an overwhelming majority and now holds
 31 of 36 elective seats in the Parliament. The NCP was the
 only opposition party to win seats. The opposition charged
 that the election was manipulated by the Government but did
 not provide evidence to support its allegations. The
 opposition also charged, with some justification, that the PPP
 benefited from its control of Radio Gambia and access to
 government vehicles for campaigning.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is responsive to charges of human rights
 violations and permits visits of international human rights
 organizations to observe the conditions of detainees and the
 trial process. There were no reported requests by such
 organizations for investigation of alleged human rights abuses
 in The Gambia during 1990. The Gambia is an active member of
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission and of the
 Organization of African Unity's (OAU) Commission on Human and
 Peoples' Rights. It took the initiative in persuading the OAU
 to locate the Commission in Banjul which opened in June 1989.
 The Government has also established the African Center for
 Democracy and Human Rights Studies in conjunction with the OAU
 Commission. The Center works to promote greater respect for
 human rights in Africa through research into and documentation
 of human rights problems and through workshops and
 conferences. In November The Gambia was the site of the
 Commonwealth Colloquium on the Domestic Application of
 International Human Rights Norms.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Gambian Constitution states.that all persons in The Gambia
 are entitled to "fundamental rights and freedoms" regardless
 of "race, place of origin, politicallopinions, colour, creed,
 or sex." There is no officially sanctioned discrimination
 based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status. The
 Gambian population is overwhelmingly Muslim and rural, with 85
 percent living in villages, and there is considerable emphasis
 on the collective aspects of rights and privileges. There is
 no evidence of discrimination in employment, education, or in
 other areas of Gambian life on religious grounds.
 Traditional views, especially about the role of women in
 society, are changing, but very slowly. Marriages are still
 most often arranged, and Muslim tradition allows for
 polygamy. Women are disadvantaged educationally, with females
 comprising about one-third of the students in primary school,
 and one-quarter of the high school students.
 Domestic violence and female circumcision are practiced in The
 Gambia as in the region, reinforced by traditional beliefs.
 
 
 THE GAMBIA
 Until recently, the Government has been passive in attempting
 to counter these practices. However, the Women's Bureau in
 the Office of the President conducts an ongoing campaign in
 both the rural and urban areas to make women aware of their
 legal rights in divorce and custody of children, property
 matters, and in cases of assault. The Bureau holds workshops
 on female circumcision to inform women of its negative effects
 and to discuss the religious and traditional ties to the
 practice. It also publishes a quarterly magazine on women's
 issues which it distributes throughout the country. The
 Women's Bureau conducted a study in 1990 of women's rights,
 including specific questions on domestic violence, that will
 be used as the basis for recommendations to the law reform
 commission. The data from this study had not been released by
 the end of 1990.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Labor Administration Act specifies that workers are free
 to form associations, including trade unions. However, less
 than 20 percent of the work force is engaged in the modern
 wage sector of the economy, where unions normally are active.
 The Gambian Workers' Confederation (GWC) and the Gambian
 Workers Union (GWU), are the two main independent and
 competing umbrella organizations, and both are recognized by,
 and have a good working relationship with, the Government.
 Police officers and the military are prohibited from forming
 unions and from going on strike.
 The Labor Administration Act authorizes strikes. However,
 because of a required 14-day cooling off period (21 days in
 essential services), government conciliation efforts, and the
 poor bargaining strength of the unions, few strikes actually
 occur. The Bakers' Association went on strike in August,
 demanding an increase in the controlled price of bread. The
 Association met with the Minister of Finance on August 8, and
 after the Minister agreed to an increase in the price of bread
 the bakers returned to work.
 As a result of an incomplete merger effort between the GWC and
 the GWU, both organizations claim affiliation to the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU);
 however, the ICFTU continues to recognize the GWU as its
 affiliate. Both unions are affiliated with the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity. In addition, there are two
 other Gambian labor confederations, the Gambian Labor
 Confederation, which is affiliated with the Communist-
 controlled World Federation of Trade Unions, and the Gambian
 Trade Union Congress, which is affiliated with the World
 Confederation of Labor. The Gambia is not a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the Labor Administration Act, workers have the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. Although trade unions are
 small and fragmented, collective bargaining does take place.
 The Labor Department registers the collective bargaining
 agreements reached between the unions and management, but does
 not interfere in the bargaining process. There is no export
 processing zone in The Gambia. Labor laws are applied
 uniformly throughout the country.
 
 
 THE GAMBIA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Criminal Code prohibits compulsory labor. There is no
 evidence of forced or compulsory labor in The Gambia.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The official minimum age for employment is 18. There is no
 compulsory education legislation and, because of the paucity
 of secondary school opportunities, most children complete
 their formal education by age 14 and informally enter the work
 force. The Labor Commissioner is charged with receiving
 employee labor cards, which include a person's age, but such
 inspection rarely-takes place for lack of funding and
 inspectors. Control of child labor does not apply to
 customary chores on family farms or street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages and hours of work are determined by the Joint
 industrial Council, pursuant to the Labor Administration Act,
 which has representation from employees, employers, and
 government. For example, the minimum wage for an unskilted
 laborer is approximately $1.21 per day,.usually supplemented
 with transport and other allowances. The wages are higher for
 various skilled laborers, with the minimum set at $1.71 per
 day for artisans, e.g., carpenter, masQn, and at $2.91 per day
 for hotel chefs, foremen, and low-level supervisors. The
 private sector generally has provision for overtime pay.
 These minimum wages do not provide for a decent standard of
 living. However, most Gambians do not live on one worker's
 earnings and rely on the extended family system, usually
 including some subsistence farming.
 The customary workweek for government workers is four 8-hour
 days, with a half day on Friday. Allowance is made for
 half-hour lunch breaks. For the private sector, there are
 four 8-hour days with half days on Fridays and Saturdays,
 making a 40-hour workweek. Government employees are entitled
 to 1 month's paid leave after I year of service; private
 sector employees receive between 14 and 30 days of paid annual
 leave, depending on their- length of service.
 Under the Factory Act, the Minister of Labor is given
 authority to regulate factory health and safety, accident
 prevention, and dangerous trades and to appoint inspectors to
 ensure compliance. However, this system is less than fully
 satisfactory, owing to the shortage of inspectors. The
 Government announced in 1987 that it would submit to
 Parliament a new labor code to replace obsolete labor laws;
 and a new industrial injuries compensation act to replace the
 existing Workmen's Compensation Act. As of the end of 1990,
 these were still pending.
