 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional xepublic and parliamentary, democracy. The head of state
 (President) appoints as-the head of government (Prime Minister) the leader of-the
 party that gains a plurality of.seats in the quinquennial elections for the unicameral
 legislature. The judiciary is independent
 The police are commanded by a civilian, commissioner under' the effective super-
 vision of the Government.
 The economy is a mixture of state-owned and private industry, with tourism and
 light manufacturing as the largest sectors, and it provides residents with a mod-
 erate to high standard of living.
 The Government generally respected human rights and the law and judiciary pro-
 -vide effective means of dealing with -instances of individual abuse. An independent
 judiciary upholds the Constitution's protections for individual rights and freedoms.
 Cultural and religious patterns reinforce the homogeneity of society. Domestic vio-
 lence-is a problem and societal discrimination against women persists, but the Gov-
 ernment has taken steps-o address both issues.

 other extrajudicial killings.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and law provide for
 freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this
 prohibition. The police may arrest a person for questioning on the basis of reason-
 able suspicion but within 48 hours must either release the suspect or lodge charges.
 Arrested persons have no right to legal counsel during this 48-hour period. Persons
 incarcerated pending trial are granted access to counsel. Bail is normally granted.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches. The Chief Justice and nine judges are appointed by the Presi-
 dent on the advice of the Prime Minister. There is a civil court, a commercial court,
 and a criminal court. In the latter, the presiding judge sits with a jury of nine. The
 Court of Appeal hears appeals from decisions of the civil and commercial courts. The
 Court of Criminal Appeal hears appeals from judgments of conviction by the crimi-
 nal court. The highest court, the Constitutional Court, hears appeals in cases involv-
 ing violations of human rights, interpretation of the Constitution, and the validity
 of laws. It also has jurisdiction in cases concerning disputed parliamentary elections
 and electoral corrupt practices. There are also inferior courts presided over by a
 magistrate.
 The Constitution requires a fair public trial before an impartial court. Defendants
 have the right to counsel of their choice, or (if they cannot pay the cost) to court-
 appointed counsel at public expense. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence.
 They may confront witnesses, present evidence, and have the right of appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the privacy of the home and prohibits electronic surveillance.
 The Government respects these provisions. Police officers with the rank of inspector
 and above may issue search warrants based on perceived reasonable grounds for
 suspicion of wrongdoing.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. However,
 the 1987 Foreign Interference Act bans foreign participation in local politics during
 the period leading up to elections. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and
 a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and
 of the press, including academic freedom. A monthly, five daily, and three weekly
 newspapers express diverse views. Six television stations (3 government-owned, 1
 governing party-owned, 1 opposition party-owned, and 1 commercial), a commercial
 cable network, and 19 private radio stations also function freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The state-supported religion is Roman
 Catholicism. The Government grants subsidies only to Roman Catholic schools. Stu-
 dents in government schools may opt to decline instruction in Roman Catholicism.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not arbitrarily restrict movement within the
 country, foreign travel, or emigration. A court order may prohibit the departure
 from the country of anyone who is the subject of a formal complaint alleging non-
 fulfillment of an obligation, such as nonpayment of a debt or nonsupport of an es-
 tranged spouse.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees. It did not force the return of any refugees to a country where
 they feared persecution. Since 1992 the Government has granted temporary refugee
 status to over 1,000 persons pending their relocation abroad. Iraqis represent the
 majority of the approximately 500 first asylum refugees still in Malta. However, the
 Government did not grant permanent refugee status or accept anyone for resettle-
 ment. The Government expels or repatriates persons it deems to be economic refu-
 gees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political-Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right in multiparty, secret-ballot elections held every 5 years
 on the basis of universal suffrage for those 18 years of age or over. In the 1998 elec-
 tion, 96 percent of the electorate voted.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. However, as a result of
 the 1996 general elections, the number of women elected to Parliament rose from
 two to four, and the first woman was appointed to be speaker of Parliament. In the
 September 1998 general elections four women also were elected to Parliament, and
 
 
 1384
 for only the second time in the nation's history, a woman was appointed to a min-
 isterial post. The Parliamentary Secretariat for Women's Rights within the Office
 of the Prime Minister was abolished by the new Nationalist Party. Women's issues
 are now covered by a Department of Women's Rights, under the Minister of Social
 Policy. The Social Policy Minister is a prominent member of the Government and
 is the Secretary General of the Nationalist Party. The new Government has en-
 dorsed the policy of positive action but has abandoned the requirement that 30 per-
 cent of nominations to government boards and committees be reserved for women.
 Instead, the Government has taken steps to include more women in the manage-
 ment and policy development structures, thus increasing female representation over
 the 30 percent threshold.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Various human rights organizations and persons interested in promoting and pro-
 tecting human rights operate freely. The Government places no restrictions on in-
 vestigations by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and law prohibit discrimination based on sex. The Government
 respects this prohibition.
 Women.-There is no widespread pattern of family violence against women, but
 continuing reports of such incidents have made plain that the problem exists. A spe-
 cial police unit and several voluntary organizations provide support to victims of do-
 mestic violence. For women who are threatened or physically abused, the Govern-
 ment also maintains an emergency fund and subsidizes a shelter.
 The Government set up a hot line in 1996 to assist victims of abuse through coun-
 seling and through referrals to legal assistance and shelters. A committee was set
 up during the year to review, existing family legislation and to propose amendments
 dealing with domestic violence.
 Prostitution is a serious offense under the law, and heavy penalties are reserved
 for organizers. Rape and violent indecent assault carry sentences of up to 10 years.
 The law treats spousal rape the same as any other rape. Divorce and abortion are
 not legal.
 The Constitution provides that all citizens have access, on a nondiscriminatory
 basis, to housing, employment, and education. While women constitute a growing
 portion of the work force, they are underrepresented in management. Cultural and
 traditional employment patterns often direct them either into traditional "women's
 jobs" (such as sales clerk, secretary, bank teller, teacher, or nurse) or into more re-
 warding jobs in family-owned businesses or select professions (i.e., academia or med-
 icine). Therefore, women generally earn less than their male counterparts, and
 many leave employment upon marriage. The Government's Parliamentary Secretar-
 iat or Women s Rights actively addresses women's issues. Legislation enacted in
 1993 granted women equality in matters of family law, and a 1991 constitutional
 amendment committed the Government to promoting equal rights for all persons re-
 gardless of sex., Redress in the courts for sexual discrimination is available. The
 Government's agenda on gender abandoned the concept of introducing gender-based
 quotas in the civil service. An internal study and proposal to increase the represen-
 tation of women in the public sector is under consideration by the Commonwealth
 Secretariat
 Children.-The Government has expressed concern for children's rights and wel-
 fare but addresses those concerns within the context of family law. Although sen-
 sitive to children's rights, Parliament has failed to pass specific legislation to protect
 children's rights and is not actively considering such legislation. However, -a com-
 mission is reviewing family law -and has recommended a reform of family courts and
 counsel for children. The number of reported cases of child abuse has grown as pub-
 lic awareness has increased, but it is not clear whether the actual number of inci-
 dents has increased.
 People With Disabilities.-The law protects the rights of the disabled. The 1969
 Employment of Disabled Persons Act led to greater employment of disabled persons
 in government agencies. The 1992 Structures Act requires accessibility to public
 buildings for people with physical disabilities. Overall government and private sec-
 tor efforts to advance the status of disabled persons have been uneven.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 , a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 strike, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Only noncivilian per-
 
 
 1385
 sonnel of the armed forces and police are prohibited from striking. There are 24 reg-
 istered trade unions, representing about 50 percent of the work force.
 Although all unions are independent of political parties, the largest, the General
 Workers' Union, is generally regarded as having close informal ties with the Labor
 Party.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act of 1976, the responsible minister may refer
 labor disputes either to the Industrial Tribunal (a government-appointed body con-
 sisting of representatives of government, employers, and employee groups) or to
 binding arbitration. The International Labor Organization Committee of Experts ob-
 jects to a provision of the act that permits compulsory arbitration to be held at the
 request of only one of the parties, but neither unions nor employers appear to object
 to this provision. In practice a striking union can ignore an unfavorable decision of
 the Tribunal by continuing the strike on other grounds. No disputes were referred
 to the Tribunal during the year.
 There is no prohibition on unions affiliating internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free, in law and
 practice, to organize and bargain collectively. Unions and employers meet annually
 with government representatives to work out a comprehensive agreement regulating
 industrial relations and income policy.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act, an employer may not take action against any
 employee for participation or membership in a trade union. Complaints may be pur-
 sued through a court of law, through a tripartite (union-employer-government) tri-
 bunal, or through the Commission Against Injustices (a government-appointed body
 composed of representatives of the Government and the opposition); but most dis-
 putes are resolved directly between the parties. Workers fired solely for union activi-
 ties must be reinstated.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bans forced
 labor, and it does not occur.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces this
 prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohibition effec-
 tively (see Section 6.c.). The law prohibits the employment of children younger than
 the age of 16. This is generally respected, but there is some employment of underage
 children during summer months, especially as domestics, restaurant kitchen help,
 or vendors. The Department of Labor enforces the law effectively, but it is lenient
 in cases of summer employment of underage youths in businesses run by their fami-
 lies.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage, $113 (44.13 Maltese
 liri) per week plus $11 (4.23 Maltese liri) per week in mandatory bonuses paid quar-
 terly, provides a decent standard of living for a worker and family with the addition
 of government subsidies for housing, health care, and free education. Wage Coun-
 cils, composed of representatives of government, business, and unions, regulate
 work-hours; for most sectors the standard is 40 hours per week, but in some trades
 it is 43 or 45 hours per week.
 Government regulations prescribe a daily rest period, which is normally 1 hour.
 The law mandates an annual paid vacation of 4 workweeks plus 4 workdays. The
 Department of Labor effectively enforces these requirements.
 Enforcement of the 1994 Occupational Health and Safety (Promotion) Act is un-
 even, and industrial accidents remain frequent. Workers may remove themselves
 from unsafe working conditions without jeopardy to their continued employment.
