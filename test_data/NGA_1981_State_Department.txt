 NIGERIA
 
 Since October 1979, when the country ended thirteen
 years of military rule, Nigeria has maintained steady
 progress in meeting the many challenges facing this
 large, densely-populated country. Starting with the
 example set by the military in preparing the country
 for the return to democratic government and implemen-
 ting the change, Nigerians have successfully overcome
 many of the problems of transition, and continue to
 build a representative political structure with
 strong legal guarantees for the individual. With
 national elections scheduled for 1983, and long-post-
 poned local elections also in the offing, strains in
 the political process are likely to become evident as
 the two-year-old federal structure, essentially based
 on the U.S. model, seeks to accommodate the disparate
 demands of the old structure, based largely on ethnic
 (tribal) groups. So far, however, the system seems to
 ,have the capacity to handle these strains without
 resort to repressive or extralegal measures.
 The 1979 transition to civilian rule ended a 12-year
 period of martial law,under which all political
 activity was banned. During this period a tragic and
 bloody civil war was fought, in which the lands and
 property of one powerful tribal group were laid waste,
 with much bitterness on both sides. In spite of these
 handicaps, the political process emerged robust and
 active almost from the outset, healthy enough to accom-
 modate the ingrained, preexisting political pressures
 and to continue the nation's economic development.
 During the first year in office, the new civilian
 government was preoccupied with adjusting to a new
 federal system far different from the former British
 parliamentary-executive pattern, while putting
 into operation a federal bicameral legislature and
 similar unicameral representative bodies in the 19
 states. Nevertheless federal and state governments
 undertook ambitious programs in housing, health and
 education. These continue with encouraging though
 uneven success.
 The 1979 Nigerian constitution contains strong human
 rights guarantees, as well as a :statement of commitment
 to national political, economic and social objectives
 designed to protect and enhance the rights of the
 individual. Nigeria, with several hundred diverse
 language groups and with pre-existing political
 structures ranging from loose, informal collective
 rule to authoritarian patterns based on Islamic moral
 codes, is moving to bring all of its people under the
 system of guarantees established by the new constitution.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includinq
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the constitution. There is
 no evidence that the government seeks to circumvent or
 ignore this prohibition. However, reports from
 reliable sources suggest that detainees are sometimes
 beaten for the purpose of extracting confessions. Such
 incidents probably take place during the apprehension
 of subjects or during interrogations at police stations,
 and seem to be the actions of individuals rather than
 the reflection of any policy. There have been no
 public charges of torture, and the press and public
 have not evidenced concern about these matters.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is not condoned.
 Nigerian prisons lack many modern facilities and there
 are reports that some prisoners have been mistreated,
 but this is not sanctioned by the government. Although
 the government has expressed the intention of building
 more modern prison facilities, prisons remain overcrowded,
 primarily because of the number of people in detention
 prior to trial. The press reported in late 1980 that
 13,784 people were in prison on remand, and the
 minister of state for internal affairs has charged
 publicly that some people accused of vagrancy have
 been "awaiting trial for one or two years." No action
 to rectify this situation has occurred. Prisoners do
 not receive discriminatory treatment on the basis of
 classification by race, sex or religion. There have
 been no summary executions. Capital punishment takes
 place, but only after civil trial with a right to
 appeal; executions occur within prisons and receive
 little publicity.
 C.   Disappearances
 Abduction and secrqt arrest are unconstitutional
 and not sanctioned officially. There are no known
 cases of disappearances.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no clandestine detentions of political pris-
 oners. The right of habeas corpus exists in law and
 has been honored since the end of the state of emergency
 in 1978. All decrees authorizing preventive detention
 were abolished upon assumption of power by the civilians,
 and no cases of preventive detention are known to have
 occurred since then.
 
 
 191
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are the norm, and the ordinary
 Nigerian receives justice from the courts under both
 traditional and statutory law. The constitution
 provides that an accused individual is entitled to a
 fair public trial unless government officials can
 satisfy the court that it would not be in the public
 interest for the matters at hand to be discussed
 publicly. Prisoners must be advised of the charges
 against them, have access to legal counsel, be informed
 of the evidence on which.charges are based, and be
 given adequate time and facilities for the preparation
 of a defense. These rights seem to be honored in
 practice, and no incidents of harassment of defense
 counsel by the government are known.
 The judiciary is independent of executive control and
 individuals have the right of redress. Civilians are
 not tried by military courts, nor are there any
 special courts to deal with political or security
 matters. There is a legal aid society, but its
 resources and activities are limited. Counsel for the
 indigent is provided in capital cases by the government.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The right to be free from invasion of the home is guaran-
 teed by the constitution and judicial warrants are required
 before a home can be entered. No allegations of forced
 entry or violations of the home have been made in 1981.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of expression,
 press, peaceful assembly and religion, although it
 prohibits membership in secret societies. Nigerians
 are free to practice the religion of their choice and
 no religious groups are discriminated against or
 favored.
 All TV and radio broadcast organizations are wholly
 owned by the government, and the constitution proscribes
 the ownership of TV and radio stations by private
 individuals unless authorized by the president. In
 addition to federal and state-government newspapers,
 there are a number of privately owned dailies, weeklies
 and magazines. All of the media are frequently
 critical of federal and state government policies.
 The government is attentive to such criticism and
 public reaction to it and there have been no efforts
 at censorship. In August 1981, three opposition
 newspapers were briefly shut down and the editors
 arrested for writing allegedly seditious anti-govern-
 ment news stories. The editors were quickly released
 on bail for later court hearings. The charges were
 subsequently quashed by the court system. There was
 no interruption in the printing of the newspapers.
 The move was widely interpreted as an attempt to
 intimidate the opposition press. As such, it drew
 
 
 192
 strong criticism and the papers involved continue to
 take the government to task regularly. There are
 indications of minor self-censorship by the press in
 the treatment of especially sensitive issues, perhaps
 by delaying publication. Generally, however, the
 press can be described as articulate and aggressive.
 Domestic and foreign books and artistic works are
 freely available. Sometimes, following particularly
 vituperative criticism of the national or state
 legislatures, reporters from various newspapers have
 been banded from the premises. These reporters are
 invariably allowed to return, however. One detention
 of an editor is known, following a series of articles
 critical of the police. The editor was released
 immediately. There is no apparent interference with
 academic inquiry in the natural or social sciences.
 There are 42 industrial unions and one labor federa-
 tion, the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC), to which all
 the unions belong. Unions, with the exception of those
 involved in "essential services," such as postal opera-
 tions and transport, have the right to organize, bargain
 collectively and strike. In fact, even those unions in
 the essential service sector often carry out work
 stoppages and slowdowns. There is no indication of
 government harassment of professionals or labor groups.
 A group of labor leaders was banned in 1972 as a result
 of an investigation of corruption and foreign ties in
 the labor movementl there have been recent calls to
 allow them to participate in labor activities.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and are respected.
 Nigeria has not historically been afflicted with a
 serious refugee problem. Prior to the coup against
 Equatorial Guinea's President Macias in August 1979,
 as many as 500 Equatorial Guineans fled to eastern
 Nigeria. Most of the refugees were assimilated into
 the local economy and are not dependent on the govern-
 ment for assistance.
 More recently, the civil war in Chad has resulted in
 an exodus of refugees into Nigeria. In March 1980, a
 government commission reported about 6 to 7,000
 Chadian refugees in northern Nigeria. After March the
 inflow increased substantially and the Nigerian
 government estimated about 50,000 Chadian refugees in
 Bornu state in late 1980.
 
 
 193
 The refugees generally are adequately treated.
 Approximately one-quarter are housed in three camps
 in Bornu state, with the remainder in private dwellings.
 During the past three months the government has spent
 3.2 million naira ($5.9 million) to support those in
 camps. In addition, the government has a commitment
 to provide one naira a day stipends for those outside
 camps, most of whom have taken up residence with
 relatives in the area and have been more or less
 integrated into the subsistence economy.
 Refugees are free to return to Chad, though few are
 apparently exercising this option.
 There are no refugees fleeing Nigeria nor is there any
 evidence of forceful repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens 18 years of age or older are allowed
 and encouraged to vote. About 34 percent of registered
 voters participated in the 1979 elections. Opposition
 groups exist openly and the system encourages their active
 participation or suffrage.
 Women in Nigeria are entitled to all rights guaranteed
 under the Nigerian constitution and can challenge anyone
 who attempts to interfere with the exercise of these
 rights. Under statutory and customary law as well as
 custom, however, they do not enjoy the status of men
 in many areas. An unmarried woman who is 21 or above
 has the legal capacity to sue and be sued, to buy and
 sell property, to engage in business or a profession
 and to choose her own residence.- However, married
 women cannot own property or enter into loan or pur-
 chase agreements without the consent of their husbands,
 nor can they obtain passports or travel outside the
 country without their husbands' consent.
 Further examples of discrimination against women
 include an absence under customary law of rights to their
 husbands' property or income, apart from the right to
 support, and limitations on the right of divorced women
 to remarry. There is no law against a married woman's
 working but, except in government service, there is no
 guarantee of equal pay for equal work. Traditional
 education for women is limited to homemaking skills.
 No statistics are currently available on the degree of
 participation of women in business or the professions,
 although there are significant numbers in law and
 medicine. Almost all marketing in southern Nigeria is
 controlled by women, who often belong to politically
 powerful market women's associations. Most of the
 states have at least one woman in their houses of
 assembly and cabinets. There are three women in the
 house of representatives, a cabinet minister, and a
 minister of state. No statistics on numbers of women
 in civil service are available, although they seem to
 be employed generally at lower levels. The federal
 and state governments and women's groups, such as the
 National Council of Women, are actively working on
 women's problems and rights.

 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Nigerians have maintained a high interest in
 human rights violations throughout Africa and have been
 willing to consider violations in other countries.
 During a 1980 meeting of the African Bar Association in
 Nairobi, the Nigerians were in the forefront of those
 calling for a committee to investigate human rights
 violations in Africa. Nigeria has participated actively
 in the plans and programs of the United Nations High
 Commission on Refugees. No requests by an international
 or nongovernmental institution to investigate human
 rights conditions in Nigeria are known. Amnesty
 International maintains an office in Lagos and the
 Nigerian Bar Association has a human rights committee
 to monitor the government's implementation of human
 rights provisions in the constitution.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Nigeria has a mixed economy, with government ownership
 especially noticeable in energy production, which
 accounts for 95 percent of exports and 80 percent of
 government revenues. A major oil producer, Nigeria is
 the second largest foreign supplier to the US, providing
 14 percent of US oil imports (which accounts for 50
 percent of Nigeria's oil exports).
 Most other businesses outside of the energy, transporta-
 tion, communications and banking areas are in private
 hands, but local laws and regulations allow extensive
 monitoring by the government of most of the economy.
 Nigeria's per capita GNP, estimated by the World Bank
 at $670 in 1979, exceed the African average. The
 average annual growth rate over the past three years
 has been an estimated 8 percent. The aggregated
 figure is misleading, however, since oil exports
 account for so much of the country's current wealth.
 A substantial portion of the population in the far
 interior is only peripherally involved in the country's
 cash economy.
 The situation of the urban worker is difficult, with
 inflation, high food costs, and shortages of housing and
 other services. The rural majority faces the additional
 problem of access to these needs, a result of the inade-
 quate distribution, transportation, and communication
 systems. The government recognizes the need to ameliorate
 these serious problems: in his first speeches after
 coming to office, President Shagari stressed his commit-
 ment to improving the situation relative to the food,
 shelter and housing requirements of the individual.
 The objective that "suitable and adequate shelter and
 adequate food, reasonable national minimum living wage,
 old age pensions, and unemployment and sick benefits
 are provided for all citizens" is embodied in the consti-
 tution.
 
 
 195
 Nigeria continues to face severe and chronic health
 problems, but is moving to overcome them. The fourth
 development plan includes a basic health services
 scheme (BlSS), which is meant to expand health services
 to the rural areas. The government plans to
 spend two billion naira (about $3.06 billion) in a
 ten-year program to provide all Nigerians with ready
 access to primary health care facilities. This
 ultimately will include a network of four-bed clinics
 to serve the rural population, 14-bed primary health
 centers, and 30-bed comprehensive health centers, in
 addition to existing large university and other hospitals
 in major population centers. The BHSS has been slow
 in taking off, due to lack of equipment and trained
 .personnel.
 In a country once popularly considered among the world's
 most unhealthy, current life expectancy at birth (49
 years) now compares with the average throughout Africa.
 The infant mortality rate (154 per thousand live
 births) is slightly higher than the African average,
 due in part to waterborne diseases and infections in
 the birth-through-five years age group. A functioning
 medical community exists within the country,. although
 many physicians trained abroad fail to return to
 Nigeria following their studies. In spite of a one
 hundred percent increase over the past five years in
 the number of doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, severe
 shortages still exist in the face of the government's
 ambitious expansion plans.
 While World Bank and PAO figures show a deficiency in
 calorie supply available for consumption as compared
 to theoretical nutrition requirements (83 percent),
 this figure is only a rough indicator. True starva-
 tion is rare; the tropical environment furnishes a
 variety of easily-grown foods, and the overall deficit
 currently can he met by imports financed by the country's
 substantial oil revenues. An intensive "Green Revolution"
 program, designed to offset this shortfall.by reversing
 the declining trend in local agricultural production, is
 among the government's top priorities, though so far this
 program is encountering problems.
 The current literacy rate is estimated at well above
 25 percent, ascompared with 15.4 percent in 1970.
 National development plans call for providing free
 primary and secondary education for all children.
 World Bank and UNESCO figures show adjusted primary
 school enrollment currently at 62 percent (1979
 figures), up from 32 percent nine years earlier.
 Nigeria has some of West Africa's largest and best
 known universitiesl there are currently more than
 52,000 undergraduate students enrolled in over 17
 college-level institutions.
