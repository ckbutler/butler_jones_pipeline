 MALI
 Following its independence from France in 1960, Mali was ruled
 in succession by a pro-Marxist regime and a military
 government. Since 1979, Mali's civilian political leaders,
 under President Moussa Traore, have reduced the direct role of
 the military in government and increased the role of the sole
 political party, the Democratic Union of the Malian People, in
 governing the country. Military officers currently hold about
 a quarter of the senior positions in the Cabinet and the
 party, four of seven governorships, and a portion of the lower
 level administrative posts, mostly in border areas. Most of
 the senior central government officials are technocrats or
 regional political leaders.
 The President, in consultation with his Cabinet and the
 party's Central Committee, makes all of Mali's important
 decisions although the Government also includes an elected
 National Assembly, which has little power.
 In addition to the military, the security apparatus includes
 the gendarmes, the presidential guard, the state security
 unit, and the police which exert considerable, but generally
 low-key influence. While civil rights are officially
 guaranteed in Mali, avenues of recourse tend to be more
 effective through personal rather than official channels.
 Mali in 1984 was characterized by civil calm, despite a
 potentially sensitive situation during a currency changeover
 and continued lack of wage increases. The political and human
 rights situation did not change significantly over the past
 year. The Government permits limited criticism of its
 economic reform policies, though always in the context of
 official party or union meetings. The Government remains
 sensitive to any criticism of its human rights record.
 The World Bank ranks Mali as one of the world's poorest
 countries. Landlocked and lacking easily exploitable mineral
 resources, Mali's economy has been based on farming and animal
 husbandry, both of which have been severely affected in recent
 years by drought.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported incidents of politically motivated
 killing during 1984 in Mali.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported incidents of disappearance, abduction,
 or hostage-taking during 1984 in Mali.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government of Mali does not condone police brutality, but
 physical abuse of suspects has been used in police
 interrogation. Torture rarely occurs and never as a form of
 punishment. Public beatings by the citizenry of persons
 identified as thieves are known to occur, though not regularly.
 
 
 208
 MALI
 When present, police will take such persons into custody
 rather than leave them to impromptu 'public justice.'  Prisons
 in Mali are not cruel or inhuman by design, but lack of
 resources creates poor physical and health conditions.
 Amnesty International has expressed concern over conditions in
 the maximum security prisons in the harsh northern desert.
 Some prisoners are put on work crews and face long hours of
 hard manual labor in the heat of the day. Occasional deaths
 are attributed to such harsh conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests or exile during
 1984 in Mali. The Malian judicial system is based on the
 French model, and the principle of habeas corpus does not
 exist. Bail is not available, but prisoners are sometimes
 released on their own recognizance. Prisoners are usually
 allowed access to a lawyer of their choosing. Administrative
 backlogs often cause delays in bringing people to trial.
 Former government officials have on occasion been held without
 trial until they have repaid embezzled funds.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally short in duration. The defense lawyer
 will tend to argue mitigating circumstances as the prisoner
 has usually admitted guilt. The verdict and sentence are
 rendered by a panel of three judges. The appeals process is
 limited to presidential pardon or call for a new trial. The
 judiciary is part of the executive branch and therefore
 potentially subject to interference. However, the court
 process is more likely to be subverted by private, influential
 means than by government interference. A special court of
 state security hears cases on diversion or embezzlement of
 government funds and operates as the criminal courts do. This
 court held several trials in 1984. Finally, the National
 Assembly can convene the high court of justice to hear cases
 against the state ministers. This court did not meet during
 1984.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Mali's Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the home.
 Searches are infrequent and warrants are issued and recorded,
 albeit sometimes after the fact.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech or of the press is not guaranteed by the
 Malian Constitution, and is in fact limited. The state
 controls all Malian media and does not permit criticism of its
 authority. However, criticism of specific programs, aspects
 of society, or the performance of government offices (rarely
 individuals) is allowed limited expression.
 Journalists, who are all government employees, have been
 suspended or fired due to 'impertinent" questioning, but in
 general have not been subjected to harsh reprisals. Private
 publications of unauthorized information or opinions are not
 tolerated, but international publications, even those critical
 
 
 209
 MALI
 of Mali or its Government, are readily available and circulate
 freely.
 b Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malian Constitution guarantees the liberty of citizens to
 form organizations to protect their "professional interests,'
 but in reality only selected organizations qualify for this
 freedom. Other than urban professional associations, the only
 groups which assemble freely are the women's, youth, and labor
 associations of Mali's single political party. Government
 refusal to authorize an independent student union led in part
 to student protests in 1981. Despite party affiliation,
 Mali's national labor union does maintain a degree of autonomy
 from the Government, even to the point of criticizing
 government wage practices and layoffs of workers. Strikes are
 permitted. Social and religious gatherings or large groups
 require permits which are routinely granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali is a secular state, and the Government generally holds to
 a policy of not discriminating on religious grounds. Ninety
 percent of Malians are Muslim, but most other religions are
 practiced freely and permitted to establish houses of worship
 and schools. Christian missionaries of various faiths enjoy
 government cooperation and are free to proselytize. Religious
 conversion is permitted. However, the Bahai are forbidden to
 proselytize or establish houses of worship, although they are
 free to practice their faith otherwise.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 travelers are sometimes subject to police checks, especially
 at night. These are allowed by law, ostensibly to restrict
 the movement of stolen or contraband goods. In practice, some
 underpaid police and gendarmes are known to supplement their
 usually delayed salaries by assessing fines or confiscating
 goods. Malians are free to change residence or workplace.
 Foreign travel requires an exit visa. Emigration is viewed as
 a relief for poor economic conditions, and repatriation is not
 restricted. Africans from neighboring countries are generally
 allowed to reside in Mali and to seek employment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The only legal political party, the Democratic Union of the
 Malian People, is the supreme political entity in Mali. The
 Government is highly centralized and important policies and
 decisions are made among a small group--the President, the
 19-member Central Executive Bureau (which includes
 representatives from all major political and regional groups
 in Mali), and the Council of Ministers. In these
 circumstances, there is no opportunity for citizens to change
 their government or have influence outside the centralized
 structure. Both the party and the Government have
 representative bodies composed of delegates elected
 country-wide every three years (the last local elections
 concluded in September 1984), but these groups meet only twice
 a year in regular session. Party elections at the local level
 are often contested with multiple candidates, while National
 
 
 210
 MALI
 Assembly elections usually have a single candidate selected by
 the party for each seat. The National Assembly debates
 proposed legislation only after acceptance by the Council of
 Ministers and review by the Supreme Court.
 The role of the military has decreased in recent years but is
 still important. Five of the 19 Executive Bureau members, 5
 of the 17 cabinet ministries, 4 of the 7 regional
 governorships, and numerous lower level positions are
 currently held by military officers.
 While women are free to participate in the Malian political
 process and are present at all levels of Government and the
 party, they continue to be underrepresented. Many women are
 actively involved in governmental and party life at the local
 level. A limited number of women occupy positions of
 responsibility in most ministries. There is one woman in the
 cabinet (Minister of Information), one in the Executive Bureau
 (President of the women's union), and two representatives in
 the National Assembly. The National Union of Malian Women is
 an active political organization under party auspices and a
 channel through which women can voice their concerns.
 While the Government avoids reference to ethnic 'quotas," in
 practice, virtually all ethnic groups are represented at the
 highest state and party levels. In local government, it is
 the Government's practice to assign officials to serve outside
 their native regions. Although some nomadic groups prefer to
 remain outside the economic and political mainstream, Mali
 remains virtually free of ethnic tension.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Mali in the past has been generally
 responsive to calls by recognized groups such as Amnesty
 International in regard to reported human rights violations.
 However, according to Amnesty International's 1984 Report (for
 1983), Mali did not respond to its appeal of October 1983
 expressing concern about alleged cruel, inhuman, and degrading
 treatment of political and other prisoners at two remote
 desert prisons. Mali itself has no known local human rights
 organizations. Human rights issues are handled officially by
 the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Justice. Mali does not
 play a major role in international human rights forums and has
 not been the focus of scrutiny in these meetings. Mali is a
 signatory to the U.N. Convenants on Civil and Political Rights
 and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the African
 Charter on Human and People's Rights. Freedom House terms
 Mali 'not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mali is ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world.
 Real per capita GNP ($177 in 1982) has stagnated. Mali's
 resources in no way match the country's needs. The country is
 caught between the recognition that true development may be
 slow and long-term and the immediate needs of a population
 which has little or no resources, due in part to the vagaries
 of nature and government policies. Economic opportunities and
 emergency food aid resources appear to be distributed on a
 non-discriminatory basis, but Malians living closer to or in
 urban centers or who work for the government generally have
 
 
 211
 MALI
 greater access to government services and resources. The same
 is true of education and health care, the latter of which is
 poor even in the capital.
 Mali's population is 7,562,000 people and growing at a rate of
 2.3 percent annually. Malians born in 1984 can expect to live
 an average of 45 years. While life expectancy has increased,
 deteriorating health conditions due to the severe drought
 during the past 3 years, have also led to a rise of infant
 mortality from 168.4 per thousand in 1983 to 174.3 per
 thousand in 1984. Caloric intake has been dropping rather
 than rising. Only a relatively small percentage of the
 population (9 percent) has access to safe water, although the
 percentage is higher for urban dwellers (42 percent) than for
 rural dwellers (3 percent). Education is free to all but only
 9 percent of the population is literate. Of the 27 percent of
 the children who do attend school, approximately 40 percent
 are female and 60 percent male.
 The role of women is negatively affected in Mali more by
 social, cultural, and general poverty factors than by
 political or economic determinants. Custom often restricts
 women to 'women's issues" when they do participate in
 politics. The women's union promotes health and education
 issues and has disseminated information on the disadvantages
 of female circumcision, but the practice is still widely
 followed, without government sanction, throughout Mali.
