 MACAU
 Macau, a tiny enclave on the south China coast encompassing only 6 square
 miles, is recognized by both China and Portugal as Chinese territory under Por-
 tuguese administration. The "Organic Statute! of 1976, which serves as Macau's
 Constitution, grants it considerable administrative, financial, and legislative auton-
 omy.
 Legislative power is shared between the Portuguese Government and Macau's
 Legislative Assembly. The Governor, apinted by the Portuguese President, holds
 expansive powers under the statute. Portuguese metropolitan law serves as the
 basis for the legal system, which features a judiciary and jury trials. The police force
 is under the control of the civilian authorities.
 Under the 1987 Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, Macau will become a Special
 Administrative Region (SAR) of China on December 20, 1999, and operate under the
 principle of "one country, two systems," to remain unchanged for 50 years. The
 Macau SAWs future Constitution, called the 'Basic Law,' was promulgated on
 March 31, 1993.
 Macau's economy is fueled by legalized gambling, which has produced a thriving
 tourist industry, and by the export of textiles and other light industrial products.

 With a population of approximately 400,000 people, Macau has a per capita gross
 domestic product of approximately $14,100.
 Although Macau citizens derive a wide range of rights and freedoms from Macau's
 status as a Portuguese territory, they have limited-ability to change their govern-
 ment. The Governor is appointed by the Portuguese President only a third of the
 legislators are directly elected, and the teritrs future path has been set by Lis-
 bn and Beijing. China, through the Basic Law, has agreed to continue the applica-
 tion of international covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social,
 and cultural rights after 1999. The involuntary transfer by Macau police to Chinese
 authorities of an Australian citizen of Chinese ancestry drew international criticism
 in 1994. In addition, human rights advocates and journalists believe that the 1993
 reorganization of Macau's judiciary has resulted in a significant erosion of judicial
 independence and contributed to journalistic self-censorship which has increased as
 the day of reversion approaches.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such abuses are prohibited by law, and this prohibition is respected.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal prohibitions against arbitrary ar-
 rest exist. The examining judge, who conducts a pretrial inquiry in criminal cases,
 has a wide range of powers to collect evidence, order or dismiss indictments, vali-
 date and maintain the detention of suspects, and determine whether to release ac-
 cused persons. Police must present persons remanded in custody to an examining
 judge within 48 hours of detention. The accused's counsel may examine the evi-
 denc. If the judge is not convinced that the evidence is adequate he may dismiss
 the accused.
 Macau police on a number of occasions reportedly have detained residents and
 visitors for alleged commercial and criminal violations in China and handed over
 these persons to Chinese authorities for incarceration in China, despite the absence
 of a Sino-Portuguese extradition treaty. This practice recently drew international at-
 tention when James Peng, an overseas Chinese businessman traveling on an Aus-
 tralian passport, was removed from his room in a Macau hotel and transported to
 China for detention for an indefinite period. According to his lawyer, Peng's requests
 for legal representation and contact with the Australian Consulate were denied. At
 year's end, he remained in jail after waiting more than 12 months for charges to
 be filed against him. Despite the fact that a trial was held in November, announce-
 ment of the verdict has den   poned pending review of the proceedings by au-
 thorities in Beijing. The Chinese Government notified Peng recently of its decision
 to bring new charges against him related to allegations of nonpayment of his par-
 ents' rent in Shenzhen (China).
 Another extradition issue concerns the recent extradition to China of two pris-
 oners accused of crimes that in China are punishable by the death penalty. In this
 case, the Macau Supreme Court authorized the extradition, despite Article 33 of the
 Portuguese Constitution which forbids the extradition of persons to countries which
 practice the death penalty. This case has been appealed to the European Human
 Rights Commission in Strasbourg and to the Constitutional Court in Lisbon. A deci-
 sion is expected in early 1995. Macau authorities have not approved any extra-
 ditions pending this decision.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-Macau law provides for a fair trial. Journalists
 and human rights activists claim that the judicial branch reorganization imple-
 mented in 1993 has eroded the independence of the judiciary. Oversight bodies es-
 tablished to recommend judicial appointments and reappointments are comprised of
 a majority of nonmagisterial members who have strong ties to the executive branch
 and to China. Human rights advocates and journalists believe that this increased
 executive influence over the judiciary has prejudiced court decisions, particularly
 the prosecution of journalists for charges of defamation and abuse of press freedom.
 In one current case involving freedom of the press, the judge who will determine
 the outcome of the case against the journalist will have his reappointment decided
 by an oversight panel whose membership includes the same person who originally
 brought the charges against the jurnalist.
 Juries determine questions of fact in criminal cases. At present, Macau's courts
 are semi-autonomous from the Portuguese judicial system. Macau's Supreme Court
 
 
 was established in April 1992. In cases involving "basic rights of the citizen," de-
 fendants still can appeal to Portugal's Constitutional Court, which may overturn all
 lower court rulings. After reversion, when the Macau judicial system becomes com-
 pletely autonomous, the power of final adjudication in the Macau SAR will be vested
 in Macau's court of final appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Famil, Home, or Correspondence.-Laws
 provide for the inviolability of the home and of communication, the right of owner-
 ship of private property and enterprises, and the freedom to marry and raise a fam-
 ily. There is no indication of abuses of these rights by the Government.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Journalists and human rights activists believe
 the practice of both academic and media self-censorship is increasing in Macau as
 reversion approaches. The Government owns a majority share of the radio and tele-
 vision service.
 Most of Macau's newspapers appear to be pro-China publications which critics
 charge do not give equal coverage to liberal and prodemocracy voices. Journalists
 assert that self-censorship is growing among newspaper reporters, some of whom ex-
 press fears that they will lose their jobs if they criticize China or government policy.
 In 1994 seventeen journalists issued a plea or Portuguese President Mario Soares
 to investigate violations of press freedom in Macau. The journalists accused the
 Macau government radio station of suppressing broadcasting of the journalists' ac-
 cusations, including complaints that the 1992 revision of the judicial stem "fails
 to safeguard fundamental rights" set out in the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.
 Since the begiIng of 1994, the Government has markedly increased its prosecu-
 tion of journ  t on       es of abuse of press freedom. In the previous 3 years,
 three complaints of abuse of press freedom were prosecuted. Since January the Gov-
 ernment brought eight cases against journalists for criticizing the Government or
 persons appointed by the Government to high-level positions. Macau government ex-
 ecutive branch appointees are complainants in these. Reporters an  uman rights
 advocates believe that the executive branch influenced judicial handling of these
 cases through the recently established judicial council of Macau, largely comprised
 of pro-Government and pro-China persons who make recommendations on the ap-
 pointment and reappointment of judges. As noted above (Section i.e.), reporters and
 human rights advocates have expressed concern that the person who filed the com-
 plaint in a current case against a reporter also sits on the panel which will rec-
 ommend tenure for the judge deciding the case.
 There are signs that constraints on academic freedom of speech are beginning to
 emerge. The participant list for an academic conference on public administration
 held in Macau in 1994 was submitted in advance to the New China News Agency
 (NCNA) office in Macau for approval. Some academics acknowledge that they avoid
 research on controversial topics which might entail criticism of China.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government respects legal
 guarantees of these freedoms. Although it restricts demonstrations to a limited
 number of "approved locations with sufficient space to accommodate the crowds and
 continues to ban any protests within 30 meters of government buildings, the list of
 approved sites includes the square in front of city hail and other central city loca-
 tions.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Members of all religions practice their faiths freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within the enclave; emigration
 and foreign travel are unlimited. The Government reports that about 105,000 of
 Macau's 400,000 inhabitants have the right of abode in Portugal.
 The Government's official policy since 1982 has been to refuse asylum to all Viet-
 namese boat people arriving in Macau waters. With the approach of Macau's and
 Hong Kong's reversion to China, Vietnamese boat people prefer to travel further
 north to Japan and Korea. Only three or four boat people remain in Macau.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have a limited ability to change their government. In a by-election in the
 summer of 1992, six members were added to the Legislative Assembly (two ap-
 pointed, two elected, two indirectly elected through limited membership organiza-
 tions recognized by the Government). The 23-member Legislative Assembly is com-
 posed of 8 members elected in universal direct elections; 8 indirectly elected by local
 community interests; and 7 appointed by the Governor. The Consultative Council,
 an advisory group to the Governor composed of elected and appointed members, also
 
 
 925
 provides some measure of popular representation. By tradition, the Government also
 consults informally on a reguLa basis with local business and cultural leaders.
 Some independent political candidates charge that the Macau Government un-
 fairly assists progovernment candidates in elections to the Legislative Assembly.
 Government funds allocated to neighborhood associations are used to pay for free
 meals and gifts to win voter support for progovernment candidates. Similar treat-
 ment is not extended to candidates who are critical of the Government or China.
 Although women traditionally have played a minor role in local political life, they
 increasingly are being found in senior positions throughout the admninistration. The
 Legislative Assembly has three female members including the President of the A-
 sembly, which is the second most senior position. The Under Secretary for Health
 and Social Affairs is a womsn, and other high-level positions in admnitrative min-
 istries, including education and statistics, are illed b y women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Macau human rights organizations in 1994 claimed that the Government at-
 tempted to punish a public school teacher for her involvement in Amnesty Inter-
 national activities in Macau. Human rights advocates both in Macau and Lisbon
 strongly protested a government decision to discontinue her contract. Subsequently,
 Macau government officials notified the teacher that she could continue her employ-
 ment with the Government.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women are becoming more active and visible in business and govern-
 ment, and some enjoy considrable influence and responsibility in these areas. Anec-
 dotal information indicates women in the private sector do not receive equal pay for
 equal work. Statistical evidence on this issue is not available.
 Cases of violence against women are not common. For cases that are reported,
 Macau's criminal statutes prohibiting domestic violence are enforced and violators
 prosecuted. Police and doctors report abuses to the Social Welfare Department,
 which investigates them. If hospital treatment is required, a medical social worker
 counsels the victim and informs her about social wefa  services. Until their com-
 plaints are resolved, battered women may be placed in public housing, but no facili-
 ties are reserved especially for them.
 Children.-Child abuse and exploitation are not widespread problems in Macau.
 While the Government provides some funds for children's welfare and protection
 services, most such services are provided by nongovernmental entities such as
 churches and community organizations. The Government has not promulgated any
 statutes specifically to protect the rights of children, relying on the general frame-
 work of civil and political rights legislation to protect all citizens.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The law guarantees freedom from discrimi-
 nation. Although Macau's governmental and legal systems place a premium on
 knowledge of the Portuguese l   age, which is spe n by less than 4 percent of
 the population, the offic l use of Chinese in the civil service is growing.
 There is significant public pressure for the Government to speed up the process
 of making the civil service more representative of the population; however, the pace
 of localization has been very slow. In January 1993, the Government gave the Chi-
 nese language official status and the same legal force as Portuguese.
 People With Disabiites.-The extent to which physically disabled persons experi-
 ence discrimination in employment, education, and the provision of state services is
 not known. The Government gives little attention to the subject, and there is little
 funding for special programs aimed at helping the physically and mentally disabled
 gain better access to employment, education, and public facilities. The Government
 has not mandated accessibility for the disabled legislatively or otherwise.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Macau labor law recognizes the right and freedom
 of all workers to form and join trade unions and of pnvate sector unions to strike.
 The Government neither impedes the formation of trade unions nor discriminates
 against union members.
 Mainland Chinese interests heavily influence local trade union activities, includ-
 ing the selection of union leadership and stress the importance of stability and min-
 imum disruption of the work force. Nearly all of Macau's 7,000 private sector union
 members belong to a pro-China labor confederation. Many local observers claim that
 this organization is mre interested in furthering the Chinese political agenda in
 Macau than in addressing classic trade union issues. A few private sector unions
 and two of the four public sector unions are outside Chinese control. Although the
 
 
 926
 Portuguese Constitution guarantees workers the right to strike, labor leaders in
 Macau complain that there is no effective protection from retribution should they
 exercise this right.
 Macau unions may freely form federations and affiliate with international bodies.
 Three civil service unions are affiliated with the major non-Communist Portuguese
 union confederation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions tend to resemble local
 traditional neighborhood associations, promoting social and cultural activities rather
 than issues relating to the workplace. Local customs, moreover, normally favor em-
 ployment without the benefit of written labor contracts-except in the case of labor
 from China. Unions traditionally have not attempted to engage in collective bargain-
 ing. Portuguese laws protecting collective bargaining apply to Macau and the Gov-
 ernment does not impede or discourage it. No rules apply to the setting of wages
 and no minimum wage exists for local or foreign workers.
 However, a significant amount of the total work force (approximately 16 percent)
 is composed of laborers from China and other countries who fill both blue- and
 white-collar positions. These workers often work for less than half the wages paid
 to a Macau resident performing the same job, live in controlled dormitories, work
 10 to 12 hours a day, and owe 1arge sums of money to the labor importing company
 for the purchase of their job. The high percentage of imported labor erodes the bar-
 aining power of local residents to improve working conditions and increase wages.
 The total number of imported laborers is 28,000, out of a total employed work force
 of approximately 171,000. There are no government mechanisms to prevent vol-
 untary negotiations.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination and there were no complaints of it in
 1994.
 There are no export processing zones; all of Macau is a free port.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is illegal and
 does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law forbids minors under the
 age of 15 to work--except in businesses operated by their families. The Macau
 Labor Department which enforces this law refers offending employers to the judicial
 authorities for prosecution. The Labor Department claims that the incidence of child
 labor has declined radically since effective enforcement began in 1985. Throughout
 1993 and up to October 1994, the Macau courts received no complaints of child labor
 violations. School attendance in Macau is not compulsory.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the absence of any statutory minimum wage
 or publicly administered social security programs, some large companies have pro-
 vided private welfare and security packages. Calls for labor reform, medical insur-
 ance, a social security system, and increases in employee compensation figure regu-
 larly in political campaign platforms. To offset a current labor shortage, the Govern-
 ment allows the importation of labor from China and other countries under contract,
 while at the same time imposing heavy fines on employers harboring illegal immi-
 grants.
 Labor legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek, an 8-hour workday, overtime,
 annual leave, medical and maternity care, and employee compensation insurance.
 Although Article 17 of Macau's labor law provides a 24-hour rest period for every
 7 days of work, worker representatives report that workers frequently agree to work
 overtime to compensate for low wages. The Department of Labor provides assistance
 and legal advice to workers on request, but government enforcement of labor laws
 is lax because of limited resources. According to government statistics for 1993, 32.7
 percent of the work force worked 7 days per week.
 The Department of Labor enforces laws on occupational safety and health. Accord-
 ing to the Government, 625 infractions of occupational safety and health laws had
 occurred up to October. This number represents approximately a 50 percent de-
 crease from the previous year. Failure to correct infractions leads to government
 prosecution. Although a recent law states that employers should provide safe work-
 ing conditions, no guarantee exists to protect employees' right to continued employ-
 ment if they refuse to work under dangerous conitions.
