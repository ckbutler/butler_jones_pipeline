 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military
 intervention of 1974, an event which followed a coup d'etat
 directed from Greece. Since that time, the southern part of
 the country has been under the control of the Government of
 the Republic of Cyprus, and the northern part under an
 autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the
 presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 this administration
 proclaimed itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
 which has been recognized only by Turkey. It held a
 constitutional referendum and presidential and legislative
 elections in 1985.
 The political systems of the Republic of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot administration are democratic and based on
 free elections, and they guarantee basic human rights to their
 populations in theory and practice.
 Both Cypriot economies are founded on the free enterprise
 system with stress on private initiative and the right to own
 property, although the Turkish Cypriot economy provides a far
 greater role for state enterprises.
 The conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
 during the 1963-74 period, the Turkish intervention in 1974,
 and the ensuing presence of Turkish troops in the north have
 led to continuing charges of human rights violations. These
 events resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
 Cypriots from the northern and southern parts of the island
 respectively, and the loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods.
 Greek Cypriots point to these displacements, the continuing
 Turkish troop presence, Greek Cypriots missing as a result of
 the 1974 events, and Turkish Cypriot unwillingness to allow
 Greek Cypriot resettlement and travel in the north as the
 fundamental human rights questions in Cyprus today. In
 contrast, Turkish Cypriots assert the 1974 intervention was
 legal and necessary to save their community from destruction.
 They also raise the issue of missing persons, focusing on
 Turkish Cypriots who disappeared during the 1963-1974 period.
 The subsequent regrouping of the two communities in separate
 parts of the island, according to Turkish Cypriots, was
 necessary for their security.
 In August 1984 the U.N. Secretary General launched an
 initiative to achieve a just and lasting resolution of the
 Cyprus'problem. His efforts are continuing.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killings instigated by government or opposition
 groups .have not occurred in Cyprus since 1974. However, there
 was politically motivated violence on.Cyprus in 1985 carried
 out by non-Cypriots and related to Middle Eastern conflicts.
 A Libyan was killed in Nicosia on April 2, three Israelis were
 murdered by Palestinian terrorists in Larnaca on September 25,
 a Syrian was killed in Limassol on September 27, and an Iraqi
 was killed in Nicosia on November 8. Those arrested for the
 Larnaca killings have been tried and convicted.

 CYPRUS
 b. Disappearance
 Since 1974, there have been no reports of persons abducted,
 secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention. However,
 the issue of persons missing during the 1963-74 period remains
 a source of dispute between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
 Cypriot communities. A tripartite committee on Missing
 Persons was established under the auspices of the U.N.
 Secretary General in 1981, and its investigations are
 continuing.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice in
 both communities. Adequate health care is provided in prison
 and detention facilities, and diet is considered normal.
 Family members may visit those in detention. After
 sentencing, prisoners may be visited once a month, or more
 frequently where humanitarian needs exist. Attorneys may
 visit prisoners freely.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice by the Government of Cyprus and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. The right of habeas corpus is
 observed. Preventive detention does not exist in law, nor has
 it been reported in practice. No one may be held for more
 than 3 days for investigation of a crime without referral of
 the case to the courts for extension of the period of
 detention. Most periods of investigative detention do not
 exceed 8 or 10 days before formal charges are filed. No
 instance of exile was reported. No complaints of forced or
 compulsory labor were reported. Thete are no political
 prisoners on Cyprus.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both parts of Cyprus, fair public trial is guaranteed by
 law. The judiciary is independent of executive or military
 control. In September, for example, the Supreme Court of the
 Republic of Cyprus ruled the military courts of the Greek
 Cypriot National Guard unconstitutioml on grounds that their
 judges were appointed by the Council of Ministers, not by the
 Supreme Council of Judges. Cases aregenerally tried before a
 judge or panel of judges, although a request for a jury trial
 is usually granted. There are no special courts to deal with
 security or political offenses. Civilians are not tried by
 military courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference withPrivacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and thebasic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community provideguarantees protecting
 the individual against arbitrary interference. A judicial
 warrant is required, for example, fora police official to
 enter a private residence. Abuses ofprivacy run counter to
 the democratic traditions of both comunities. However,
 Turkish Cypriots complain that mail ming through the
 
 
 944
 CYPRUS
 Republic of Cyprus postal system is often delayed, opened, or
 not delivered.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are guaranteed by law and are widely and freely
 practiced. The press is free throughout the island and
 represents the entire political spectrum. Opposition papers
 frequently criticize the authorities. There is no press
 censorship.
 The authorities control radio and television. Although
 opposition and minority parties complain that they do not
 receive sufficient attention from these media, the
 proliferation of party and independent newspapers in both
 communities enables ideas and arguments to circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right, based on law, to associate, organize, and hold
 meetings is respected in practice.
 Trade unions and confederations, both non-Communist and
 Communist, are free to organize on both sides of the line
 which divides the two communities. Labor authorities are
 required by law to mediate disputes in cases which cannot be
 solved through normal collective bargaining. All Cypriot
 workers are permitted to strike, although both the Government
 of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot authorities have the power
 to curtail strikes in what are deemed to be essential
 services. Each has used it once in 1985, in both cases in
 relation to striking electricity authority workers.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in
 international meetings. The Government of Cyprus has taken a
 particularly active role in the International Labor
 Organization. Labor unions, more than most other
 organizations on Cyprus, attempt to maintain contact and
 cooperation across the dividing line.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected on Cyprus. The Greek
 Orthodox Church in the south has the character of a state
 institution. Since the law does not accord conscientious
 objector status to any individual or group, there have been
 arrests, military trials, and imprisonments of Greek Cypriot
 Jehovah's Witnesses for their refusal of military service.
 Since the Supreme Court's finding in September that the
 National Guard's military courts were unconstitutional, those
 who were convicted and imprisoned by the military courts,
 including some Jehovah's Witnesses, have been released. If
 the Government reconstitutes the military courts along the
 constitutional lines specified by the Supreme Court, those
 released could again be subject to trial and imprisonment.
 Although members of the Latin, Maronite, and Armenian
 minorities cannot serve in the Greek Cypriot National Guard,
 this exemption is based on ethnic rather than religious
 considerations and is generally welcomed by the minorities
 themselves.
 
 
 945
 CYPRUS
 Approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots still live in the south of
 the island, and they are allowed to practice their religion
 freely. In the north, non-Muslims include members of the
 Christian Maronite minority, a small number of remaining Greek
 Cypriots, and foreign residents--all of whom are free to
 practice their religion. Nevertheless, there have been
 complaints that the welfare of minorities in the north is
 impaired by Turkish Cypriot restrictions on housing, water,
 education, and movement. The United Nations Force in Cyprus
 monitors the welfare of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites in
 the north as well as that of the Turkish Cypriots in the south.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of
 movement within their respective areas. Turkish Cypriot
 authorities regulate travel into or out of the Turkish Cypriot
 area. They barGreeks and Greek Cypriots from entering the
 north and Turkish Cypriots from visiting the south, except
 when traveling for humanitarian, medical, or other special
 reasons. The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of
 enclaves to visit the south are usually granted, but the
 applicants must return within a designated period or risk
 losing their right to return and their property. Foreigners
 coming from the south must obtain permission to enter the
 north. At the same time, the Government of Cyprus bars the
 entry into the Greek Cypriot area of foreigners who arrive at
 Turkish Cypriot ports. Those who enter through the south but
 wish to stay overnight in the north are discouraged from doing
 so by the Government. Special regulations apply to
 journalists.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed,
 although individuals facing military service or legal action
 in either part of Cyprus may not be allowed to travel.
 Turkish Cypriots have difficulty in traveling to some
 countries because their travel documents, issued by the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities, are not recognized. Citizens may
 repatriate freely.
 Refugees who come to Cyprus from Eastern Europe are normally
 sent to third countries as soon as arrangements for their
 resettlement can be made.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community are democratically elected. In
 their lively multiparty political systems, parties actively
 and without restriction compete for popular support. Greek
 Cypriots and Maronites living in the north--the latter having
 chosen before 1960 to be regarded as members of the Greek
 Cypriot community--do not participate in Turkish Cypriot
 elections but elect their own village officials. They are
 eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must make
 their way to the south in order to exercise their right.
 Women are less active in politics than men in both north and
 south, although this is due to custom rather than to any legal
 impediment. No woman in the north and only one in the south
 is a member of Parliament, nor are there currently any women
 of ministerial rank in the north. A woman serves as Attorney
 
 
 946
 CYPRUS
 General in the.Government of Cyprus. Two women currently
 serve as under secretaries in the Turkish Cypriot
 administration.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude-Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Cyprus participates actively in the work of the U.N.
 Commission on Human Rights. For several years the question of
 human rights in Cyprus relating to the events of 1974 has been
 on the Commission's agenda but has been regularly postponed by
 agreement-of the parties directly concerned. However, the
 Government of Cyprus.has repeatedly raised elsewhere the
 question of missing persons unaccounted for since 1974.
 Representatives of international human rights organizations
 have open-access to both the south and the north.
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International was concerned about the imprisonment of
 Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing on grounds of conscience to
 perform military service. Freedom House rated the*Greek
 Cypriot area "free" _and the Turkish Cypriot area "partly free"
 because of the Turkish troop presence.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The island of Cyprus had a population of 665,000 in 1985, of
 which about four-fifths were Greek-Cypriots and about
 one-fifth Turkish.Cypriots. Per capita gross, national product
 in the south in 1983, according to World Bank figures, was
 $3,720. Per capita GNP in the north, according to most
 estimates, is believed to be one-third that in the south.
 The relatively prospering economy in the south it based on
 manufacturing, trade, tourism and services, construction, and
 agriculture. The economy in the north, which is closely
 linked to that of Turkey, is heavily based on agriculture and
 has problems with high inflation, low-investment, and
 significant underemployment.
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to
 members of both communities regardless of race, religion,
 ethnic background, or political opinion. Both societies are
 essentially middle class, with a small but prominent wealthy
 segment. Housing is adequate and is available for displaced
 persons. Most Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish, are covered
 by a national health service system Illiteracy is virtually
 unknown among adult persons below the age of 55.
 The minimum age for the employment of children in an
 "industrial undertaking" is set at the age of 14. The Cyprus
 Constitution provides that "every person has the right to a
 decent existence," and there is extensive legislation
 guaranteeing acceptable conditions for workers with respect to
 minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and
 health.
 Throughout Cyprus, the legal status of women is identical to
 that of men. However, customs have retarded the full
 participation of women in all aspects of public life.
 Politics, for example, has traditionally been a male preserve
 in Cyprus. Through changing attitudes, however, women are
 experiencing increasing mobility.
