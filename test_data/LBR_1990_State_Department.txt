 LIBERIA
 At the beginning of 1990, Liberia was a nation which, while
 theoretically under a constitution and legal system patterned
 on America's, was in essence ruled by one man: Samuel K. Doe,
 through his army and political party. In late December 1989,
 a small group of insurgents from the National Patriotic Front
 of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor, crossed into Liberia
 from the Ivory Coast to attack government targets in
 northeastern Liberia's Niba county. The Armed Forces of
 Liberia (AFL) responded by carrying out a brutal series of
 attacks on civilian targets in Nimba, singling out members of
 the Mano and Gio tribes for retribution because of their
 perceived support for the rebels.
 The Gio and Mano responded by siding with the insurgents and,
 in turn, targeting Doe's tribe (the Krahn), along with the
 Mandingo, whose role as small merchants made them unpopular,
 and many of whom were perceived as supporting the government.
 The insurgency spread throughout Liberia, but, although NPFL
 forces reached the suburbs of Monrovia in early June, they
 were unable to defeat the AFL. By early July all semblance of
 the old government's authority had vanished, leaving a
 stalemate in which various military commanders wielded de
 facto executive and judicial power in their respective areas
 of control. Eventually the NPFL was driven back by a
 five-nation West African Peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), which
 entered Monrovia at the end of August, and a splinter rebel
 group, the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia
 (INPFL), led by former Taylor military commander Prince
 Johnson. An "Interim Government of National Unity" (IGNU),
 formed in Banjul in August by Liberian exiles, with Amos
 Sawyer as President, was then able to enter Monrovia and
 slowly begin to assert administrative control over the ravaged
 city. The three warring factions (NPFL, INPFL, and AFL) met
 in Banjul on December 20-21 and agreed to hold additional
 meetings to work towards a cease-fire and holding another
 all-Liberia conference in Liberia to form an interim
 government within 60 days.
 Both the rebel and the AFL soldiers killed innocent civilians
 for reasons ranging from ethnic identity to suspected
 collaboration with one of the other sides. Most of the
 soldiers involved in the conflict are poorly trained and
 barely, if at all, disciplined. Their behavior has been the
 greatest source of human rights abuses in Liberia in 1990, and
 they are collectively responsible for the deaths of thousands
 of civilians.
 Liberia began 1990 with a mixed economy based on traditional
 agriculture and exports of iron ore, rubber, and timber.
 Virtually all export activity has ceased, and a great deal of
 the traditional agriculture has been disrupted by the massive
 population displacements caused by the war. With the
 exception of a single rubber plantation operating behind rebel
 lines, almost all organized economic activity had ceased at
 year's end.
 The overall human rights situation in Liberia in 1990 was
 appalling. All combatants routinely engaged in indiscriminate
 killing and abuse of civilians, looting, and ethnically based
 executions, with one of the worst single episodes occurring in
 July when AFL soldiers killed approximately 600 persons taking
 refuge in the courtyard of St. Peter's Church. Leaders of all
 the armed groups did little or nothing to stop the killings
 and, in some cases, may have encouraged them or been directly
 
 
 193
 LIBERIA
 responsible for the abuses. Thousands, if not tens of
 thousands, of civilians died in the Liberian civil war, many
 of them from malnutrition and disease brought on by economic
 collapse, and over 50 percent of the population has been
 displaced. Not even Doe himself was immune. On September 9,
 he was captured and tortured to death by Prince Johnson and
 his INPFL forces.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In addition to the thousands of civilians killed
 extrajudicially by the warring parties (see Section 1.g,
 there were a number of killings specifically committed for
 political reasons. In January former po-litical activist
 Robert Phillips was brutally murdered in his Monrovia home.
 Although the Doe government's Special Antiterrorist Unit was
 probably responsible- there was no government investiqa tion-
 As fighting drew nearer Monrovia, reports proliferated of
 suspected NPFL sympathizers-including Mano and Gio members of
 the AFL--being detained and killed. On the other side, there
 are reliable reports that the. NPFL executed several prominent
 Liberian political figures, including former Liberia Action
 Party leader Jackson F. Doe. On September 9, President Doe.
 was tortured by Prince Johnson and the INPFL, later dyinq of
 his wounds.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances were common -throughout Liberia in- 1990, with
 the AFI, NPFL, and INPFL abducting and killing civilians,
 sometimes in large numbers, who were perceived as enemies,
 based primarily on ethnic identity. The full extent of this
 activity may never be knowr. NPFL and INPFL. leaders-
 threatened severe consequences to members of their
 organizations engaging in such activities, but it is unlikely
 that these warnings had any real effect.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The most graphic example of torture in 1990 was the videotaped
 interrogation and torture of President Doe by rebel leader
 Prince Johnson and his followers. The AFL is reported to have
 routinely beaten captives, often severely, and both sides
 subjected prisoners to mock executions, including the NPFL's
 mock execution of an American journalist held by them in
 September. Reports of the torture of captives in the
 Executive Mansion by Doe's followers were frequent and
 credible but in most cases difficult to confirm as most of the
 victims were subsequently executed. As the fighting
 intensified, AFL soldiers brutally tortured and systematically
 executed suspected NPFL sympathizers held in the grossly
 overcrowded Barclay Training Center prison. Both the NPFL and
 the INPFL severely beat and tortured prisoners in order to
 extract information. There are also reports that some ECOMOG
 troops resorted to similar tactics.
 Before the civil war began, conditions for prisoners in the
 nations's jails were hazardous to life and limb. Prisoners
 
 
 194
 LIBERIA
 were denied access to family and medical care. Cells were
 small, crowded, and filthy, and care of captives was haphazard
 at best. Several inmates of a county jail in Zwedru, Grand
 Gedeh county, had to be admitted to a local clinic suffering
 from malnutrition when the commander of the prison embezzled
 their rations; one died. Conditions at the maximum security
 facility at Belle Yella have long been of concern; there have
 been many credible reports that inmates there have died in the
 last few years as a result of disease, malnutrition, or
 torture. Some prisons were reportedly opened by forces of all
 the factions, but there was little information on the fate of
 individual prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The 1985 Constitution provides specific legal safeguards for
 the rights of the accused, including warrants for arrests, and
 the right of detainees to be charged or released-within 48
 hours. These rights, although sometimes enforced, were
 frequently violated, either due to procedural incompetence or
 to willful acts by the authorities, particularly in cases
 involving national security. Brief detentions were frequently
 used as a form of petty harassment. Judicial inefficiency and
 neglect often resulted in prolonged detention without charge.
 However, by early July the entire legal system had ceased to
 function, and whatever legal safeguards that had previously
 existed had vanished.
 At the outset of the civil war, Doe's followers rounded up
 hundreds of male Gio and Mano residents of Monrovia during
 January and February. No warrants were issued for their
 arrests, and no judicial officer reviewed the act-ion. Many
 were questioned and released, others were held for long
 periods or killed. During the fighting throughout the war,
 both sides detained members of opposing ethnic groups at will,
 with no procedural safeguards. As fighting drew nearer the
 capital, the frequency of arbitrary arrest and execution of
 perceived enemies by both the government and the NPFL
 increased markedly.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In January Liberia possessed a legal system modeled closely on
 that in the United States, including a judicial structure with
 a Supreme Court at its apex, protections for civil rights such
 as the right to be charged or released within 48 hours of
 arrest, and a requirement for arrest and search warrants. In
 practice, however, the system afforded little protection for
 defendants' rights. Corruption was pervasive among court
 officials, lack of training and supplies hampered the work of
 those who had the will to work, and the system as a whole was
 subject to inordinate executive interference. By July, the
 system had completely collapsed along with the rest of civil
 authority, and justice was in the hands of military commanders
 and their units.
 In March, in an effort to win public and international
 support, President Doe made a number of conciliatory gestures
 towards his critics, including ordering the release of
 imprisoned Liberia Unification Party leader Gabriel Kpolleh,
 attorney Ceapar Mabande and several others. They had been
 awaiting a retrial ordered by the Supreme Court of their
 controversial 1988 treason convictions.
 
 
 195
 LIBERIA
 There were a number of other political prisoners at the time
 of the collapse of the Doe government. Many of these are
 believed to have been released.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The almdst complete lack of discipline among AFL and rebel
 soldiers and the collapse of civil authority made instances of
 military interference with civilian life common in 1990. Many
 of these instances centered around theft or extortion, with
 many AFL and rebel soldiers regarding possession of a weapon
 as a license tor steal or intimidate. In the early months of
 the fighting, refugees from Nimba reported AFL soldiers going
 from village to village, demanding cash and goods from the
 residents and beating or killing those who refused to
 surrender their possessions. In some cases, entire villages
 were looted and then burned by marauding troops. Similarly,
 when NPFL forces took the port city of Buchanan in May. they
 looted the town's shops. There was extensive looting-by the
 AFL and later the NPFL, INPFL, and- even ECOMOG in Monrovia and
 its suburbs. The INPFL, AFT, and NPFL routinely commandeered
 vehicles, equipment, gasoline, and food from rubber
 plantations and other businesses. with no compensation. During
 the fighting in Monrovia, even diplomatic facilities were
 subject to forcible entry and looting, primarily by NPFL, and
 AFL forces.
 g. Use of Excessive-Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law-in Internal Conflicts
 The vast majority of killings in Liberia over the course of
 the civil war occurred when both government and insurgent
 soldiers deliberately killed civilians with no semblance of
 trial, hearing, or impartial judgment, and with no fear of
 being held accountable for their acts. Liberians of all ages
 were killed on the basis of ethnic identity, religion, of
 having worked for the government, or in many cases for refusal
 to surrender money or possessions to undisciplined soldiers.
 The majority of AFL and NPFL soldiers throughout the war had
 free reign to kill civilian members of opposing ethnic
 groups. INFPL soldiers also sought out and killed Krahn and
 Mandingo civilians, albeit much less frequently than the NPFL,
 especially during their 5 month occupation of Bushrod Island.
 The total number of civilians killed will never be known, but
 is likely to number in the thousands. Atrocities were
 initially confined almost entirely to Nimba county, where the
 NPFL launched its insurgency, but as the fighting continued
 and control of territory changed from government to insurgent
 forces, different ethnic and religious groups were
 victimized. From the outset of the conflict, the AFL
 primarily killed Gio and Mano persons but also targeted
 Americo-Liberians. In one of the most horrific acts of
 brutality, AFL soldiers entered the compound of St. Peter's
 Lutheran Church in Sinkor on July 29, where hundreds of Gio
 and Mano civilians had gathered for safety. The soldiers
 shot, stabbed, and hacked to death men, women, and children
 throughout the compound. Journalists and others who later
 visited the site estimated the number of dead at over 600.
 The AFL also killed scores of Gio and Mano who sought refuge
 at other Monrovia churches and the United Nations compound.
 Reports that the AFL was killing civilians and dumping their
 bodies at the end of the runway at Spriggs-Payne airfield were
 confirmed when ECOMOG forces recaptured the area, and
 
 
 196
 LIBERIA
 journalists counted over 100 corpses at the edge of the swamp
 that borders the airfield. Two specialized units within the
 AFL, the Executive Mansion Guard (EMG) and the Special
 Anti-Terrorist Unit (SATU), were primarily responsible for
 such killings, although regular AFL units were also involved.
 The NPFL also killed civilians, again based primarily on
 ethnic considerations. From the January attack on Karnplay in
 Nimba county, where they executed government officials as well
 as private citizens, rebel forces routinely singled out
 members of the Krahn and Mandingo ethnic groups for killing.
 Numerous incidents occurred in Nimba county in January, during
 the capture of Buchanan in May, and in Voinjima in July, and
 in Paynesville, Gardnersville, and Sinkor areas, in and around
 Monrovia, in August, September, and October when as many as
 several hundred Krahn and Mandingo, including women and
 children and a number of Nigerians and Ghanaians, were
 summarily killed. In late September, after the NPFL entered
 Grand Gedeh county, there were reports by refugees who fled
 the area that the NPFL was again hunting down and killing
 Krahns.
 The NPFL ordered residents to evacuate areas under its control
 and forced them through checkpoints where anyone suspected of
 being Krahn or Mandingo or a former government employee was
 identified and killed. At one such checkpoint dubbed "no
 return," the NPFL was reliably reported to have killed more
 than 2,000 people. In the Monrovia area ECOMOG buried
 hundreds of NPFL victims in a mass grave at the end of Dupont
 Road in Paynesville. The NPFL also shot hundreds of
 civilians, according to credible reports, at Fendall and the
 Gardnersville Housing Estate. Following Charles Taylor's
 remarks over NPFL radio on September 14 that one ECOMOG
 national would be killed for every Liberian killed by ECOMOG
 forces, NPFL soldiers turned on Nigerians, Ghanaians, Sierra
 Leoneans, and possibly other West Africans in Paynesville and
 Fendall. At food distribution points and medical clinics, the
 NPFL required that registrants identify themselves by tribal
 affiliation. Krahns and Mandingos were subsequently sorted
 out and killed.
 Although with less frequency than the NPFL, Prince Johnson's
 INPFL faction is reliably reported to have singled out and
 killed Krahn and Mandingo, including Krahn legislator Chea
 Kayee, removed from a refugee encampment by Johnson's men in
 mid-September and later found dead. INPFL soldiers also
 identified Krahn and Mandingo civilians on Bushrod Island and
 killed them, including women and children. Some 200 corpses
 were reported to have been left near the base of a bridge to
 Bushrod Island.
 In both the AFL and NPFL, few soldiers were ever disciplined
 for such actions, and almost no attempt was made to stop
 them. The government did relieve the first commander of the
 forces in Nimba, General Smith, on January 23 because of poor
 discipline within the ranks. However, his replacement,
 General Craig, was also relieved of his post within weeks, and
 General Smith resumed command. Neither side made more than a
 token effort to stop killings of civilians throughout the war.
 The INPFL did issue a field command that soldiers guilty of
 looting or killing civilians should be summarily executed, and
 some were. However, INPFL abuses did not end, and the
 soldiers themselves were mistreated and received no trial or
 legal protection. INPFL leader Johnson claimed to have
 
 
 197
 LIBERIA
 executed some INPFL members found guilty of harassing and
 killing civilians. Although the level of INPFL abuses
 decreased somewhat, it was not eliminated. Despite frequent
 claims that such deaths resulted from civilians being "caught
 in the crossfire," none of the killings discussed here were
 incidental to combat, although there were an unknown number of
 civilian casualties from ECOMOG air raids against the
 NPFL-controlled port of Buchanan and near Monrovia in November.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 At the beginning of 1990, the Liberian press was under
 increasingly serious restrictions and intimidation from the
 government. The passage of an act creating a "Communications
 Commission" designed to "monitor and control" the media and
 the fact that ECLM, a private radio station, remained closed
 further encouraged the practice of self-censorship among many
 Liberian journalists. It was exacerbated by the firebombing
 of the editorial offices of The Daily Observer, Monrovia's
 largest circulation paper, in March. The paper continued to
 publish, as did several others, until the proximity of
 fighting to Monrovia forced, them to close. AFL soldiers
 subsequentIy burned down the Daily Observer offices as the
 rebels closed in on Monrovia.
 As the government's control slackened, the independent media
 began to cover the civil war with considerable candor and-
 generally gave full coverage to AFL abuses and losses and-to
 rebel activities, although a few newspapers had reported AFL
 atrocities from the start of the civil war. As the war
 continued, even the government-owned electronic media began to
 provide fuller coverage, and several independent newspapers
 called for Doe's resignation. Although there were no direct
 reprisals against these newspapers, the government called
 meetings with the relevant editors, issued threats and
 warnings, and otherwise tried to intimidate the press. In
 March President Doe declared that The Sun Times and Footprints
 Today, two newspapers he had banned in 1988, could begin
 publishing again. They never did. In June the government
 lifted the ban imposed on the newsletter of the Liberia Action
 Party, but it did not resume operations.
 Indeed, by the third quarter of the year, no one was
 publishing anything in Liberia except for the occasional
 propaganda leaflet. There were no newspapers or television
 stations, and the only functioning radio stations were
 broadcasting foreign news and propaganda on behalf of the
 NPFL. In November, when the security situation had improved
 in Monrovia, a new newspaper, Torchlight, and a radio station,
 ELBC Monrovia, began operations. A second newspaper, The New
 Times, appeared in December.
 Although domestic journalism ceased to function, from the
 beginning of the conflict foreign reporters arrived in Liberia
 to cover the war. They were generally treated well by both
 sides, allowed to enter and leave the country without undue
 interference, and even given guided tours of "liberated
 Liberia" by the NPFL. However, the NPFL did beat an American
 journalist held by them briefly and subjected him to a mock
 execution. The NPFL reportedly still has two Nigerian
 journalists under detention. Reportedly, dissemination of
 news is tightly controlled within NPFL territory.
 
 
 198
 LIBERIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Before 1990, the constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 assembly were honored more often in urban areas than in
 rural. In Monrovia, several political parties were active,
 although none organized large gatherings in 1990. In rural
 areas, although at least one party did undertake some
 organizing work, partisans were subject to a greater degree of
 harassment and interference from local authorities. Within
 the first weeks of the incursion, government troops tried to
 arrest one rural organizer for the opposition United People's
 Party (UPP), possibly because of his role in opposition
 activities in Nimba county.
 As the fighting in Nimba dragged on and began to spread to
 other areas, efforts began in Monrovia to organize peace
 groups. Several groups, particularly the Interfaith Mediation
 Committee, held organizational meetings declaring their
 interest in a peaceful solution to the conflict and ultimately
 calling for Doe's resignation. Several public marches and
 rallies were held by such groups, with major human rights,
 legal, journalists, and teachers' associations participating.
 While most were peaceful, government forces fired on the last
 such march in late June, possibly killing several persons, and
 beat protesters suspected of calling for Doe's resignation.
 As the fighting grew closer to the capital, peace groups, like
 all other organized activity, drew to a halt. In an
 unsuccessful bid to appease critics calling for his
 resignation, Doe lifted the ban on two political parties and
 lifted restrictions on the student union and business caucus
 in June. In December ECOMOG banned demonstrations and
 nonreligious public gatherings when the INPFL planned a march
 protesting allegations of ECOMOG brutality, but the ban was
 not rigidly enforced. The Press Union of Liberia resumed
 meeting in Monrovia during the last quarter of the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The 1985 Constitution states that freedom of religion is a
 fundamental right of all Liberian citizens, and in practice
 there are no restrictions on this right. No religion has
 preference over others, and there is no established state
 religion. Christianity, brought by 19th-century settlers and
 spread through the interior by missionaries, has long been the
 religion of the political and economic elite, and public
 figures often refer to the "Christian principles" on which
 Liberia was founded. The majority of the rural population
 follow traditional religions. Although Mandingos, who are
 predominantly Muslim, have been targeted by rebel forces,
 other Liberian Muslims have not received the same treatment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides every person the right to move
 freely throughout Liberia and to leave or enter the country at
 any time. Hundreds of thousands of Liberians have done so,
 beginning in early January when reports of AFL massacres began
 to circulate in Nimba county. The Gio and Mano residents of
 Nimba fled the fighting by crossing the borders to Guinea and
 Cote d'Ivoire by the tens of thousands, often by simply
 walking across unguarded borders. Others walked to Sierra
 Leone, and, as the NPFL entered Grand Gedeh county, most of
 the Krahn fled to Cote d'Ivoire.
 
 
 199
 LIBERIA
 Within Liberia, the checkpoints which hampered internal
 movement for years were dramatically increased once the
 fighting began, and many of the AFL and NPFL checkpoints
 became scenes of harassment, robbery, and killings. The Ganta
 checkpoint, on the road from Nimba county to Monrovia, was
 reported to be the scene of dozens of killings in January, and
 when the fighting reached Monrovia there were checkpoints
 every few blocks. The NPFL set up checkpoints in areas it
 controlled and harassed civilians fleeing the country,
 particularly on the main road from Monrovia to Sierra Leone.
 On that route, at the checkpoint at Gbah, harassment and
 killings were especially common. The INPFL also established
 checkpoints in areas of Monrovia it controlled, at which
 government workers, and occasionally Krahn, were identified
 and sometimes killed. Despite these restrictions, there has
 been massive internal displacement within Liberia; one U.S.
 Government estimate put the number at 600,000 Liberians
 displaced within the country, in addition ta the 750,000
 refugees outside the borders, by the end of the year. This
 amounts to around 50 percent of Liberia's prewar population.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite constitutional and legal guarantees of free and fair
 elections, the ability of Liberians to exercise their right to
 change the government was put in serious doubt by the-
 fraudulent 1985 elections that kept the Doe government in
 office. The Liberian government as it existed in January was
 in theory modeled on the American system and included a
 bicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, and a
 two-term limitation on presidential service. In practice, the
 President held a preponderant share of the power. Once the
 fighting began, Doe virtually ignored the other, mostly
 moribund, branches of government, although the legislative
 branch, largely a rubber stamp throughout Doe's tenure,
 rejected the President's June.call for early elections and
 urged negotiations with the rebels. Some members of the
 legislature did call for Doe's resignation and voiced their
 concern about the widespread abuses perpetrated by the AEL.
 Charles Taylor claims to be President of Liberia and reports
 he has held "traditional" (head count) elections for seats in
 a national assembly, but his claim to the executive rests on
 his military victories.
 In August a group of exiled Liberian political, social, and
 religious leaders meeting in Banjul formed an Interim
 Government of National Unity (IGNU), headed by political
 scientist and opposition leader Amos Sawyer. The IGNU arrived
 in Monrovia in mid-November, after ECOMOG and INPFL forces had
 pushed NPFL forces away from the capital city. At the Banjul
 meeting in December, agreement was reached that an all-party
 conference would be held in Monrovia by mid-February 1991 that
 would choose a new interim government which would hold office
 until general elections could be held.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Despite the overwhelming evidence of military atrocities on
 all sides of the fighting, both the government and the rebel
 groups insisted that civilians were not being targeted.
 Government officials dismissed early reports of killings by
 
 
 200
 LIBERIA
 the AFL, claiming that those reports concerned civilians
 caught in the crossfire between government troops and rebels.
 When it became clear that unarmed civilians were being shot
 outside of combat, they complained that it was difficult to
 differentiate between rebels and civilians. Similarly, the
 NPFL denied for months that there was any systematic killing
 of Krahn and Mandingo civilians by its troops, attempting to
 brush off reports by attributing incidents to occasional
 indiscipline. Prince Johnson, who has personally executed
 individuals in front of witnesses without any pretense of a
 trial, also denied reports of atrocities. He murdered one
 local relief worker on the spot for selling rice even though
 he had earlier approved the scheme for charging nominal prices
 for such relief food.
 Aside from these almost pro forma denials, neither the
 government nor the rebels seemed particularly concerned about
 whether their abuses became known. The AFL, INPFL, and NPFL
 allowed journalists and human rights activists relatively easy
 access to areas near the fighting. Some journalists returned
 with videotapes of opposing troops and civilians being beaten
 and threatened, and Prince Johnson deliberately made a
 videotape of the torture of President Doe, which he then
 released to the media. In December Prince Johnson invited
 Amnesty International to visit Monrovia and investigate the
 alleged killing of 400 of his INPFL troops by ECOMOG. The
 ECOMOG commander welcomed the visit.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 During the Doe regime, the perception of domination by, and
 government favoritism toward, Krahns grew and gave rise to
 ethnic tensions that had been either nonexistent or at least
 dormant. Thus, from the beginning of the insurgency the
 country fractured along ethnic lines. Until the fighting
 moved out of Nimba county, it was almost entirely a tribally
 based affair. The Krahn-dominated AFL was intent on
 suppressing the Gio and Mano tribes, which in turn saw their
 chance at revenge on the Krahn and the Mandingo. Even after
 the war widened in scope to engulf all of Liberia, rebels
 continued to single out Krahn and Mandingo for retribution,
 while the AFL focused its depredations in Monrovia primarily
 but not exclusively on Gio and Mano residents there.
 Americo-Liberians were also singled out for harsh treatment.
 The Constitution provides that only "persons of Negro descent"
 may be citizens or own land, denying full rights to many
 nonblack residents who have lived their lives there.
 The status of women in Liberian society varies by region, with
 women holding some skilled jobs in Monrovia, including
 cabinet-level positions, in the past. Even prior to the war,
 however, there was some discrimination against women in
 education and employment. In some rural areas, in particular,
 traditional attitudes hold sway, e.g., that women are the
 property of their husband.
 In the massive violence against civilians, women have suffered
 the gamut of abuse, especially rape. Even prior to the war,
 domestic violence against women was probably extensive but was
 never seriously addressed by the government or womens' groups
 as an issue. Female circumcision is widely practiced in rural
 areas and in 1990 was debated openly and extensively in the
 
 
 LIBERIA
 Monrovia press. There are no statistics on domestic violence
 against women, but it is considered to be fairly common.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Like virtually all other organized activity in Liberia, unions
 had disappeared by July, with industries shut down and their
 workers scattered. Worker rights, along with other rights,
 were essentially ignored in the chaos that enveloped Liberia
 as the year progressed. The following paragraphs reflect the
 situation prior to the disintegration.
 The Constitution states that workers have the right to
 associate in trade unions. Over 20 trade unions were
 registered with the Ministry of Labor, representing roughly 15
 percent of the monetary sector work force. Ten national
 unions were members of the Liberian Federation of Labor Unions
 (LFLU), an affiliate of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. The Government did not recognize the right
 of civil servants or employees of public corporations to
 unionize or strike.
 Or April 27, the U.S. Trade Representative announced that
 Liberia's status as a beneficiary of trade preferences under
 the Generalized System of Preferences program had been
 suspended as a result of Liberia's failure to-take steps to-
 provide internationally recognized worker rights. The
 suspension remains in effect.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 With the important exception of civil servants and employees
 of public corporations, workers had the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. Labor laws had the same force in
 Liberia's one export processing zone as in the rest of the
 country.
 The 1990 report of the Committee of Experts (COE) of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) reiterated that
 Liberian labor legislation fails to provide workers adequate
 protection against discrimination and reprisals for union
 activity, fails to protect workers' organizations against
 outside interference, and does not give eligible workers in
 the public sector the opportunity to bargain collectively.
 The COE noted that these deficiencies violate the provisions
 of ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and collective
 bargaining which Liberia has ratified.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor, and the practice was
 firmly condemned by the Doe government. Liberia has also
 ratified both ILO force labor Conventions. However, serious
 questions have been raised by the ILO and others about the
 degree of enforcement of that prohibition, especially on rural
 community development projects.
 The COE report cited above urged the Government to bring its
 law and practice into conformity with ILO Convention 29 on
 forced labor by adopting legislation providing penal sanctions
 for illegal use of forced labor and improving the inspection
 program for enforcing the prohibition of forced labor. The
 COE repeated its earlier criticism of a law providing prison
 
 
 202
 LIBERIA
 sentences, with an obligation to work, for certain proscribed
 criticism of the Government; such sentences are in violation
 of ILO Convention 105 on the abolition of forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children
 The government prohibited employment of children under age 16
 during school hours. Again, such employment is a moot point,
 although it should be noted that many rebel soldiers are
 reported to be very young, with some less than 12 years of age.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law of Liberia provides for a minimum wage, paid
 leave, severance benefits, and safety standards. Before the
 economy collapsed, the minimum wage for agricultural workers
 was approximately 90 cents per day, with industrial workers
 receiving three to four times that amount. These wages did
 not provide a decent standards of living but were generally
 supplemented by other sources of income. As there was little
 or no economic activity in Liberia at the end of 1990, these
 regulations had little meaning.
