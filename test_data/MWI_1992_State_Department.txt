 MALAWI
 Malawi's political, economic, and social development continues to be dominated by
 Life President Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, as it has since he led the country to independ-
 ence in 1964. Dr. Banda is also Life President of Malawi's sole legal political party,
 the Malawi Congress Party (MCP). In practice, the Cabinet and Parliament are sub-
 ordinate to the MCP Central Committee. Only candidates selected by the party and
 approved by the President may contest parliamentary elections. Constitutional
 amendments and laws passed by the Parliament mirror decisions already taken by
 President Banda. In October President Banda called for a national referendum
 under international observation to determine whether Malawi should continue as a
 one-party state or allow multiple parties to operate and compete for political power
 within the country. A U.N. electoral assistance team invited to Malawi to provide
 gIidance on the referendum recommended that it be held in mid-June 1993. On
 New Year's eve, President Banda announced that the referendum would be held on
 March 15, 1993.
 Police and party security organs--notably the Security and Intelligence Service
 (SIS), the MCP Youth League, and the Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP)--closely mon-
 itor a wide range of the population's activities. The police and party security organs
 continue to commit serious human rights abuses. In contrast, the army has es-
 chewed internal politics. Malawi's total military expenditures for 1989, the last year
 for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed
 
 
 150
 analysis, were $35 million. The Government has ordered, due to severe fiscal con-
 straints imposed by the economy, a 10 percent across-the-board cut in the operating
 budgets for all government agencies.
 Small, dnseer populated, and landlocked, Malawi is a predominantly agricultural
 economy operating in a relatively free enterprise environment. Nearly 90 percent of
 the population engages in subsistence farming. The main cash crops, grown mostly
 on estates are tobacco tea, coffee, and sugar. Since independence, with good man-
 agement the economy has grown steadily, with a major portion of that growth in
 the agricultural sector. In 1992, however, a serious drought, declining agricultural
 commodity prices, devaluation of the Malawi currency, and other factors led to eco-
 nomic decline and threatened government insolvency. Donor nations, meeting in
 Paris in May, decided to reduce aid to Malawi and tie future economic assistance
 levels to human rights reforms.
 Malawi's poor human rights record stands in sharp contrast to its economic
 achievements and humanitarian handling of Africa's largest refugee population. In
 1992, though challenged by citizens to permit greater political freedom, the Govern-
 ment and the MCP kept strict control on all aspects of political life, with continued
 restrictions on speech, press, assembly, association, and the right of citizens to
 change their government through democratic means. Nevertheless, an independent
 press be  to emerge in the latter half of 1992, religious leaders became increas-
 ngy bol as they spoke out for human rights reforms, and the first internal inde-
 pendent political groups-the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), the United Demo-
 cratic Front (UDF), and the Public Affairs Committee (PAC--publicly called for po-
 litical pluralism. The Government reacted to these challenges with more restraint
 than would have been the case in previous years, and President Banda surprised
 domestic and international audiences when he announced the national referendum
 on one-party vs. multi party politics. A report issued by the U.N. electoral assistance
 team, which visited Malawi November 14-21, made recommendations in such areas
 as freedom of assembly, association and speech, access to public media, and voter
 education activities.
 Police abuse of prisoners and detainees persisted, including credible reports of tor-
 ture. The Government continued also to use arbitrary detention, especially under
 the Preservation of Public Security Act, to counter alleged opponents, although such
 detentions were less frequent and of shorter duration than in the past. After student
 demonstrations in March and April, labor riots in May, and a pervasive
 antigovernment letter writing campaign in May and June, 100 to 200 Malawians
 were arrested and held in prison, most without charge or trial. Almost all of these
 short-term detainees were released by early August. However, in October and No-
 vember the Government arbitrarily arrested several persons in Blantyre who gath-
 ered outside the courthouse for the trial of trade union official Chakufwa Chihana,
 It arrested others throughout the country who were selling AFORD membership
 cards. The Government also released more than a dozen other political detainees,
 long held without charge or trial, although it did not release Orton and Vera
 Chirwa, who have long been the focal point of international concerns about human
 rights abuses in Malawi. In October Orton Chirwa died in prison; the official post
 mortem report showed that he died of natural causes. His widow was denied per-
 mission to attend his funeral.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political killings in
 1992. However, Orton Chirwa died while imprisoned; he had been subjected in past
 years to torture and to inadequate medical, sanitary, and nutritional care. In addi-
 tion, Frackson Zgambo, an airport official detained in 1989, died in April in police
 custody. Sylvester Phiri, detained in 1987 for distributing antigovernment lit-
 erature, died in prison in December 1991. Although foul play was suspected in these
 two cases, there were no official investigations into the causes of these deaths.
 Police and auxiliary security forces (MYP) used excessive force in responding to
 the labor riots in May; they shot and killed approximately 20 persons.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases of disappearance for political
 reasons in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment-
 Allegations of institutionalized torture persist. Beatings during arrest and detention
 are llegal but common. Guilty officers are rarely disciplined. Human rights organi-
 zations have reported that some criminal prisoners have been subjected to "hard
 core" punishment in which the person is chained naked to the floor of a cell and
 denied adequate food for 30 days.
 
 
 151
 There are credible reports of at least one woman prisoner confined naked, tor-
 tured with a cattle prod beaten by male wardens, and deprived of adequate food,
 water and sanitation. Prison terms and conditions are harsh, crowded, and fre-
 quently degrading, particularly in Nsasnje prison on the Shire river marshes in
 southern Malawi, where malaria is also a constant danger.
 In August the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) began com-
 prehensive visits of Malawi's prisons, the first time the ICRC had been permitted
 in Malawi since 1969.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Preservation of Public Secu-
 rity Act (PPSA), President Banda may order the arrest, search, and detention of
 persons considered a threat to public order. Police officers may also arrest persons
 on their own authority before a formal detention order is issued. Historically, per-
 sons often have been held for months before being served detention papers. In Au-
 gust Parliament passed, on President Banda's directive, revisions to the preventive
 detention portion of the PPSA. Persons held under a detention order must now be
 charged with a crime and brought to trial in an open court within a "reasonable"
 time and permitted to consult with a lawyer.
 The Government may, for reasons of national security, prohibit a detainee's public
 appearance before a court. In that case, however the authorities mustdpermit the
 p erson to appeal his detention to a newly created Review Tribunal headed by a High
 Court justice. The Tribunal is tasked to review periodically all detention orders. Its
 recommendations are sent to President Banda, who ultimately decides to continue
 or revoke any detention order.
 Government secrecy precludes an accurate estimate of the number of political de-
 tainees and prisoners in Malawi. By mid-1992 there were more than 200 political
 detainees, including clergy, in Malawi's prisons most of whom had been arrested
 for possessing antigovernment literature or speaking out about the need for political
 change. However, almost all were released just prior to the arrival of the ICRC in
 August. The Government also released mre than a dozen political detainees long
 held without charge, including Aleke Bands, Dany Mhang, and Machipisa
 Munthali. Bands had been held without charge since 1980, and Munthali had been
 held since 1974 despite having completed his sentence. By the end of 1992, experi-
 enced observers put the number or political detalnees at fewer than 10, including
 Vera Chirwa. The police were, however, detaining and charging individuals selling
 or possessing AFORD or UDF membershi? cars. Such detentions numbered at
 least 30 and were generally of a few hours to a few days' duration. In December
 in Blantyre, police arrested and detained for 4 days as many as 150-200 persons
 who had gathered to protest the conviction and sentence of multiparty advocate
 Chakufwa Chihana.
 While forced exile has not been used as a means of political control, there is a
 small but constant exodus of persons who leave for political reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Malawi has both traditional and modem court
 systems. The latter consists of the magistrate courts, the High Court, and the Su-
 preme Court of Appeal. The President appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court
 and, after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission, other court justices.
 President Banda is constitutionally empowered to dismiss any judge of any court at
 any time.
 Inmost cases, legal counsel is permitted only in the modern courts. The right of
 appeal exists in both systems. Both are empowered to try capital offenses, including
 treason. In practice the modern courts hear mostly civil cases, though in recent
 years criminal caseloads in the magistrate's courts have increased. Although judicial
 independence is constitutionally mandated, neither judiciary has been truly inde-
 pendent. However, 1992 saw unprecedented indelendence on the part of the modern
 courts, both the High Court and the magistrate s courts, when deciding politically
 sensitive cases. By law, defendants and their attorneys are guaranteed access to
 government-held evidence. In practice, however, defendants and their attorneys usu-
 ally do not see the evidence against them until they are in court.
 The courts are open to the public, and defendants are charged publicly. Crowded
 dockets, however, have delayed serious cases from being heard for up to 5 years.
 In one homicide case, the suspect was held 7 years without being charged. In most
 criminal cases, the defendant remains imprisoned during the interval. In July and
 August, in advance of the ICRC visit to prisons, teams of magistrate judges worked
 full-time to clear a large backlog of cases, permitting the release of hundreds of de-
 tainees from overcrowded and poorly maintained facilities. However, a large backlog
 of capital cases in the traditional court system remained.
 The traditional courts, which try the majority of criminal cases, are the most ac-
 cessible to the average Malawian. Over 300 traditional courts, dispersed among
 Malawi's 24 districts and 3 regions, hear several hundred thousand civil and crimi-
 
 
 152
 nal cases each year. Traditional court justices, including justices of the National
 Traditional Appeal Court, are a p pointed directly by the President. A typical Tradi-
 tional Court panel will include three village chiefs and one magistrate judge. Police
 officials handle the prosecution, and defendants conduct their own defense. The bur-
 den is usually on the defendants to prove their innocence.
 The executive branch seldom interferes in traditional court cases involving cus-
 tomary (tribal) law, but has done so in political and security cases. The most cele-
 brated occurrence was in 1983, when the President directed that Orton and Vera
 Chirwa be tried by the traditional court, where few, if any, procedural safeguards
 are available. In a trial widely criticized by international human rights monitors as
 unfair and politically motivated, the Chirwas were convicted and sentenced to
 death. Banda subsequently commuted the Chirwas' death sentences to life imprison-
 ment. Despite appeals from many human rights organizations the Government re-
 fused to rlease the Chirwas. Orton Chirwa died in prison in 6ctober; Vera Chirwa
 remains in prison.
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the property ights of those
 suspected of economic crimes such as illegal currency transactions. These revoca-
 tions sometimes have political overtones and have been heavily weighted against
 the Asian community. The Act has not been invoked in recent years. In August Par-
 liament amended the Act in order topermit those accused the opportunity to estab-
 lish their innocence in open court. However, the amendment ofrered no redress to
 existing victims of the Forfeiture Act and continues to give President Banda, and
 not the judicial branch, the final say' on guilt or innocence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Police
 may enter houses of suspects at will under special entry authority to conduct
 searches for incriminating evidence or suspects. Telephones are routinely tapped,
 and an extensive network of informers reports private statements and actions to the
 Government. Authorities open domestic and international mail.
 Membership in the rling Malawi Congress Party is not legally mandatory, but
 citizens feel pressure to join. In 1992 President Bands advised MCP members to
 stop requiring that citizens present their party cards before being granted access to
 markets, hospitals, or public transportation, as had been common practice in the
 past.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Free speech and free press are circumscribed
 in Malawi. It is an offense, punishable by 5 years' imprisonment, to publish any-
 thing likely "to undermine the authority of, or public confidence in, the Govern-
 ment." In 1992 Parliament changed the penalty, from life to 5 years' imprisonment,
 for sending out of the country "false information" which may be "harmful to the in-
 terests or good name of Malawi." In practice, giving any critical information to for-
 eign journalists can result in arrest, though by late in the year, opposition figures
 grew increasingly bold in grantinginterviews to foreign radio correspondents about
 the political climate in Malawi without government reprisals.
 In April Chakufwa Chihana, the Malawian labor leader who headed the office of
 the Southern African Trade Union Coordination Council headquartered in Lilongwe,
 was arrested immediately upon his return to Malawi after visiting Zambia and
 South Africa, where he spoke in support of democratic change in Malawi. He was
 eventually charged with sedition for criticizing the Government and advocating
 multiparty democracy. He spent 5 months in detention. Chihana's trial began in Oc-
 tober. On December 14 he was found guilty on two of three counts, imp~orting a sedi-
 tious document and possession of a seditious document, and sentenced to concurrent
 terms of 18 and 24 months at hard labor. The international community, including
 the United States Government, objected to the original criminal charges, the verdict,
 and the penalty handed dwn n the Chihana verdict. Soon after his arrest in April,
 Chihanas wife was fired from her job as Dean of Malawis School of Nursing. In
 September the High Court ruled that she had been dismissed illegally and awarded
 her compensation.         '
 Malawi's two government-controlled newspapers and one radio network exist pri-
 marily to catalog the President's words and deeds and to chronicle government pro-
 grams and business developments from the MCP perspective. In mid-1992 the gov-
 ernment-controlled press began to cover objectively domestic political events and
 other sensitive issues (e.g., crime, riots, donor reductions in aid) to a far greater ex-
 tent than ever before. Two main independent newspapers, founded in 1992, led the
 way in this objective coverage and met with little government interference. Never-
 theless, all outlets, independent and government-controlled, continued to practice
 self-ensorship and refrained from direct criticism of President Bands or his Govern-
 ment. Criticism of government efficiency does appear in the newspapers. Govern-
 
 
 153
 ment radio and press frequently advise citizens of the alleged dangers of multiparty
 democracy and remind citizens to report to the police all "confusionists" and "sub-
 versives" they frind, that is, anyone advocating political pluralism or change from the
 status quo.
 In December the editor responsible for the increasing objectivity of the govern-
 ment-controlled daily newspaper was suspended with pay and subsequently dis-
 missed from his job. The ostensible reason for these actions was allowing two arti-
 cles to go to print which leveled accusations at nonpolitical institutions without suf-
 ficient facts. The opinion among local observers, however, was that the editor had
 reached the limits of the Government's tolerance for press freedom in a paper that
 it controls.
 Foreign journalists seeking visas to enter Malawi must specify in advance the top-
 ics they intend to cover. In 1992 the Government permitted a few Western journal-
 ists to visit Malawi, mostly to cover the effects of the drought, but also to ask gov-
 ernment officials questions concerning political issues. Other foreign journah'sts
 were denied entry.
 Academic freedom is limited by the general restrictions on speech and press. Sev-
 eral university students were arrested, and more than 15 were expelled from school
 as a result of student demonstrations in March and April in support of the Catholic
 bishops' pastoral letter. However, later in the year these students won a court case
 against the University and were reinstated. The long detentions of professors Jack
 Mapanje and Blaise Machila, who were finally released in 1991, and the 1992 depor-
 tations of Catholic Monsignor Roche and Fathers O'Malley and Leahy, reminded
 university students and professors of the narrow bounds to academic inquiry and
 political dissent, as did the closing of the Polytechnic College in Blantyre following
 student protests in December 1992.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Political meetings are not per-
 mitted outside the framework of the Malawi Congress Party. Persons may be im-
 prisoned if they further the aims of an "unlawful society," defined as "any group
 considered to be dangerous to the good government of the republic." A gathering of
 three or more persons can be construed as an unlawful assembly under Malawian
 law.
 In August a consortium of Christian groups (Catholic, Presbyterian, and Anglican)
 was prevented from holding a mass rally in Mzuzu because authorities believed it
 had political overtones. More than 10 clergy members were arrested and questioned,
 detained for a few days, and eventually released. In October, however, thousands
 of people gathered in Mzuzu and Nkhata Bay for the funeral of Orton Chirwa with-
 out incident or arrest. In Seetember AFORD, a political organization that describes
 itself as a "pressure group, attempted to register with the Government. In late
 1992, police arrested between 30 and 40 people, allegedly for attempting to sell
 AFORD and UDF membership cards. Most were released within 1 day of their de-
 tention. In December police in Blantyre arrested as many as 150200 peaceful dem-
 onstrators who had gathered to protest the verdict in the Chakufwa Chihana trial.
 They were released 4 days later.
 Individuals and organizations can and do associate freely concerning nonpolitical
 matters.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state or preferred religion, and religious
 groups may establish places of worship and train clergy. However, religious groups
 are required to register with the Government, and an informal presidential decree
 that no new religious groups should be registered in Malawi has taken on the force
 of law. The ban has servedto prevent legitimate religious groups from establishing
 a registered presence in Malawi.
 Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religious convictions prevent them from joining the
 MCP or any other political party, have been banned since 1967. Relations between
 the Government and the Witnesses remain tense and regularly elicit hostile out-
 bursts from senior officials. Jehovah's Witnesses continue to be arrested and impris-
 oned for their religious beliefs. Jehovah's Witnesses who entered Malawi as
 Mozambican refugees were not allowed to proselytize within refugee camps, and
 many eventually were expelled or returnedvoluntarily to Mozambique. Many of
 these were originally from Malawi but had previously been expelled to Mozambique.
 Religious publications, like others, may not criticize the Government or the MCP.
 In March the annual Catholic bishops' pastoral letter, released during Sunday wor-
 ship services throughout the country, was boldly critical of many government prac-
 tices. Over 16,000 copies of the small publication were distributed in a day. The
 Government declared the document seditious. In addition, three Catholic clergy_
 Monsignor Roche and fathers O'Malley and Leahy-were deported because of their
 alleged participation in activities the Government considered overtly political and
 critical of the status quo.
 
 
 Most religious groups are free to establish and maintain links with coreligionists
 in other countries, and members are free to travel abroad. Malawi's sizable Muslim
 minority (estimated at 20 percent of the population) conducts its religion and builds
 mosques freely. Foreign Islamic organizations have funded the latter with no gov-
 ernmental interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation-Legal provisions exist for restricting the movement of those convicted
 of political or criminal offenses. Denial of passports on political grounds is common.
 Credible evidence suggested that SIS agents followed persons suspected of opposi-
 tion to the Government out of Malawi in 1992. Civil servants and employees of
 state-owned enterprises must obtain written permission to travel abroad, even on
 vacation, although such clearance now appears to be routine.
 Formal emigration is neither restricted nor encouraged. However, Asian residents
 and citizens, while free to travel within the country, must nominally reside and
 work in one of four urban area' (Lilongwe, Zomba, Mzuzu, and Blantyre/Limbe). In
 Lilongwe, a planned capital, they must also live within certain neighborhoods. Dur-
 ing 1992 the Government did not strictly enforce those restrictions.
 Malawi hosts the largest refugee population     in Africa. Over 1 million
 Mozambicans-more than 10 percent of Malawi's population-are now located in
 rural areas in nearly half of Malawi's 24 districts. Most refugees live in camp-like
 situations, while others live within or adjacent to existing vllages. In both cases,
 their presence has brought improved medical care and economic stimuli to the re-
 gion. Although international and voluntary organizations supported by donors pro-
 vide most of the assistance for refugees, they clearly strain Malawi's transportation
 network, contribute to deforestation, and occup scarce amble land. Public dis-
 content over this burden has been rising, and in (992 officials indicated publicly for
 the first time the Government's growing discontent through newspaper articles and
 editorials that admonished refugees for being ungrateful troublemakers.
 Voluntary repatriation has been limited, and thousands of additional refugees
 have continued to arrive in Malawi each month. The Government has cooperated
 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international
 relief efforts. The ICRC, through its regional delegation in Harare, Zimbabwe, has
 been offering aid to refugees in Malawi since the early 1980's.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights;- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 During 1992 citizens of Malawi could not change their national Government
 through democratic means. Major and many minor political decisions are made by
 the President or his closest associates. Opposition political parties were prohibited.
 However, in late 1992 an emerging multiparty movement gathered su pport, and un-
 derground parties and associations began to take shape. In October President
 Banda called for a national referendum on a one-party versus a multiparty political
 system. The U.N. electoral assistance team's report recommended that an umbrella
 organization for those goups advocating multipartyism be allowed to "campaign" as
 a legal association in the national referendum.
 The MCP structure provides for some choice among candidates for party (every
 3 years), parliamentary (every 5 years), and other offices-all by secret ballot. Nomi-
 nees for political seats however, are carefully selected by the MCP and approved
 by the President. The National Assembly, consisting of both elected and a few ap-
 pointed members, is mainly concerned with ratifying preordained policy. Its inde-
 pendence and powers are broadly based in law but highly circumscribed in practice.
 Parliamentary elections held in June cannot be described as free or fair. It was
 illegal for candidates to campaign. Complete election results were not reported, only
 the winners' vote totals. Many candidates nominated on the primary level were
 summarily disqualified by party election officials before the general election. For the
 141 National Assembly seats, 50 candidates ran unopposed, including most leading
 MCP officials. Eight candidates who lost in the general election were later selected
 as members-at-large by President Banda.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local nongovernmental human rights organizations are not permitted. At best,
 human rights issues can be touche on tangentially by the Malawi Law Society
 which, in recent years, has been able to debate in public aspects of existing law with
 increasing candor, as it did during a 1992 Symposium on the Rule of Law. The Law
 Society represents both government and private lawyers.
 The Government does not permit Amnesty International to conduct human rights
 investigations in Malawi. However, in June the Government signed an agreement
 
 
 155
 with the ICRC to permit ongoing visits to Malawi's prisons. Those visits began in
 August.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Membership in the ruling MCP or its organs is not open to Malawians of Asian
 or European descent. In addition, there are regional differences between the north
 and the rest of Malawi. Northerners have experienced considerable discrimination
 by the Government in the past, most recently in 1989, when President Banda lent
 his weight to a campaign which resulted in many northerners losing jobs in the
 south and being forced to return to their region or go into exile abroad. Historically,
 several of the most important plitical prisoners, including Orton and Vera Chirwa,
 have come from the northern region. Since 1990 the Government has made a con-
 certed effort to downplay or deny regionalism in an effort to maintain a facade be-
 hind which all regions and all tribes appear unified and content under the leader-
 ship of PresidentBanda. Asian residents, whether Malawian citizens or not, have
 been compelled to transfer ownership of rural shops and trucking businesses to eth-
 nic Africans. Strict rules govern where Asians may own property, although these
 have been relaxed considerably in recent years. In 1992 an amendment to the citi-
 zenship law made it possible for non-Africans born inside or outside Malawi to gain
 Malawi citizenship as long as one of their parents is a citizen.
 Malawi's official government hostess, C. Tamanda Kadzamira, has gone to consid-
 erable lengths to draw Asian women into her National Women's Development Orga-
 nization (CCAM). Despite these informal changes, many persons in the small but
 prosperous Asian community of about 5,000 persons question their long-term future
 in Malawi.
 In Malawi women are eMual under the law, and tribal leadership structures re-
 main primarily matrilineal in the central and southern regions of the country. How-
 ever, in practice women do not have opportunities equal to those of men. Histori-
 cally, most females have been unable to complete even a primary education and are
 at a serious disadvantage in the job market. The Government presently reserves for
 girls 33 percent of the places in the secondary school system, though the actual
 number of attendees is less. It has also cooperated closely with international donors
 seeking to enhance educational opportunities for females at all levels.
 In practice, women are disadvantaged under the law through ignorance. In 1992
 the Ministry of Women and Children and Community Services, working with CCAM
 and the Malawi Law Society, published a bilingual handbook on women's legal
 rights.
 The Government is slowly giving recognition to the importance of women as agri-
 cultural producers, as approximately 70 percent of all smallholder farms and over
 50 percent of subsistence holdings are headed by women. When buying and selling
 "saleable" property, men and women have equal rights. However, with "customary"
 property (land in transition), succession in the northern region reverts to male fam-
 ily members, whereas succession in the southern region reverts to female family
 members. The Ministry of Agriculture now has a separate women's extension pro-
 gram specifically designed to accommodate their needs. Women enjoy access to ma-
 ternal health services and to extension programs, but infant and child mortality re-
 main extremely high.
 Malawi continues to maintain a strict dress code for women. Pants and shorts are
 not permitted in public, and dress length must be below the knees. No known ar-
 rests for dress code violations occurred in 1992.
 A few small ethnic groups continue to practice female genital mutilation (cir-
 cumcision).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join trade
 unions. For government workers, this right is limited to unions whose membership
 consists solely of government workers. Unions represent 10 to 20 percent of
 Malawi's small wage-earning labor force, and most organized wage workers are un-
 skilled laborers on large agricultural estates. Unions are required by law to affiliate
 with the Trade Union Congress of Malawi (TUCM). The TUCM, like both the Em-
 ployers Consultative Group and the Associated Chambers of Commerce, is a private
 organization ostensibly independent of the Malawi Congress Party, but in practice
 its activities are highly circumscribed by the Government. Restrictive colonial labor
 legislation has been subsumed largely intact into Malawian law.
 While technically legal, strikes are not tolerated in Malawi. Ministry of Labor offi-
 cers are quick to intervene at the first hint of labor unrest. In May workers from
 a variety of businesses who were dissatisfied over low wages and rapidly rising
 prices spontaneously walked off the job. The TUCM, however, did not support the
 
 
 156
 strikes. In a few hours, large, aimless crowds roamed the streets of Blantyre, even-
 tually confronting police. Over a 2-day period, reports suggest that 22 people died
 in the ensuing violence, though some sources contend that the death toll was some-
 what higher. Over the next several days other strikes and threats of strikes
 throughout the country caused employers to give workers 25- to 100-percent wage
 increases.
 The TUCM associates with international labor organizations and is a member of
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the Organization of Afri-
 can Trade Union Unity. It also belongs to the Southern African Trade Union Coordi-
 nation Council (SATUCC), which is headquartered in Lilongwe, though the Govern-
 ment closed this office indeimitely in April for reasons rising out of SATUCC See-
 retary General Chakufwa Chihana's arrest on sedition charges. Chihana, whose
 trial concluded in December, was convicted of two counts of sedition and sentenced
 to 2 years' imprisonment at "hard labor' (see Section 2i.).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the legal right
 to organize, but the law does little to restrict antiunion discrimination by employers.
 Complaints are resolved by the Ministry of Labor. When employees and employers
 cannot reach agreement on a labor issue, a labor officer from the Ministry of Labor
 meets with the two sides in an attempt to reach a consensus. This is usually suc-
 cessful. These ministry officials do not decide the outcome themselves.
 Collective bargaining is protected by law, but its use is limited by stark market
 realities. Skilled workers are in demand in Malawi and have enjoyed relative suc-
 cess when individually negotiating contracts. Unskilled workers are in oversupply,
 and this holds down their wages. Management-labor councils (called "work commit-
 tees"), which arose in direct response to the May disturbances, mediate labor issues
 in the workplace. Standing management-labor councils exist for large industries and
 businesses. The composition of the councils is generally half labor and half manage-
 ment, but there are no set procedures on how labor representatives are chosen or
 what relationship the committees have with existing unions. Grievances of all kinds
 (including wage issues) may be handled by these committees as long as they relate
 to work at that particular place of employment. When wage negotiations concern an
 entire industry nationwide, the Government involves itself in the discussions, and
 all parties work until a consensus is reached. However, the Government does not
 intervene overtly in the collective bargaining process.
 There are no export processing or free trade zones in Malawi.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor, which was widely
 practiced during colonial times, has never been formally outlawed, but it is opposed
 ythe Government and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 is 14. Enforcement by labor inspectors from the Ministry of Labor is not effective.
 Because there is no law providing compulsory education for children, many children
 are available for daily employment. In the large subsistence agriculture sector,
 where most Malawians work, children hel on family farms at a much younger age.
 Many also work on plantations, where tley are paid substantially less than the
 legal minimum wage.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Less than 15 percent of the work force is em-
 ployed in the formal wage sector. In May 1989, the Minimum Wage and Conditions
 of Employment Act nearly doubled the minimum daily wages in Malawi's three
 cities, but perhaps a quarter of the work force receives less than the legal minimum
 wage because of poor enforcement and because many workers are unaware they are
 entitled to a minimum wage. In 1992 the Government created a Wages Advisory
 Board to follow economic trends and make recommendations to President Banda
 concerning periodic changes in the minimum wage levels.
 The legal minimum wage.is not adequate for a decent living and is often supple-
 mented by additional employment. Minimum wages vary from urban to rural areas.
 For those fortunate enough to hold paying jobs, wages and working conditions are
 generally adequate to maintain slightly better than a subsistence standard of living.
 Many subsistence farmers supplement their earnings by also working as tenants on
 nearby estates. Labor laws address normal employment practices but do not cover
 tenancy agreements, and abuses are widespread.
 The standard legal workweek in Malawi is 48 hours with 1 day of rest, usually
 Sunday. Workers obliged to work on Sundays and official holidays must be paid
 overtime. Occupational safety standards are also set by law. However, their enforce-
 ment by Ministry of Labor inspectors is erratic.
