 JORDAN
 The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a monarchy. Its Constitution concentrates
 a high degree of executive and legislative authority in the King, who determines do-
 mestic and foreign policy. The Prime Minister and Cabinet manage the daily affairs
 of government. The Parliament, which consists of a 40-member Senate appointed by
 the King, and an 80-member Chamber of Deputies elected by the people, is rel-
 atively weak and not an effective check on executive authority.
 The General Intelligence Directorate (GID) and the Public Security Directorate
 (PSD) share responsibility for maintaining internal security and have broad author-
 ity to monitor the activities of persons believed to be security risks. They continue
 to be implicated in human rights abuses. The Government revoked martial law in
 1991, but important aspects of martial law remain, such as broad police powers.
 Jordan has a mixed economy with significant government participation in indus-
 try, transportation, and communications. Jordan has few natural resources and is
 financially dependent on foreign assistance and remittances from Jordanian nation-
 als working abroad. Because of the Government's policies during the Gulf War, Arab
 countries in the Gulf discontinued financial aid. The economy has been buffeted by
 high unemployment and inflation, and a sharp reduction of exports to Iraq due to
 United Nations sanctions.
 Human rights abuses include arbitrary arrest; mistreatment of detainees; pro-
 longed detention without charge; lack of due process; official discrimination against
 adherents of the Baha'i faith; and restrictions on women's rights. Citizens do not
 have the right to change their form of government, although in recent years, the
 King has ten some steps to increase participation in the political system. In 1992
 
 
 1117
 the Government legalized the establishment of political parties and has licensed 23
 parties to date. The parliamentary elections held in 1993 were free and fair. Voters
 may elect municipal officials and the lower house of Parliament, but overall deci-
 sionmaking authority remains with the King.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Legal Code guarantees prisoners the right to humane treatment, secu-
 rity forces continue to abuse detainees physically during interrogation. Torture alle-
 gations are difficult to verify because semurity officials frequently deny detainees
 timely access to lawyers. The most frequent aleged methods of torture include sleep
 deprivation, beatings on the soles of the feet, and extended solitary confinement.
 Defense lawyers for 25 Islamists, called the "Arab Afghans" who were tried in a
 military court for "attempting to destabilize the country, claimed that security offi-
 cers tortured their clients during pretrial detention from January to August 1994,
 and that their clients confessed under "duress". The court questioned each defend-
 ant about allegations of mistreatment. A number said that security officials had
 "hit" them but were unable to identify them. The Court permitted doctors to testify
 about the defendants' physical condition. However, the doctors were not able to ex-
 amine the defendants until months after the alleged beatings, and were unable to
 determine the cause of the defendants' injuries.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Code requires legal au-
 thorities to file formal charges within 10 days of arrest. The courts routinely grant
 prosecutors' requests for 15-day extensions of detention as provided by law, thereby
 extending the period of pretrial detention. If a suspect is detained for a long period,
 which generally happens only in state security cases, the authorities often do not
 provide defendants with the written charges against them or access to legal counsel
 until shortly before trial.
 In 1994 the police arrested approximately 70 Islamists as suspected security risks,
 including 40 in a roundup in the northern city of Salt.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and the Government does not resort to it.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Defendants are sometimes denied the right to fair
 trial in state security cases. The judicial system consists of civilian courts, which
 hear most criminal cases; the Appeals Courts (including the Court of Cassation); the
 Supreme Court- the State Security Court, which hears a range of offenses including
 sedition, armed insurrection, financial crimes and drug-related offenses; religious
 courts; and special courts, including one that has jurisdiction in disputes with gov-
 ernment agencies.
 In the civilian courts, most trials are open. Defendants are entitled to legal coun-
 sel, may challeng witnesses, and have the right to appeal. Defendants facing the
 death penalty orfe imprisonment must be rpresented by legal counsel.
 Islamic, or Shari'a, Courts have jurisdiction over marriage and divorce among
 Muslims and inheritance cases involving both Muslims and non-Muslims (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 Panels of three judges, who may be either civilian or military judges, hear trials
 in the State Security Court. Currently, only military judges are assigned to the
 Court. Although trials in the State Security Court are open to the public, in practice
 the Court has restricted the attendance of journalists, family members of the de-
 fendants, and diplomatic observers.
 Authorities hold defendants tried in the State Security Court for extended periods
 in pretrial detention without access to a lawyer. Defense attorneys in the Arab Af-
 ghan case complained that the Court did not give them sufficient time to prepare
 a defense because they were prevented from meeting with their clients until 2 days
 before the opening of the trial (see below and Section 1.c.). However, the Govern-
 ment permitted representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (IC C) to visit the defendants while they were in pretrial detention. Although State
 Security Court judges inquire into allegations of torture and permit the testimony
 of physicians regarding these allegations, the Court has not to date invalidated a
 defendant's confession because it was obtained under torture or duress.
 Defendants in the State Security Court have the right of appeal to the Court of
 Cassation, which is authorized to review the testimony, evidence, and judgment.
 These appeal procedures are being tested in the "Miu'tah" and Arab Afghan cases.
 In the Mu'tah case, which was tried from September to December 1993, the State
 
 
 1118
 Security Court found all 10 defendants guilty of plotting to assassinate the King.
 It sentenced the ringleader to death, two other defendants to life imprisonment, and
 the remaining seven to long_periods of hard labor. The Court of Cassation was re-
 viewing the case at year's end.
 The State Security Court began the trial of the Arab Afghans on August 27 and
 handed down verdicts on December 21. The Court sentenced 11 defendants to death
 by hanging, 7 to various prison terms with hard labor, and acquitted the remaining
 7 defendants of all charges. It sentenced three defendants in abstentia. The verdicts
 were in appeal before the Court of Cassation at year's end.
 The Government does not detain political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The po-
 lice must obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor General or a judge before conducting
 searches in most cases. However, in security cases, authorities sometimes, and in
 violation of the law, obtain warrants retroactively or obtain preapproved warrants.
 Security officers reportedly monitor telephones, read correspondence and engage in
 surveillance of persons that allegedly pose a threat to the regime. Wiile these prac-
 tices are not believed to be widespread, the law permits them if the Government
 obtains a court order.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the freedoms of
 speech and the press and citizens in general openly criticize the Government. How-
 ever, the Press and Publications Law of 1993 restricts coverage of 10 subjects, most
 notably the military services, the royal family, and monetary policy.
 The Government exercises control over the print media by requiring licenses for
 newspapers and periodicals. However, the Press and Publications Law of 1993 re-
 stricts coverage of 10 subjects, most notably the military services, the royal family,
 and monetary policy. However, the law does not prescribe penalties for publishing
 without a license, and no such case has yet arisen. The Government may revoke
 a license only if a company fails to publish for an extended period of time. The law
 eased licensing requirements. Since enactment, the Government has licensed 12
 weeklies, 2 dailies, and 4 research centers. The Government requires licenses for
 journalists, editors, and publishers. Journalists have long complained about the re-
 q irement that they must join the government-sponsored Jordan Press Association.
 However, the Government has not taken legal action against journalists who refuse
 to join the Association. The press law offers limited protection for the confidentiality
 of a journalist's sources.
 The Penal Code authorizes the State to take legal action against any person who
 incites violence, defames "heads of state," disseminates "false or exaggerated infor-
 mation outside the country which attacks state dignity," or defames public officials.
 Although the press law ended censorship, most journalists censor themselves.
 Journalists accused of violating the law are tried in a special court for press and
 copyright cases. Approximately 30 cases relating to freedom of the press were pend-
 ing in that court as of November.
 in May a journalist and an editor of the daily English-language Jordan Times
 were fined JD 300 (approximately dollars 430) for reporting that defendants in the
 Mu'tah trial claimed that security officers had tortured them while in detention. In
 June the former editor and a journalist of the weekly Al-Ahali were also fined the
 same amount for reporting the same allegations. The defendants in beth cases have
 appealed.
 The Government does not usually interfere with the importation of foreign news-
 papers and magazines. However, in 1994 the Ministry of Information prevented the
 entry into Jordan of some Arab publications, including a Lebanese periodical which
 was embargoed twice, purportedly for containing material regarded as morally offen-
 sive or critical of the royal family.
 In March the Minister of Information announced that, if asked, he would not per-
 mit the public screening of the American film, "Schindler's List." Movie distributors
 did not request such permission, and the film was not shown. However, the film is
 available in pirated videocassette format. The Government has not taken steps to
 seize copies or otherwise block distribution of the tape. The government-appointed
 Film Censorship Council prohibited showings of the Egyptian film, "The Terrorist,"
 on grounds that it might encourage extremist violence.
 The Government owns the radio and television companies, and radio and tele-
 vision news is more restricted than print media. Television news airs criticisms of
 the Government but rarely covers alleged human rights abuses. All political parties
 generally have access to broadcast facilities, but the cost of air time is prohibitively
 high. In the 1993 elections, the Government determined that no party would be
 given access to television because not all parties could afford the expense. Inter-
 
 
 1119
 national cable television programs are widely available by satellite from local ven-
 dors.
 In the past, some leftist and Islamist university professors were dismissed for ad-
 vocating extremist political views. Although there have been no known dismissals
 since the late 1980's, intellectuals believe that there are no safeguards to prevent
 future dismissals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens must obtain permits
 for any public gatherings. The Government has granted permits for peaceful dem-
 onstrations since 1989. The Government routinely licenses political parties and to
 date has licensed 23 parties. It is illegal to participate in an unlicensed party. The
 High Court of Justice may dissolve a party on aphcation of the Minister of Interior
 if the party violates the Constitution or the political parties' law. The Government
 has no discretion to deny a license to a party that sulbmits a complete application,
 including names of the founders, financial information, and _bylaws.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-According to the Constitution, Islam is the state religion.
 Sunni Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the population. The Government does
 not interfere with the public worship of Jordan's Christian minority. The Govern-
 ment does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a religion but does not prohibit the prac-
 tice of the faith.
 The law prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing. Muslims who convert to other
 faiths complain of social and government discrimination. The Government does not
 fully recognize the legality of such conversions. Under Islamic law, converts are re-
 garded as apostates and may, in principle, be legally denied their proper  and
 other rights, although this does not happen. Converts from Islam do not fall under
 the jurisdiction of their new religion's laws in matters of personal status and are
 still considered Muslims under Shari'a law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel abroad and within Jordan, except in and
 through military areas. The law requires that Jordanian women and foreign women
 married to Jordanians must obtain written permission from a male guardian to
 travel abroad or apply for a passport. This requirement is normally enforced only
 when a married woman plans to travel abroad with children. Legal authorities will
 enforce requests from fathers to prevent their children from departing the country,
 even when traveling with their mothers.
 Many Palestinian residents are Jordanian citizens--with all the rights of citizen-
 ship. The Government authorizes other Palestinians to carry Jordanian travel doca-
 ments. Palestinians must obtain permits from the Ministry of Interior for travel be-
 tween the East Bank and the Israeli-occupied territories and neighboring states.
 The permits are routinely granted. In May the Government eased travel restrictions
 on Palestinians, allowing residents of the Occupied Territories to enjoy unlimited
 residence and travel in Jordan.
 Over 1.2 million Palestinian refugees are registered with the United Nations Re-
 lief and Works Agency. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees in assisting refugees. There have been no reports that
 the Government has expelled anyone with a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have any meaningful ability to change their system of government
 given that executive and legislative powers are concentrated in the handE of the
 King. He has sole discretionary authority to form and dismiss the Cabinet, dissolve
 Parliament, and to establish the broad parameters of public policy. Appointments
 made by the King to high Government posts do not re    legislative approval. The
 Prime Minister and the Cabinet have limited pollcymaing powers.
 The Parliament is composed of a Senate appointed by the King and a Chamber
 of Deputies elected by the people. Of the 80 seats in the Chamber, 9 are reserved
 for Christians, 6 for bedouins, and 3 for Circassians or Chechens, which are ethnic
 minorities. The Parliament is empowered to approve, reject, or amend legislation
 proposed by the Cabinet. In practice, Members of Parliament ask the Government
 to submit specific legislation for consideration. The King may propose extraordinary
 sessions of Parliament and may postpone regular sessions up to 60 days. The King
 must approve by decree all laws passed by Parliament. If the Government amends
 or enacts a law when Parliament is not in session, it must submit the law to Par-
 liament for consideration during the next session.
 At year's end, 6 of 31 ministers and 11 of 80 parliamentarians are of Palestinian
 descent. This representation is in large part the result of an electoral system which
 gives greater representation to south Jordan, which has few inhabitants of Palestin-
 ian origin. Women have the right to vote. Three women ran for Parliament in the
 
 
 1120
 1993 election; one was was elected to a seat reserved for Circassians. Women's
 groups encouraged women to vote, and in the Amman area, nearly half of those who
 voted were women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups investigate allegations of human
 rights abuses and have published and disseminated findings critical of government
 policy. However, the press and publications law restricts the publication of informa-
 tion about the military and security services, which, in effect, prevents the publica-
 tion of torture reports and other abuses allegedly committed by the security serv-
 ices.
 The Arab Organization for Human Rights and the Amman-based Peace Center for
 Humanitarian Studies are registered with the Government and have raised human
 rights cases in public and in private with government officials. Both organizations
 have drawn public attention to alleged human rights abuses and have pressed the
 Government to explain the status of some prisoners and to charge or release the
 prisoners promptly. The Bar Association also raises human rights concerns regard-
 ing the application of the law and due process. The Government grants the ICRC
 access to detainees and prison facilities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women experience legal discrimination in matters of pension and social
 security benefits, inheritance, divorce, and the value of testimony in court (see Sec-
 tion i.e.). Under Islamic law, or Shari'a, female heirs receive half the amount of a
 male heir's inheritance, while the non-Muslim widows of Muslim spouses have no
 inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance
 goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents property.
 Male Muslim heirs have the duty to provide for all family members who need assist-
 ance. Under Shari'a law, the testimony of two women is required to equal the testi-
 mony of one man. This technically applies only in religious courts but is sometimes
 imposed in civil courts as well, irrespective of religion. Men are able to obtain di-
 vorce more easily than women under Ilamic law. Marriage and divorce matters for
 Christians are adjudicated by special courts for each denomination.
 The Government provides males with more generous social security benefits than
 those for women. The Government continues pension payments of a deceased male
 civil servant to his heirs, but it discontinues the pension payments of a deceased
 female civil servant.
 By law, a married woman requires her husband's permission to obtain a passport.
 Married women do not have the legal right to confer citizenship on their children.
 However, they may confer citizenship on their non-Jordanian husbands who then
 may obtain citizenship for the children. Civil law grants women equal pay for equal
 work, but in practice this law is sometimes ignore&
 Social pressure against women pursuing a career is strong. Nonetheless, women
 have employment opportunities in many professions, including engineering, medi-
 cine, education, and law. Women's groups stress that the problem of discrimination
 is not only one of law but also of women's lack of awareness of their rights or un-
 willingness to assert those rights. The Jordanian chapter of the Business and Pro-
 fessional Women's Club gives seminars on women's rights and assists women in es-
 tablishing small businesses.
 Medical experts acknowledge that spousal violence against women occurs. Cul-
 tural norms constrain victims from seeking medical or legal help and frustrate a sci-
 entific assessment of the extent of the abuse. Abused women have the right to file
 a complaint in court against their spouses, but in practice, familial and societal
 pressures discourage them from seeking legal remedies. Nongovernmental organiza-
 tions provide assistance to victims of domestic violence. Wife beating is technically
 Drunds for divorce, but the husband may seek to demonstrate in court that the
 beating occurred because the wife was irreligious or did not obey him. This defense
 stems from a Koranic injunction to hit an irreligious or disobedient wife, not to in-
 jure her but to show her the error of her ways. It is within the discretion of a
 Shari'a Court judge to deny a divorce in such cases.
 The Criminal Code stipulates a sentence of 1 year for persons found guilty of com-
 mitting a "crime of honor-which is the murder of a female, usually by a male rel-
 ative, for alleged sexual misconduct. Even if the defense cannot meet the stringent
 condition to plead a crime of honor defense-the defendant must have witnessed the
 female victim engaging in intercourse-offenders rarely spend more than six months
 to two years in prison. By contrast, the penalty for murder is 15 years. Women may
 
 
 1121
 not invoke the crime of honor defense for murdering a male relative under the same
 circumstances. The law restricts a crime of honor to "he who surprises his wife or
 any close female relative committing adultery."
 Children.-Although the law prohibits children under the age of 16 from working,
 child street peddlers may be observed on the streets of Amman. The Ministry of So-
 cial Development has a committee to address the problem and in most cases re-
 moves the children from the streets, returns them to their families, and provides
 the families with a monthly stipend. Corporal punishment in schools is prohibited.
 Although social workers say there is a significant incidence of child abuse within
 families, the problem is difficult to quantify.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government has granted full citizenship
 to all Palstinians who fled to Jordan in the period after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war
 and to a large number of refugees who arrived after the 1967 war. However, refu-
 who fled Gaza after 1967 are not entitled to citizenship and are issued only
 limied-vlidty passports.
 Palestinians suffer disproportionate scrutiny in taxation and discrimination in the
 award of university scholarships and appointments to senior positions in the Gov-
 ernment and the military.
 Religious Minorities.-The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a
 religion. It does not record the religion on national identity cards issued to Baha'is,
 nor does it register property belonging to the community. Unlike Christian denomi-
 nations, the Bah'i community does not have its own court to adjudicate personal
 status and family matters. Baha'i personal status matters are heard in Islamic law
 courts.
 The Government does not officially recognize the Jehovah's Witnesses, the United
 Pentecostal Church, the Church of Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
 Day Saints, but they conduct their activities without harassment.
 Established religions require official government recognition in order to register
 property in the name of the church, but members may practice their religion with-
 out government recognition. In general, Christians do not suffer discrimination.
 Christians hold cabinet and other government positions and are represented in the
 media and academia approximately in proportion to their presence in the general
 population. In the military, Circassians are over representedin certain units. Chris-
 tian and Baha'i schoolchildren in public schools are not required to participate in
 Islamic religious instruction.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government passed legislation in 1993 requiring
 future public buildings to accommodate the needs of the disabled and the retro-
 fitting of existing public buildings, but implementation has been slow. High unem-
 ployment in the general population restricts job opportunities for the disabled. Pri-
 vate organizations and members of the royal family actively promote programs to
 educate and rehabilitate the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers in the private sector and in some state-
 owned companies have the right to establish and join unions. Unions must be reg-
 istered to be considered legal. The law prohibits union membership for noncitizens.
 About 25 percent of the work force is organized into 17 unions. Although union
 membership in the Jordan Federation of Trade Unions (JFTU), the sole trade fed-
 eration, is not mandatory, all unions belong it. The Government subsidizes and au-
 dits the JFTIEs salaries and activities. Union officials are elected by secret ballot
 to 2-year terms. Although the Government co-sponsors and approves the timing of
 these elections, it does not interfere in the choice of candidates. Unions may not af-
 filiate with international bodies.
 Labor laws prohibit strikes if a labor dispute is under mediation or arbitration.
 If a settlement is not reached through mediation, the Ministry of Labor may refer
 the dispute to an industrial tribunal by agreement of both parties. If only one party
 agrees, the Ministry of Labor refers the disputx  o the Council of Ministers and then
 to Parliament. The tribunal is an independent arbitration panel of judges appointed
 by the Ministry of Labor. The decisions of the panel are legally binding. Labor law
 prohibits employers from dismissing a worker during a labor dispute. There were
 no known strikes in 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have, and exercise,
 the right to bargain collectively. The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimina-
 tion, but the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions claims that the Gov-
 ernment does not adequately protect employees from antiunion discrimination, and
 that the Government has dismissed public-sector employees for political reasons.
 Workers may lodge complaints about antiunion discrimination with the Ministry of
 
 
 1122
 Labor, which is authorized to order the reinstatement of employees discharged for
 union activities. The Ministry has done so in three out of eight cases in 1993-94.
 The national labor laws apply in the free trade zones in Aqaba and Zarqa. Private
 sector employees in these zones belong to one national union that covers both zones
 and have the right to bargain collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids compul-
 sory labor, except in a state of emergency such as war or natural disaster. Compul-
 soy labor is not practiced.
 Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor law forbids children under
 the age 16 from working except as apprentices, beginning part-time training-6
 hours a day, no night shit-at age 13. Ministry of Labor inspectors attempt to en-
 force the law on child labor, but in practice the enforcement often does not extend
 to some small family businesses which employ underage children. Education is com-
 pulsory to age I5. Famiies in remote areas frequently keep some school age chil-
 dren at home to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The Gov-
 ernment periodically adjusts a minimum wage schedule for various trades, based on
 recommendations of an advisory panel representing workers, employers, and the
 Government. The lowest minimum wage rate on the schedule is about $140 a
 month, including allowances. Workers earning the lowest wage fred it difficult to
 stay above the poverty level, which the Government estimates at a monthly wage
 of about $86 per month for a family of three.
 The law prohibits most workers from working more than the customary 48 hours
 a week--54 hours for hotel, restaurant, and cinema employees. Workers may not
 work more than 16 hours in any continuous period or more than 60 hours' overtime
 per month. Employees are entitled to 1 day off each week. The law does not apply
 to domestic servants, who do not have a legal forum to address their labor griev-
 ances. Domestic servants, almost all of whom are foreigners, have no standing to
 sue in court for nonpayment of wages.
 The law specifies a number of health and safety requirements for workers, includ-
 ing the presence of bathrooms, drinking water, and first aid equipment at work
 sites. The Ministry of Labor makes an effort to enforce health and safety require-
 ments, but is hampered by the lack of qualified inspectors. The inspectors do not
 have the power to order firms to comply with health and safety standards. The law
 does not require em loyers to report industrial accidents or occupational diseases
 to the Ministry of Laor.
