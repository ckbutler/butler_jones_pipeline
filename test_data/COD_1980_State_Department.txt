 ZAIRE
 Zaire's constitution provides for a highly centralized
 and personalized presidential one-party government.
 President Mobutu assumed office in 1965 in the wake of
 a military coup. In 1967, he founded the Popular
 Movement of the Revolution (MPR) as the political arm
 of government and, since 1974, the sole legal political
 party. Formation of additional parties is illegal.
 Constitutionally, the Executive Council (Prime Minister
 and Council of Ministers), the Legislative Council
 (popularly-elected national assembly), the judiciary,
 and the labor movement are organs of the MPR along
 with the Party Congress, its Political Bureau, and
 Central Committee. The President heads both the
 party and the state, appointing the Prime Minister
 (First State Commissioner) and his cabinet. The
 President shares law-making authority with the Legis-
 lative Council, although he retains and exercises the
 constitutional power to promulgate laws by decree. Zaire
 has a civilian government, but military officers are
 sometimes appointed to government positions and President
 Mobutu himself retains his military rank.
 The government continued to apply a policy of amnesty
 toward political exiles and refugees, hundreds of
 whom, including ex-Katangan rebels, continued to return
 home for resettlement or reintegration into their
 former occupations. Two special amnesties substantially
 reduced the prison population and shortened remaining
 sentences for most prisoners. The 1980 judicial
 reform abolished the oppressive Judicial Council,
 reinforcing the independence of the bar. The Ministry
 of Justice launched a campaign to improve prison
 conditions by reducing overcrowding, thus improving
 prison management and physical conditions. Nonetheless,
 prison conditions, particularly at local jails, remain
 harsh. Arbitrary arrest and detention, military and
 police abuse, extortion, and corruption still are
 common. Many Zairians continued to suffer from a lack
 of adequate food, shelter, health care, transportation,
 and access to education and jobs that pay an adequate
 wage. Though progress toward economic stabilization
 under an International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby
 agreement has been encouraging, high inflation and
 economic stagnation remain the most serious problems
 affecting the welfare of Zaire's citizens.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Although Article 13 Title II of the Zairian constitution
 explicitly prohibits the use of torture and all other
 means of degrading and inhuman treatment, there have
 been allegations of torture in 1980. Some prisoners
 arrested in Bas Zaire in March 1980 allegedly were
 beaten in order to extract information implicating
 other suspects in anti-regime activities. Incidents of
 local police and military personnel beating suspected
 
 
 303
 criminals and targets of extortion continue to be
 widespread. Although President Mobutu has condemned
 such abuse, disciplinary action against personnel
 inflicting physical punishment continues to be sporadic.
 Reports of depriving prisoners of food for days are
 also common, although such deprivation usually is not
 for the purpose of punishment but rather reflects
 inadequacy of prison food supplies or their diversion.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Despite government efforts in 1980 to improve prison
 conditions, some abuses were reported, particularly
 with regard to military and national security police
 prisons. Conditions in the local jails or "cachots"
 are particularly bad, often with little provision made
 for prisoner food, water, sanitation or bedding.
 There are reports that some prisoners must take turns
 sleeping on the floor for lack of space. In the Zairian
 legal system, civilian suspects are not supposed to be
 held'in the local jails for more than 24 hours before
 appearing before a magistrate to hear the charges
 against them. However, some prisoners are held without
 charges for days, weeks, and sometimes months. Reports
 of brutality and extortion by the arresting officer and
 guards are common. The Ministry of Justice has begun
 efforts to investigate charges of ill treatment or
 extortion and to identify and remove offending prison
 personnel. They are also allocating limited funds for
 prison improvements.
 Some of the worst prisons, such as Ekafera in Equateur,
 were closed. The Department of Justice budget for
 civilian prison improvements was increased by 127
 percent and a program begun to upgrade physical plant
 and improve food, water, and sanitation facil-ities.
 Fishing, food and -.ash crop agriculture, and poultry
 and cattle raising programs instituted in a few rural
 detention centers have already paid off in improved
 prisoner nutrition.
 Recognizing that overcrowding severely aggravated
 already poor prison conditions, the government took
 several measures to reduce prison populations. The
 President pardoned a limited number of prisoners in
 May and June, and in October declared amnesties commuting
 all 139 death-row cases to life sentences and all life
 sentences to 20 years. All those serving sentences of
 two years or less were released. Sick prisoners were
 released this year to reduce overcrowding and as a
 pragmatic solution to poor or nonexistent medical
 facilities. The Ministry of Justice instituted a more
 systematic review of prisoner cases and set up a manage-
 ment training program designed to produce competent,
 honest court and prison clerical staff and to eliminate
 unwarranted or dishonest bureaucratic delays in prison
 releases. These reforms have not yet had an effect on
 the prison system.
 
 
 304
 Overcrowding and inadequate medical, sanitation,
 food, and exercise facilities are also found at military
 and national security police prisons. Some prisoners
 held at these prisons were physically abused, denied
 access to normal judicial procedures, and held incommu-
 nicado for several months.
 In 1979 President Mobutu approved an International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) request to visit and
 investigate conditions in civilian, military, and
 security police prisons in the country. In 1979 and
 1980 ICRC representatives visited selected prisons in
 Kinshasa and Shaba. In early spring the ICRC team
 members visited all major prisons and detention camps in
 the Equateur Region and in October were given access to
 military prisons in Kinshasa. In May and October they
 visited, and were able to interview privately, prisoners
 in the civilian and security prisons in Kinshasa.
 The Zairian judicial system allows for execution
 for certain crimes. In February 1980 four persons
 found guilty of violent crimes were executed.   Other
 reports of summary executions could not be substantiated.
 c. Disappearances
 During 1980 the national security police arrested and
 detained some prisoners for several months before
 notifying their families. Once notified, family members
 were permitted to visit prisoners and bring food supple-
 ments. Some families of prisoners once held in the
 Ekafera prison in Equateur Region have had no contact
 with and have been unable to obtain information on the
 whereabouts of their family member since the prison
 closed in the beginning of the year. It is not known
 whether these prisoners are still alive. This and
 similar situations appear to result from administrative
 incompetence rather than any intentional policy of
 prisoner "disappearance."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under Article 49 Title III of the 1978 constitution,
 the President can declare a state of national siege
 or emergency and suspend rights guaranteed to citi-
 zens under Article 15 which protect them against
 arbitrary arrest and detention. During this period
 of national emergency, the security police or military
 can arrest suspects wlthout filing formal charges
 and hold them for interrogation for an unlimited period.
 Although no formal declaration of national emergency
 was made during 1980, security police arrested suspects
 for threatening national security and held them without
 charge for weeks and months.
 Although there is no way of knowing the number of
 detainees currently being held without charges and
 
 
 305
 
 benefit of formal legal procedures, arbitrary arrests
 are common. Vagabonds and beggars are routinely
 arrested and detained for unspecified periods. Irreg-
 ularly paid, underpaid soldiers and policemen often
 detain citizens without provocation or on flimsy grounds
 in order to extract bribes for their release. Law
 enforcement personnel sometimes abuse their power by
 accepting money to arrest citizens.
 During the past year the government moved to control
 these excesses. In areas where soldiers were more
 regularly (although still poorly) paid this year, the
 incidence of military road-blocks and shake-downs
 decreased. The government intervened to release
 journalists arrested by local law enforcement personnel
 for criticizing and offending a local dignitary.
 Of sixty persons arrested in March in Bas Zaire and
 held without charges in a security detention center,
 all but four were either released or transferred
 to a civilian prison for formal arraignment by early
 October. The public trial of the four defendants
 charged with attempting to organize a political party
 and other political offenses ended November 28 with a
 quilty verdict and three-year sentences for two accused,
 a 10-month sentence for the third, and'acquittal for the
 fourth defendant.
 Non-judicial sanctions against persons suspected
 by the security police of threatening the security of
 the state are authorized by law. These sanctions range
 from restriction of movement or travel to house arrest
 or administrative detention.
 e. Denial.of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are almost always public but are not always
 fair, although the right to a fair trial is provided
 by law. All defendants have the right to a defense
 counsel, who is generally free from government pressure.
 Indigene defendants are assigned free counsel by the
 court. Private lawyers continue to enjoy freedom and
 independence from government control after successfully
 resisting a 1979 move to bring all lawyers into
 government employment. Arrestees are protected
 procedurally from arbitrary arrest by the requirement
 that within 24 hours they be brought before a magistrate
 to hear charges against them. If the magistrate
 decides that there was cause for arrest, and therefore
 a trial, he will request a detention warrant which
 allows the accused to be held for five days. Within
 the five day period, a bail hearing must be held,
 after which the judge must decide bail within 24
 hours. Defendants accused of a crime with l9st than a
 six month sentence may be released while awaiting
 trial, unless they have no fixed address, no ties to
 the community, or appear likely to flee. Those accused
 of crimes punishable by a longer than six month sentence
 can be held in preventive detention. Their detention
 must be reviewed after two weeks and then reviewed
 monthly until the trial is held. Defendants may appeal
 their cases.
 
 
 306
 In 1972, a special court of state security was
 established to hear cases involving threats to national
 security, armed robbery, and smuggling. The procedures
 outlined for legal protection in civil courts are
 available to defendants in security courts, except that
 the latter judgments cannot be appealed.
 Procedures for trial in the military courts are provided
 in a military penal code. Normally, military courts
 hear only those cases involving military personnel. In
 times of emergency, however, the President can suspend
 the civilian courts and require all cases to be heard in
 the military courts. The procedures for protecting
 defendants' rights in civilian courts still apply.
 In practice, defendants in criminal, security or
 military cases are often held for extended periods
 with no charges brought against them. Some are released
 after months of detention without ever having been
 brought to trial. The fairness of trials is sometimes
 compromised by bias or corruption, particularly at the
 lower levels. The 1980 revision of the judicial
 code abolished the Judicial Council, which previously
 supervised the Supreme Court and all other judges and
 had the power to review all court decisions. Though
 civil judges are now more independent, they are still
 supervised by the Department of Justice and sometimes
 are subject to political pressures. Because judges
 are poorly paid, many solicit and accept bribes from
 defendants to render favorable verdicts, thereby
 contributing to a system that favors the wealthy.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Judicial warrants are required by law before the
 police are permitted to search a home, except in
 cases of threat to national security. During 1980
 security police on occasion entered and searched
 citizens' homes without obtaining a warrant and without
 convincing evidence that a threat to national security
 existed. No incidents of "bugging", demolition,
 or sealing doors and windows of private homes or
 offices have been reported.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Though reliable statistics are not available, there
 is widespread agreement that the standard of living
 for the average Zairian continued to decline in 1980.
 Causes of this trend are the cumulative effects of
 incompetent management, leakage and misallocation of
 foreign exchange, and external factors such as deter-
 iorating terms of trade, exacerbated by pervasive
 corruption. In 1980, the government continued its
 efforts -- with the aid of international organizations
 
 
 307
 -- to improve the recapture of foreign exchange earnings
 and limit the budget deficit, even as it repaid massive
 rescheduled overseas debts.
 The government has undertaken a series of austerity
 measures designed to halt Zaire's economic decline.
 In mid-1979, the government adopted an IMF stabili-
 zation program imposing harsh deflationary medicine
 aimed at cutting domestic demand. While the short-
 term effect of adhering to the stabilization plan
 has been further privation for a people already in
 severe want, the plan is designed to establish a
 longer-term basis for economic recovery.
 The approximately 75 percent of the Zairian population
 that lives in rural areas is among the world's poorest,
 lacking adequate access to public services such as
 medical care and schools. One quarter of the population
 is urban, and migration from rural areas continues to
 swell urban populations. Food is scarce and expensive,
 and malnutrition is prevalent both among urban dwellers
 and in the countryside. It is probably the single most
 serious health problem and contributes to high rates of
 death and illness from other causes.
 The rural-exodus and serious malnutrition both result
 from ill-advised governmental policies and practices
 over the past 20 years. These include neglect of
 agricultural investment, ill-conceived price controls
 and export taxes, and corrupt and incompetent adminis-
 tration. The scarcity of all goods and services
 (including transportation) in the countryside greatly
 reduces the productivity of the farmer. The economic
 downturn and scarcity of foreign exchange means that
 industrial firms are running at only a fraction of
 capacity due to shortages of imported spare parts and
 raw materials. Urban unemployment statistics are
 unreliable, but the jobless rate likely approaches 50 percent
 in Kinshasa, the capital city. Remuneration for
 productive activity in industry, agriculture, and the
 services sector is so inadequate that many public and
 private employees often engage in moonlighting, either
 in illegal smuggling or legal speculative or trading
 activities.
 Health care tends to be curative rather than preventative,
 is extremely limited in scope and availability in
 urban areas, and outside the few church-run hospitals
 and clinics is practically nonexistent in rural areas.
 Many public hospitals and dispensaries do not function
 for lack of supplies. Theft and sale of medical supplies
 by poorly paid public health personnel is common.
 The literacy rate in Zaire for persons over age
 15 varies regionally between 40 and 50 percent.
 Rates are lower in rural areas and lowest for rural
 women. Education is expensive and in short supply at
 all levels, particularly in the rural areas where
 
 
 308
 secondary schools and institutions of higher learning
 are virtually nonexistent. Increasing numbers of
 parents cannot afford to send their children to
 schools. There are only half as many girls enrolled in
 primary schools as there are boys. Teachers' salaries
 are paid sporadically and late by the government,
 although an effort is currently underway to rationalize
 the payroll system and eliminate systematic padding by
 administrative personnel.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution incorporates the guarantees called for
 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 The government controls the press and media. Articles
 and opinion pieces must be approved by a government
 review commission before publication. Although the
 review process has an intimidating effect upon journalists,
 they are not harassed if a piece is rejected by the board.
 Investigative reporters and academic researchers both
 tend toward self-censorship. Journalists and writers
 take care not to criticize directly the President -- a
 criminal offense -- or his-close associates. They do
 criticize government practices, inadequate services, and
 corrupt local officials, however. During 1980, there
 were some cases of arbitrary arrest of journalists who
 had criticized or offended a high-level regional or
 local official, but the central government intervened to
 release those detained.
 From time to time certain issues of foreign magazines
 are censored or banned by the government. An Agence
 France Press journalist who had written a number of
 critical reports was expelled by the government
 in 1980.
 Right of assembly is qualified by the requirement
 that groups be legally recognized. Groups of more
 than a few persons may not assemble without a permit,
 which is only issued to legally recognized groups.
 Under the constitution, all citizens are members of the
 sole political party, the Popular Revolutionary Movement
 (MPR). Likewise, all social, political, sport or youth
 associations must be under the rubric of the party to
 have legal status. There is only one recognized labor
 union in Zaire empowered to call strikes, negotiate and
 organize. Although its right to strike is restricted by
 both legal and political considerations, the union
 carried out several job actions in 1980 which won higher
 salaries and benefits for employees.
 University workers, followed by students at the national
 university, went on strike for higher stipends, wages,
 and transportation allowances in the early spring.
 
 
 309
 Between 40 and 100 students were arrested and detained.
 All students were released in the aftermath of the visit
 by Pope John Paul II. During the student riots, several
 government vehicles were destroyed and some students
 were beaten by soldiers brought in to suppress the
 demonstrations, which had taken on heavily anti-govern-
 ment overtones. At no time, however, did the soldiers
 open fire on students.
 Nearly 65 percent of Zaire's population is affiliated
 with a Christian church. The government officially
 sanctions protestantism (a variety of sects), Catholicism,
 Kimbanguism, Islam, Judaism and Eastern Orthodoxy.
 Despite constitutional provisions to the contrary,
 all other religions and sects currently are prohibited
 by law. There are established procedures for new
 churches to obtain legal recognition, however. Following
 the May visit of the Pope, the government began a
 campaign to encourage greater activity by the churches
 in economic and social as well as religious fields. The
 government includes support for Protestant, Catholic,
 and Kimbanguist mission schools and clinics in its
 central budget.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 In principle, any Zairian citizen may obtain a passport
 and exit visa. In practice this process is sometimes
 delayed and impeded by officials angling for bribes to
 facilitate the paper work. A married woman must have
 her husband's authorization before obtaining a passport,
 but once the document is issued she need not get her -
 husband's approval to travel. If her husband is
 incapacitated in some way or refuses to authorize the
 passport, she can take her case to the courts, which
 are empowered to override a husband's denial. Travel
 within Zaire is generally unrestricted, although special
 permits are required in certain (mainly diamond-mining)
 areas. Soldiers and gendarmes manning highway check
 points sporadically demand payment from travelers.
 The government sets the official figure for refugees
 to whom it provides safehaven at approximately 700,000.
 Since the government permits refugees to seek employment
 and settle on farms, most refugees are self-sufficient
 and integrated into the Zairian economic system within
 a year or two of arrival. The United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the number
 of refugees requiring protection or assistance at over
 300,000. Angolan refugees account for the largest
 group, estimated at 215,000. There are about 11,000
 Burundians, 22,000 Rwandans, and roughly 200,000
 Ugandan refugees. There is no evidence of forcible
 repatriation of refugees safehavened in Zaire. Zaire
 works cooperatively with the UNECR to guard refugee
 rights.
 Since the declaration of a general amnesty for
 refugees and political exiles in June 1978, more than
 
 
 310
 190,000 Zairians have been repatriated from Angola,
 Zambia, Europe, Sudan, and Tanzania. The government
 is now negotiating with ex-Katangan rebel leaders,
 the Angolan government and the UNHCR for the voluntary
 return to their homelands of several thousand more
 Zairian refugees and the tens of thousands of Angolan
 refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The 1978 constitution provides for a powerful presidency
 and a highly centralized government. All citizens
 are members of the one political party (the MPR)
 headed by the President. Opposition parties are
 illegal and the single party functions to mobilize
 popular support rather than as a vehicle to express
 citizens' opinions. Citizens over 18 years of age must
 vote. Legislative Council (national assembly) elections
 held in 1977 were contested freely, and by all accounts
 fairly, by multiple candidates in each regional
 constituency. The Legislative Council debates public
 policy, interpellates ministers and formulates
 Zairian laws. The President, however, also exercises
 the constitutional power to promulgate laws by decree
 and thereby override the Council. Quite active
 during 1979 and early 1980, the Council has since
 been reined in by the President, disappointing those
 who had hoped it would develop quickly into a powerful
 institution providing a vehicle to expand popular
 participation in government. On December 31, a prominent
 member of the Legislative Council was detained, for
 alleged   "outrage against the Chief of State, subversive
 activities, and incitement to revolt against the estab-
 lished order." Five others who went to the President's
 residence to protest this action were also detained. No
 legal proceedings had been initiated as of January 12,
 1981 and it was unclear whether the incident would be
 handled by the party disciplinary commission or by the
 courts.
 No regional, tribal, social or racial group is denied
 citizenship or political participation. There are
 unofficial regional and ethnic quotas in the university.
 These quotas are designed to protect various ethnic
 groups from exclusion by university officials who
 tend to recruit and select from their own ethnic
 group. Women's rights to own property and participate
 in the political process are protected by law, but
 their role is restrained by tradition and custom.
 There are growing numbers of women in the professions,
 government, business, and the university. Women have a
 limited role in the modern sector of the economy and top
 levels of government. Married women must obtain their
 husband's authorization before opening a bank account,
 accepting a job, or renting or selling real estate.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 During 1980 the government demonstrated a growing
 recognition of the need to respond to foreign and
 
 
 311
 domestic concerns about human rights issues in Zaire. It
 has demonstrated a willingness to engage in a dialogue
 with some international non-governmental organizations
 concerned with human rights.
 During 1980.Amnesty International issued several reports
 critical of the human rights situation in Zaire. Amnesty
 expressed concern regarding poor prisoner treatment
 and high mortality rates, the arrest and detention
 without trial of suspected critics of the government,
 and the continued holding of political prisoners.
 Amnesty also reported allegations that eight persons
 were killed while in government custody in Kinshasa in
 late 1979 and early 1980. The government has taken
 strong public exception to the Amnesty reports, and has
 provided Amnesty with its rebuttal.
 In early 1980 the government invited several international
 human rights organizations and Kinshasa-based diplomatic
 missions to conduct an on-site investigation of the
 1979 incident at the Mbuji-Mayi diamond mines in which
 several people were killed. Apprehensive over the
 effectiveness of such an investigation long after the
 event and unhappy with the ground rules, none of those
 approached accepted the invitation.
