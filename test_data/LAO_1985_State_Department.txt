 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is ruled by a
 Communist Government established in December 1975 after an
 insurgency of 20 years supported by North Vietnam. The sole
 political party, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, takes
 its political ideology from Marx, Lenin, and Ho Chi Minh. It
 is dependent on Vietnamese and Soviet military and economic
 support to retain power. Laos' approximately 3.6 million
 ethnically diverse people, scattered over more than 91,000
 square miles of rugged terrain, have no common national
 history and share few common traditions. National
 institutions remain weak. There is no constitution or
 codified body of law. No national elections have been held
 since the establishment of the regime.
 The Government's insecurity and efforts to establish a
 Communist political and economic structure based on the Soviet
 and Vietnamese models have resulted in numerous human rights
 violations. Regional and domestic political tension,
 scattered anti-government resistance activity, and poor
 economic conditions continue, contributing to a siege
 mentality on the part of the narrowly-based Lao leadership.
 The Government is faced with a number of resistance groups
 which field as many as several thousand fighters seeking its
 overthrow. The approximately 50,000 Vietnamese troops in Laos
 regularly conduct operations with the Lao People's Army (LPA)
 against resistance groups and serve as the ultimate guarantor
 of the Government's survival. The state security apparatus,
 which reinforces central control through threats, fear,
 intimidation, and imprisonment, is a primary source of human
 rights abuses. Its power over the lives of Lao citizens is
 legally unrestricted.
 Laos is an extremely poor and underdeveloped country.
 Although Laos apparently met its food needs with a successful
 1984/85 crop year, nutritional levels remain barely adequate.
 Most large businesses were nationalized after 1975 and efforts
 during 1985 to reduce further the scope of private trade have
 disrupted supplies.
 Human rights violations continued in 1985, and the individual
 remained subject to the arbitrary control of the state and the
 Communist Party. Compared with the period just after the
 Communist takeover, there have been a few limited improvements
 in the human rights situation since 1983. In 1985, few people
 were apparently sent to "re-education camps," some were
 released, and the conditions of some who remain under
 detention reportedly improved. However, serious abuses such
 as arbitrary arrests and detention without trial still exist.
 Government pressures against private economic activity
 increased. The totalitarian nature of the regime is mitigated
 somewhat by the importance of humane values in traditional Lao
 culture.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Refugee reports continued in 1985 of villagers, particularly
 Hmong tribespeople, being killed or made ill by government
 and/or Vietnamese forces using toxic weapons. However, such
 
 
 814
 LAOS
 reports were fewer than in 1983 and 1984 and have not been
 verified. There are occasional reports that Lao government
 and Vietnamese patrols have fatally shot persons fleeing from
 Laos and those entering the country illegally, usually
 smugglers or suspected members of the anti-government
 resistance.
 An unknown number of people are killed annually in combined
 Lao/Vietnamese military operations against resistance forces.
 Many of the insurgents appear to be former Royal Lao Army
 troops and Hmong tribesmen. Both sides are reported to use
 brutal tactics, with the anti-government forces attempting
 ambush and assassination of Lao, Vietnamese, and other
 Communist military and civilian personnel. There are
 recurrent reports of lethal attacks in isolated areas on
 vehicles bearing government officials and on buses. These are
 attributed to resistance elements but have also involved
 ordinary robberies. Resistance groups in 1985 also reportedly
 killed a few aid experts from Communist countries. Official
 policy calls for the execution of resistance leaders, but no
 such executions were reported in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 Although there were numerous cases of secret arrest and
 removal of persons to "re-education" camps in the first years
 of the present regime, disappearances have been reported only
 infrequently in the last several years and not at all in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of torture for the past six years.
 Some "re-education" prisoners continue to be held in harsh
 conditions. Former prisoners have reported that punishment
 for misbehavior could include brutal public beatings,
 shackling, deprivation of food, and sometimes, for those who
 tried to escape, execution. Some inmates died from
 malnutrition. Lao government officials have publicly denied
 reports of mistreatment of persons in the "re-education camps."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Lao Government continues to maintain a number of
 "re-education camps" in which persons associated with the
 previous Government are imprisoned. Firm figures are not
 available, but it is believed that 1,000 to 3,000 persons
 remain imprisoned.
 Since 1979, conditions in most of the "re-education camps"
 have reportedly improved, and a number of camps have been
 closed. Most detainees are now living in a kind of internal
 exile under conditions that--except for the severe restriction
 on their freedom of movement--generally are no worse than
 those of poor Lao living in the countryside. Many have
 reportedly been assigned to collective farms or construction
 units in areas near their former camps. Some are on probation
 or cannot arrange necessary internal travel documents. Others
 who have lost property and families are reported to have
 chosen to remain in areas near the camps to begin new lives.
 Amnesty International estimated, in its 1985 Report, that as
 many as 6,000 individuals live under some form of restriction
 and it has adopted more than 40 such political detainees as
 prisoners of conscience.
 
 
 815
 LAOS
 In 1985, government officials claimed, as they had in 1984,
 that nearly all soldiers and officials sent to "re-education
 camps" in 1975-76 had been "released" and that "only a few"
 people remained under detention. Some government officials
 contend that all "re-education camps" have been closed. In
 June 1985 the Council of Ministers reportedly adopted a
 resolution authorizing the return of detainees to their homes,
 but without specifying any dates of release. In 1985 the
 Government permitted at least 50 "re-education camp" prisoners
 to return to Vientiane.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of what the
 Government calls "socially undesirable habits," such as
 prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and "wrong thought" are
 sent to "rehabilitation" centers, usually without trial. Most
 of these persons have been allowed to return to their homes
 after periods ranging from a few months to several years of
 hard labor, political indoctrination, and admission of guilt.
 In 1985, there were reports that some unemployed and idle
 youths in Vientiane and other urban areas were rounded up and
 sent against their will to the countryside to work on public
 works projects, in some cases to join "patriotic youth" groups
 also working on such projects.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No code of law exists in Laos and there is no guarantee of due
 process. The Government is still revising the pre-1975 law
 code and rehabilitating the court system. It has promulgated
 interim rules and regulations for the arrest and trial of
 those accused of specific crimes, including armed resistance
 to the Government. Although the regulations allow an accused
 person to make a statement presenting his side of the case,
 they provide no real opportunity for the accused to defend
 himself and do not permit bail or use of an attorney. Rather,
 the Government has issued instructions on how to investigate,
 prosecute, and punish wrongdoers. These instructions are
 applied capriciously and inconsistently. People can be
 arrested on the unsupported accusations of others and detained
 while the accusations are investigated, without being informed
 of the charges or the person making the accusations. Those
 arrested are not always informed of the charges against them,
 and investigations often take a long time unless family
 members and friends take a strong interest in the case.
 Government officials and their families can easily influence
 the judgments reached. There is some provision for appeal,
 although important political cases tried by "people's courts"
 are without an appeal process. Amnesty International reported
 that seven persons sentenced to prison in 1983 were permitted
 informally to appeal their convictions and were released in
 1984. Death sentences must be approved by the Council of
 Ministers. Lao regulations call for judgment to be given in
 public. This is, in effect, a public announcement of the
 sentence and not a public trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search and seizure are authorized by the security bureaus
 themselves rather than by an impartial judicial authority, and
 government regulations, which are not always followed, provide
 little protection for the persons affected. International and
 domestic mail is selectively opened on a routine basis. Mail
 from China and non-Communist countries is particularly
 
 
 816
 LAOS
 suspect. Telephone calls are frequently monitored.
 Privately-owned land may not be sold but can be inherited.
 Houses, appliances, and other private property can be sold
 only with difficulty in most cases, since the possession of
 large amounts of cash in this.poor country draws immediate
 government suspicion. Inheritances cannot be passed on to
 relatives who have left the country as refugees and acquired
 another nationality. Only government officials and ,others
 whom the Government determines, have-a professional need are
 allowed to possess non-Communist foreign newpapers, magazines,
 and other publications. The Government makes no attempt to
 stop Lao from watching Thai television or listening to foreign
 radio stations such as theVoice of America. The state
 security apparatus monitors family life extensively through a
 system of neighborhood wardens and informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Lao press is owned by the Government and party and used to
 disseminate official positions. Written or spoken opposition
 to the Government is not permitted. Persons who have engaged
 in such activities have been jailed. Most Lao are intimidated
 from discussion or association with foreigners. Academic
 freedom does not exist.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls all meetings and, except for religious
 and athletic events, organizes them. Individuals do not have
 the right to join-together to promote causes not sponsored by
 the regime or to protest government policies. All
 associations--such as those for youth, women, workers, and a
 "peace organization"--are government-controlled and authorized
 'mass organizations." These are organized to exercise
 government control and di.sseminate government policy. All
 professional groups are organized by the party, and their
 leadership is ordinarily drawn from party ranks.
 Trade unions are organized as "mass organizations" of the
 party without the right to engage in collective bargaining.
 They have no real influence in determining working conditions.
 Lao associations are permitted to maintain relations with
 like-minded organizations in other countries, particularly
 those in Communist countries. Ordinarily Lao citizens are
 permitted association or contact with foreigners only in rare
 and unusual circumstances, usually involving their work.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nearly all Lao are Buddhists or, in the case of some hill
 tribes, animist. After 1975, the Government took over some
 Buddhist and Christian places of worship for use as political
 indoctrination centers or warehouses. This practice appears
 to have ceased, however, and construction of Buddhist temples
 has been observed. Buddhist temples have become more active,
 and the number of monks has increased.
 In official statements, the Government has recognized the
 right of the people to religious belief as well as the
 contributions religion can make to the development of the
 country. However, many Lao believe that the Government has
 
 
 817
 LAOS
 begun a long-term effort to subvert the role of religion, in
 part because it considers the maintenance of temples and the
 activities of monks non-productive. This effort includes
 carefully controlling the education of young monks and
 compelling the Buddhist clergy to propagate some elements of
 Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Monks are the only remaining
 social group still entitled to special honorific terms of
 address, and even high party and government officials continue
 to use them. Religious festivals are permitted to take place
 without hindrance. Young people regularly.enter into
 religious orders for short periods. Links may be maintained
 with coreligionists and religious associations only in
 countries approved by the Government, usually other Communist
 countries. Traditional links to Thai Buddhists are no longer
 permitted. In theory, missionaries are not banned from
 entering Laos to proselytize, but in most cases they have been
 denied permission. Many top party officials still participate
 in religious ceremonies, but the military are forbidden even
 to have Buddhist funerals.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship
 without harassment, but the activities of their churches are
 closely observed. Since 1975, they have not been permitted to
 operate schools, seminaries, or associations, although some
 short-term training sessions for local Protestant church
 leaders have been permitted. In 1985 a few church leaders
 remained under detention, allegedly for anti-government
 activity. In addition, two priests were confined to
 "re-education camps" with no charges made against them.
 Catholic Church officials visited Laos in 1985 to meet with
 local Catholic Church leaders. The Government has taken
 steps, including the use of media, to persuade hill tribe
 minority groups to abandon their "old-fashioned" animist
 beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lao citizens must obtain permission from the authorities for
 all internal travel of any distance and in all cases when
 crossing provincial boundaries. A curfew exists in the
 capital and other major cities. Its rules change from time to
 time, as does its enforcement. Government officials have
 cited threats of "disorders" created by "reactionary" elements
 as the reason for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is permitted for officials, students in
 government-approved programs, and some others who have access
 to foreign exchange. Lao are rarely permitted to study or
 train in non-Communist countries even at their own expense.
 Exit visas are required and are difficult to obtain, but in
 1983, 1984, and 1985 there were noticeable increases in the
 number of Lao permitted to travel abroad. Border crossing
 permits are available for those with business in Thailand.
 Although the Government has said that those wishing to
 emigrate will be allowed to so do, as a practical matter legal
 emigration is rarely authorized for ethnic Lao and, when it
 is, reportedly requires substantial bribes. Since 1975 over
 300,000 of the Lao who have fled Laos have registered as
 refugees in Thailand. An unknown number of other Lao who have
 fled the country have simply settled in with kindred ethnic
 groups.
 Some of those fleeing have been fired upon and killed by Lao,
 Vietnamese, or Thai border patrols as they attempt to cross
 
 
 818
 LAOS
 the Mekong River. Many Lao caught seeking to leave illegally
 have been imprisoned, although in some cases they have only
 been-sent to short indoctrination seminars and then released.
 The Lao and Thai Governments have agreed to take back, on a
 case-by-cfse basis, those of their respective citizens who
 have illegally crossed into the other country and wish to
 return home. Since May 1980, when agreement was reached with
 Thailand and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) on a voluntary repatriation program, about 3,000 Lao
 refugees voluntarily returned to Laos under the auspices of
 the UNHCR. Those accepted for return receive several days of
 political indoctrination and are then released to return to
 their homes, where they are placed under the control of the
 village authorities. The UNHCR provides basic necessities and
 monitors treatment and living conditions thereafter. Perhaps
 as many as 5,000 to 10,000 refugees have repatriated
 themselves without official involvement. There is reportedly
 no pattern of official harassment or maltreatment of these
 voluntary returnees. Laos has also agreed in principle to
 -receive back Lao citizens determined not to be entitled to
 refugee status by the Thai-UNHCR screening program begun in
 1985.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Laos is ruled by a small elite of the Lao People's
 Revolutionary Party, the sole party. There is neither freedom
 to participate in politics outside the party nor popular
 choice of policies or officials. After the Communists seized
 power in May in 1975, but before the establishment of the
 present regime in December of that year, local elections were
 held in which voters chose from a list of candidates selected
 by the party. Representatives to the Lao Supreme People's
 Council were reportedly chosen by those local officials,
 although this process was not made public. Recently, Phoumi
 Vongvichit, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, told an
 Australian academic that the Supreme People's Council was
 "elected" on December 2, 1975, by the National Congress of
 People's Representatives which proclaimed the LPDR. There
 have been no national elections. A few "by-elections" have
 been organized to replace representatives who have died or
 been transferred.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Laos has refused to cooperate with the U.N. Secretary
 General's investigation of the use of chemical/toxin weapons
 in Laos. It does not cooperate with private international
 organizations interested in human rights. It does
 occasionally permit visits by officials of international human
 rights organizations if the purpose of the visits is not
 specifically related to allegations of human rights
 violations. In the past, the Lao Government has permitted the
 UNHCR to investigate to a limited degree the status of Lao
 refugees voluntarily repatriated from Thailand. In 1985, a
 senior UNHCR official made a brief visit to Vientiane.
 Amnesty International in its 1985 Report stated that its main
 concern "is the continued restriction in remote parts of
 northeast and southeast Laos of large numbers of people being
 detained without trial since 1975 because of their alleged
 
 
 819
 LAOS
 positions or activities under the pre-1975 government." It
 also expressed concern at the lack of due process or legal
 safeguards due to the absence of a constitution or code of
 law. Freedom House rates Laos as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Laos is approximately 3.6 million. Overall,
 population growth is estimated as 2.0 percent annually. About
 85 percent of the population is engaged in agriculture. The
 World Bank in 1983 estimated Laos' per capita gross national
 product (GNP) at $143. The country's economic problems are
 complicated by inadequate internal transport and isolation
 from the sea. The avowed aim of the Government is economic
 self-sufficiency and improved conditions for the people
 through a socialist transformation of the economy, including
 collectivization of agriculture. The Government has declared
 that farmers will not be forced to join collectives but
 continues to apply strong pressure on them to join, and.
 economic incentives are given to those who do so. The
 Government has nationalized most of Laos' few industries and
 tried to impose strict controls on private enterprise.
 Limited private trade continues, however, because the
 Government recognizes the present limitations of the state
 trading system. In 1985 efforts to restrict such trade
 intensified.
 The economy in 1985 was tied more closely to that of Vietnam
 by, among other things, reducing foreign trade links through
 Thailand and upgrading such links through Vietnam. The dollar
 exchange value of the kip dropped more than 30 percent between
 January and October. Laos continues to experience serious
 foreign exchange problems and has difficulty in paying its
 import bills for many necessities, including fuel. Natural
 and man-made problems continue to hold timber and coffee
 exports far below their potential. In addition, the
 Government has used these commodities and minerals to pay for
 barter trade with Soviet bloc countries, rather than selling
 them for hard currency. Partial Thai restrictions.on the
 types of goods permitted to transit through Thailand may have
 played a role in these developments.
 Health conditions are poor but improved marginally in 1985.
 In 1985, the World Bank estimated infant mortality at 116.2
 per 1,000 live births, which represents a slight reduction
 from 1984 and a significant one from 1976 when government
 figures placed the rate at 204 per 1,000 live births. Life
 expectancy at birth was approximately 44.66 years in 1985.
 According to government statistics, in 1982 there were only
 226 physicians and 1,184 other medical personnel in the
 country. Major causes of death in Laos are gastrointestinal
 diseases from unsafe drinking water, malaria, respiratory
 infections, and malnutrition. In 1982 the daily calorie
 supply of the average Lao was recorded by the World Bank as
 being 90 percent of requirements. The Government is
 attempting to improve public health by training more personnel
 in basic health care, modernizing 13 provincial hospitals,
 constructing clinics in all districts, inoculating against
 cholera and other diseases, promoting adult education on
 preventive hygiene, and improving water supplies. In 1975,
 100 percent of the urban but only 32 percent of the rural
 population had access to safe water, according to the World
 Bank.
 
 
 820
 LAOS
 Lao authorities are continuing a campaign to reduce illiteracy
 and claim it has been eliminated in some provinces. The World
 Bank estimated the literacy rate at 43.6 percent for the
 period 1980-1982. The Government claims that approximately 93
 percent of children aged 5-14 attend school regularly. The
 World Bank estimate for 1980 was 73.69 percent. Teacher
 training, however, has usually been rudimentary. According to
 some accounts, in both provincial and urban areas the time
 teachers must devote to supplementing their meager salaries
 causes them to reduce classroom hours substantially. The
 Government carries out an intensive program of adult education
 aimed at indoctrinating adults along "socialist lines."
 Emphasis in higher education is placed on training technicians
 and engineers to work on development projects. Thousands of
 Lao students have been sent abroad for training in the
 U.S.S.R., Vietnam, and Eastern Europe. The pool of trained
 manpower in Laos is gradually increasing as students begin to
 return from abroad, but some do not find jobs in their areas
 of training.
 -Laos has set neither minimum wage, maximum workweek, nor
 safety or health standards for the workers in its almost
 entirely rural and agricultural economy. Workweeks typically
 fall well under forty-eight hours, with some exceptions such
 as during urgent road-building or construction projects.
 Workplace conditions are not systematically exploitative, but
 they sometimes fail to protect workers adequately against
 sickness or accident. Work permits customarily are not issued
 to persons under eighteen, although children frequently work
 with their parents in traditional occupations such as farming
 and shopkeeping.
 The role of women in Lao society has been traditionally
 subservient to that of men, but discrimination is not highly
 pronounced. The government-controlled Lao Women's Federation
 has as one of its stated goals achievement of rights for woman
 'equal" to those of men. Lao women are currently being
 encouraged to. take an increasing part in economic and
 state-controlled political activity. According to 1980 World
 Bank figures, the primary school enrollment ratio for girls is
 80 percent of that for boys, although the literacy rate among
 women is only 70 percent of that among men.
 Approximately half of the population in Laos is ethnic Lao,
 also called "lowland Lao"; 20 percent are tribal Thai; 15
 'percent are Phoutheung (or Kha); and other mountain tribes
 constitute another 15 percent (Hmong, Yao and others). The
 Lao Government is attempting to integrate these groups and
 overcome traditional antagonisms between lowland Lao and
 minority groups.
 The.Hmong are split along clan lines. Many were strongly
 anti-Communist, but others sided with the Communist Pathet Lao
 and'the Vietnamese. The Government is repressive toward all
 groups that fought against it, especially those who continue
 to resist its authority by force. The Hmong tried to defend
 some of their tribal areas after 1975 and some continue to
 support anti-LPDR resistance groups. Vietnamese and Lao armed
 forces conduct military operations against both resistance
 groups, the tribally-based ones in the north and the
 resistance forces from lowland Lao groups, mainly in southern
 Laos.
 
 
 821
 LAOS
 The Government wants to resettle in the lowlands some ethnic
 minorities who now inhabit mountainous areas where they would
 be under closer government control and engage in settled
 agricultural production. The Government has reportedly
 abandoned the use of force in favor of a voluntary program
 based on material inducements.
 Deterioriation in Sino-Lao relations since 1979 has resulted
 in continuing increased Lao Government suspicion and
 surveillance of local ethnic Chinese. The Government so far
 has not persecuted or expelled Chinese although it allows them
 to emigrate rather freely; in fact, the majority of Chinese
 resident in Laos in 1975 have since left on their own, largely
 for economic reasons. Those who remain have maintained
 Chinese schools in Vientiane and Savannkhet and Chinese
 associations in several provincial capitals.
