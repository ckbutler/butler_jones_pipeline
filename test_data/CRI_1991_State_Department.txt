 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is an established democracy with separate executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches and a Supreme Electoral
 Tribunal considered to be a foutth branch of government.
 Elections for president, two vice-presidents, and 57 deputies
 to a unicameral legislative assembly are held every 4 years;
 they have been free and fair. Rafael Angel Calderon won the
 February 1990 presidential elections, in which approximately 80
 percent of eligible voters participated. The president is
 constitutionally barred from reelection to the presidency for
 life. Members of the Legislative Assembly may be reelected but
 only after at least one term out of office.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished Costa Rica's standing army.
 Law enforcement and citizen protection are shared by the Civil
 Guard, the Crime Prevention Unit, and the Antidrug Police in
 the Ministry of Public SecUrity; the Rural Guard and the
 Directorate of Narcotics and Intelligence in the Ministry of
 Government; the Directorate of Intelligence and Security in the
 Ministry of the Presidency; and the Judicial Police in the
 Supreme Court. The San Jose Metropolitan Police and the
 Ministry of Public Works and Transportation's Transit Police
 also have limited police functions. Public security forces
 generally observe procedural safeguards established by law and
 the Constitution and are under effective civilian control.
 Export-orieited businesses, both agricultural and light
 industrial, lead the Costa Rica economy. 'Economic growth
 slowed during 1991 to a projected 1.5 percent. The right to
 own private property is protected by the Constitution, although
 there have been delays in recent years in compensating foreign
 and Costa Rican owners for properties expropriated for
 incorporation into nature protection or Indian reserves. In
 the southern border area, squatters' clashes with property
 owners, including some who are U.S. citizens, have sometimes
 become violent; three houses were burned and one squatter was
 killed in May.
 Costa Ricans enjoy a wide range of individual rights and
 freedoms. There were some reports of mistreatment by police
 and many prisoners suffer excessive periods of pretrial
 custody. The Costa Rican State, reflecting a society-wide
 consensus, is committed to extending effective protection of
 basic rights and freedoms to all Costa Ricans.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government does not practice, abet, or condone political
 killing, and none was reported.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known or reported incidents of politically
 motivated abductions or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and
 holds invalid any statement obtained through violence. These
 
 
 547
 COSTA RICA
 prohibitions are usually respected in practice, but incidents
 of police mistreatment are sometimes reported. Prisoners
 generally receive humane treatment. Though there have been
 occasional charges of mistreatment by prison guards in past
 years, no such charges were made by inmates in 1991. These
 charges can be taken up with the Special Defense Counsel for
 Prison Inmates, which investigates any such accusations.
 Serious cases are handled by the office of the Chief Prosecutor
 (Ministerio Publico). Public concern about crowded
 penitentiaries and the availability of weapons in prisons is
 growing. Occasional rioting is a problem in several large
 prisons. The Government has earmarked nearly $1 million to
 repair the more rundown prisons, some of which are over 100
 years old. Improvements were made to a number of prisons in
 1991.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Judicial warrants are required for arrests4 and an arraignment
 before a representative of the court must take place within 24
 hours of arrest. Article 48 of the Constitution entitles
 detained persons to a judicial determination of the legality of
 the detention. These rights are generally respected, although'
 persons charged with major offenses often remain in pretrial
 custody for long periods. Approximately 40 percent of those
 currently in prison have yet to be tried.
 The right to bail is provided for in law and observed in
 practice. Bail is sometimes denied to repeat offenders,
 however, and is usually denied to foreigners and major drug
 offenders on the assumption that they would leave the country
 before coming to trial. Generally, detainees are not held
 incommunicado. With judicial authorization, however, suspects
 may be held for 48 hours after arrest or, under special
 circumstances, for up to 10 days. The judiciary is generally
 effective in ensuring that legal and constitutional safeguards
 are observed.
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent and assures a fair public trial.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts,
 known as tribunals ("tribunales" or "juzgados"). Its 24
 magistrates are elected by the Legislative Assembly to 8-year
 terms. Accused persons may select their own attorneys; access
 to counsel is guaranteed and honored in practice. The State
 provides legal counsel to those who cannot afford an attorney.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reported instances during 1991 of extralegal
 invasions of privacy conducted by, or with the knowledge of,
 the Government. Judicial warrants are required to search
 private homes, and police generally comply.

 COSTA RICA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically provides for freedom of speech
 and press, which is generally respected in practice. There are
 9 private newspapers, 6 private television stations, and 1
 public and 79 private radio stations. The media freely
 criticize the Government, and there is no evidence of
 self-censorship or governmental intimidation.
 In May a lower court ordered the seizure of all 2,500 copies of
 the first edition of El Caso-Chamisse, a book alleging that a
 prospective presidential candidate was involved in a 1973
 murder of a suspected drug dealer. The order was made
 following a libel complaint by the candidate. This led to
 accusations of prior censorship by the authors and by many
 newspapers. As a result of public pressure, the lower court
 reversed itself, and the book was allowed to be distributed a
 week later. The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court in
 June ruled that the 89-year-old press law was
 unconstitutional. The law had stipulated that the Supreme
 Court was the court of first instance for all slander and libel
 cases dealing with journalists, in effect eliminating any right
 to appeal. The June decision allows such cases now to be tried
 in penal courts (i.e., criminal tribunals).
 In 1983 the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a U.S.
 journalist for violating a 1969 law requiring licensing by the
 journalists' guild. A 1985-advisory opinion by the
 Inter-American Court of Human Rights declared the law
 incompatible with the Inter-American Human Rights Convention.
 The Arias government (1986-1990) publicly supported the law,
 however, and there were two additional convictions, resulting
 in suspended prison sentences and fines in 1989. In 1990
 unlicensed foreign correspondents in Costa Rica were briefly
 harassed by police. The current Calderon Administration has
 publicly supported the-licensing requirement on the grounds
 that it ensures professionalism.
 Films, plays, and television shows are regulated by an Office
 of Censorship and a Censorship Tribunal, which reviews appeals
 of the Office's actions. In 1989 the censor's office banned
 the film, The Last Temptation of Christ. An association of law
 students brought the case to the Ombudsman for Human Rights,
 who overturned the ban in November 1989. The acting Attorney
 General rescinded that decision in January 1990. As of the end
 of 1991, the case was still pending before the Constitutional
 Chamber of the Supreme Court.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional provisions of freedom of assembly and
 association are fully respected. Permits required for parades
 or similar large-scale gatherings are granted routinely; they
 are not required for other public meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by the Constitution and
 generally observed in practice. Roman Catholicism, however, is
 the official state religion. Foreign missionaries and clergy
 of all denominations work and proselytize freely. Costa Ricans
 affiliated with non-Catholic groups note, though, that
 non-Catholic-churches are required to comply with building
 
 
 549
 COSTA RICA
 codes from which Catholic churches are exempt. These groups
 are seeking remedial legislation. A group of religion teachers
 filed suit before the Supreme Court in July, asking that the
 Law on Career Educators be overturned. It stipulates that all
 teachers of religion must be approved by the Catholic Church's
 episcopal conference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Though there are no restrictions on travel within the country,
 all citizens and residents are required to obtain an exit visa
 before traveling abroad. Emigration and right of return are
 not restricted, however. Costa Rica supports multinational
 refugee programs and has accepted many refugees from Central
 and South America. Many Nicaraguan refugees have been
 voluntarily repatriated following the April 1990 change of
 government in Managua. The Constitution specifically prohibits
 repatriation of anyone subject to political persecution.
 Political asylum traditionally has been granted to exiled
 dissidents of various political orientations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Costa Ricans choose their government through free, open, and
 competitive elections. The integrity of elections is ensured
 by the independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and election
 results are respected. The Legislative Assembly can and does
 reject executive branch initiatives. Citizens can and do
 petition their elected representatives for legislative redress
 and assistance with government bureaucracies.
 The ruling Social Christian Unity Party and the opposition
 National Liberation Party control 29 and 25 seats,
 respectively, in the 57-member Legislative Assembly. The
 Communist Party holds one seat. Two independent provincial
 parties hold one seat each-
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A 1984 executive order created the office of ombudsman for
 Human Rights, now housed in the Ministry of Justice, which
 hears complaints from individuals about human right abuses. A
 similar office considers complaints concerning the penitentiary
 system.
 Three nongovernmental groups monitor and report on human rights
 in Costa Rica: the Costa Rican Commission for Human Rights,
 the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central
 America, and the Family and Friends of Political Prisoners of
 Costa Rica. There are also numerous private groups dedicated
 to assisting refugees.
 Costa Rica has traditionally been a strong supporter of
 international and private human rights organizations. The
 Inter-American Institute of Human Rights maintains its
 headquarters in San Jose. The Government has invited the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit the country
 whenever it wishes.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Costa Rica's population includes some 24,000 indigenous
 people. Most live in traditional communities on 21 reserves
 which, in part because of their remote location, often lack
 access to schools, health care, electricity, and potable water.
 Indigenous people participate in the management of their own
 affairs through the National Indian Commission (CONAI).
 According to CONAI; about 20 percent of the indigenous people
 are undocumented and so lack proof of citizenship. In the
 2,000-member Guaymi group, the figure increases to 70 percent.
 Lack~of documentation prevents voting or running for'office and
 makes it difficult to obtain credit. The Guaymis publicly
 protested their status in 1990. In April 1991, President
 Calderon signed a law that will permit 7,000 indigenous people
 to obtain identification papers within the next 3 years.
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is
 legally unrestricted. Women and men are generally paid equally
 for equal work. A Women's Defense Counsel has been established
 to work with various government agencies to protect women's
 rights and offer women advice and information on how to fight
 sexual discrimination. The press reports on a disturbing rate
 of violent crime against women, raising the level of public
 awareness of the problem. Physical abuse of women, including
 domestic violence, is prosecuted and often results in stringent
 penalties. Abuse of female minors is considered aggravated
 assault. There are a number of groups that monitor abuse of
 women and provide counseling-
 Costa Rica's population of 30,000 blacks, who reside largely on
 the Caribbean coast, enjoys full rights of citizenship,
 including the protection of laws against racial discrimination.
 The 1990-1994 Legislative Assembly includes one black member,
 as did the last. The Government treats all matters of racial
 discrimination as human rights issues; the Defense Counsel for
 Human Rights deals with these and other such issues.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to join unions of their choosing without prior
 authorization. Approximately 15 percent of the work force is
 organized. Unions are independent of government control and
 are generally free to form federations and confederations,
 exemplified by the merger of three social democratic labor
 federations in 1991, and to affiliate internationally.
 The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations (AFL-CIO), the ICFTU, and other trade union
 organizations, however, have contended that trade unionism's
 right of association has been hurt by the "Solidarismo"
 movement in Costa Rica, an alternative to traditional trade
 unionism which espouses cooperation between employers and
 employees. Solidarista associations are financed in part by
 employers and are allowed under Costa Rican law to offer a wide
 range of services and engage in profit-making activities, which
 unions are not permitted to do. A "permanent workers'
 committee" from an association will often enter into "direct
 agreements" with an employer. This sometimes bypasses attempts
 by an established union to reach a collective bargaining
 agreement. In June the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Freedom of Association (CFA) concluded that the
 
 
 551
 COSTA RICA
 interference of Solidarista associations in trade union
 activities, including collective bargaining, is in conflict
 with the principle of full independence for workers'
 organizations in carrying out their activities. The CFA noted
 the Government's agreement to enact legislation to ensure the
 real separation of functions between unions and Solidarista
 associations.
 The law restricts the right of public sector workers to strike
 and imposes penalties on those who do. Nevertheless, they
 strike with some frequency, and fines imposed are often dropped
 as part of a strike settlement. At year's end a bill was
 pending before the Legislative Assembly to repeal these'
 articles. Strikes and labor unrest were at low levels in 1991.
 The one major labor action was a 2-day work stoppage held in
 June to protest the Government's economic policies. The
 stoppage effectively closed down the public schools and all but
 the most essential public services.
 There are no restrictions per se on the rights of private
 workers to organize and strike. The Labor Code contains
 clauses, however, that allow employees to be fired for
 nonspecific reasons. Some employers have used these provisions
 as license to fire workers-who seek to strike. Very few
 private sectors employees are union members and there were no
 private sector strikes of any consequence in 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize is protected by the Constitution; much of
 the 1943 Labor Code, however, is outdated. One clause permits
 workers to be discharged "at the will of the employer,"
 provided the worker is paid the required compensation. This
 has often been used to fire labor organizers. Public sector
 workers cannot engage in collective bargaining because the
 Public Administration Act of 1978 makes labor law inapplicable-
 in relations between the Government and its employees. The
 Government has promised the ILO that it will enact remedial
 legislation to protect union organizers, and proposals to
 modernize the Labor Code were under consideration in the
 Legislative Assembly at year's end. Collective bargaining is
 allowed in the private sector but, due to the dearth of unions,
 this is more a de jure than de facto right.
 Labor regulations in nine export processing. zones do not differ
 from those in the rest of the economy but-often are not
 enforced. Lack of resources is cited by the Labor Ministry as
 the reason why labor regulations are often not enforced in the
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 there are no known instances of either.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution provides special employment protection for
 women and minors and establishes the minimum working age at 12
 years, with special regulations in force for workers under 15.
 A child welfare agency, in cooperation with the Labor Ministry,
 is responsible for enforcement. Although data is lacking,
 child labor appears to be an integral part of the large
 informal economy. Enforcement in-the formal sector is
 reasonably effective.
 
 
 552
 COSTA RICA
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution provides the right to a minimum wage. A
 National Wage Board, composed of three members each from
 government, management, and labor, sets wages and salaries for
 all sectors. The wages set are minimums. Wages can and do
 exceed the set amounts. The Board usually meets at the
 beginning and middle of each year. While violations sometimes
 occur, these wage and salary levels are generally respected.
 The minimum wage rates, which are legally enforceable, were
 last set in May and-June for the private and public sectors.
 Workers at the low end of the wage scales often find it
 difficult to maintain a minimum standard of living. A 1990
 Ministry of Planning study found that at minimum wage levels,
 about 97 percent of a worker's pay was spent on food; this
 worsened in 1991.
 The Constitution sets the workday hours, remuneration of
 overtime, days of rest, and annual vacation rights. It
 requires compensation for discharge without due cause. Maximum
 work hours are set at 8 hours for daytime and 6 hours for
 nighttime work, with weekly totals of 48 and 36 hours,
 respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work not
 considered unhealthful or dangerous, but weekly totals may not
 exceed 48 hours. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime
 premium of 50 percent of regular wages for work in excess of
 the daily work shift. Agricultural workers are not paid
 overtime, however, if they work beyond their normal hours
 voluntarily;,there is little evidence that employers coerce
 such overtime from employees.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace. This
 law requires industrial, agricultural, and commercial firms
 with 10 or more workers to establish a management-labor
 committee. The law allows the Government to inspect workplaces
 and to fine employers for violations. There are too few labor
 inspectors, especially outside of San Jose, to ensure that
 minimum conditions of safety and sanitation are maintained.
