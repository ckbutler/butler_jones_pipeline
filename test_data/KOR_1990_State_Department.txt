 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea continued a transition from
 authoritarianism towards democracy and openess begun in 1987;
 however, elements of its authoritarian past remained. Power
 remained highly centralized, though less so than in previous
 years. SurVeillance of political opponents by security forces
 continued, as well as detentions under sweeping national
 security laws. In December 1987, Roh Tae Woo became Korea's
 first directly elected President since 1971. In the April
 1988 legislative elections, the three opposition parties
 together gained control of the National Assembly. However, in
 January 1990, the President's party and two of the opposition
 parties merged to form a new ruling party controlling more
 than two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly,
 plunging Korean politics into a period of confrontation. In
 July the ruling party railroaded-several controversial bills
 through the National Assembly. The opposition Assemblymen
 responded by resigning, only to return in mid-November after- a
 4-month absence. Despite unprecedented high-level
 inter-Korean talks in 1990, North Korea remained a military
 threat, and tensions rooted in the division of the Korean
 peninsula and the Korean War remained strong.
 In 1990, as in 1989, Korea's powerful security services were
 noticeably more active than in 1988. The security services
 continued to collect information on a wide variety of people,
 from opposition politicians to student radicals and labor
 activists. The authorities also detained a large number of
 such people who held views the Government considered
 dangerous, bften failing to present warrants as required by
 law. Despite high levels of trainini and discipline, there
 were credible reports of the use of excessive force by
 police. Such reports increased after the Government launched
 a "war on crime" in the fall.
 After 3 years of double-digit Gross National Product (GNP)
 growth, the Korean economy grew more slowly in 1989 and 1990.
 After a solid first-half performance the-Government projected
 real GNP growth for 1990 at 8 to 9 percent. Nevertheless,
 recent events in the Middle East, the likelihood that higher
 oil prices will increase inflation, and concern about Korea's
 external accounts, have rekindled Korean concerns about a
 possible economic slowdown. Concern over the effect of
 labor-management disputes on the economy was one reason for
 the crackdown on union activity in 1990. However, curbing
 inflation-has become the Government's top economic policy
 priority. Urban housing shortages, continued high levels of
 rural migration to the cities, labor shortages, and unbalanced
 regional development continue to pose problems for the Korean
 economy.
 Based on gains made during the watershed years of 1987 and
 1988, Korea today is a more tolerant and open society than it
 was in the mid-1980's. During these 2 years the Korean press
 became freer, and the judiciary more independent; workers
 asserted their right to organize unions and bargain
 collectively. Yet the continuing gap between democratic
 ideals and actual practice was apparent in the continued
 arrest of dissidents, students, and workers under the National
 Security Law (NSL), the Law on Assembly and Demonstrations,
 and the labor laws.
 Credible charges that prisoners were mistreated--in both
 political and nonpolitical cases--continued. Police broke up
 
 
 930
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 several wildcat strikes, including one at Korea's largest
 television network. The Constitutional Court upheld the NSL,
 although the court also said it should be applied only in
 cases involving a real threat to national security.
 Nevertheless, the authorities continued to arrest people whose
 views they considered dangerous. In 1990, for the first time
 during the Sixth Republic, the Government broke up two groups
 it described as "antistate organizations," arresting more than
 60 people in the process. In October a draftee revealed that
 a military intelligence agency was still collecting
 information on a large number of civilians, in spite of
 repeated government pledges to stop this practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political killings, and, unlike in
 previous years, no reports of deaths in official custody.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no documented cases of permanent disappearance
 during 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Credible allegations of cruel treatment continued in 1990.
 Although political cases get the most publicity, lawyers say
 that mistreatment of people detained or arrested for
 nonpolitical crimes is widespread. The alleged mistreatment
 reportedly includes acute sleep deprivation, being forced to
 stand during long periods of questioning, verbal abuse, and
 beatings. Two men arrested on charges of theft in late
 September claimed they were mistreated at a police station.
 Police admitted the men were beaten while under investigation.
 After the Government declared a "war on crime" in the fall, a
 growing number of criminal suspects charged they were
 similarly mistreated by police. A survey of 1,025 police
 inspectors from around Korea showed that 75 percent of them
 supported a partial restriction on human rights in dealing
 with criminals, while 48 percent said that if they strongly
 believe that a suspect is guilty their superior officers would
 tacitly approve "inflicting a little pain" to get a confession.
 In 1990 the courts made several rulings in cases involving
 torture. In January a Seoul appellate court ruled police
 tortured a businessman to force him to pay money to a
 state-owned corporation in 1985. In Au ust an appeals court
 reversed the convictions of four former senior police
 officers, who had been found guilty of covering up the torture
 death of a student in early 1987. In September a Seoul court
 sentenced a retired military investigator to 2 years in prison
 for torturing a noncommissioned officer during a 1983
 investigation into the theft of military property. By year's
 end the court had not yet handed down a verdict in the nearly
 2-year-old trial of four policemen for torturing dissident Kim
 Kun Tae in 1985. The police have failed to locate a fifth
 suspected officer who has been on the run since 1988. No
 action was reported on this case in 1990.
 
 
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Throughout the year students and police clashed frequently,
 exchanging rocks, firebombs, and tear gas canisters. In
 general the Korean police have shown restraint and discipline,
 often in the face of severe provocation from firebomb-throwing
 demonstrators. There were, however, a number of credible
 reports of police hitting or kicking demonstrators while
 detaining them. In February two reporters covering an
 antigovernment rally were beaten by plainclothes police. They
 demanded and received an apology from the Seoul central
 district police chief, but no legal action was taken against
 any policemen. According to the Ministry of Justice, an
 investigation was dropped for lack of witnesses. Police are
 rarely held accountable for mistreating suspects.
 Conditions in Korean prisons have reportedly improved somewhat
 in the last few years. Most accusations of mistreatment
 involved persons detained for investigation or awaiting trial
 in detention facilities, rather than those who were already
 convicted and serving their sentences in prison. However,
 prisoners in Taegu and Pusan asserted that they were beaten
 and otherwise mistreated, and they conducted hunger strikes in
 protest.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Roh administration, Koreans are freer to criticize
 the Government than in the past. However, several restrictive
 laws permit the Government to detain persons whose views it
 considers dangerous. These include the NSL, the Law on
 Assemblies and Demonstrations, the Social Surveillance Law
 (SSL), and labor laws.  The SSL, enacted in 1989, contains
 provisions allowing the Government to reimprison for up to 2
 years persons who have served their sentence and are required
 to report their activities in detail to the authorities but
 fail to do so. However, there are no known instances in which
 anyone has been jailed under this law for failing to report to
 the police. Article 7 of the NSL permits imprisonment of
 persons who "praise, encourage, or cooperate with antistate
 organizations or their members or persons who received orders
 from them, or by other methods benefit antistate
 organizations." Because North Korea has been defined as an
 "antistate organization," this sweeping article has been used
 by the Government to prosecute dissidents on the grounds that
 their activities benefit North Korea. (See also Sections 2.b.
 and 6.a.)
 Although the Government acknowledged the need to amend the
 NSL, the National Assembly again failed to do so in 1990. In
 April the Constitutional Court ruled the NSL was not
 unconstitutional as long as it was applied only in cases
 involving a real threat to national security. Nonetheless the
 Government frequently used the NSL against dissidents, labor
 activists, and advocates of unification whose plans, in the
 Government's view, echo those of North Korea. In late
 November, the Government announced that 495 people were
 arrested under the NSL and the Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations in the first 9 months of 1990. Approximately
 60 percent of these were indicted and brought to trial, while
 the rest were released. Thousands more were briefly detained
 for labor activities, antigovernment demonstrations, or
 expressing views sympathetic to North Korea. Most of these
 were released within 24 hours.
 In August and October the Government arrested more than 60
 members and put out warrants for another 150 members of the
 
 
 932
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 "Advanced Masses Organization" and the "Socialist Workers
 Alliance" respectively, charging them under the NSL with
 forming an "antistate organization" and instigating illegal
 demonstrations. The declaration in each case that the
 Government had broken up domestic antistate organizations
 marked the first such announcements since the inception of the
 Sixth Republic in February 1988.
 The Government justifies its broad security laws and the
 resulting restrictions by arguing that Korea is in a "special
 situation." The Korean War ended with the signing of an
 armistice, not a peace treaty, and North Korea remains a
 formidable threat. In the past, North Korea has attempted to
 insert agents into the South or murdered South Korean
 leaders. The Government asserts that unauthorized attempts to
 contact North Korea threaten the Government's efforts to
 ensure peaceful reunification on the basis of democracy and
 respect for human rights.
 Warrants are required by law in cases of arrest, detention,
 seizure, or search, unless a criminal is apprehended while in
 the act of committing a crime. However, lawyers state that
 warrants were not presented at the time of detention in many
 cases throughout 1990. The Constitution specifically provides
 the right to representation by an attorney, but in practice
 attorneys are not allowed to be present during interrogation.
 In January a Seoul court threw out some of the evidence
 against a dissident painter, saying it was extracted while he
 was denied access to his lawyer. In March the Supreme Court
 ruled that defense lawyers have the right to meet their
 clients at any time. However, lawyers continue to say that in
 NSL cases they are rarely permitted access to their clients
 during the investigation phase, which can last up to 50 days.
 There is a functioning system of bail in Korea. Bail was even
 granted in some NSL cases, such as that of dissident activist
 Kim Young Ae, who was freed on bail while appealing her
 conviction under the NSL. The right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of a person's detention was
 deleted from the-Code of Criminal Conduct in 1973, partially
 restored in 1980, and then fully restored in late 1987.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides defendants a number of rights in
 criminal trials, including a presumption of innocence,
 protection against self-incrimination, freedom from ex post
 facto laws and double jeopardy, and the right to a speedy
 trial. When a person is physically detained, his initial
 trial must be completed within 6 months of arrest. These
 rights are generally observed. Trials are open to the public,
 but attendance is restricted when the judge believes the
 spectators would seek to disrupt the proceedings.
 The Chief Justice and the other Justices of the Supreme Court
 are appointed by the President with the consent of the
 National Assembly for a term of 6 years. Lower court justices
 are appointed by the Chief Justice with the consent of the
 other Justices. The Justices of the Constitutional Court are
 appointed by the President, the National Assembly, and the
 Chief Justice with the consent of the National Assembly.
 Judges generally allow considerable scope for examination of
 witnesses by both the prosecution and defense counsel. The
 right to an attorney is frequently ignored in political cases
 until the initial investigation is completed. Political and
 
 
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 criminal cases are tried by the same courts; military courts
 do not try civilians. Defendants have the right of appeal,
 and appeals dan result in reduced or lengthened sentences.
 Convictions are rarely overturned. Death sentences are
 automatically appealed.
 Although historically the executive branch exercised great
 influence on judicial decisions, there are increasing
 indications of judicial independence in recent years.
 However, the judiciary remains subject to executive influence
 in politically sensitive cases. In May the Ministry of
 Justice denied an entry visa to a Korean-American who had been
 called to testify by the defense in Im Su Kyong's appeals
 case, The role of the Constitutional Court, which began
 operations in 1988, continued to grow in 1990. A court ruling
 in the spring limited the application and tightened
 evidentiary standards for hearing cases under the NSL.
 In February the Government amnestied 22 long-term "security"
 prisoners, all of whom had already served the greater part of
 their sentences. Among those conditionally released was Sub
 Sung, a well-known political prisoner mentioned in past human
 rights reports. According to Korean human rights groups, 74
 prisoners are serving long-term sentences (10 years or more),
 mostly on charges of espionage on behalf of North Korea. It
 cannot be determined how many of these could be classified as
 political prisoners.
 As of mid-1990, leading Korean human rights groups put the
 number of "political" prisoners at around 1,300, up from an
 estimated 800 at the end of 1989. However, these groups
 define a political prisoner as anyone who has been arrested as
 the result of a politically motivated act. Therefore, their
 figure includes persons who committed acts of violence such as
 firebomb attacks'on government facilities. The Government
 states that there are no political prisoners.
 It is difficult to estimate accurately the number of political
 prisoners since many people are detained and then released
 without charges, or charged and then released without being
 tried. It is particularly difficult to determine whether some
 persons were arrested for exercising the right of free
 association or for violent acts during demonstrations or
 illegal wildcat strikes. However, it appears that as of fall
 1990, the number of political prisoners by international human
 rights standards is in the hundreds.
 The Government continued to arrest those who made contact with
 North Korea without government authorization. Three activists
 who met with a North Korean official in Berlin were arrested
 in December. Artist Hong Song Dam was convicted on charges of
 espionage. One of the charges was that Hong leaked state
 secrets by sending slides of one of his paintings to the
 North. Late in the year, however, the Supreme Court ruled
 that the lower court's decision was incorrect and ordered a
 retrial. Dissident Kim Hyon Chang was sentenced to 7 years in
 prison under the NSL for contacts with an "antistate"
 organization of Koreans in Japan. Prominent dissident Kim
 Keun Tae was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment under the NSL
 and the Law on Assemblies and Demonstrations. One of the
 charges Kim was convicted for was "aiding the enemy" by
 reading his organization's charter at a rally. Although some
 100,000 people participated in the rallies., Kim was one of
 only a few charged with NSL violations.
 
 
 934
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The most highly publicized NSL cases of 1989 involved the
 arrest of four people, Moon Ik Hwan, Im Su Kyong, Mun Kyu
 Hyon, and Suh Kyung Won, who traveled to North Korea without
 South Korean government permission. In 1990 appeals courts
 confirmed their convictions although their sentences were
 reduced. Moon Ik Hwan, 72 years old, was released from prison
 in October because of ill health. A student organization
 leader was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for helping to
 arrange Im's trip and for organizing a famrmers' rally that
 tarned violent.
 The Government continued to maintain that it must grant prior
 approval to all contact with North Korea. On July 20,
 President Roh proposed to allow any South Korean to visit
 North Korea during a 5-day holiday period. Disagreement with
 the North over procedures prevented any visits. In spite of
 this, Im Su Kyong and Mun Kyu Hyun remain in prison for
 visiting North Korea.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, the Government honors the integrity of the home
 and family. However, many political and religious figures are
 still subjected to varying degrees of government
 surveillance. In October a soldier assigned to the Defense
 Security Command (DSC) provided human rights groups with a
 number of computer disks listing some 1,300 persons whose
 activities the DSC was monitoring. The list included leading
 politicians, dissidents, academics, journalists, and religious
 and social leaders. Opposition assemblymen have credibly
 charged in the National Assembly that telephone tapping and
 the opening or interception of correspondence are prevalent.
 In September the parents of a student activist found a
 listening device in their home. Two days later their son was
 detained by the National Security Planning Agency (NSP) and
 charged with violating the NSL. Security officials have
 admitted that thousands of former NSL detainees remain under
 surveillance.
 In the spring, ruling party executive chairman Kim Young Sam
 complained that the NSP was harassing his political allies and
 financial supporters. Kim charged that his supporters were
 subjected to surveillance and surprise tax audits. There were
 also credible reports that the NSP harassed former ruling
 party national assemblyman Chung Ho Yong when he tried to run
 for reelection.
 The security presence in city centers, near university
 campuses, government buildings, ruling party offices, and
 media outlets is heavy. Citizens, particularly students and
 young people, are sometimes stopped, questioned, and
 searched. Government informants are known to be posted on and
 around university campuses. In October a soldier provided
 evidence that the Defense Security Command operated a cafe
 near Seoul National University, which it used as a listening
 post to gather information on student activism. That same
 month, the university administration acknowledged that
 university vehicle passes were given to members of the
 intelligence services.
 Persons thought to have politically suspect backgrounds are
 still denied some forms of employment and advancement,
 particularly in government, the broadcast media, and
 education. Many human rights activists say that big
 
 
 935
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 corporations still retain an informal system of blacklisting
 political "undesirables."
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:*
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Most political discourse remains unrestricted; however,
 restrictions on the expression of ideas which the Government
 considers Communist or pro-North Korea remain severe, despite
 provisions in the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of
 speech. Direct control over the print media has virtually
 disappeared. However, the Government continues to apply the
 NSL against publishers, printers, and distributors who produce
 or sell "subversive" literature. The NSL remains the
 Government's main weapon to suppress domestic dissent and to
 inhibit unauthorized exchanges with North Korea. In midyear
 the Prosecutor General's office announced that in 1988 and
 1989 courts listed 529-publications as "aiding the cause of
 the enemy." The authorities arrested people on charges of
 producing or selling subversive, pro-North Korean literature
 throughout the year.
 Listening to North Korean radia is illegal if the authorities
 judge it is for the purpose of "benefiting the antistate
 organization," i.e., North Korea. Reading or purveying books
 or other literature considered to be subversive, pro-Communist
 or pro-North Korean is also illegal. A magazine publisher was
 convicted under the NSL of printing an article which "defamed"
 the President, and a poet and his publisher were convicted of
 printing a poem "glorifying North Korea." Several student
 editors were arrested for publishing articles about the North
 Korean juche ideology in their college papers. A group of
 dissident publishers claimed police confiscated 81,000 volumes
 during 38 raids on publishers and bookstores during the first
 half of 1990. They also claimed that 77 people were arrested
 since 1987 for printing and distributing material praising
 communism or supporting North Korea, as opposed to 13 such
 arrests in the 1982-1986 period.
 Despite the restrictions on the production or sale of
 "subversive" literature, the Government has allowed, within
 its guidelines, an,.increase in media coverage of North Korea.
 Both television networks broadcast, on a weekly basis, edited
 versions of North Korean television programs, and editors of
 the U.S. editions of two Korean dailies have published reports
 of their visits to North Korea in their Korean sister papers.
 The Government has also allowed somewhat wider public access
 to selected North Korean publications.
 The move to unionize media companies throughout the country,
 begun in 1988, continued to be a major source of conflict in
 Korean newspaper and broadcast organizations. All major
 newspapers and broadcasting corporations in Seoul now have
 labor'unions. Despite indirect government ownership of the
 two Korean television networks, the electronic media have
 moved toward a relatively neutral political stance, while
 still remaining less independent than the print media. Behind
 this trend, in part, lies the increasing importance of labor
 unions in the broadcasting industry. In April the Korean
 Broadcasting System (KBS) labor union went out on strike in
 protest of the Government's choice of a new company
 president. The Government subsequently ordered riot police to
 break up the strike. At year's end there was still a police
 presence in front of KBS. In August the Federation of Media
 
 
 936
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Workers' unions won a victory when a Seoul court ruled that
 the Government had misused a portion of the labor union law
 when it refused to register the federation.
 The Government continued to limit academic freedom, both
 directly and indirectly. Professors and university
 administrators are expected to play an active role in
 preventing campus demonstrations. There is widespread
 sentiment for greater university autonomy. There is also a
 threat to academic freedom from radical leftist students who
 attack the person or property of professors whose lectures or
 writings contradict the students' ideology.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Most peaceful, nonpolitical assemblies take place entirely
 without official supervision or restriction. The law on
 assembly and demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered
 likely to "undermine" public order, and requires that
 demonstrations of all types, including political rallies, be
 reported in advance to the police. The Government continued
 to use these and other restrictive laws to prosecute protest
 organizers and to block many gatherings organized by
 dissidents and particularly students, arguing that they might
 incite "social unrest" and are therefore illegal. Police
 usually try to prevent student demonstrations from moving off
 campuses into the streets, and confrontations frequently
 ensue. These clashes often involve violence on both sides.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. Full freedom prevails for
 proselytizing, doctrinal teaching, and conversion. Korea both
 sends and receives missionaries of various faiths, and many
 religious groups in Korea maintain active links with members
 of similar faiths in other countries. The Government and the
 public do not discriminate against minority sects. Adherence
 to a particular faith confers neither advantages nor
 disadvantages in civil, military, or official life.
 Churches and religious groups are subject to most of the
 restrictions on political activities that apply to other
 institutions. Many of the most vocal and well-organized
 critics of government policies on secular issues are religious
 groups, including Catholics, Protestants, and Buddhists.
 Church buildings and grounds are sometimes used as a refuge by
 demonstrators during clashes with police. While the police
 generally respect the principle of sanctuary, police have
 entered church buildings in order to confront students,
 dissidents, or trade unionists. In May police chased
 demonstrators into a church in Chonju. The second floor of
 the church suffered damage in the ensuing scuffle. Shortly
 after this incident, the officer in charge of the police unit
 involved was suspended.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is universal freedom of movement and freedom to change
 employment within the country. In 1989 the Government dropped
 all age restrictions on foreign travel. Previously these
 restrictions had prevented most young and middle-aged people
 from going overseas. The requirement to obtain permission to
 travel to several former Communist countries was lifted in
 April. Travel to North Korea is allowed only with government
 
 
 937
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 approval. Political opponents are sometimes banned from
 overseas travel, even if they are not being sought by the
 authorities for the commission of a crime. In August the
 Ministry of Justice banned 30 dissidents from traveling abroad
 in order to prevent them from participating in a conference
 organized by the North.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Korean people have the right to elect their own
 government. In 1987 they chose their president in an open
 election. In 1988 legislative elections, they elected an
 opposition majority in the National Assembly. In January 1990
 the President's party suddenly merged with two of the three
 opposition parties, creating a new party which held two-thirds
 of the seats in the National Assembly. The three parties
 argued the merger was necessary to preserve political
 stability. The remaining opposition party denounced the
 merger as an undemocratic negation of the people's will as
 expressed in the 1988 general election.
 Following the merger, Korean politics entered a period of
 confrontation. In July the Government rammed several
 controversial bills through the National Assembly without any
 floor debate. After this, the remaining opposition members of
 the legislature submitted their resignations in protest. The
 showdown between the ruling and opposition camps left the
 Assembly in a state of virtual paralysis until the opposition
 ended its boycott in mid-November.
 The Constitution, as amended in 1987, provides for the direct
 election of the President and for a mixed system of direct and
 proportional election of legislators. The President serves a
 single 5-year term and may not be reelected. The Assembly's
 term is 4 years. The new Constitution strips the President of
 his power to dissolve the Assembly. There is universal
 suffrage for all citizens aged 20 or above, and elections are
 held by secret ballot.
 Political power has traditionally been centered in the person
 of the President, strongly supported by the military and
 security agencies. The situation.began to change, however,
 when the three opposition parties won a majority in the
 National Assembly in the April 1988 general election. This
 check on government power was diminished by the political
 parties' merger in January. which gave the ruling party a
 secure majority in the Assembly. Following the merger, the
 ruling party began to hint it favored a change to a
 parliamentary system of government. In mid-November, however,
 the ruling party announced that for the time being it was
 giving up plans to revise the Constitution.
 A local autonomy law was passed in December, and local
 elections are planned for early 1991. For reasons of culture
 and discrimination, women occupy few positions in government,
 big business, and the professions. There are currently 6
 women in the 299-seat legislature, all of whom were appointed
 to proportional representation seats based on their party's
 showing in the 1988 elections. The second Minister for
 Political Affairs is the only woman in the Cabinet. Her
 Ministry is in charge of Women's Affairs.
 
 
 938
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Section 4 Governmental. Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The National Assembly and the major political parties all have
 committees concerned with various aspects of human rights. In
 addition, several nonaffiliated private organizations are
 active in promoting human rights. Chief among these groups
 are the Lawyers Group for a Democratic Society, the Human
 Rights Committee of the Korean National Council of Churches,
 The Catholic Priests' Committee for Justice and Peace, The
 Korean Bar Association, "Mingahyop"--an association of the
 families of political prisoners, and the Korean Legal Aid
 Center for Family Relations. These groups publish reports on
 the human rights situation in Korea and make their views known
 both inside and outside the country. Some human rights
 activists have alleged government harassment and surveillance.
 While the Government does not welcome outside involvement with
 respect to human rights, government and ruling party officials
 have generally been willing to meet with international human
 rights groups, including groups from Asia Watch and Amnesty
 International. In addition, foreign human rights groups have
 been allowed to observe elections, and the Government has
 regularly discussed human rights with foreign diplomats.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Republic of Korea is a densely populated and racially
 homogeneous country. There are no ethnic minorities of
 significant size. Nonetheless, regional rivalries exist in
 Korea. Persons from the southwestern region (North and South
 Cholla provinces) have traditionally faced discrimination.
 Many Koreans believe that successive governments led by
 figures from the southeastern region (North and South
 Kyongsang provinces) have deliberately neglected the economic
 development of the Cholla provinces for political reasons.
 Korea's conservative Confucian tradition has left women
 subordinate to men socially, economically, and legally. Some
 progress has been made since the founding of the Republic:
 women can and do vote, become government officials, and hold
 elected office (see Section 3). Women enjoy full access to
 educational opportunities. However, the vestiges of Confucian
 traditions remain in many areas. Most married women do not
 work outside the home. In large companies women are often
 expected to resign upon marriage, or no later than the birth
 of their first child.
 Laws providing for equal opportunity in the workplace do
 exist. The National Assembly enacted an Equal Employment
 Opportunity (EEO) Law in 1988. The law condemns sexual
 discrimination in hiring and wages, and calls for improved
 working conditions for women, including no night work and
 limits on overtime. So far, however, the law has had only
 limited practical effect. In March four companies were
 indicted under the EEO law on charges of refusing to take
 applications from women for job openings they had advertised.
 The traditional preference for male children continues in
 Korea today. As a result, a shortage of female babies is
 developing. It is estimated that when today's children reach
 marrying age there will be 400,000 surplus bachelors.
 Although Korean law bans gender testing and abortions except
 
 
 939
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 when the woman's life is in danger, fetal gender testing and
 abortion of female fetuses are widely performed. Early in
 1990 the Government began a campaign against these practices.
 As of October, the Government suspended the licenses of seven
 doctors (for a maximum of 7 months), and warned three others.
 Korea's amended family law went into effect on January 1. New
 amendments permit women, as well as men to head a household,
 recognize a wife's right to 'a portion of the couple's
 property, and allow a woman to maintain greater contact with
 her offspring after a divorce. The effect of the revised law
 on actual practice is still uncertain. For instance, although
 discrimination in the distribution of inherited property has
 been'legally abolished, it continues to be widespread in
 practice.
 The revised family law contains no express provisions
 regarding wife abuse. There are no reliable statistics on
 this phenomenon. Although there is a telephone hot line for
 abused women, there are few shelters. Although a woman could
 file for divorce because of abuse before the amendment of the
 family law, a divorced wife lost her parental rights to her
 children. This, coupled with the fact that employment
 opportunities for women are limited and divorced women have
 difficulty remarrying, led some women to stay in abusive
 situations.
 Although other types of violent crimes are directed against
 women, reliable data on their prevalence are not available. A
 number of cases have surfaced involving women being kidnaped
 and sold into prostitution. Although the Government professes
 that the issue of crimes against women is one of its top law
 and order priorities, a number of female kidnap victims have
 complained that the police were unhelpful or unsympathetic to
 their attempts to escape from their abductors.
 Section 6 Worker Rights.
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution gives workers the right to free association,
 with the exception of most public service employees. When a
 new union is formed, it must notify the Government. In at
 least one case, however, the Government refused to register a
 union group because it did not list affiliation with the
 country's only legal labor confederation, the Federation of
 Korean Trade Unions (FKTU). As of the fall of 1990, nearly 2
 million workers, or about 22 percent of the civilian work
 force, were unionized. Only one union is permitted at each
 place of work, and.there is no minimum number of members
 required to form a union. Companies have in the past taken
 advantage of this provision of the law to form small,
 company-controlled unions, which labor organizers have often
 found difficult to replace with more representative unions.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run
 enterprises, and defense industries. By law, enterprises in
 public interest sectors such as public transportation,
 .utilities, public health, banking, broadcasting, and
 communications must submit to government-ordered arbitration
 in lieu of striking. The Labor Dispute Adjustment Act
 requires unions to notify the Ministry of Labor of their
 intention to strike and mandates a 10-day "cooling-off period"
 before a strike can legally begin. The cooling-off period is
 15 days in public interest sectors. In January the Government
 
 
 940
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 announced a crackdown on "illegal labor practices" as part of
 a tougher stand on labor disputes. Measures included the use
 of police intervention.
 The National Assembly did not make any significant changes in
 Korea's labor laws during 1990. In fact, since the
 inauguration of the Sixth Republic in 1988, the Government and
 National Assembly have had little success agreeing on reforms
 that would improve the legal framework for labor-management
 relations, which remain little changed from the Fifth Republic.
 The FKTU has approximately 2 million members. It is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. Most of the FKTU's constituent unions maintain
 affiliations with international trade secretariats. Less than
 10 percent of unionized labor belongs to unions which are not
 affiliated with the FKTU.
 In January some of the non-FKTU unions banded together to form
 the "National Association of Trade Unions," known in Korean as
 "Chonnohyop." The Government has taken a very hard line
 against Chonnohyop, which it describes as a radical
 organization. ' As a first step, the Government instituted
 "administrative" investigations of 160 unions affiliated with
 Chonnohyop. The Government also arrested Chonnohyop's
 President and many of Chonnohyop's national and regional
 leaders. According to Chonnohyop, 364 workers were arrested
 during the first 5 months of 1990. Another 134 were on the
 police wanted list, while 224 were processed through summary
 courts for minor offenses.
 Another group of unions, outside both the FKTU and Chonnohyop,
 are the emerging crafts unions, including journalists,
 hospital workers, construction workers, and teachers. Some of
 these craft federations have begun to move toward affiliation
 with international trade secretariats. In 1990 the
 journalists' federation won a victory when the courts ruled
 the Government was misusing portions of the trade union law to
 avoid registering the federation. The Government has also
 refused to legalize the teachers' union, since teachers are
 considered to be public service employees--even those employed
 by private schools. Some 1,500 teachers have been fired for
 refusing to quit the union. Of 93 teachers arrested for their
 union activities, 2 were still in jail at the end of the
 year. Some teachers who formed a committee to promote
 reinstatement of the fired teachers have themselves been
 punished with expulsions and transfers. In April the Supreme
 Court ruled provisions of the national public service law
 which prevent private schoolteachers from unionizing did not
 violate the constitutional guarantee of freedom of association.
 In addition to its tough policy against Chonnohyop, the
 Government also continued to take a hard line against what it
 sees as illegal, wildcat strikes which threatened government
 control of key industries and media outlets. In 1990 police
 were used to break up "wildcat strikes" at KBS Television,
 Hyundai Heavy Industries, and a number of smaller companies.
 In December, 16 large company-based unions representing
 100,000 workers, mostly from heavy industry, formed a new
 grouping called the Solidarity Conference of Large Firms'
 Unions (Yondae Hwaywe in Korean), which is independent of both
 the FKTU and Chonnohyop. Its declared aim is to respond to
 the "repression of the democratic union movement by government
 and industry."

 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution and the Trade Union Law guarantee the
 autonomous right of workers tu enjoy freedom of association,
 collective bargaining, and collective action. Extensive
 collective bargaining is practiced. Korea's labor laws do not
 extend the right to bargain collectively to government
 employees, including employees of state or public-run
 enterprises and defense industries. In a 198Q ruling, the
 Ministry of Labor concluded that a 1970 law required the
 Government to treat companies operating in Korea's two export
 processing zones (EPZ's) as public-interest enterprises, thus
 making it more difficult for unions at EPZ companies to
 organize.
 Korea has no independent system of labor courts. The central
 and local labor committees form a semiautonomous agency of the
 Ministry of Labor that adjudicates disputes in accordance with
 the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor committee is
 composed of equal representation from labor, management, and
 "the public interest." The local labor committees are
 empowered to decide on remedial measures in cases involving
 unfair labor practices and to mediate and arbitrate labor
 disputes. Rulings by the various labor committees are
 sometimes inconsistent. At one point in 1990, all of the
 labor representatives on both the central and local committees
 resigned to protest a decision by one local committee. This
 decision would have prevented union officials from accepting
 wages from their employers while conducting union business.
 (Because union dues are limited, almost all union officials
 -receive most or all of their salaries from their employer.)
 The Central Labor Committee reversed this decision, and the
 labor representatives returned to their positions.
 Many major employers are still strongly antiunion. Some firms
 continue to hire "save the company squads" to beat up union
 organizers and to intimidate workers. The authorities often
 have failed to investigate such incidents thoroughly. In
 1990, as in the past, there were cases of violence against
 property by workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution provides that no person shall be punished,
 placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to
 involuntary labor except as provided by law and through lawful
 procedures. Forced or compulsory labor is not condoned by the
 Government. The Government has investigated several incidents
 in which private persons forced men to work involuntarily on
 fishing boats. The Government has also investigated a number
 of charges by workers that employers were demanding compulsory
 labor in the form of overtime work beyond the legal maximum.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor standards law prohibits the employment of persons
 under the age of 13 without a special employment certificate
 from the Ministry of Labor. Because there is compulsory
 education until the age of 13, few special employment
 certificates are issued for full-time employment. Some
 children are allowed to do part-time jobs such as selling
 newspapers. In order to gain employment, children under 18
 must have written approval from their parents or guardians.
 Employers may require minors to work only a reduced number of
 
 
 942
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 overtime hours and are prohibited from-employing them at night
 without special permission from the Ministry of Labor.
 A large proportion of production line workers in labor-
 intensive industries such as textiles, apparel, footwear, and
 electronics are girls in their mid-teens. Many of these girls
 work in small, cramped, and sometimes dangerous workplaces.
 Employees working under these conditions are not accorded the
 legal protections to which they are entitled.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Korea implemented a minimum wage law in 1988. The minimum
 wage level is reviewed annually and in 1990 was set at the
 equivalent of $238 per month. Companies with fewer than 10
 employees are exempt from this law, and some still pay
 below-minimum wages. Some nonexempt companies (mostly small
 ones) also pay below-minimum salaries. In June the Labor
 Ministry reported to the National Assembly that 1,361 of the
 78,016 companies employing more than 10 workers were paying
 workers less than the required minimum. Several companies
 were indicted and some fined for paying below-minimum wages.
 At the end of 1990 the Labor-Ministry knew of no cases of
 companies subject to the minimum wage law paying below minimum
 wages.
 The FKTU continues to claim that the current minimum wage does
 not meet the minimum requirements of urban workers. The
 Government states that the money an average Korean blue-collar
 worker takes home in overtime and bonuses significantly raises
 the total compensation package. According to the Government's
 economic planning board, 5.5 percent of the population lived
 below the poverty level in 1987. From 1987 through 1990
 Korean workers received an average increase in nominal wages
 of approximately 50 percent. The Labor Standards and
 Industrial Safety and Health laws provide for a maximum
 60-hour workweek. By the fall, amendments to the labor
 standards law passed in March 1989 had brought the maximum
 regular workweek excluding overtime down to 46 hours in
 companies employing fewer than 300 employees, and 44 hours in
 companies with more than 300. According to the Government,
 the average Korean worker worked 49.6 hours each week in 1989.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but the
 Ministry of Labor employs few inspectors, and the standards
 are not effectively enforced.
