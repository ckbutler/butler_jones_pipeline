 HAITI
 Haiti has had a long and troubled history of authoritarian
 rule characterized by many periods of political instability
 and serious human rights abuses. The country is nominally
 a republic. Executive authority is vested in a president
 for life. The legislature is a unicameral chamber
 with members elected for six-year terms. In practice,
 the legislature reflects the will of the president,
 Jean Claude Duvalier. Advised by a small coterie,
 he wields almost all actual power. During the eight
 months that the legislative assembly is in recess,
 major sections of the constitution concerning protection
 of individual liberties are suspended, and the president
 is given full powers to rule by decree.
 In October 1980, the government began to take action
 against growing press criticism, arresting the head
 of the Christian Democratic Party and later his daughter.
 Both have been held without official charges. Two
 popular radio commentators were also arrested but
 subsequently released.
 Late in November 1980, the government arrdsted and
 held without charges at least 40 journalists, opposi-
 tion political party figures, and human rights acti-
 vists. Seventeen of those arrested were involuntarily
 expelled from Haiti to the United States, Canada and
 the Netherlands Antilles. The status of some of those
 arrested remained unknown at year's end.,
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includ-
 ing Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There were reports of torture of persons taken into
 custody in 1980, but they have not been substantiated.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings continued to be administered almost routinely
 in connection with interrogation of suspects and incar-
 ceration of prisoners. Several opposition figures
 arrested in late November reported having been severely
 beaten, stripped of their clothes, and forced to remain
 naked in their prison cells. The government has not
 taken any effective measures to eradicate this practice.
 Physical facilities, medical care, and diet in incarcerative
 facilities are generally crude. Lesser offenders
 may be visited by family members, who may also bring
 them food, but persons considered dangerous by the
 government are in many cases held in isolation.
 c.   Disappearances
 The police frequently fail to inform family members
 of an individual's arrest. However, the police do
 not ordinarily refuse to confirm an arrest if inquiries
 are made. The status of some of those arrested in
 November remains unknown.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 
 
 460
 The Haitian constitution provides that no one can be
 followed by government authorities, arrested, or detained
 except in cases determined by the law and according
 to the prescribed forms. Arrest and detention can
 only take place by a mandate from a legally competent
 officer. In order for the warrant to be executed,
 it is necessary that 1) it state the grounds for detention,
 and the applicable legal provision under which the
 offense is charged; and 2) that it notify the accused
 person of his offense, and a copy be left with the
 accused at the time of the warrant's execution. The
 government does not generally observe these guarantees
 in practice, often using arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 as a means of dealing with political opposition. In
 October 1980, Yvens Paul, a prominent playwright and
 newscaster, was arrested and held without charges for
 10 days upon his return from a visit to New York.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Observance of this requirement is arbitrary. According
 to the constitution arrests should be followed by an
 appearance before a judge within 48 hours. However,
 this provision appears to be honored more in the breach,
 as in the case of the daughter of opposition leader
 Sylvio Claude, Marie France Claude, who has been held
 since October without charges. Indigent defendants
 often languish for months without trial.
 In one case early this year, the Haitian authorities
 showed more willingness than in the past to deal with
 defendants accused of political offenses through the
 judicial system rather than through indefinite detention.
 The four "St. Marc" defendants, arrested in 1978 in
 connection with an alleged conspiracy to overthrow
 the government, were given a public trial in 1980 and
 were represented by able counsel. Upon conviction,
 the defendants were each sentenced to nine years in
 prison, less time already served.
 The Court of Appeals (Cour de Cassation) is the highest
 court in the judicial system. Its judges are appointed
 by the president for 10-year terms and the judicial
 system is not independent of the executive. There
 is evidence that the courts are responsive to executive
 guidance in politically sensitive cases.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 There have been no reports of invasion of the home
 in 1980. There is no evidence that legal safeguards
 were observed in the November round-up of opposition
 figures and their dependents.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Haiti is a poor country with extremely limited natural
 resources and severe deficiencies in infrastructure.
 Agriculture employs about 70 percent of the population.
 Intense pressure on land resources has resulted in
 destruction of the forest cover on hillsides suitable
 for cultivation-- while only 40 percent of the land
 is considered arable, about 53 percent is actually
 cultivated. Average plot size is less than 2 acres,
 too small for modern farming methods.   Many peasants
 
 
 ï¿½ 461
 
 do not enjoy clear title to their land, which impedes
 the delivery of agricultural credit. The World Bank
 estimates that 80 percent of the rural population exists
 below the absolute poverty level. Coffee, vetiver
 (a grass used for making mats and screens), and mangoes
 are the primary agricultural exports. The industrial
 and commercial sector is small and heavily concentrated
 in the Port-au-Prince area. Investment capital is
 limited. There are a few medium-sized basic industrial
 plants, and over 200 firms engaged in assembly or light
 industrial transformation operations. There are about
 3,000 kilometers of roads, of which about 600 would
 be considered classified as first class. Many regions
 of the country are accessible only by four-wheel-drive
 vehicle.
 Infant mortality is high with a rate of 130 per 1,000.
 Hospitals are rudimentary, and life expectancy is 51
 years. The great majority of Haitian children have
 no access to schooling. Social services in general
 are non-exIstent outside the capital city.
 Agricultural productivity has been declining, as plots
 are subdivided into ever smaller pieces and increasingly
 unsuitable slopes are brought under cultivation. Port-
 au-Prince and other urban areas are experiencing abnormally
 rabid growth because of rural flight to the cities.
 This in turn has exacerbated the problem of urban unem-
 ployment. No precise figures on this can be obtained,
 but it is probably fair to say that 50 percent of those
 seeking work cannot get it.
 The economy is also facing other serious problems common
 to other Caribbean countries: double-digit inflation,
 capital outflow, shortfalls in government revenue,
 and increased petroleum costs. During 1980 gross national
 product is estimated to have approached $1.5 billion,
 with a real growth rate close to two percent. Per
 capita gross national product remained below $300.
 The government has beer? the beneficiary of substantial
 sums of outside assistance. 1980 aid to Haiti, from
 all sources, amounts to more than $100 million, most
 of which is directed toward improvement in agriculture,
 education, health, and transportation. Yet the Government
 of Haiti has not shown by its actions that it is committed
 to serious socio-economic improvement. There was a
 pipeline of more than $30 million at the end of fiscal
 year 1980 due to the slow progress of Haitian authorities
 in implementing projects and committing funds.
 Efforts of the United States and other aid donors to
 link increased aid levels to administrative reform,
 budgetary control, and tighter reins on corruption
 have not met with success. Various government and
 para-governmental agencies continue to collect and
 expend public funds without effective control over
 diversion of these funds to enrich private individuals.
 Such misappropriations seriously undercut Haiti's development
 efforts in 1980 and had severe impact on the government's
 budgetary solvency and foreign exchange position.
 However, some centralization of budgetary accounts
 and revenues has taken place, and the government has,
 with outside help, completed the southern highway,
 many secondary roads, clinics, schools, the electrification
 
 
 462
 
 of a number of provincial cities, and the extension
 of the telephone system.
 The minimum wage was raised from $2.20 to $2.64 per
 day on October 1 1980, and employers outside Port-au-
 Prince were recently required to pay transportation
 expenses up to 28 cents per day for commuting workers.
 There are, however, many workers for whom the minimum
 wage does not apply, and who have difficulty in earning
 enough to provide for their basic needs. While there
 is a government social security plan, few Haitian workers
 are covered by it.
 For many Haitians, the best economic opportunities
 are to be found outside the country. Thousands migrate
 to the Bahamas and the United States, and as many as
 80,000 migrate each year to the Dominican Republic
 to work as sugar cane cutters.
 The Haitian constitution gives equal rights to men
 and women. However, under Haitian civil codes, married
 women forfeit the right to manage their own property,
 are required to live in their spouse's residence, and
 must have the husband's written permission to obtain
 an exit visa. Qualified Haitian women have access
 to most jobs, including government appointments. They
 receive wages in general equal to those received by
 their male counterparts. However, lack of education
 bars most women from access to job opportunities.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Haitian constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 press, assembly and religion. The new press code promulgated
 in April 1980, while milder than the December 1979
 code, retains serious restrictions: a formal requirement
 (which cannot be met by daily newspapers) that all
 publications be submitted to the censors 72 hours in
 advance, the licensing of press credentials by the
 ministry of the interior, and the prohibition of material
 critical of the vresident or his family. In reality,
 pre-screening is impractical so independent journals
 publish at their own risk. The government arrested
 and held for questioning at least two broadcast journalists
 in October. Despite these incidents, the independent
 press and radio stations continued to disseminate news
 and commentaries that were seriously critical of the
 government until the November 28 crackdown when at
 least 20 journalists were arrested. Criticism of the
 government has since ceased.
 There has been no interference by the government with
 academic inquiry per se in natural or social sciences.
 Some academicians have been arrested, however, for
 political reasons.
 Little in the way of trade organization or collective
 bargaining exists and strikes are extremely rare.
 Unions must obtain recognition from the ministry of
 labor and conform to the labor code which provides
 for a direct government role in labor disputes. Communist
 and other left-wing groups are prohibited from organizing,
 and groups not registered with the government are limitbd
 
 
 463
 to public assemblies of fewer than 20 people. Labor
 union activity increased somewhat with the creation
 of CATH (Centre Autonome des Travailleurs Haitien)
 in June 1980.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 An estimated 800,000 Haitians have left the country
 over the past 20 years, primarily in search of better
 economic opportunities and also, in some cases, for
 political reasons. During 1980 the migrant exodus
 sharply increased, and more than 20,000 Haitians illegally
 entered the United States with 15,000 claiming political
 asylum. The Haitian government has made some efforts
 to stem the refugee tide by seizing refugee vessels
 on occasion and fining or imprisoning boat captains.
 However, fines have been small and prison sentences
 short.
 The government does not impede domestic movement.
 Foreign travel requires a passport and exit visa which
 together can cost up to $97. Those who leave illegally
 are subject to fine or imprisonment, but the government
 has publicly stated it will not prosecute or punish
 returning emigrants who have left in this manner.
 The government receives an unspecified but fairly substantial
 "recruiting fee* for allowing Haitian migrant workers
 to work in the Dominican Republic sugar harvest, under
 the terms of a bilateral agreement. There is no evidence
 that workers are involuntarily made to go to the Dominican
 Republic to fulfill the terms of the agreement, although
 there have been substantial and documented charges
 that they work under harsh conditions.
 Except in the case of married women seeking exit visas,
 there is no discrimination in matters of internal or
 foreign travel, emigration and repatriation.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Haiti is an authoritarian state. In accordance with
 the constitution, President Duvalier was designated
 as president by his father and predecessor, Francois
 Duvalier. He was subsequently confirmed as life president
 in a national referendum. The unicameral legislature,
 elected in closely controlled elections in February
 1979, played no independent role during 1980 in formulating
 national policy, though several members called government
 ministers to task for the governments' alleged indifference
 to the plight of Haitian sugar cane cutters in the
 Dominican Republic.
 Two fledging independent political parties and one
 government party operated in 1980, but the activities
 of the opposition parties were closely monitored, and
 a demonstration planned by the Haitian Christian Democratic
 Party in October to protest the arrest of leader Sylvio
 Claude was banned by the government. Gregoire Eugene,
 head of the Christian Party, was arrested in November
 following his publicized criticism of the government's
 alleged indifferences to the fate of "boat people."
 The arrests of those two leaders has effectively neutralized
 the opposition.
 
 
 464
 The Communist Party is specifically outlawed. Various
 liberal groups, such as the League of Human Rights
 and National Committee of Women have criticized members
 of the government on specific issues. In 1980 the
 government established a division of human rights within
 the ministry of foreign Affairs. The division was
 not, however, active during the year.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Haiti invited the Inter-American
 Human Rights Commission for an inspection visit in
 August 1978. The commission reported that the government
 systematically violated the basic human rights of indi-
 viduals, principally by denying them the right of political
 participation, and due process under law.
 The report recognized, however, that there were improvements
 in certain categories of rights, particularly the right
 to life, since President Jean Claude Duvalier took
 office in 1971. The government allowed a United States
 State Department study team in 1979 freedom to travel
 throughout the country to investigate the fate of returning
 migrants. It participates in international and regional
 human rights bodies, though it has not taken an active
 role in these meetings. It has not entered into dialogue
 with external non-government human rights groups.
 In November 1980 the Organization of American States
 General Assembly approved a resolution which endorsed
 the work of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 and called on Haiti to carry out the recommendations
 in the report for human rights improvement.
