 MALI
 Mali is a constitutional democracy. The Government is headed by Prime Minister
 Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. In the country's first democratic elections in 1992, which
 were judged to be free and fair by international observers, citizens ratified a new
 Constitution, elected the National Assembly, and chose President Alpha Oumar
 Konare as Head of State. These elections completed a 14-month transition following
 the 1991 overthrow of the Moussa Traore regime. In January, the Government
 reached an agreement with the majority of Tuareg and Maur rebel groups in the
 north, ending several years of a rebellion. All parties held to the agreement, and
 there were no casualties during the year.
 Security forces are composed of the Army, Air Force, Gendarmerie, the Republican
 Guard, and the police. The Army and Air Force are under the control of a civilian
 Minister of Defense, as are the Gendarmerie and the Republican Guard. The police
 are under the Ministry of Territorial Administration. There was one report of police
 brutality during a violent demonstration in October.
 Mali is a very poor country. Its economy is based primarily on farming and ani-
 mal husbandry, making it highly dependent on adequate rainfall for its economic
 
 
 well-being. The Government continues to make progress in implementing reforms
 aimed at modernizing the economy. Nevertheless, Mali continues to be beset by eco-
 nomic problems, including a poor infrastructure, the lack of an industrial sector, and
 heavy dependence on foreign -assistance. Social ills, including a literacy rate of only
 23 percent and a high population growth rate, also contribute to Mali's poverty.
 The Government generally respected constitutional provisions for freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and religion. However, prison conditions are
 poor, and the judicial system's large case back log results in long periods of pretrial
 detention. The executive branch retains influence over the judiciary.
 Social and cultural factors continued to sharply limit economic and educational
 opportunities for most women. Societal violence against women and children, includ-
 ing spousal abuse and female genital mutilation, is widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were no developments in the October 1994 deaths of the Swiss Cooperation
 Mission director and his two Malian colleagues, killed by an army patrol in
 Niafunke. A government mission of inquiry into their deaths determined in Decem-
 ber 1994 that the patrol's actions were unwarranted and unjustified. Ho.wever, to
 date, the Government has neither identified publicly the responsible parties nor
 made attempts to expedite the case, which is still being reviewed at the regional
 court in Mopti.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment-
 There was one report of police brutality during a violent demonstration by former
 government employees in October. Prison conditions continue to be characterized by
 overcrowding, inadequate medical facilities, and limited food sup plies. Several asso-
 ciations, including the International Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC), the Malian
 Association of Human Rights, and the Malian Association of Women Jurists visited
 prisoners in 1995 and are working with women and juvenile prisoners to improve
 their conditions. Juvenile offenders are usually held in the same prison as adult of-
 fenders. Women are housed in the same prison facility as men but live in a separate
 compound.
 d Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that suspects
 must be charged or released within 48 hours and are entitled to counsel. In practice,
 however, detainees are not always charged within the 48-hour period. Moreover, ad-
 ministrative backlogs and insufficient lawyers, judges, and courts often cause
 lengthr delays in bringing people to trial. in extreme cases, individuals have re-
 mainea several years in prison before coming to trial. Judicial warrants are required
 for arrest. Local lawyers have estimated that about half of prison inmates are pre-
 trial detainees. There is no incommunicado detention.
 Bail does not exist. On occasion the authorities release defendants on their own
 recognizance.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but the executive branch continues to exert considerable influence over the
 judicial system. The Ministry of Justice appoints judges and supervises both law en-
 forcement and judicial functions, and the President heads the Superior Judicial
 Council, which oversees judicial activity.
 The Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative powers. The Constitution
 established a separate Constitutional Court which oversees issues of constitutional-
 ity and acts as an election arbiter. The Constitution also provides for the convening
 of a High Court of Justice with the power to try senior government officials in cases
 of treason.
 Except in the case of minors, trials are public, and defendants have the right to
 be present and to have an attorney of their choice. Defendants are presumed inno-
 cent and have the right to confront witnesses and to appeal decisions to the Su-
 preme Court. Court-ap__inted attorneys are provided for the indigent on a pro bono
 basis. The majority of disputes in rural areas are decided by the village chief in con-
 sultation with the elders. -If these decisions are challenged in court, only those found
 to have legal merit will be upheld.
 Women and minorities are not discriminated against in courts, but traditional
 practice discriminates against women in inheritance matters.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and the Government respects
 this right in practice. Police searches are infrequent and require judicial warrants.
 Security forces do, however, maintain physical and technical surveillance of individ-
 uals and groups believed to be threats to internal security, including surveillance
 of telephone and written correspondence of individuals deemed a threat to national
 security.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these in practice. There are nearly 50
 independent newspapers and journals, in French and local languages, including 2
 independent daily newspapers.
 The Government controls the only television station, two of many radio stations,
 and one of the three daily newspapers, but these all operate on a semi-independent
 basis and present a wide range of views, including those critical of the Government,
 the President, the Prime Minister, and other politicians.
 Seven ind     ent radio stations exist in Bamako and several others operate in
 regional capitals. French cable television began rebroadcasting operations in Sep-
 tember, and the Government has taken intialstep toward private television licens-
 In . ws passed in 1993 regulate the press and provide for substantial penalties, in-
 cluding imprisonment, for slander and for public injury to the Head of State, other
 officials, and foreig diplomats; these laws leave injury undefined and subject to ju-
 dicial interpretation.
 Academic freedom is respeted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution prvids for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Government does
 not interfere with political meetings, which take place openly.
 c. Freedom of Rehion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and de-
 clares Mai to be a secular state. The Government does not discriminate on religious
 reounds, and citizens are free to practice their faiths. Although legal restrictions on
 teBaha'i faith still exist, the Government does not enforce them, and Baha'i wor-
 ship freely. The Minister of Territorial Administration can prohibit religious publi-
 cations which it concludes defame another religion, but there were no known in-
 stances of publications beingprhibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. The Government generally does not restrict inter-
 nal movement, and does not restrict international travel. However police routinely
 stop and check beth citizens and foreigners, ostensibly to restrict the movement of
 contraband and to verify vehicle registrations. Some police and gendarmes use the
 occasion to extort bribes.
 There are approximately 13,000 Mauritanian Peuhl refugees settled in Mali. The
 fighting in the north between government troops and Tuareg rebels between 1990
 and January 1995 generated an estimated 120,000 Tuareg and Maur Malia 'i refu-
 gees, most of whom fled to Mauritania, Algeria, and Burkina Faso. Mali has signed
 repatriation accords with these nations and Niger under the auspices of the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In September the Government appealed
 to the international donor community for development, demobilization, and repatri-
 ation assistance. By years end more than 36,000 refugees had returned from these
 neighboring countr es. The Government does not forcibly repatriate refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and did so for the first time
 in 1992, voting by secret ballot in elections which were generally free, fair, and
 broad-based, despite some irregularities. Twenty -one political parties participated in
 the elections, and 11 are represented in the National Assembly. The President's
 party, the Association for Democracy in Mal, holds the majority of the seats in the
 Assembly.
 Under the Constitution, the President is Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief
 of the armed forces and is elected for a term of 5 years with a limit of two terms.
 The President appoints the Prime Minister.
 Ther are no restrictions on voting, legal or otherwise, for women or minorities.
 However, women are underrepresented in politics. Only 3 women hold seats in the
 116-member National Assembly, and 2 cabinet ministers are women. A third
 woman, the Secretary for the Promotion of Women, holds ministeral rank. Nomadic
 
 
 164
 peoples, including Fulani and Tuareg, are represented in both the Cabinet and Na-
 tional Assembly. The President of the Assembly is Fulani.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are three independent human lights organizations: the Malian Association
 for Human Rights (AMDH), a smaller Malian League of Human Rights, and a re-
 cently established chapter of Amnesty International. All operate openly and without
 interference from the Government. AMDH criticized the Government's policy toward
 student protests and its treatment of students who protested (often violently) for
 larger scholarships. The ICRC has an office in Bamako.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination by reason of social origin, color, lan-
 guage, sex, or race, and respects these in practice. However, social and cultural fac-
 tors give men a dominant role.
 Woen.-Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and
 provides for the basic rights of all persons, violence against women, including wife
 beating, is tolerated and pervasive.
 Women's access to jobs in the professions and government is limited, as are eco-
 nomic and educational opportunities. The Government, the major employer, pays
 women the same as men for similar work. Women often live under harsh conditions,
 especially in the rural areas, where they perform hard farm work and do most of
 the childrearing.
 Despite legislation giving women equal rights regarding property, traditional
 practice and ignorance of the law prevent women from taking full advantage of this
 reform. There are numerous active women's groups that promote the rights of
 women and children, and the female head of the Commission for the Promotion of
 Women enjoys the rank of minister. Women have very limited access to legal serv-
 ices. They are particularly vulnerable in cases of divorce, child custody, and inherit-
 ance rights, as well as in general protection of civil rights.
 Children.-Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is
 still common, especially in rural areas, and is performed on girls at an early age.
 According to an international expert, 75 percent of women have undergone this mu-
 tilation. The Government has not proposed legislation prohibiting FGM. However,
 it supports educational efforts to eliminate the practice through seminars and con-
 ferences and provides media access to proponents of its elimination.
 Only one in five children receives basic education. There is no constitutional or
 legal provision to protect the interests and rights of children, and no juvenile court
 system. However, the Malian Social Services Department investigates and inter-
 venes in cases of reported child abuse or neglect.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the physically or mentally disabled, nor mandating accessibility. The Government
 does not discriminate against the physically disabled in regard to employment, edu-
 cation, and other state services. Given the high unemployment rate, however, the
 physically disabled are often unable to find work.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code specifically
 provide for the freedom of workers to form or join unions and protect freedom of
 association. Only the militar, the gendarmerie, and the Republican Guard are ex-
 cluded from forming unions. Virtually all salaried employees are organized. Workers
 have established independent unions for teachers, magistrates, health workers, and
 senior civil servants, and most are affiliated with the National Union of Malian
 Workers (UNTM) confederation. The UNTM has maintained its autonomy from the
 current Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, although there are restrictions
 in some areas. For example, civil servants and workers in state-owned enterprises
 must give 2 weeks' notice of a planned strike and must enter into negotiations with
 the employer and a third party, usually the Ministry of Labor. The Labor Code pro-
 hibits retribution against st-ikers. Most strikes have involved government em ploy-
 ees, and the Government made no attempt to retaliate against them. Unions are
 free to associate with and participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-True collective bargaining
 does not take place. The growth of independent unions has led to more direct bar-
 gaining between these unions and their employers. Wages and salaries, however, for
 those workers belonging to the UNTM unions are set by tripartite negotiations be-
 
 
 tween the Ministry of Labor, labor unions, and representatives of the federation of
 employers of the sector to which the wages apply. These negotiations usually set the
 pattern for unions outside the UNTM. The Ministry of Labor acts as a mediator in
 labor disputes.
 Neither the Constitution nor the Labor Code addresses the question of antiunion
 discrimination, but there have been no reports or complaints of antiunion behavior
 or activities. If the parties cannot come to agreement, the dispute goes to the Labor
 Court for decision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Reports of de facto slavery persist, especially in the remote salt
 mining communities of Taoudeni north of Timbuktu. These reports are difficult to
 verify, and other reports indicate that the members of the Bellah ethnic group who
 work the mines now receive wages, however meager.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment is 14, lut children may work with parental permission as apprentices at
 age 12. This regulation is often ignored in practice. Moreover, it has no effect on
 the vast number of children who work in rural areas, helping with family farms and
 herds, and in the informal sector, e.g., street vending. These children are not pro-
 tected by laws against unjust compensation, excessive hours, or capricious dis-
 charge. The Labor Inspection Service of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for, and
 reasonably effective in, enforcement of child labor laws, but only in the modern sec-
 tor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code specifies conditions of employ-
 ment, including hours, wages, and social security, but in practice many employers
 either ignore or do not comply completely with the regulations. The national mini-
 mum wage rate is approximately $40 (cfa 21,000) per month. Workers paid on a
 daily basis receive a rate of $1.80 (cfa 1,000). Workers must be paid overtime for
 additional hours. The minimum wage is supplemented by a required package of ben-
 efits, including social security and health care benefits. While this total package
 could provide a minimum standard of living for one person, in practice most wage
 earners support large extended families and must supplement their income by some
 subsistence farming or work in the informal sector.
 The normal legal workweek is 40 hours, with a requirement for at least one 24-
 hour rest period. The Social Security Code provides a broad range of legal protec-
 tions against hazards in the workplace, and workers' groups have brought pressure
 on employers to respect parts of the regulations, particularly those affecting per-
 sonal hygiene. With unemployment high, however, workers are often reluctant to re-
 port violations of occupational safety regulations. The Labor Inspection Service of
 the Ministry of Labor oversees these standards but limits enforcement to the mod-
 ern, formal sector. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations and request an investigation by the Social Security Department,
 which is responsible for recommending remedial action where deemed necessary.
