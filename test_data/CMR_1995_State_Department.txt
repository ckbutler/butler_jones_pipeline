 CAMEROON
 Nominally a multiparty republic, Cameroon continues to be dominated in fact by
 President Paul Biya and a circle of advisers drawn largely from his own ethnic
 group and from his party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM).
 The OPDM's power was last challenged in 1992 in relatively free National Assembly
 elections and highly flawed presidential elections. The CPDM successfully domi-
 nates the National Assembly through its controlling share of a ruling coalition. On
 December 23, the National Assembly passed amendments to the 1972 Constitution
 which for the first time provide for presidential term limits and certain new legisla-
 tive institutions, including a partially elected senate and regional councils. However,
 the amendments did little to strengthen the independence of the judiciary or to
 moderate the President's power to dominate legislation.
 The national police and the gendarmerie have dominant roles in enforcing inter-
 nal security laws. The security forces, including the military, remain under the ef-
 
 
 32
 fective control of the President, the civilian Minister of Defense, and the civilian
 head of police. These forces, in particular the police and gendarmes, continued to
 commit numerous human rights abuses.
 Cameroon has a diversified agricultural and industrial base, with a small but im-
 portant offshore petroleum sector. Over 58 percent of the population lives in rural
 areas, and agriculture accounts for about 25 percent of gross domestic product
 (GDP). The petroleum sector accounts for about only 7 percent of GDP, but it sup-
 plies nearly a third of the Government's budget. Principal export crops are timber,
 coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, and rubber. Although there are numerous public en-
 terprises and state monopolies, recent reforms have reduced the Government's pre-
 dominant role in the economy. Following years of contraction, the economy sta-
 bilized after a 50 percent currency devaluation in 1994 for the African franc zone,
 and exports shot up. GDP declined by 6.3 percent per year from 1985 to 1993. The
 precipitous decline pushed per capita income from its peak of $1,080 to $532 per
 year. Economic growth for 1994/95 was estimated at 3.3 percent.
 Cameroon's human rights record continued to be poor, and the Government con-
 tinued to commit numerous and serious human rights abuses. On many occasions,
 it prevented opposition political parties and other opposition groups from exercising
 the right of free assembly, with the police sometimes using excessive force to bre
 up demonstrations. In midyear it launched a campaign to intimidate the private
 press that included increased censorship of articles, the arrest of journalists, the
 suspension and seizure of newspapers, and numerous beatings of vendors and dis-
 tributors. The Government's censorship campaign appeared motivated, in part, by
 its desire to control the outcome of the nationwide multiparty municipal elections-
 arbitrarily postponed in 1992 and 1994 and finally scheduled for January 1996. Citi-
 zens' ability to change their government remained limited.
 Additional egregious abuses included the routine beating by police of suspected
 criminals; arbitrary arrest; the prolonged detention of prisoners; life-threatening
 prison conditions; infringements on the right to privacy;, and continued violations of
 worker rights. Discrimination and violence against women remained serious prob-
 lems. Discrimination against minorities and indigenous people continued. Mob vio-
 lence and intertribal disputes resulted in many deaths.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no killings known to
 have been politically motivated. However, on the night of April 22-23, an unknown
 assailant(s) brutally murdered the Reverend Engelbert Mveng, a Jesuit priest and
 prominent Cameroonian historian, in his residence outside of Yaounde. The murder
 was only the most recent of several unsolved murders of clergy over the past several
 years. The police announced an investigation into the case, but at year's end, no
 progress had been reported. The Government was widely criticized for not seriously
 pursuing an investigation into this and other church murders, leading to widespread
 speculation about government complicity.
 Security forces continued to use excessive force in dealing with civilians, and
 there were a number of incidents in which civilians died. In early January, for ex-
 ample, a police officer killed a 7-year-old girl, Appolonie Ngah Essala, when he
 opened fire on a taxicab that failed to halt at one of the numerous police roadblocks
 in the city. In condemning the shooting, Yaounde police officials promised that the
 officer would be sanctioned and face legal action in court, but such sanctions, if ap-
 plied, had not been made public by year's end. In another incident in mid.January,
 gendarmes wounded a Yaounde high-school student, Eric Tonye, who was fleeing
 the scene of a car crash. Shortly thereafter, while in police custody, the student died
 from loss of blood. Witnesses claimed that the youth died from a lack of medical
 attention while in police custody. There was no investigation into the case.
 A number of intertribal land disputes in Northwest and West rovinces resulted
 in many deaths. For example, in May and June, a land dispute 1etween Bali and
 Chomba people in Northwest province led to repeated outbreaks of fighting that re-
 suited in the deaths of an undetermined number of people. At year's end, no charges
 had been brought against persons implicated in these incidents. In June fighting
 over land rights broke out in West province between Bamoun agriculturalists and
 Bororo cattle herders, reportedly killing seven persons. The authorities created an
 official commission to resolve the matter and made some arrests.
 There was an upsurge of mob violence directed at persons suspected of witchcraft
 and sorcery, resulting in a number of deaths. For example, in Littoral province on
 the night of May 12-13, a mob burned to death a woman, E. Madeleine, who had
 been accused of sorcery. Mob violence also resulted in the deaths of a number of
 
 
 persons suspected of criminal acts. In late May, a mob in Bamenda, Northwest prov-
 ince, beat to death an individual named Mbete after accusing him of stealing food.
 Police often fail to intervene to prevent such acts of mob violence and rarely arrest
 perpetrators after they occur.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, politically motivated detentions are commonplace, and police and gen-
 darmes frequently fail to inform detainees' family members or attorneys of their
 whereabouts. Families, associations, or political parties concerned about the where-
 abouts of a detained person commonly have to make inquiries at local police or gen-
 darme headquarters to determine whether a family member or associate had been
 taken into custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code proscribes torture, renders inadmissible in court evidence obtained
 thereby, and prohibits public servants from using force against any person. In spite
 of this, there were credible reports of security forces inflicting batings and other
 cruel treatment. Often the beatings are reported to occur, not in prison facilities,
 but in temporary detention cells in a police or gendarme facility.
 Security forces frequently inflict degrading mistreatment on detainees, including
 stripping, confinement in severely overcrowded cells, and denial of access to toilets
 or other sanitation facilities. Police and gendarmes routinely beat detainees to ex-
 tract confessions and the names and whereabouts of alleged criminals. In particular,
 they often beat them on the soles of their feet with an iron bar or whip them with
 a reinforced rubber tube. Although abuses are rarely punished, the Government has
 made some efforts to discourage abuses by security forces. It made available in Octo-
 ber a report on almost 100 Gendarme officers who were sanctioned for human rights
 abuses in recent years.
 On June 10, Mahamamat Djibril, a member of a Cameroonian human rights non-
 governmental organization (NGO), the Movement for the Defense of Human Rights
 and Liberties, was arrested in the town of Maga, Far-North province. According to
 a credible report, Djibril had gone to the local gendarmerie office to inquire into a
 case of alleged polie abuse. Upon stating his usiness he was reportedly seized,
 assaulted by three gendarmes, and detained for 3 days before being brought before
 a court in Yagoua where he was charged with assaulting a police officer and creat-
 ing a disturbance.
 There were numerous credible reports that plie bat newspaper vendors and
 distributors, particularly in the port city of Doua, who attempted to sell suspended
 newspapers (see Section 2.a.).
 A U.S. citizen was arrested in Douala on February 3and charged with theft. Be-
 fore they established his U.S. citizenship, police bat him on the soles of his feet
 with the flat side of a machete on two occasions. He was reportedly gagged during
 one of the beatings. The police did not provide diplomatic notification of the arrest
 until 5 days after it occurred. The authorities never provided a response to a diplo-
 matic protest of the delay in notification, nor to a request for an investigation into
 the alleged mistreatment.
 On October 25, a Peace Corps volunteer was approached by an apparently intoxi-
 cated policeman in an East province bar and, without provocation, threatened with
 bodily harm. When the volunteer attempted to leave the scene, he was struck in the
 face. Despite a diplomatic protest, at years end there was no indication that any
 disciplinary action had been taken against the policeman.
 Prison conditions are life threatening, especially outside major urban areas. Seri-
 ous deficiencies in food, health care, and sanitation occur in almost all prisons, in-
 cluding those run by traditional rulers in the north. Prisoners are reported to be
 sometimes chained in their cells. Beatings are common, with numerous credible re-
 ports appearing in the private press of pisoners having been burned by cigarettes
 or painfully suspended over iron bars. Seriously ill prisoners are often denied ade-
 quate medical care. Juveniles and nonviolent prisoners are often incarcerated to-
 gether with violent adults. Sexual abuse of juvenile prisoners by adult inmates ap-
 pears to be common. Corruption among prison personnel is widespread.
 Some high-profile prisoners, including several political opponents of the Govern-
 ment, have been able to avoid some of the abuse that is routinely meted out to many
 common criminals. Some are held in elite wings of certain prisons where they expe-
 rience relatively lenient treatment.
 In northern Cameroon, traditional Lamibe (chiefs) are permitted by the Govern-
 ment to operate their own private prisons outside the gvernment penitentiary sys-
 tem. Private prisons in the chiefdoms of Rey Bouba, Bibmi, and Tcheba have the
 worst reputations, including allegations by members of the National Union for De-
 mocracy and Progss (UNDP) that their members have been detained in them and
 that some have died from mistreatment.
 
 
 Because of the Government's refusal to guarantee the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) access to all detention centers, official as well as unofficial,
 the ICRC has declined to visit any prisons since 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary, prolonged detention remained
 a serious problem. Security forces failed to implement fully a Penal Code require-
 ment that detainees be brought promptly before a magistrate and have held detain-
 ees incommunicado.
 Police may detain a person in custody in connection with a common crime for up
 to 24 hours, renewable three times, before bringing charges. However, the law only
 provides for the right to a judicial review of the legality of detention in the few ma-
 jority Anglophone areas of the country. Elsewhere, the Francophone legal tradition
 applies, precluding judicial authorities from acting on a case until the administra-
 tive authority that ordered the detention turns the case over to the prosecutor. After
 a magistrate has issued a warrant to bring the case to trial, he may hold the de-
 tainee in "pretrial detention" indefinitely pending court action. Furthermore, a 1990
 law permits detention without charge for renewable periods of 15 days "in order to
 combat banditry." Persons taken into detention are frequently denied access to both
 legal counsel and family members. The law permits release on bail only in the
 Anglophone provinces, where the legal system includes features of British common
 law. Even there, bail is granted infrequently.
 The Government imprisoned several journalists for alleged libel. Some of these
 cases were marred by judicial improprieties and appear to have been motivated by
 the Government's desire to inhibit criticism of important government figures or gov-
 ernment policies (see Section 2.a.).
 The Government does not practice political exile. Some opposition members who
 considered themselves threatened by the Government have voluntarily left the coun-
 try and declared themselves to be in political exile. Other persons who received
 threats sought political asylum abroad (see Section 2.a.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is subject to political influence.
 Amendments to the Constitution passed on December 23 provide for the independ-
 ence of the judiciary but do not make clear how this will be achieved. Under the
 amendments, the President retains power to appoint members of the bench, as he
 has in the past. The period for which judges will be appointed is not defined in the
 Constitution. Judges and magistrates acknowledge that rendering a decision that
 displeases the President may well result in a transfer to a less desireable position
 or nonreappointment.
 The legal system is strongly influenced by the French legal system, although in
 the Angiophone provinces certain aspects of the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition appl
 The court system includes the Supreme Court, a court of appeas in each of the 0
 provinces, and courts of first instance in each of the country's 56 divisions. The
 courts are notoriously corrupt and inefficient. Justice is frequently denied or de-
 layed. powerful political or business interests appear to enjoy virtual immunity from
 prosecution while critics of the Government are sometimes jailed on specious
 grounds of libel. Prisoners may be detained indefinitely during pretrial proceedings.
 Traditional courts are important in rural areas. Their authority varies by region
 and ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters of property and domestic disputes
 and may serve a probate function as well. Most traditional courts permit appeal of
 their decisions to traditional authorities of higher rank.
 Because appointed attorneys receive little compensation, the quality of legal rep-
 resentation for indigent persons is often poor. The Bar Association and some vol-
 untary organizations, such as the Cameroonian Association of Female Jurists, offer
 pro bono [egal assistance in some cases. Triais are public, and those convicted have
 the right to appeal their sentences.
 There were no known political prisoners at year's end (see Section 2.a.). However,
 a controversial court case in Far North province involving members of an opposition
 political party, UNDP, continued during 1995. In mid-1994 the authorities arrested
 29 prominent UNDP activists from that province, including the party's local division
 head, Amadou Adji, following a reck-thrwing attack on a motorcade in which the
 provincial governor and a cabinet minister, who had defected to the Government
 from the UNDP, were riding. The Government charged them with various offenses,
 including obstruction of a public highway, banditry, and assault, occasioning one
 death. UNDP leaders claim that all were arrested on political grounds, regardless
 of whether they were present when the incident broke out, and that the real culprits
 were juveniles who escaped. The authorities released 15 of the detainees, including
 Adji, in February pending trial, held 7 in detention, and dropped charges against
 6 others in March. The trial opened on July 27 but was postponed in August first
 at the request of the prosecution, and later at the request of the defense. The UiNDP
 argued that the judge in the case, a member of President Biya's ethnic group, was
 
 
 35
 biased against the defendants and permitted irregular courtroom procedures that fa-
 vored the prosecution.
 Attorneys presented closing arguments on December 14, but the judge did not
 issue a verdict. Instead, he postponed his decision until February 8, 1996, after the
 municipal elections scheduled for January 21. Because the accused have not been
 convicted of a crime they may participate in those elections. However, a postelection
 conviction would render them ineligible to hold office, and the seven tat remain
 in prison cannot participate in the electoral campaign. Defense attorneys and UNDP
 leaders were concerned that the judge would use a guilty verdict to annul election
 results unfavorable to the Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Both in-
 vasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are illegal, but there were
 numerous credible reports that police and gendarmes harassed citizens, conducted
 searches without warrants, and seized mail. There were numerous credible reports
 that the Government kept some opposition activists and dissidents under surveil-
 lance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression and the press, the Government does not always respect these liberties.
 In fact, it vigorously censors and intimidates the large private press. A 1990 law
 established more liberal regulations to begin publication of newspapers and maga-
 zines, but it also formally authorized prepublication censorship and granted the
 Ministry of Territorial Administration the authority to suspend or revoke the right
 to publish. In December the National Assembly passed a new press law restricting
 the Government's right to censor individual articles in advance of publication but
 expanding the Government's right to ban or seize publications "which threaten the
 public orer or good morals," terms which the new law does not define.
 The law also provided for the licensing of private radio and television stations,
 but, as of late 1995, the Government had granted no licenses and retained complete
 control of the electronic media. The Government informed license applicants that,
 while private stations are theoretically legal, there exists no statutory framework
 for issuing licenses. Public servants employed by the official media face retribution
 for openly criticizing the Government. In addition to direct censorship, many private
 newspapers were harassed and intimidated into practicing a degree of self-censor-
 ship.
 The Government publishes an official newspaper, the Cameroon Tribune, and de-
 termines the content of radio and television broadcasts, the most important media
 for reaching the public. While government reporters sometimes run stories which
 implicitly criticize the ruling party or portray government programs in an unfavor-
 able light, the government-controlled media provide disproportionately high levels of
 coverage to CPDM functions, while giving little attention to opposition events.
 There are 40 to 50 private newspapers which publish sporadically; only about 10
 appeared on a regular basis in 1994-95. While these newspapers are often out-
 spoken in their criticism of the President and the Government, the press is not read
 widely outside the major cities because of the high cost of a newspaper to the aver-
 age citizen, as well as distribution problems. Despite its advantage, starting in the
 spring the Government waged a severe campaign of intimidation against the press,
 which included frequent and arbitrary censorship of articles (particularly those criti-
 cal of leading government figures), the arrests of journalists, beatings and arrests
 of newspaper vendors and distributors, repeated seizures of newspaper copies, and
 finally the outright suspension of the leading independent journals. The Govern-
 ment claimed that they had violated prepublication censorship laws, although one
 newspaper's suspension notice was based on the "behavior" of the editor, grounds
 which have no known basis even in Cameroonian press law. The repeated seizures
 of thousands of copies of newspapers dealt a severe blow to many financially
 strapped independent newspapers, two of which were bought in September by
 progovernment businessmen. By late 1995, fewer newspapers appeared regularly on
 the streets, and most of those appearing had adopted a decidedly more cautious
 tone.
 The manager of the government-directed Cameroon Radio and Television Corpora-
 tion arbitrarily suspended from January 1 through March 2 a weekly radio and tele-
 vision program created by a 1991 law to allow political parties represented in the
 National Assembly to represent their views. The entirely illegal suspension of the
 program appeared designed to inhibit expression by members of the UNDP, the only
 major opposition party represented in the National Assembly, of their claim that the
 Government was engaged in efforts to destabilize their party.
 
 
 Of the many arrests made during the year, several stand out. On May 4, gen-
 darmes arrested Patrice Ndedi Penda, editor of the independent newspaper,
 Galaxie, and detained him overnight in a Douala prison. His arrest, which was
 made without a legal warrant, stemmed from a year-old court case in which Penda
 had accused a government minister of an impropriety. The judge in the case had
 declared himself incompetent to rule on the matter, and the case had been consid-
 ered closed. In obtaining the May 4 arrest, the concerned minister is believed to
 have improperly prevailed upon contacts within a Douala gendarme unit. A Douala
 court later ruled that the arrest and detention had been illegal. In the same month,
 several thousand copies of Galaxie's four editions for May were seized and de-
 stroyed.
 On June 6, the Government arrested Ndzana Seine, the publisher of Le Nouvel
 Independant, on grounds of having committed outrage to the Head of State and in-
 citing to rebellion after he published an article accusing the head of the Govern-
 ment s security services of embezzlement and other financial improprieties. Ndzana
 Seine had been jailed on similar charges in 1994 and held for 2  months without
 bail. He received a stiff fine and a suspended sentence in that case. During the June
 6 arrest, police reportedly beat two of the publisher's associates. Following his June
 - arrest, the authorities held Ndzana Seme in a Yaounde prison for 2 months and did
 not bring formal charges against him until 4 to 5 weeks after his arrest. In August
 a court sentenced him to 2 months' imprisonment but immediately released him on
 the grounds that he had already served the sentence. In November a court convicted
 him on additional charges of outrage to the Head of State and sentenced him to 12
 months in prison and a large fine. At year's end, Ndzana Seine had gone into hiding
 to evade the authorities.
 In a similar case, in August a court sentenced Pius Njawe, publisher of Le
 Messager, to 2 months' imprisonment on charges he defamed the head of the Gov-
 ernment's security services in an article alleging financial improprieties. The sen-
 tence was suspended on appeal.
 In mid-July, a court sentenced Paddy Mbawa, an outspoken critic of the Govern-
 ment and the publisher of the Anglophone Cameroon Post, to 9 months in prison
 on two counts of having libeled a prominent businessman. Mbawa and his support-
 ers claimed that the charges against him were part of a government conspiracy to
 silence him and to destroy his newspaper. The 9-month sentence was unusually se-
 vere for a case of this type, and, in addition, the court proceedings against him were
 marked by judicial irregularities. Mbawa was jailed on August 10 although the
 court's failure to provide a written judgment in the case prevented him from filing
 a timely appeal. Subsequent appeals and requests for bail were denied. At year's
 end, Mbawa remained in prison, and the Government had filed a new set of charges
 against him, accusing him of libel and antigovernment rhetoric. If convicted, he
 could face a lengthy prison term.
 In April Julius Wamey, the former editor in chief of the Cameroon Post, a news-
 paper that is often harshly critical of the Government, sought (and subsequently re-
 ceived) political asylum in the United States. He reported that he had been subject
 to olice harassment and death threats in Cameroon.
 In August the Government arbitrarily suspended indefinitely four major private
 newspapers, La Nouvelle Expression, Le Messager, Dikalo, and Challenge Hebdo.
 All four had been outspokenly critical of the Government. The Government based
 its suspension order of three of the newspapers on their alleged defiance of censor-
 -ship rules. La Nouvelle Expression had the proof that it had abided by the censor-
 ship rules; it was suspended on other grounds, that of the "behavior" of the editor.
 The newspapers' editors argued, accurately, that the censorship rules were arbitrary
 and capricious.
 There were dozens of instances of press seizures throughout the year and many
 arrests of newspaper vendors. For example, in mid-April the authorities arrested
 three newspaper vendors, handled them roughly, and briefly jailed them in Douala
 on grounds they were selling a banned edition of Le Messager. The edition carried
 an article critical of the Vice Prime Minister. In August the authorities arrested sev-
 eral dozen newspaper vendors in Douala and Yaounde on grounds that they had dis-
 tributed suspended newspapers. While only briefly detained, the police beat many
 of the vendors, and magistrates handed out heavy fines.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on academic freedom, free political discus-
 sion at the university is dampened by the presence of armed security forces, re-
 ported state security informants, as well as the sometimes strident pro-opposition
 groups. Some professors believe that their political viewpoints and activism have
 had a negative impact on professional opportunities and advancement. In August
 the Abbe Jean-Marc Ela, a respected theologian and professor of sociology at the
 
 
 37
 University of Yaounde, sought political asylum in Canada claiming that he had re-
 ceived death threats.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation are provided for in law but restricted in practice. The Penal Code prohibits
 public meetings, demonstrations, or prcessions without prior government approval.
 So me 113 political parties operated[ legally, albeit with severe restrictions, along
 with a   wing numer of civc associations.
 The Government restricted the ability of opposition parties to operate, generally
 by refusing them permission to hold meetings on the grounds that the proposed
 meetings threatened public order. There were many instances of government inter-
 ference during the year, even when the parties had followed propr advance proce-
 dures. For example, on March 25, police antiriot forces dispersed militants of the
 Social Democratic Front (SDF), a major opposition party, who had gathered peace-
 fully in a Yaounde public square for a memorial service dedicated to deceased SDF
 members. In dsprsing the gathering, the police injured a number of persons and
 briefly arrested 18 persons. The police also disrupted a number of SDF municipal
 election rallies in the South and Center provinces in October and November.
 There were a number of examples of official interference with activities of the
 Union of Democratic Forces (UFDC). On January 31, the Yaounde authorities
 banned a UFDC rally intended to install newly elected party officials. On February
 1, Yaounde police dispersed a meeting of the Allied Front for Change, a coalition
 of 16 major opposition parties, including the UFDC, when Front members gathered
 in UFDC headquarters to elect a coalition president. On March 22, police barricaded
 UFDC headquarters to prevent Mongo Beti, a celebrated Cameroonian writer and
 intellectual, from delivering a lecture on his book criticizing the French role in Afri-
 ca.
 The Government attempted frequently to interrupt meetings of groups supporting
 greater autonomy or independence for the Anglophone region. On July 3, for exam-
 ple, gendarmes in Bamenda, Northwest province, used tear gas to disperse a group
 welcoming leaders of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC), a pro-
 Angophone group engaged in a public campaign. On the same day, gendarmes sur-
 rounded the Bamenda home of an SCNC leader and prevented free entry or exit.
 The governor of Southwest province banned all demonstrations, meetings, and ral-
 lies by SCNC or the Liberal Democratic Alliance (LDA) party throughout the Fako
 division of the province. On July 13, gendarmes broke up an LDA rally in Kumba,
 Southwest province, even though party organizers had followed the required ad-
 vance procedures.
 The Government's efforts to intimidate opposition party meetings had an impact.
 Several parties reported that the Government's repressive acts had discouraged
 them from attempting to hold rallies or other organizational activities.
 In a related incident, on August 31, Yaounde police disrupted a workshop on elec-
 tion monitoring by prohibiting participants from meeting in the hotel where they
 had made prior arrangements or in any of several alternative hotels. The seminar
 organizers, members of the private organization Conscience Africaine, had taken all
 the necessary legal steps to obtain advance approval for the seminar. The Govern-
 ment later relented after the conference had already been moved to a diplomatic
 venue.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally does not restrict this freedom. However, religious groups
 must be approved and registered with the Ministry of Territorial Administration in
 order to function legally.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The 1972 Constitution provides all citizens the right to settle in any
 place and to move about freely, subject to statutory provisions concerning public
 order, security, and tranquility. In reality, government forces commonly impede do-
 mestic travel on specious and arbitrary grounds. Police frequently stop travelers to
 check identification documents, vehicle registrations, and tax receipts as security
 and immigration control measures. Security forces, including police, frequently set
 up roadblocks primarily to extract bribes. This long-standing practice appears to
 have increased as the economy declined, although security forces did not take the
 drastic 1994 salary cuts imposed on civil servants.
 The Government occasionally uses its passport control function against those it
 considers a potential threat. For example, it withdrew the passport of Victorin
 Hameni Bieleu, the President of the UFDC party, 4 years ago, and he has been un-
 able to obtain a new one.
 Cameroon has long served as a safe haven for displaced persons and refugees
 from the region, and it cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees. Although the Government occasionally returns illegal immigrants, there
 
 
 38
 were no reports of forced repatriation of recognized refugees. However, there were
 continuing reports that some illegal immigrants have been subjected to harsh treat-
 ment, including imprisonment.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government, but dominance
 of the political process by the President and his party limit the ability of citizens
 to exercise this right.
 In contrast to the relatively open March 1992 National Assembly elections, the
 last presidential election held in October 1992 was characterized by widespread
 irregularities; it was highly criticized by independent observers and widely regarded
 in Cameroon as fraudulent. Municipal elections, which had been repeatedly post-
 poned in 1992 and 1994 were finally scheduled for January 1996.
 Considerable controversy surrounded the Government's handling of preparations
 for these local elections. The electoral registration period was marred by widespread
 and credible charges that administrative obstacles rendered it difficult or many citi-
 zens to register. There is no independent nonpartisan national election commission,
 and the 1992 municipal election law, passed by a CPDM-dominated National As-
 sembly, favors the incumbent party. Government authorities have broad powers per-
 mitting them to determine candidates' eligibility for office, monitor the operations
 of local polling commissions, announce election results, and invalidate entire lists
 of candidates.
 The Government's control over Cameroon's administrative apparatus is broad and
 deep. The President appoints by decree the Chief Operating Official, the Govern-
 ment delegate, of Yaounde, Douala, Bamenda, and several other large cities, which
 have no elected mayors. The governors of each of the provinces are also appointed
 directly by the President. Important lower level members of the provincial adminis-
 trative structures including the senior divisional officers, the divisional officers, and
 the district chiefs, are all appointed by the Prime Minister, who is also a member
 of the CPDM. The governors and senior divisional officers wield considerable au-
 thority within the areas under their jurisdiction, including, significantly, the author-
 ity to ban political meetings that they deem likely to threaten public order (see Sec-
 tion 2.b).
 In December the National Assembly passed a set of government-introduced
 amendments to the strongly centralized 1972 Constitution. All debate was held be-
 hind closed doors. The amendments included term limits for the President, the cre-
 ation of a partially elected (70 percent) and partially appointed (30 percent) Senate,
 and the creation of a set of regional councils with limited powers over local affairs.
 The amendments did not weaken presidential powers, and the independence of the
 judiciary remained questionable.
 There are no specific discriminatory laws prohibiting women or minorities from
 participating in government, in the political process, or in other areas of public life.
 Women are represented in the President's Cabinet (2 of 44 members), in the Na-
 tional Assembly (22 of 180 members), in the CPDM, in the judicial system, and in
 numerous state-run enterprises, although not in numbers anywhere near prpor-
 tional to their share of the population. In June two women were named to secretary-
 general posts in the Ministries of National Education and Tourism.
 While most of the key members of the Government, such as those from the Min-
 istries of Territorial Administration and Defense, are drawn from the President's
 own Beti ethnic group, all levels of the administration include participants from
 other ethnic groups and regions. Suffrage is universal at age 20.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits numerous domestic and international human rights
 monitoring groups to operate. It sometimes impded the effectiveness of these non-
 governmental organizations, including the ICRC, by limiting access to prisoners, re-
 fusing todivulge inormation, and otherwise inhibiting their activities. On occasion,
 human rights workers have been beaten and harassed (see Section 1.c.). Some of
 the most active include the National League for Human Rights, the Organization
 for Human Rights and Freedoms, the Association of Women against Violence, the
 Cameroonian Association of Female Jurists, the Cameroonian Association for Chil-
 dren's Rights, Conscience Africaine, the Movement for the Defense of Human Rights
 and Liberties, the Human Rights Defence Group, and the Human Rights Clinic and
 Education Center. Financial hardships, inexperience, and occasional fear of govern-
 ment reprisals sometimes discouraged these nongovernmental civic associations
 from publicly criticizing the Government's human rights record. Nevertheless, sev-
 
 
 39
 eral organizations issued press releases to denounce specific human rights abuses.
 Many held seminars and workshops on various aspects of human rights.
 The governmental National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, whose
 operations had been hamered in previous years by lack of official funding, in 1995
 received sufficient funds from the Government to enable it to carry out limited ac-
 tivities. The Commission has submitted reports to the President and the Prime Min-
 ister but has never released these publicly. It organized events or hosted several
 human rights seminars during the year. These included a national poster campaign
 in February to educate the population about their civil and human rights and a
 human rights seminar in March in Bamenda for government officials.
 The Government cooperated with the ICRC in preparing a draft training manual
 for gendarme units to be used in riot control and other "maintenance of order oper-
 ations. In September the Government permitted a US. military unit to offer a semi-
 nar for the first time on peacekeeping, disaster relief, democracy, and military code
 of conduct to a selected group of military officers. The seminar included considerable
 human rights content. In October a government ministry shared with diplomatic of-
 ficials a report of sanctions taken against a number of gendarmes accused of human
 rights violations in 1993 and 1994. While sketchy, the report marks one of the few
 times the Government has demonstrated a willingness to publicize sanctions taken
 against the forces of law and order.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and mandates that "every-
 one has equal rights and obligations." However, it does not explicitly forbid discrimi-
 nation based on race, language, religion, or social status. The Government does not
 effectively enforce these constitutional provisions.
 Women.-Credible reports indicate that violence against women has surged in re-
 cent years and that the law does not impose effective penalties against violators.
 Spousal abuse is not a legal ground for divorce. In cases of sexual assault, a victim's
 family or village often imposes direct, summar punishment upon the suspected per-
 petrator through means ranging from destruction of property to boating. While there
 are no reliable statistics on violence against women, the number of newspaper re-
 ports indicate the frequency is high._                                   _
 Despite constitutional prvisions recognizing equal rights, women do not, in fact,
 enjoy the same rights and privileges as men. Polygyny is permitted by law and tra-
 dition, but polyandry is not. The extent to which a woman may inherit from her
 husband is normally governed by traditional law in the absence of a will, and cus-
 toms vary from group to group. In many traditional societies, custom grants greater
 authority and benefits to male than to female heirs. In cases of divorce, the hus-
 band's wishes determine custody of children over the age of 6. While a man may
 be convicted of adultery only if the sexual act takes place in his home, a female may
 be convicted irrespecti~ve of venue. In the northern provinces, traditional leaders
 (Lamibe) prevent their numerous wives from ever leaving the palaces.
 Children.-aThe Constitution provides that a child has the right to an education,
 and the Government sets mandatory schooling through age 14. Nevertheless, risin
 school fees and costs for books have forced many families to forgo sending their
 dren to school. The degree of familial child abuse is not known but is one of several
 targeted issues of children's rights organizations. Babies and small children some-
 times accompany their mothers to prison.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not widely
 practiced in Cameroon, but it occurs in some areas of the Far North and Southwest
 provinces. It includes the most severe form of the abuse, infibulation, and is usually
 practiced on young, preadolescent girls. The Government does not recognize FGM
 as a problem and has not allocated resources to educate the public on the issue.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1983 law and subsequent implementing legislation
 provide certain guarantees for persons with disabilities. These include access to pub-
 Iic institutions, medical treatment, and education. The Government is obliged to
 bear part of a disabled person's educational expenses, to employ disabled persons
 where possible, and, as necessary, to provide them with public assistance. These
 rights and guarantees are, in fact, rarely respected. There are few facilities for dis-
 abled persons and little public assistance of any kind. Lack of facilities and care for
 the mentally disabled is particularly acute. Society tends to treat the disabled as
 tainted, leaving it to churches or foreign NGO's to provide assistance.
 Indigenous People.--Cameron's population of indigenous Pygmies (a term which
 in fact encompasses several different ethnic groups) primarily resides in the forest
 areas of the south and southeast. While they suffer no legal discrimination, they are
 
 
 subject to much societal and economic discrimination; other groups often treat the
 Pygmies as inferior and sometimes subject them to virtual slave labor.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Therere e frequent and credible allegations
 of discrimination among Cameroon's more than 200 ethnic groups. President Biya's
 Beti ethnic group receives special preferences in all sectors affected by the Govern-
 ment. This has resulted in Betis holding a preponderance of key positions in govern-
 ment, the security forces, and the military. In other sectors, discrimination by other
 ethnic gups is not uncommon. Virtually all ethnic groups tend to provide pref-
 erential treatment to their coethnics where they able to do so.
 An important ethnic, political division falls along linguistic lines rooted in the co-
 lonial period. The Anglophone minority (20 percent) often charges that the
 Francophone majority does not share real power and that the Government provides
 fewer economic benefits to English-speaking regions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Code allows workers to form and
 join trade unions of their own choosing. It permits groups of at least 20 workers
 to organize a union but also requires registration with the Ministry of Labor. In
 ractice, independent unions have found it extremely difficult to obtain registration.
 egistered unions are invariably subject to government domination and inter-
 ference. Provisions of the Labor Code do not a pply to civil servants, employees of
 the penitentiary system, or workers responsible for national security. In lieu of
 strikes, civil servants are  red to negotiate grievances directly with the minister
 of the concerned department and with the Minister of Labor. Some sections of the
 Labor Code have never taken effect, as not all of the implementing decrees have
 been issued. No new implementing decrees were issued in 1995.
 The Labor Code explicitly recognizes workers' right to strike but only after man-
 datory arbitration. Arbitration proceedings are not legally enforceable and may be
 overturned by the Government. The Labor Code, in theory, provides for the protec-
 tion of legal strikers and prohibits retribution against them. In fact, the Govern-
 ment responded aggressively to a number of strikes, many of which were occasioned
 by Iong-term arrearages in civil service salaries. In January it dismissed 20 Univer-
 sity of Yaounde administrative employees after they staged a strike demanding pay-
 ment of several months salary arrearages. While in May the Government acceded
 to p     oart of the demands of the Yaounde urban council workers for back pay, in June
 and July it used security forces to help terminate strikes over salary atrearages by
 members of thc Cameroon Public Servants Union (CAPSU), an independent and un-
 registered union, and by Public Works Workers (Grands Travaux). In the latter in-
 stance, on August 7 the Government called out the Presidential Guard to evict
 workers from a state-owned building.
 In September the National Union of Secondary School Teachers (SNAES), a reg-
 istered union, fbied a complaint with the International Labor Organization (ILO),
 charging that the Government had illegally assigned members of the union's execu-
 tive committee to remote areas in retaliation for union participation in a December
 1993 to February 1994 strike over salary arrearages and improved professional sta-
 tus for teachers. SYNES, the National Union of Teachers of Higher Education, sub-
 mitted a complaint to the ILO concerning the Governments long-term refusal to
 register it.
 arc the Government encouraged the creation of a new labor confederation,
 the Union of Free Trade Unions of Cameroon (USL), with which it maintains cose
 ties. Previously, the sole labor confederation had been the Confederation of
 Cameroonian Trade Unions (CoTU), formerly affiliated with the ruling CPDM party
 under the name Organization of Cameroonian Trade Unions. While both organiza-
 tions appear to be dominated or at least thoroughly intimidated by the Government,
 the creation of the USLC was widely interpreted as an effort by the Government
 to create a rival trnde union confederation more firmly under its control.
 Earlier, in January the Government had permitted the CCTU to hold a congress
 and agreed not to interfere in the union's activities and to respect the decisions of
 the CCTU majority. In 1994 the Government had engineered the ouster of Louis
 Smbs, who was seen as a threat to government control of the union, from his post
 as Secretary General. The ILO and other international trade union organizations
 criticized the Government's action, and Sembes was reelected to the secretary gen-
 eral post in the January election.
 In June the ILO expressed regret over the Government's silence in response to
 its 1994 inquiries concerning government interference in the leadership of the
 CCTU.
 
 
 The CCTU is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The USLC, established in
 March, filed an application for membership with these organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Code pro-
 vides for collective bargaining between workers and management in local work
 places, as well as between labor federations and business associations in each sector
 of the economy. Nevertheless, no sectoral collective bargaining negotiations had
 been undertaken by year's end.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employers guilty of such
 discrimination are subject to fmes ranging up to the equivalent of $2,000 (1 million
 CFA francs). However, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination do not
 have to reinstate workers fired for union activities. The Ministry of Labor reported
 that there were no complaints of such discrimination in 1995. In contrast, CCTU
 delegates reported that many trade unionists were dismissed from their jobs in 1995
 due to union activities. The Cameroon Railroad Corporation suspended all union ac-
 tivities in 1995 and fired some union members.
 Cameroon has an industrial free zone regime. The Government approved several
 firms to operate under it in 1994 but none in 1995. Free zone employers are exempt
 from some provisions of the Labor Code but must respect all internationally recog-
 nized worker rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Labor Code. However, prisons continued to allow inmates to be con-
 tracted out to private employers or used as communal labor for municipal public
 works. There are credible reports that slavery continues to be practiced in the
 Lamidat of Rey Bouba, an isolated traditional kingdom in North province.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code establishes that
 no child may be employed before age 14. Ministry of Labor inspectors are respon-
 sible for enforcing the minimum age of employment but lack resources for an efec-
 tive inspection program. In rural areas many children begin work at an early age
 on family farms. Often, rural youth, especially girls, are employed by relatives as
 domestics, while many urban street vendors are under the age of 14. There are no
 special provisions limiting working hours for children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Under the Labor Code, the Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for setting a single minimum wage applicable nationwide in all sec-
 tors. In February the Prime Minister set the wage at approximately $47 (24,000
 CFA francs) per month. The wage does not provide a decent living for the average
 worker and family.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard workweek of 40 hours in public and pri-
 vate nonagricultural firms and 48 hours in agricultural and related activities. The
 Code makes compulsory at least 24 consecutive hours of weekly rest. The Govern-
 ment sets health and safety standards, and Ministry of Labor inspectors and occu-
 pational health doctors are responsible for monitoring these standards. However,
 they lack the resources for a comprehensive inspection program, and there is no pro-
 vision in the Labor Code authorizing workers to remove themselves from work situ-
 ations that endanger health or safety. Workers do have the right to report a dan-
 gerous situation to a Ministry of Labor medical doctor. The doctor may inspect the
 suspect work site and recommend remedies but, in many cases, fails to do so.
