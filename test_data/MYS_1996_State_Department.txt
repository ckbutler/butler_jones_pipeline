 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states with a parliamentary system of government
 based onperiodic multiparty elections, but in which the ruling National Front coali-
 tion has held power since 1957. The coalition headed by Prime Minister Mahathir
 bin Mohamed increased its majority in a general election held in 1995. Opposition
 parties actively contest elections, although they hold only 11.5 percent of the seats
 m the Federal Parliament; an opposition party controls one state government.
 The Royal Malaysian Polie has primary respnsibility for internal security mat-
 ters; it reports to and is under the effective control of the Minister of Home Affairs.
 The Prime Minister also holds the Home Affairs portfolio. There are allegations tht
 some members of the police committed human rights abuses.
 Rapidly expanding exports of manufactured goods, now over 50 percent of gross
 domestic product, continue to maintain high annual rates of economic growth. Crude
 oil exports and traditional commodities (tropical timber, palm oil, and rubber) add
 to trade revenues. Strong economic performance in recent years has led to signifi-
 cant reductions in poverty, an improved standard of living, and more equal income
 distribution.

 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. The Government continued to arrest and detain
 citizens without trial and to impose long-term restrictions on movement without due
 process hearings. The Government sometimes limits freedom of assembly, associa-
 tion, speech, the press, and judicial independence. These limits make it very difficult
 for opposition parties to compete on equal terms with the long-ruling governing coa-
 lition. Religious minorities are subject to some restrictions. Domestic violence
 against women and child abuse continued to be problems. In a development wel-
 comed by women's groups, the Government began to implement the Domestic Vio-
 lence Act, which covers violence against women and children, after a long delay.
 Some discrimination against indigenous people and restrictions on worker rights
 pe rsist. In November the authorities terminated an international conference about
 astTimer because of the disorder created by demonstrators from the youth wings
 of the ruling coalition parties. Although nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) are
 normally free to criticize the Government, the authorities fied criminal charges
 under the Publications Act against a prominent human rights activist who alleged
 mistreatment of illegal aliens in detention centers. The authorities punished law en-
 forcement officers implicated in a police brutality case.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 ku ing ...
 Folowing investigations by the Attorney General's office and the police into the
 circumstances surrounding the 1995 death of a criminal suspect, the High Court
 sentenced two police officers to 3 years' imprisonment for misconduct during the
 suspect's interrogation. The deceased, who was a suspect in a burglary case, died
 while in police custody from "hemorrhage caused by blunt trauma in most parts of
 his body," raising suspicions of police brutality. The other police officers implicated
 in the case were subjected to internal discipline.
 The Government continued to deny allegations of mistreatment and corruption in
 illegal alien detention enters. Stating that the death of approximately 50 illegal
 aliens in the centers last year was not due to misconduct, the Government brought
 criminal charges against human rights activist Irene Fernandez for publishing a re-
 prt contaiing allegations about conditions in the detention centers. The case is
 currently pending in a magistrate's court (see Sections 1.c., 1.d., and i.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continued to be allegations that poie off.ers abused criminal suspects dur-
 ing interrogation, including strong psychological pressure and sometimes physical
 abuse. In some cases, government authorities have investigated police officials for
 such abuses, but because they refuse to release information on the results of the
 investigations, it cannot be determined whether those responsible for any such
 abuses are punished.
 In one case, however, police officers were sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment for
 misconduct in the 1995 death of a criminal suspect in custody (see Section L.a.).
 This was the first reported instance in recent years of police officials being tried,
 convicted, and sentenced for abuse of prisoners. In another case, a civil suit filed
 by a former suspect, a sessions court ordered police officers to pay compensation to
 the plaintiff for assaulting him in 1995 while in custody.
 Responding to public criticism of police professionalism, the Inspector General of
 Police has stated that he would punish those who abuse their power or use violence
 in carrying out their duties. Several police officers also were arrested for various
 criminal offenses including extortion, drug abuse, and murder.
 A number of law enforcement officials were arrested on narcotics-related charges.
 The Prisons Department revealed that at least 12 prison officers were arrested for
 drug-related activities. A total of 78 prison officers have been arrested for drug-re-
 lated offenses since 1990.
 Criminal law prescribes caning as an additional punishment to imprisonment for
 those convicted of some nonviolent crimes such as narcotics possession and criminal
 breach of trust. Early in the year, the Government amended the Immigration Act
 to make caning a mandatory part of the sentence for those convicted of using forged
 passports. Judges routinely include caning in sentencing those convicted of such
 crimes as kidnaping, rape, and robbery. The caning, which is normally carried out
 with a  /-inch-thick wooden cane, commonly causes welts and sometimes scarring.
 Prison conditions generally meet international standards. Basic human needs, in-
 cluding medical care, sanitation, nutrition, and family access, are met. Overcrowd-
 
 
 ing is a problem in some large prisons. However, a new prison complex has elimi-
 nated the overcrowding problem in the Kuala Lumpur area.
 Prison guards have been accused and convicted of criminal wrongdoing, mostly in
 nonviolent narcotics-related cases. While acknowledging that prison guards have
 been arrested for such activities, the Director General of the Prisons denied a well
 publicized allegation by a former inmate that heroin was readily available in the
 prisons. "Security" prisoners (see Section 1.d.) are detained in a separate detention
 center. Conditions there are not significantly. different from those of the regular
 prison population.
 The Government does not permit visits by human rights monitors.
 The Government denied allegations that the 1995 death of approximately 50 ille-
 gal aliens was due to inhuman conditions in illegal alien detention centers (see Sec-
 tions L.a., 1.d., and I.e.). Stating that every allegation made in human rights activ-
 ist Irene Fernandez's report on the centers is false, the Government prosecuted her
 for publishing a false report. The case was pending in a magistrate's court at year's
 end. Fernandez alleged that migrants in the camps were denied proper food and
 water, lacked medical attention, and were subjected to abuse by camp guards. An
 Independent Board of Visitors appointed by the Government to investigate the alle-
 gations of misconduct found no evidence of ill-treatment or abuse of migrant work-
 ers. In a report submitted to the Government in December, the bard recommended
 that improvements be made in health and sanitation facilities, and, noting that beri-
 beri was common in the centers, that a more nutritious diet be provided. The Min-
 istry of Home Affairs announced that the Government would seek additional funds
 to make the improvements.
 d. Arbitrary Arrst, Detention, or Exile.-Three laws permit the Government to de-
 tain suspects without judicial review or i'ling formal charges: The 1960 Internal Se-
 curity Act (ISA), the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance
 of 1969, and the Dangerous Drus Act of 1985. The Government continued to use
 long-term detention without tria in cases alleged to involve national security, as
 well as in narcotics trafficking and other cases. According to the Home Affairs Min-
 istry, there are 2,008 people being detained without trial under these laws; most are
 being held under the Dan erous Drugs Act.
 Passed more than 30 years ago when there was an active Communist insurgency,
 the ISA empowers the plice to hold any person who may act "in a manner preju-
 dicial to the security of alaysiae for up to 60 days initially. The Minister of Home
 Affairs may authorize, in writing, further indefinite detention for periods of u to
 2 years. Those released before the end of their detention period are subject to im-
 posed restricted conditions," which are in effect for the balance of their detention
 periods. These conditions limit their rights to freedom of speech, association, and
 travel outside the country. According to the Government, the goal of the ISA is to
 control internal subversion, although many observers believe that the act is now
 sometimes used for other purposes. The Government also uses the ISA against pass-
 port and identity card forgers. According to the Home Affairs Ministry, there were
 76 ISA detainees at year's end, compared with 34 in 1995. Most of the detainees
 currently in custody under the ISA are forgers. Since the authorities exposed a
 criminal syndicate involved in selling forged daysian identity cards to illegal
 aliens last year, 67 suspects have been arrested under the ISA. Of these, the Gov-
 ernment has thus far authorized 2-year detentions for 50, including several govern-
 ment officials.
 Several members of the outlawed Islamic fundamentalist movement Al Arqam
 were arrested under the ISA for attempting to revive the movement. The Govern-
 ment authorized 2-year detentions for seven upon expiration of their 60-day remand
 orders. The wife of the movement's founder was placed under restricted residence
 under the act. In 1994 the Government outlawed the movement as deviationist and
 detained its founder under the ISA. After a brief period of detention, the founder
 apologized for his deviationist teachings and vowed to stp the movement.
 Security authorities sometimes wait several days afer a detention before inform-
 ing a detainee's family. Even when there are no formal charges, the authorities
 must inform detainees of the accusations against them and permit them to appeal
 to an advisory beard for review every 6 months. Advisory board decisions and rec-
 ommendations, however, are not binding on the Home Affairs Minister, are not
 made public, and are often not shown to the detainee. A number of ISA detainees
 have refused to participate in the review process under these circumstances.
 Amendments to the ISA severely limit judicial review of detentions, contravening
 international standards of due process. Opposition leaders and human rights organi-
 zations continued to call on the Government to repeal the ISA and other legislation
 that deprive people of the right to defend themselves in court. The Deputy Home
 Affairs Minister announced mn February that the Government had prepared pro-
 
 
 posed amendments to the ISA; these proposals reportedly are designed to make the
 IA"less ominous."
 In a civil lawsuit, the High Court ruled in September in favor of a former ISA
 detainee who had alleged that the Government's extension of his detention period
 was improper. After his initial 2-year detention, the Government extended his de-
 tention for another 2 years, but without specifying the grounds for detention. Al-
 though the court ruled in the plaintiff's favor, it awarded him damages of only about
 $0.40 (one ringgit). The judge noted that the plaintiff had been set free because of
 a technical error and should have rested on his good fortune.
 In December senior government officials warned that the ISA would be used
 against NGO's if they continued to "bait" the Government. Expressing irritation at
 NGO plans to hold a conference on police abuse in January 1997, the Home Affairs
 Minister said that the Government may have to use the act if the "situation be-
 comes bad." The Minister added, however, that the Government would not bar the
 organizations from holding the meeting if they do not break any laws. The Govern-
 ment would take action only if the organizers make it into a public meeting by invit-
 ing non-NGO's or the piess.
 Under the 1969 Emergency Ordinance, which was instituted after intercommunal
 riots in that year, the Home Affairs Minister can issue a detention order for up to
 2 years against a person if he deems it necessary to protect public order or for the
 suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence." According
 to the Home Affairs Ministry, there were 56 people in detention under the Emer-
 gency Ordnance compared with 447 in 1995.
 Provisions of the 1985 amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act give the Govern-
 ment specific power to detain suspected drug traffickers. The suspects may be held
 up to 39 days~efore the Home Aairs Minister must issue a detention order. Once
 the Ministry has issued an order, the detainee is entitled to a habeas corpus hearing
 before a court. In some instances, the judge may order the detainee's release. Sus-
 pects may be held without charge for successive 2-year intervals, with periodic re-
 view by an advisory board, whose opinion is binding on the Home Affairs Minister.
 However, the review process contains none of the due process rights that a defend-
 ant would have in a court proceeding. As of September, 1,876 drug suspects re-
 mained under detention or under restrictions equivalent to house arrest under this
 statute, compared with 1,810 in 1995. The police frequently rearrest suspected nar-
 cotics traffickers and firearms offenders under the preventive measures clauses of
 the Dangerous Drugs Act or the ISA, after an acquittal in court on formal charges
 under separate provisions of those acts.
 Immigration laws are used to detain possible illegal aliens without trial or hear-
 ing. Approximately 8,500 migrant workers who were unable to prove their legal sta-
 tus have been placed in temporary detention under immigration laws. The detainees
 are not accorded any administrative or legal hearings and are released only after
 their employers prove their legal status. Those who can produce legal documents are
 normally released immediately;, those who cannot prove their legal status may be
 held for extended periods before deportation. Illegal aliens are kept in detention cen-
 ters which are separate from prisons. There are currently an estimated 1 million
 or more illegal workers in Malaysia.
 Following the death of approximately 50 illegal aliens in detention centers in
 1995, human rights organizations and opposition leaders accused the authorities of
 mistreatment and corruption and called for a thorough investigation. After its inves-
 tigation, however, the Government denied the allegations and brought criminal
 charges under the Printing and Publications Act against the human rights activist
 who first brought the controversy to light. She is accused of publishing false infor-
 mation regarding the centers' conditions. The case, which was proceeding in a mag-
 istrate's court at year's end, is being monitored by international observers and
 human rights groups. NGO's report that the conditions in the centers have margin-
 ally improved, anyan independent board appointed by the Government found no
 evidence of ill-treatment and noted that it was satisfied with living conditions in the
 camps (see Section 1.c.).
 Law enforcement authorities also continued to utilize the Restricted Residence Act
 to restrict movements of criminal suspects for an extended period. The act allows
 the Home Affairs Ministry to place criminal suspects under restricted residence in
 a remote district away from home for a period of 2 years. The Ministry is authorized
 to issue the "banishment" orders without any judicial or administrative hearings.
 Several professional soccer players and coaches, who were banished in 1995 for al-
 leged involvement in match fixing and bribery, remain under restricted conditions.
 The restricted residence practice violates due process and is viewed in the same
 light as detention without trial. Human rights activists have questioned the need
 for a law that was passed 60 years ago to deal with gambling under very different
 
 
 circumstances and have called for its repeal. The Government continued to justify
 the act as a necessary tool in dealing with vice and gambling activities. (See also
 Sections 1.f. and 2.d.)
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Past government action, a constitutional amend-
 ment, and legislation restricting judicial review undermine judicial independence
 and strengthen executive influence over the judiciary in politically sensitive cases.
 A series of" election-related decisions and high-profle ommercial cases in 1995 in-
 tensified the debate on judicial impartiality and independence. Members of the bar
 and other observers continued to express serious concern about this issue.
 The legal system is based on English common law. High courts have original ju-
 risdiction over all criminal cases involving serious crimes and most civil cases. Civil
 suits involving automobile accidents and landlord-tenant disputes are heard by ses-
 sions courts. Magistrate's courts hear criminal cases in which the maximum term
 of sentence does not exceed 12 months. The Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdic-
 tion over high court and session court decisions. The Federal Court hears appeals
 of Court of Appeal decisions. Islamic religious laws administered by state authori-
 ties through [slamic courts bind ethnic Malays in some civil matters, such as family
 relations and diet.
 Most civil and criminal proceedings are generally fair and open. The accused must
 be brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest, and charges must be levied
 within 10 days. Defendants have the right to counsel, bail is available, and strict
 rules of evidence apply in court. Defendants may appeal court decisions to higher
 courts and, in criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or local state
 rulers as appropriate. All criminal trials, including murder trials, are heard by a
 single judge. Parliament voted in 1994 to amend the Criminal Procedure Code to
 abolish jury trials in death penalty cases. The defense in both ordinary criminal
 cases and the special security cases described below is not entitled to a statement
 of evidence before the trial.
 The right to a fair trial is restricted in criminal cases in which the Attorney Gen-
 eral invokes the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. These regulations
 governing trial procedure normally apply only in firearms cases. In cases tried
 under these regulations, the standards for accepting self-incriminating statements
 by defendants as evidence are less stringent than in normal criminal cases. Also,
 the authorities may hold the accused for an unspecified period of time before mak-
 ing formal charges. The Attorney General has the authority to invoke these regula-
 tions in other criminal cases if the Government determines that the crime involves
 national security considerations, but such cases are rare. There were no cases in-
 volving this restriction in 1996.
 A letter alleging gross judicial misconduct led to an investigation by the Govern-
 ment and the abrupt resignation of a high court judge who was widely assumed to
 have authored the letter. The Attorney General proposed that the Bar Council's
 membership include law lecturers and government lawyers, in addition to private
 attorneys. Members of the Council, however, view this proposal as an attempt to
 dilute the Council's effectiveness and independence, and have vowed to fight it.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for these rights and the Government generally respects them. Provisions
 in the security legislation (see Section 1.d.), however, allow the police to enter and
 search without a warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national
 security. Police may also confiscate evidence under these acts. In some cases each
 year, police have used this legal authority to search homes and offices, seize books
 and papers, monitor conversations, and take people into custody without a warrant.
 The law permits the Home Affairs Ministry to place criminal suspects under re-
 stricted residence in a remote district away from home for a 2-year period.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and the press, some important limitations exist, and over the years the
 Government has restricted freedom of expression of media organizations and indi-
 viduals. The Constitution provides that freedom of speech may be restricted by leg-
 islation "in the interest of security * * * (or) public order. Thus, the Sedition Act
 prohibits public comment on issues defined as sensitive, such as citizenship rights
 or non-Malays and the special position of Malays in society.
 The Government used the Sedition Act and the Publications Act to file criminal
 charges against opposition member of parliament Lim Guan Eng before the 1995
 general election. The charges were based on Lim's public comments about a statu-
 tory rape case involving a former chief minister of Malacca. The trial was still pend-
 
 
 717
 ag at year's end following several continuances. Lima has argued that the case
 against him is politically motivated. Amnesty International also considers the
 charges against Lima to be politically mativat  and has called on the Government
 to dismiss the case. Liim was reeleted in the general election, but could lose his
 parliamentary seat if he is convicted and sentenced to more than 1 year in prison
 or fined more than $800 (2,000 ringgits).
 The Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984 contains important limitations
 on press freedom. Domestic and foreign publications must apply annually to the
 Government for apermit. The act was amended in 1987 to make the publication
 of "malicious news a punishable offense, expand the Government's power to ban or
 restrict publications, and prohibit court challenges to suspension or revocation of
 publication permits. Government policies create an atmosphere that inhibits inde-
 pendent or investigative journalism and result in self-censorship of issues govern-
 ment authorities might consider sensitive. Government displeasure with press re-
 porting is often conveyed directly to a newspapers board of directors.
 In practice press freedom is also limited by the fact that leading political figures,
 or companies controlled by leading political figures in the ruling coalition, own most
 of the major newspapers and all radio and television stations. These mass media
 provide generally laudatory, noncritical coverage of government officials and poli-
 cies, and give only limited and selective coverage to political views of the opposition
 or political rivals. Editorial opinion in these mass media frequently reflects govern-
 ment positions on domestic and international issues. Chinese-language newspapers
 are generally more free in reporting and commenting on sensitive political and so-
 cial issues.
 Small-circulation publications of opposition parties, social action groups, unions,
 and other private groups actively cover opposition parties and frequentlyprint views
 critical of government policies. However, the Government retains significant influ-
 ence over these publications by requiring annual renewal of publishing permits.
 Although there were no cases of denial of renewal requests in 1996, the Govern-
 ment has in the past used this requirement to place limitations on opposition and
 other publications critical of the Government. The Official Secrets Act also can be
 used to restrict freedom of the press. Pointing out the dangers of abuse to restrict
 press freedom, the Bar Council and NGO's have called for a review of certain provi-
 sions that grant considerable discretion to the authorities. In 1995 the authorities
 arrested two journalists under the act, but released them without bringing formal
 charges.
 The government-controlled Malaysian News Agency (Bernama) is by law the sole
 distributor of foreign news, although the Government has not to date used this law
 to restrict foreign news coverage or availability. NGO's currently enjoy considerable
 freedom to speak out against Government policies. The Government's case against
 NGO activist Irene Fernandez under the Printing Presses and Publications Act is
 being closely monitored by NGO's and others as a test case of the Government's
 willingness to permit public criticism.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom in the areas of teaching and
 publication. Academics are often publicly critical of the Government. However, there
 is a degree of self-censorship among public university academics whose career ad-
 vancement and funding are prerogatives of the Government. Private institution aca-
 demics also practice a limited degree of self-censorship for fear that the Government
 may revoke licenses for their institutions. Legislation also imposes limitations on
 student associations and student and faculty activity (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association, but there are significant
 restrictions. These rights may be limited in the interest of security and pubic order,
 and the 1967 Police Act requires police permits for all public assemblies with the
 exception of workers on picket lines. Spontaneous demonstrations occur periodically
 without permission, but they are limited in scope and generally occur with the tacit
 consent of the police.
 In the aftermath of the intercommunal riots in 1969, the Government banned po-
 litical rallies. The Government continued that policy during the 1995 general elec-
 tion. However, both government and opposition parties held large indoor political
 gatherings dubbed "discussion sessions" during the campaign period. The ruling coa-
 lition also held several large-scale events that very much resembled political rallies.
 Government and opposition candidates campaign actively. There are, however,
 some restrictions on freedom of assembly during campaigns. During the actual cam-
 paign period, political parties submit lists of times an  laces for their discussion
 sessions. Some opposition discussion group meetings in past campaigns have been
 canceled for lack of a police permit. An opposition meeting during the 1996 Sarawak
 state election campaign was canceled for lack of a permit. Outside of the campaign
 
 
 718
 period, a permit also is required, with most applications routinely app roved. These
 restrictions and the ban on political rallies handicap the opposition's alility to cam-
 palg effectively.
 Cher statutes limit the right of association, such as the Societies Act of 1966,
 under which any association of seven or more members must register with the Gov-
 ernment as a society. The Government may refuse to register a new society or may
 impose conditions when allowing a society to register. The Government also has the
 power to revoke the registration of an existing society for violations of the act, a
 power it has selectively enforced against political opposition groups. This threat of
 possible deregistration inhibits political activism by public or special interest organi-
 zations.
 Another law affecting freedom of association is the Universities and University
 Colleges Act; it mandates government approval for student associations and pro-
 hibits student associations, as well as faculty members, from engaging in political
 activity. Campus demonstrations must be approved by a university vice chancellor.
 Human rights organizations have called for a repeal of the act on the grounds that
 it inhibits the free flow of ideas and exchange of views.
 The authorities terminated an international conference about East Timor in No-
 vember because of the disorder created by demonstrators from the youth wings of
 the ruling coalition parties. Both the demonstrators and the organizers of the event
 were arrested and held for several days. They were all released on bail, and no for-
 mal charges have yet been brought against them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. Religious minorities, which
 include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities, generally are per-
 mitted to worship freely but are subject to some restrictions. Adherence to Islam is
 considered intrinsic to Malay ethnic identity, and therefore Islamic religious laws
 administered by state authorities through Islamic courts bind all ethnicMalays in
 some civil matters, such as family relations and diet. Government funds support an
 Islamic religious establishment, and it is official policy to "infuse Islamic values"
 into the administration of the county. At the same time, the Constitution provides
 for freedom of religion, and the Government has refused to accede to pressures to
 impose Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim community.
 The Government opposes what it considers extremist or deviant interpretations
 of Islam. In the past, the Government has imposed restrictions on certain Islamic
 sects. In August 1995, the Government banned the Al Arqam religious movement
 for what it termed "deviationist teachings," and it remained banned at year's end.
 The Government continues to monitor the activities of the Shi'ite minority.
 Government authorities continued to emphasize the importance of controlling de-
 viationist groups, and arrested followers of the banned Al Arqam movement for at-
 tempting to revive the deviationist sect (see Section 1.d.). The Government an-
 nounced that the authorities were investigating another 50 or so "deviationist"
 groups. In most cases, the Government expected to provide "counselling and hold
 dialogs" to encourage them to return to "the right path." The authorities have
 warned that such groups would not be allowed to take advantage of freedom of reli-
 gion to spread discord among the people.
 There continued to be allegations that some state governments are slow in ap-
 proving building permits for non-Muslim places of worship or land for cemeteries
 or non-Muslims.
 The Government discourages the circulation of a popular Malay-language trans-
 lation of the Bible. Some states have laws prohibiting the use of Mala-anguage
 religious terms by Christians, but the authorities do not actively enforce them.
 The Government permits but discourages conversion to religions other than Islam.
 Some states have long proscribed by law proselytizing of Muslims, and other parts
 of the country strongly discourage it as well. In a March 1990 decision, the Supreme
 Court upheld the primacy of the Constitution over inconsistent state laws by ruling
 that parents have the right to determine the religion of their minor children under
 the age of 18. The decision eased fears in the non-Muslim community over state
 laws that in religious conversion cases set the age of majority at puberty based on
 Islamic law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens generally have the right to travel within the country and live
 and work where they please, but the Government restricts these rights in some cir-
 cumstances. The east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak have the independent
 right to control immigration into their territories; citizens from peninsular west Ma-
 laysia and foreigners are required to present passports or national identity cards for
 entry. The Government regulates the internal movement of provisionally released
 ISA detainees. It also limits the movement of some released ISA detainees to a des-
 ignated city or state (see Section 1.d.). The Government also uses the Restricted
 
 
 719
 Residence Act to limit movements of those suspected of gambling or vice activities
 (see Section l.d).
 The Police Inspector General in late 1995 announced that over 400 former com-
 munists had been "rehabilitated" by the security authorities and resettled since De-
 cember 1989. This rehabilitation consists of detention without trial under the ISA
 at the Kamunting Detention Center in Perak state. In addition, rehabilitated former
 Communist Party of Malaya members who have reintegrated into society are re-
 stricted to certain areas where security authorities watch them carefully for up to
 6 years. These rehabilitated persons cannot resume full participation in political life
 until this period of surveillance demonstrates to the satisfaction of the police that
 they have abandoned their former ideology.
 The Government generally does not restrict emigration. Citizens are free to travel
 abroad, although in some cases the Government has refused to issue or has with-
 held passports on security grounds or in the belief that the trip will be detrimental
 to the country's image. In 1995 the Government prevented an environmental activ-
 ist from traveling overseas to attend a conference. Most such government actions
 are taken because of suspected drug trafficking offenses or other serious crimes.
 Citizens must apply for the Government's permission to travel to Israel. Travel
 to Jerusalem for religious purposes is explicitly allowed.
 There are 1 million or more foreign workers, concentrated primarily in low-skill
 jobs, the Human Resources Ministry estimates that as much as 90 percent of the
 labor force in the plantation sector is foreign. Nearly half of the foreign workers may
 be in the country illegally. Some illegal workers eventually are able to regularize
 their immigration status, others depart voluntarily after a few months, and some
 are formally deported as illegal migrants. The Government instituted a second ille-
 gal worker registration program in July, which had regularized the status of 200-
 300,000 workers by fall, and ran through the end of the year. After a similar reg-
 istration program ended 3 years ago, the Government launched combined police and
 military operations to enforce immigration and passport laws. As a result, the au-
 thorities detained more than 130,000 foreign workers and deported 50,000 of them
 in 1994.
 Following a report of numerous deaths in the detention centers in 1995, human
 rights groups and opposition politicians accused the authorities of mistreatment and
 corruption and called for an independent investigation. A government-appointed
 independent board reported that a total of 90 illegal immigrants had died in the de-
 tention centers, 22 since September 1995; all reportedly died of natural causes (see
 Sections l.a., 1.c., and 1.d.).
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 There were no reports of forced expulsions of those having a valid claim to refugee
 status. Over the past 21 years, Malaysia gave first asylum to approximately 254,000
 Vietnamese; on June 25, it closed its last camp for Vietnamese refugees. Approxi-
 mately 249,000 Vietnamese were resettled in third countries, with over haf going
 to the United States. As of December 31, 23 asylum seekers from the closed Viet-
 namese refugee camp remained in custody, the two largest subgroups being
 screened-in Vietnamese who are awaiting resettlement in third countries (8) and
 purported "stateless" individuals who claim ties with Taiwan (11).
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 By law citizens have the right to change their government through periodic elec-
 tions, which are procedurally free and fair, with votes recorded accurately. In prac-
 tice, however, it is difficult for opposition parties to compete on equal terms with
 the governing coalition (which has held power at the national level since 1957) be-
 cause of legal restrictions on campaigning, as well as restrictions on freedom of asso-
 ciation and of the press. Nevertheless, opposition candidates campaign actively and
 agree that the voting and counting of votes are relatively free and fair. The govern-
 ment coalition controls 12 of 13 states. An Islamic opposition party controls the
 northern state of Kelantan.
 Malaysia has a Westminster-style parliamentary system of government. National
 elections, required at least every 5 years, have been held regularly since independ-
 ence in 1957. In the 1995 general election the ruling coalition won an overwhelming
 victory, increasing its seats in the Parliament to 82 percent. Several members of the
 opposition cam h ave since joined the coalition, increasing the coalition's represen-
 tatio n   the Parliament to approximately 88 percent. The Malay-based United
 Malay National Organization (UMNO) party dominates the ruling National Front
 coalition. Within the UMNO there is active political debate, and there was intense
 competition in the October UMN0 party elections.
 
 
 The Parliament in 1995 passed amendments to its rules that strengthen the
 power of the Speaker and curb parliamentary procedures heavily used by the oppo-
 sition. The amendments empowered the Speaker to ban obstreperous opposition
 Members of Parliament for up to 10 days, imposed limits on their ability to pose
 supplementary questions and revisit nongermane issues, and established restric-
 tions on the tabling of questions of public importance. The amendments have re-
 stricted the opposition's ability to criticize the Government in Parliament.
 Women face no legal limits on participation in government and politics, but there
 are practical impediments. Women are represented in senior leadership positions in
 the Government in small numbers, including two cabinet-level ministers. Women
 hold 15 of 192 seats of the elected lower house of Parliament and 13 of 69 seats
 in the appointed upper house. Women also hold high-level judgeships.
 Ethnic minorities are represented in cabinet-level positions in government, as well
 as in senior civil service positions. Nevertheless, the political dominance of the
 Malay majority means in practice that ethnic Malays hold the most powerful senior
 leadership positions. Non-Malays fill 8 of the 28 cabinet posts. Ethnic Chinese lead-
 ers of a component party of the ruling coalition hold executive power in the state
 of Penang.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The National Human Rights Association publicly criticizes the Government, as do
 other NGO's, although it does not investigate except in response to individual com-
 plaints. It seeks repeal of the ISA and is reviewing opposition-controlled Kelantan's
 efforts to impose Islamic restrictions in that state.
 A number of other organizations, including the Bar Council and public interest
 groups, devote considerable attention to human rights activities. The Government
 tolerates their activities but rarely responds to their inquiries or occasional press
 statements. Officials criticize local groups for collaborating with international
 human rights organizations.
 NGO's are becoming increasingly active and critical of the Government. However,
 the authorities still accuse some NGO's of painting a negative picture of the country
 to the outside world. Although the Government did not place any restrictions on
 their activities, the Government announced that it would draw up clearer guidelines
 for registration of NGO's. Human rights monitors called on the Government to im-
 pose guidelines that make it easier for NGO's to operate.
 Observers are concerned that the Government s case against a prominent NGO
 activist under the Publications Act may inhibit the willingness and ability of NGO's
 to speak out against the Government.
 The Government has not acceded to any of the major international treaties on
 human rights, generally maintaining that such issues are internal matters. It re-
 jects criticism of its human rights record by international human rights organiza-
 tions and foreign governments, and has blocked registration of a local chapter of a
 prominent international human rights organization.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal protection of the law and prohibits discrimina-
 tion against citizens on the basis of religion, race, descent, or place of birth. Al-
 though neither the Constitution nor laws explicitly prohibit discrimination on the
 basis of sex or disabilities, the Government has made efforts to eliminate discrimi-
 nation against women and the disabled. Government policies include affirmative ac-
 tion programs for Bumiputras (i.e., Malays and Muslims).
 Women.-Government leaders have identified domestic violence as a continuing
 social ill. Between January and August, there were 514 reported cases of domestic
 violence. In a development welcomed by women's organizations, the Government
 began to implement the 1994 Domestic Violence Act. It offers a broad definition of
 domestic violence, gives powers to the courts to protect victims, and provides for
 compensation and counseling for victims. Those covered under the bill include a
 spouse, a former spouse, a child, an incapacitated adult, or any other member of
 the family. Cases of wife beating or child abuse, which had been tried under provi-
 sions of the Penal Code governing assault and battery, are now expected to come
 under the Domestic Violence Act.
 NGO's concerned about women's issues advocate legislative and social reforms to
 improve the status of women. These groups raise issues such as violence against
 women, trafficking in women and young girls, employment opportunities with equal
 pay, and greater participation by women in decisionmaking positions. Women's is-
 sues continued to receive prominent coverage in public seminars and the media.
 
 
 721
 The cultural and religious traditions of the major ethnic groups heavily influence
 the condition of women in society. In family and religious matters, Muslim women
 are subject to Islamic law. Polygyny is allowed and practiced to a limited degree,
 and inheritance law favors male offspring and relatives. The Islamic Family Law
 was revised in 1989 to provide better protection for the property rights of married
 Muslim women and to make more equitable a Muslim woman's right to divorce.
 Non-Muslim women are subject to civil law. Changes in the Civil Marriage and
 Divorce Act in the early 1980's increased protection of married women's rights, espe-
 cially those married under customary rites.
 Government policy supports women's full and equal participation in education and
 the work force. Women are represented in growing numbers in the professions, but
 women's groups argue that the level of participation is still disproportionately low.
 According to various studies, only about 1.4 percent of women currently hold deci-
 sionmaking posts. The studies also estimate that only about 5 percent of political
 decisionmakers are women. In the scientific and medical fields, women make up
 more than half of all university graduates and the total intake of women into urn-
 versities increased from 29 percent in 1970 to one-half of the student population in
 recent years. The participation of women in the labor force increased from 37 per-
 cent in 1970 to almost one-half in 1996.
 In the opposition-controlled state of Kelantan, the state government has imposed
 restrictions on all female workers, including non-Muslims. Female workers cannot
 work at night and are restricted in the dress they may wear in the workplace. The
 state government justifies these restrictions as reflecting Islamic values.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare; it
 spends roughly 20 percent of its budget on education. The Government has taken
 some steps to deal with the problem of child abuse. Parliament passed the Chil-
 dren's Protection Act in 1991, effective in 1993. The Domestic Violence Act which
 covers children, is also expected to provide protection against child abuse. In 1995
 the Justice Minister announced that the Government was considering imposing a
 mandatory death sentence for those found guilty of child abuse that resulted in
 death, but the Government has not instituted changes to that effect.
 Statistics on the extent of child prostitution are not available, but women's organi-
 zations have highlighted the problem of trafficking in underage girls. The Health
 Ministry anounced that it would work closely with the police to stamp out child
 prostitution. Brothels are frequently raided, and some brothel owners are pros-
 ecuted.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not discriminate against phys-
 ically disabled persons in employment, education, and provision of other state serv-
 ices. However, public transportation, public buildings, and other facilities are not
 adapted to the needs of the disabled, and the Government has not mandated acces-
 sibility for the disabled, through legislation or otherwise. Special education schools
 exist, but they are not sufficient to meet needs. Nevertheless, the Government as
 well as the general public are becoming more sensitive to the needs of the physically
 disabled. New commuter trains are being made wheelchair accessible. The Govern-
 ment also provides incentives for employers to offer employment opportunities for
 the disabled. The Health Minister announced plans to restructure the health care
 system toplace greater emphasis on rehabilitation of the disabled.
 Disabled persons work in all sectors of the economy, but the prevalent feeling in
 society remains that disabled people cannot work. The Government continued its ef-
 fort to register those with disabilities under four categories-blind, deaf, physical,
 and mental. As of August, however, the Government had registered only 57,844 of
 the estimated 200,000 persons with disabilities in the country. The Social Develop-
 ment Minister encouraged all disabled persons to register, as the registration proc-
 ess is a part of the Government's efforts to provide training to the disabled.
 In 1994 the Deputy Prime Minister signed the Economic and Social Commission
 for Asia and the Pacific proclamation on full participation and equality for people
 with disabilities in the region, and in response to that commitment the Government
 has taken initiatives to make public facilities more accessible to disabled persons,
 and has increased budgetary allotments for programs aimed at aiding them.
 Indigenous People.-Indigenous groups and persons generally enjoy the same con-
 stitutional rights-along with the same limitations-as the rest of the population.
 In practice, federal laws pertaining to indigenous people vest almost total power in
 the Minister of National Unity and Social Development to protect, control, and oth-
 erwise decide issues concerning them. As a result, indigenous people have very little
 ability to participate in decisions. Under the Aboriginal Peoples Act, indigenous
 people (known as Orang Asli) have no right to own land. The law does not permit
 Orang Asli in peninsular Malaysia, who have been granted land on a group basis,
 to own land on an individual basis or to receive titles to the land. In a development
 
 
 722
 welcomed by the Orang Ash community, the Social Development Ministry an-
 nounced in March that state governments, which make decisions affecting land
 rights, had agreed to issue titles to Oranjg Ash. Amendments were being drafted to
 enable Orang Asli to hold titles on an individual basis.
 In east Malaysia, although state law recognizes indigenous people's right to land
 under "native customary rights," the definition and extent of these lands are in dis-
 pute. Indigenous people in the state of Sarawak continued to protest the alleged en-
 croachment by the State or private logging companies onto land that they consider
 theirs by virtue of customary rights. A large project (Bakun dam) in Sarawak, which
 will involve resettlement of a large number of residents in the area, has raised sev-
 eral controversial questions regarding land disputes as well as potential environ-
 mental problems. NGO's and opposition politicians have called on the Government
 to address these issues before proceeding with the project.
 The indigenous people in peninsular Malaysia, who number fewer than 100,000,
 are the poorest group in the country. However, according to government officials,
 Orang Ash are gradually catching up to other citizens in their standard of living,
 and the percentage of Orang Asi who were still leading a nomadic lifestyle has
 dropped to less than 40 percent. The Government also has pointed out that the
 changes allowing Orang Ash to own land in peninsular Malaysia are expected to en-
 hance their economic standing.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government implements extensive af-
 firmative action programs designed to boost the economic position of the ethnic
 Malay majority, which remains poorer on average, than the Chinese minority de-
 spite the ormer's political dominance. Such government affirmative action programs
 and policies do, however, limit opportunities for non-Malays in higher education,
 government employment, business permits and licenses, and ownership of newly de-
 veloped agricultural lands. Indian Malaysians continue to lag behind in the coun-
 try's economic development, although the national economic policies target less ad-
 vantaged populations regardless of ethnicity. According to the Government, these
 programs have been instrumental in ensuring ethnic harmony and political stabil-
 ity. Early in the year, senior government officials reiterated the need for the pro-
 grams despite significant improvements in economic standing of the Malay popu-
 lation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By law most workers have the right to engage in
 trade union activity, and approximately 10 percent of the work force belong to trade
 unions. Exceptions include certain limited categories of workers labeled -confiden-
 tial" and "managerial and executives," as well as defense and police officials. Within
 certain limitations, unions may organize workplaces, bargain collectively with em-
 ployers, and associate with national federations.
 The Industrial Relations Act prohibits interfering with, restraining, or coercing a
 worker in the exercise of the right to form trade unions or in participating in lawful
 trade union activities. The Trade Unions Act, however, restricts a union to rep-
 resenting workers in a "particular establishment, trade, occupation, or industry or
 within 'any similar trades, occupations, or industries," contrary to International
 Labor Organization (ILO) guidelines. The Director General of Trade Unions may
 refuse to register a trade union and, in some circumstances, may also withdraw the
 registration of a trade union. When registration has been refused, withdrawn, or
 canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful association. The Government jus-
 tifies its overall labor policies by positing that a "social compact" exists wherein the
 Government, employer, and worker are part of an overall effort to create jobs, train
 workers, boost productivity and profitability, and ultimately provide the resources
 necessary to fund human resource development and a national social safety net.
 Trade unions from different industries may join together in national congresses,
 but must register as societies under the Societies Act (see Section 2.b.). On inter-
 national Labor Day, May 1, the Malaysian Labor Organization (MLO), which had
 split from the MTUC in 1990, officially merged with it again, thus reunifying the
 principal labor centers.
 Government policy discourages the formation of national unions in the electronics
 sector;, the Government believes enterprise-level unions are more appropriate for
 this sector. In mid-1996, there were six such enterprise-level unions registered in
 the electronics industry. An enterprise union can be recognized voluntarily by its
 company, or it can be certified by the Government when it is confirmed as having
 the support of 50 percent plus one of the workers in that company. Four unions
 have been recognized through certification, and two of them have negotiated collec-
 tive bargaining agreements with their employers. Restrictions on freedom of associa-
 tion in the electronics industry have been the subject of complaints to the ILO.
 
 
 723
 In one case in 1990, a company dismissed all members of one union. The union
 charged the company with union-busting and wrongful dismissal in industrial court
 in September of that year. The union appealed a May 1994 industrial court decision
 that found for the company. In August 1994, a high court remanded the case to an
 industrial court on procedural grounds for reajudication, but the company appealed
 the decision for retrial to the higher Court of Appeals. In September the Court of
 Appeals ruled in favor of the plaintiffs (the union), ordering reinstatement of all dis-
 missed employees with back wages by October 1. Although the company reinstated
 the plaintiffs as ordered, it appealed the ruling on the issue of back wages. In July
 1995, in a case involving the etal Industry Workers Union, the Ministry of Human
 Resources went to court to force an employer to disclose information necessary to
 resolve a claim of recognition-the first action of its kind.
 Unions maintain independence both from the Government and from political par-
 ties, but individual union members may belong to political parties. Although union
 officers are forbidden to hold principal offices in political parties, individual trade
 union leaders have served in Parliament as opposition members. Trade unions are
 free to associate with national labor societies that exercise many of the responsibil-
 ities of national labor unions, although they cannot bargain for local unions.
 Relations between the Government and the Malaysian Trade Union Congress
 (MTUC) remain cool. The low point was reached in 1994 when MTUC President
 Zainal Rampak and former MTUC Secretary General Dr. V. David were arrested
 and charged, along with two other labor figures, with criminal breach of trust. Some
 groups claimed that the arrests (based on events in the 1980's) and the high bail
 amount were an attempt to keep Rampak from attending international labor fo-
 rums. Ultimately, however, Rampak was given permission to travel to the ILO con-
 ference in Geneva. The accused labor figures appeared in a sessions court on No-
 vember 21, 1994 and pled not guilty to all charges. The case was postponed several
 times and is still pending. There is still considerable MTUC and international ob-
 server concern about the outcome of this trial.
 Although strikes are legal, the right to strike is severely restricted. The law con-
 tains a list of "essential services" in which unions must give advance notice of any
 industrial action. The list includes sectors not normally deemed essential under ILO
 definitions. There were 13 strikes in 1995 resulting in a loss of 4,884 workdays; the
 majority of the strikes (8) were in the manufacturing sector. The number of workers
 involved in strikes in 1995 was 1,748, down 15 percent from 1994.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to notify the Ministry
 of Human Resources that a dispute exists before any industrial action (strike or
 lockout) may be taken. The Ministry's Industrial Relations Department may then
 become actively involved in conciliation efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve a set-
 tlement, the Minister has the power to refer the dispute to the industrial court.
 Strikes or lockouts are prohibited while the dispute is before the industrial court.
 According to 1994 data, the industrial court found for labor in 62 percent of its cases
 and for management in 14 percent. The remaining 24 percent were settled out of
 court. Figures for 1995 and 1996 are not available. The Industrial Relations Act pro-
 hibits employers from taking retribution against a worker for participating in the
 lawful activities of a trade union. Where a strike is legal, these provisions would
 prohibit employer retribution against strikers and leaders. Although some trade
 unions question their effectiveness, it is not possible to assess fully whether these
 provisions are being effectively enforced, given the limited number of cases of al-
 leged retribution.
 There are three national labor organizations currently registered: One for public
 servants, one for teachers, and one for employees of state-based textile and garment
 companies. Public servants have the right to organize at the level of ministries and
 departments. There are three national joint councils representing management and
 professional civil servants, technical employees, and nontechnical workers.
 Enterprise unions can associate with international labor bodies and actively do so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-Workers have the legal right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and collective bargaining is widespread in those
 sectors where labor is organized. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by em-
 ployers against union members and organizers. Charges of discrimination may be
 filed with the Ministry of Human Resources or the industrial court. When concilia-
 tion efforts by the Ministry of Human Resources fail, critics say that the industrial
 court is slow in adjudicating worker complaints; however, other critics point out that
 the industrial court almost always sides with the workers in disputes.
 Companies in free trade zones (FTZ's) must observe labor standards identical to
 those in the rest of the country. Many workers at FTZ companies are organized, es-
 pecially in the textile and electrical products sectors. During 1993 the Government
 proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations Act to remove previous restric-
 
 
 tions on concluding collective agreements about terms and conditions of service in
 "pioneer industries." Legislation to address this issue was introduced and subse-
 quently withdrawn in late 1994 by the Ministry of Human Resources to take into
 account other developments in the labor sector. The legislation was not reintro-
 duced. The Government took these measures in part to respond to ILO criticism of
 its previous policy with respect to pioneer industries. The ILO continues to object
 to other legal restrictions on collective bargaining. Some labor leaders criticized
 amendments to the Labor Law in 1980, designed to curb strikes, as an erosion of
 basic worker rights. The labor critics contend that these changes do not conform to
 ILO standards.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no evidence that forced
 or compulsory labor occurs. In theory, certain laws allow the use of imprisonment
 with compulsory labor as a punishment for persons expressing views opposed to the
 established order or who participate in strikes. The Government maintains that the
 constitutional prohibition on forced or compulsory labor renders these laws without
 effect.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Children and Young Persons
 (Employment) Act of 1966 prohibits the employment of children younger than the
 age of 14. The Act permits some exceptions, such as light work in a family enter-
 prise, work in public entertainment, work performed for the Government in a school
 or training institution, or work as an approved apprentice. In no case may children
 work more than 6 hours per day, more than 6 days per week, or at night. Ministry
 of Human Resources inspectors enforce these legal provisions. In December 1994,
 a Japanese electronics firm was fined $5,400 for violating the Children and Young
 Persons Act. This was the first time that a large firm had been fined under the act.
 According to credible reports, child labor is still occurring in certain sectors of the
 country. A joint report by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 the Asian and Pacific Regional Organization put the child work force at 75,000.
 However, government officials maintain that the figure is outdated as it was based
 on a nationwide survey of child labor undertaken in 1980, which estimated that
 more than 73,400 children between the ages of 10 to 14 were employed full-time.
 NGO surveys indicate that most child laborers are employed on agricultural estates,
 but there are indications that some are being employed in small factories. Govern-
 ment officials do not deny the existence of child labor but maintain that child labor-
 ers have largely been replaced by foreign workers and that the Government vigor-
 ously enforces child labor provisions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but the
 Wage Councils Act provides for a minimum wage in those sectors or regions of the
 country where a need exists. Under the law, workers in an industry who believe
 that they need the protection of a minimur wage may request that a -wage council"
 be established. About 150,000 workers of the 8-million-member labor force are cov-
 ered by minimum wages set by wage councils. Representatives from labor, manage-
 ment, and the Government sit on the wage councils. The minimum wages set by
 wage councils generally do not provide for an adequate standard of living for a
 worker and family. However, prevailing wages, even in the sectors covered by wage
 councils, are higher than the minimum wages set by the wage councils and do pro-
 vide an adequate living.
 Under the Employment Act of 1955, working hours may not exceed 8 hours per
 day or 48 hours per workweek of 6 days. Each workweek must include one 24-hour
 rest period. The act also sets overtime rates and mandates public holidays, annual
 leave, sick leave, and maternity allowances. The Labor Department of the Ministry
 of Human Resources enforces these standards, but a shortage of inspectors pre-
 cludes strict enforcement. In 1993 Parliament adopted a new Occupational Safety
 and Health Act (OSHA), which covers all sectors of the economy, except the mari-
 time sector and the military. The act established a national Occupational Safety and
 Health Council, composed of workers, employers, and government representatives,
 to set policy and coordinate occupational safety and health measures. It requires
 employers to identify risks and take precautions, including providing safety training
 to workers, and compels companies having more than 40 workers to establish joint
 management-employee safety committees. The act requires workers to use safety
 equipment and to cooperate with employers to create a safe, healthy workplace.
 Trade unions maintain that relatively few committees have been established and,
 even in cases where they exist, that they meet infrequently and are generally inef-
 fective.
 There are currently no specific statutory or regulatory provisions that provide a
 right for workers to remove themselves from dangerous workplace conditions with-
 out arbitrary dismissal. Employers or employees violating the OSHA are subject to
 substantial fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years.
 
 
 Significant numbers of contract workers, including numerous illegal immigrants,
 work on plantations and in other sectors. Working conditions on plantations for
 these lab6rers compare poorly with those of direct hire plantation workers, many
 of whom belong to the National Union of Plantation Workers. Moreover, immigrant
 workers in the construction and other sectors, particularly if they are illegal en-
 trants, generally do not have access to the system of labor adjudication. Government
 investigations into this problem have resulted in a number of steps to eliminate the
 abuse of contract labor. For example, in addition to expanding programs to regular-
 ize the status of immigrant workers, the Government investigates complaints of
 abuses, endeavors to inform workers of their rights, encourages workers to come for-
 ward with their complaints, and warns employers to end abuses. Like other employ-
 ers, labor contractors may be prosecuted for violating the labor laws.
 The Government admitted that approximately 50 foreign workers died while in
 detention in 1995 but vigorously denied allegations by NGO's that detainees are tor-
 tured, are living in inhuman conditions, and are not given proper medical care. The
 Government issued new guidelines on foreign worker recruitment, and took action
 against labor contractors who violate the law. The minimum fine assessed by law
 is $8,000. In principle, serious violators can be jailed, but, in practice, such punish-
 ments are rare.
