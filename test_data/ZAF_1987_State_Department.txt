 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa's laws codify the doctrine of apartheid, which
 prescribes the basic rights and obligations of people
 according to their racial or ethnic origin. The country's
 black majority (73.4 percent of its population) suffers from
 pervasive, legally sanctioned discrimination based on race in
 political, economic, and social aspects of life. The
 "colored" (mixed-race) and Asian minorities (9.1 percent and
 2.8 percent of the population respectively) also suffer from
 extensive racial discrimination, although to a somewhat lesser
 degree than South Africa's black population. While the
 Government claims that South Africa is a parliamentary
 democracy, blacks continue to be denied the right to vote in
 national elections and to be represented in Parliament. Until
 1984 South Africa's national political institutions were
 reserved for whites (14.7 percent of the population). A new
 Constitution was implemented in 1984 that created.a tricameral
 Parliament with separate chambers for whites, coloreds, and
 Asians. The terms of the Constitution ensure continued
 parliamentary control by whites over key affairs. In
 addition, the executive branch (headed by a State President
 with strong powers) continues to be dominated by whites.
 White control of the Government is backed by a powerful
 defense and police establishment, especially the South African
 Defense Force (SADF), with over 95,000 active duty personnel
 and nearly 400,000 reservists, and the South African Police
 (SAP), with 56,000 members. In recent years the SADF has been
 used to assist the SAP in internal security matters,
 especially in patrolling the black townships. The National
 Security Management System (NSMS), established to coordinate
 intelligence services and government departments, has assumed
 greater influence in the last few years over several aspects
 of government policy designed to minimize black discontent,
 including setting levels of state of emergency detentions as
 well as providing development assistance and social services.
 Critics maintained that the NSMS, staffed primarily by police
 and military officials, was developing into a "parallel
 government," accountable only to the cabinet-level State
 Security Council. During 1987 the Government also increased
 special black security forces known as "instant police" and in
 some cases gave tacit support to conservative black vigilante
 groups.
 Central to the policy of separate, racially based political
 institutions was the creation, beginning in the 1950's, of 10
 "homelands" to which all blacks were assigned on the basis of
 ethnic background. These homelands comprise only 13 percent
 of South Africa's area and are often small, fragmented bits of
 land in impoverished rural areas. Since 1976 the Government
 has granted "independence" to four homelands, thereby forcibly
 stripping an estimated 8-million South African blacks of their
 South African citizenship. In 1987 it underscored its
 determination to move ahead with this policy by continuing to
 incorporate more black residential areas into these
 homelands. South Africa is the only country that has
 recognized the "independence" of these homelands. Since the
 late 1970's, the Government has sought to introduce gradual
 and piecemeal reforms that ameliorate some aspects of
 apartheid but do not threaten continued white control of the
 nation's key political structures. At the same time, black
 opposition to apartheid has increased dramatically. This was
 especially so after the creation of the tricameral Parliament
 in 1984, which was seen as an attempt by the Government to
 freeze blacks out of national political participation. The
 
 
 271
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Government has reacted since 1985 with increasingly stringent
 restrictions on individuals' rights and repression of
 organized black oppositiof.
 Many apartheid laws discriminate against blacks in housing,
 employment, and education, serving to perpetdat6 an-unusually-
 high income disparity between whites and blacks. Starting in
 1984, a serious economic downturn aggravated the suffering of
 black South'Africwns aPnd was a significant factor in fueling
 political unrest. In:1987'the overall economic situation
 improved,.-Withindicators sugqesting" an annual real growth
 rate of about 2,to 3 percent over the next 2 years; However;
 local econdmists have-estimated that an annual real growth
 rate above 5 percent is necessary'for the economy to absorb
 the roughly 300',O0  lack entrants to the labor market each.
 year. An even higher frate-"of growth would be-nedessary to
 reduce present black unemployment, which many private
 observers estimate-at 25 to 30 percent, and at high as 70
 percent in somB'afeas.
 The human rights situation in South Africa continued to
 deteriorate in 1987. A state of emergency, imposed in 1986
 and giving polie- and-military exbtraordinary prret -and
 detention powers, was teneWed In J-dlie 1987. 'The Government

 The level of political violence apparently declined in 1987
 from previous jear-s,' although-at least 500 people died as the
 result of suchviolence -during the year-. The shadowy' war "
 between South. African security forces and -the African National
 Congress (ANC) escalated. The banned ANC is headquartered in
 exile-in Lusaka; Zambia, while many of'its-leaders, including
 Nelson Mandela, remain 'in long-term imprisonment in South
 Africa. Throughout 1987 a number of bomb blasts, landmine
 explosions, 'and grenade attacks occurred in South Africa, many
 of which appeared to be ANC operations. 'South African
 security forces were involved n raids, "bomb attacks,
 abductions, and as:assinations directed against the ANC in
 various neighboringcountries. State President Botha appealed
 throughout the year for black leaders to enter negotiations
 with the .Government, but all credible black leaders maintained
 their-refusal to enter talks until the Government met certain
 conditions, including the release of political prisoners, the
 removal of the ban on all political organizations, and the
 lifting of the statb of emergency. In July a delegation of
 prominent,.private, white South African citizens, including
 Afrikaners, traveled to Senegal for an exchange of views with
 leaders of-the ANC on the future of South Africa--the first
 such meeting of-its kind. Throughout the year there were
 unconfirmed 'rumors of contacts between government officials
 and external ANC leaders.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political violence continued to plague South Africa in 1987,
 though apparently at reduced levels compared to the 1984-86
 period. Due to restrictions on reporting of incidents of
 unrest, independent statistics on the number of deaths related
 to political unrest were difficult to obtain. The Government
 asserted that such deaths have declined dramatically since the
 imposition of the state of emergency in June 1986. It
 claimed, for example, that in May 1987, 8 blacks died in
 unrest-related violence, a decrease of 95 percent from the
 comparable figure of 157 deaths in May 1986. Fragmentary
 statistics based on the Government's daily "unrest reports"
 and other sources indicated that at least 500 people died in
 political violence during the year, compared to 1,289 deaths
 from political violence in 1986.
 Most of the deaths in 1987 resulted from violence within the
 black townships, and the vast majority of victims were
 blacks. Much of this violence resulted from fighting between
 political factions. Overall, however, violence resulting from
 political strife within the black community was less prevalent
 than in 1986, and so-called "necklace" killings, in which the
 victim is executed by a burning tire placed around his neck,
 declined dramatically in 1987. This was mainly due to the
 state of emergency but also to strong discouragement of such
 acts by internal and external black political groups,
 including the ANC. Fragmentary statistics indicated deaths
 resulting from necklacing declined from the hundreds in 1986
 to perhaps no more than a dozen in 1987.
 Many other deaths were the result of excessive use of force by
 police, who sometimes quelled demonstrations with live
 ammunition, tear gas, birdshot, hard rubber clubs, or rubber
 bullets. In April six people were killed when police fired on
 a demonstration of striking railroad workers. During 1987 the
 Government augmented security forces by accelerating the
 recruitment of "Kitsconstabels" ("instant police"--called that
 because their training periods were short); these special
 police constables were first introduced in the black townships
 in 1986. Government critics charge that they have been
 responsible for numerous abuses. In February four people were
 shot and killed by Kitsconstabels in Grahamstown.
 Several deaths of persons in police custody occurred during
 the year, at least two of which appeared to be execution-style
 killings. In July ANC member Ashley Kriel was killed by
 police in a Cape Town home. An autopsy revealed that he had
 been shot in the back at point-blank range. In August Caiphus
 Nyoka, a high school student leader, was killed by police
 during a nighttime raid on his home in Daveyton, even though
 he had apparently offered no resistance. He had been shot in
 the forehead at close range. At the end of 1987, the
 Government had failed to provide any explanation or order any
 investigation in regard to Nyoka's death.
 In 1987 a series of court cases or out-of-court settlements
 also revealed police excesses. In February a member of the
 SAP was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment for the "unprovoked
 and.unnecessary" killing of a black youth in 1986. The
 
 
 273
 SOUTH AFRICA
 policeman had ordered the youth to run away and had then shot
 him as he ran. In:'April a court ruled that policemen in the
 Lebowa homeland were responsible for the April 1986 torture
 and deaths of two detainees, Lucky Kutumela, a journalist and
 member of the Azanian People's Organization (AZAPO), and Peter
 Nchabaleng, a Transvaal provincial offidial of the UDF. The
 postmortem report on Nchabaleng concluded that'he died after
 multiple blows with sticks or similar objects. An inquest
 magistrate found no one criminally liable for the 1985 death
 in police custody of trade unionist Andries Raditsela, but the
 Government agreed to pay compensation to Raditsela's family.
 In July the Gdvernment agreed-to pay.$650,000 to 51 people who
 were wounded or whose relatives were killed in the March 1985
 massacre of 20 blacks- in the Langa township outside
 Uitenha~e. Many of the victims, who had been demonstrating
 while on their way to a funeral, had been shot in the back.
 In September a Cape Town court exonerated two police officers,
 even though'they had admitted shooting a young girl who had
 been watching police quell an antiapartheid demonstration.
 The court excused them on the basis that they were following
 the orders of a superior (who was not charged). In October
 the trial began-in the Eastern'Cape Supreme-Court of two
 policemdn accused -of murdering two black youths in Cradock,
 near Port Elizabeth.' 'According- to eyewitness -testimony, one
 of thd youths, Mlungisi Stuurman; who was arrested for wearing
 an antiapartheid'shirt, Was tortured in a police van with a
 plastic bag, beaten, and then shot in the back of the neck.
 The most serious violence resulting from political factional
 fighting .in 1'987 took place in Natal. In particular, clashes
 between UDF supporters and Inkatha members, who support
 KwaZulu Chief-Mangosuthu Buthelezi, resulted in at least 268
 deaths during-the year in the Pietermarfitzburg area. "The
 violence around Pietermaritzburg acceldeated beginning in
 September, and-effoftsby several -groups to mediate an end to
 the violence were untuccesful as of the erd of 1987.
 In addition, as a significant minority of blacks in South
 Africa espouse or condone violent opposition to apartheid,
 there were instances Vf violence and intimidation against
 blacks who were not complying with such protest activities as
 school or rent boycotts and strikes. Attadkslby radical
 blacks-on tooiiship government officials, 'black-policemen, and
 other suspected "collaborators" continued, though at a lower
 rate than in 1986. The ANC helped fuel this violence since it
 continued to call on blacks to attack these so-called
 collaborators. The Government emphasized such intimidation as
 a justification for repressive actions against members of
 trade unions and community organizations.
 The Government also cited this intimidation as justification
 for support of, or in some cases acquiescence in, the
 activities of black vigilante groups. These groups were
 formed by conservatives for the ostensible purpose of ensuring
 neighborhood safety. In 1987 their activities increased as
 they engaged in'armed attacks on dissidents and squatter
 communities. In some cases, the police assisted or stood
 aside during such attacks and the victims usually received no
 help from the police. In January a crowd of 1,500 armed
 vigilantes attacked UDF activists near Uitenhage while police
 looked on.. Several eyewitnesses reported that police were
 directing the crowd of vigilantes to the homes of UDF
 activists. The vigilantes ransacked the homes and burned the
 possessions of theactivists in the street. In May and June,
 four UDF activists died in vigilante attacks in the Eastern
 
 
 274
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Cape. UDF supporters in Natal came under increasing attack
 during the year from vigilantes. In July four UDF supporters
 were killed by vigilantes near Pietermaritzburg. In the
 Lebowa homeland, there were reports that a vigilante group had
 been formed by the homeland's ruling party to attack
 dissidents. In the homeland of KwaNdebele, the proindependence
 Mbokotho vigilante organization continued its violent campaign
 against the opponents of independence.
 One example of the Government's support for vigilante groups
 came in April with the Cape provincial administrator's
 appointment of Johnson Ngxobongwana and six of his supporters
 as the Crossroads town committee. Ngxobongwana and his
 vigilante organization had achieved notoriety in June 1986 for
 their violent ejection of theit political opponents from the
 Crossroads squatter camp outside Cape Town with the support of
 the police. In October the Cape Town Supreme Court overturned
 this appointment and cklled on the Government to organize
 elections in the community.
 Throughout 1987 a pattern of killings and bomb blasts directed
 against antiapartheid groups and trade unions continued. One
 of the more prominent victims was Eastern Cape activist Eric
 Mntonga, who was murdered near King Williams Town in July. In
 May the headquarters building of the Congress of South African
 Trade Unions (COSATU) in Johannesburg was wrecked by a huge
 bomb explosion, and numerous other COSATU offices were
 vandalized or destroyed during the year. In August a bomb
 exploded at a building in Cape Town which housed COSATU and a
 number of antiapartheid organizations. At the end of the year
 there had been no arrests in connection with any of these
 incidents. The Government has had a number of successes in
 recent years in arresting those accused of antigovernment
 terrorist acts, but has shown an inability or unwillingness to
 pursue the perpetrators of violent acts directed against
 antiapartheid groups and persons, such as the December 1986
 murder of black political activist Dr. Fabian Ribeiro and his
 wife.
 The ANC, a revolutionary organization that since 1961 has
 openly advocated the overthrow of the South African
 Government, encouraged attacks on government offices and
 installations involved in the administration of apartheid but
 often equivocated or was silent on the question of
 responsibility for individual incidents of violence.
 Officials of the organization continued to disavow a strategy
 of deliberately hitting civilian targets. On May 20, two
 bombs exploded outside the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court,
 killing four policemen and injuring numerous bystanders. The
 ANC armed wing, Umkhonto We Sizwe, subsequently claimed
 responsibility. On July 30, another bomb exploded near the
 Witwatersrand army headquarters in central Johannesburg,
 injuring 68 people. The ANC declined comment on what, if any,
 responsibility it had for the incident.
 The ANC maintained its position that armed white farmers in
 northern border areas of South Africa constitute part of the
 Government's security establishment. There were numerous
 reports of clashes between government forces and ANC
 guerrillas attempting to infiltrate the country. The SADF
 also struck at alleged ANC targets in neighboring countries,
 including raids in Zambia in April and in Mozambique in May.
 The Government claimed in September that 220 ANC "terrorists"
 had been killed or arrested in the-first 8 months of 1987, a
 significant increase over 1986. In October the Government
 
 
 275
 SOUTH AFRICA
 arrested fl- people, charging them with involvement in a number
 of ANC-inspired-attacks ifi the Cape area. Throughout the
 year, sevefaldiozen community activists around the country
 faced charges of furthering the aims of the ANC, and most were
 convict-a.          --
 The Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), another antiapartheid
 organization in exile, also advocated violent opposition to
 the South African Government and claimed'that it had sent
 large amounts of arms into the country.
 b. Disappearafice
 In recent'years many people have disappeared, reportedly into
 police bustodk,'for long periods. Some, missing for very long
 periods of t1me, aretuspected by friends and associates to
 have been killed by security forces. South African law does
 not require-notification of a person's family, lawyer, or any
 other pbrsoi in the event of his detention or arrest, and
 prohibits the unauthorized publication of the name of any
 detainee if "th6'prevention of or combating of terroristic
 activities" is the reason for the detention.
 SinceAubust 1986, the Minister of Law and Order periodically,
 has tabled lists of state of emergency detainees in
 Parliament. These lists, which appeared to be incomplete,
 only includedzd~taihees held for at least 30-days. As of the
 end of'lB7y%'this constituted the Government's only'official
 public accdun ing'6k emergency detainees. Human rights
 monitoring'6upS estimated that substantiai numbers of
 detainees hse hot bebdrhimed in the-Governmenti's lists and
 maintained that in most cases family members were not informed
 of emergency detentions.
 Following +h6'June'1986 emergdncy'derlaration,-and in the wake
 of subsgqtnitncrackdohg'on-vari6us opposition organizations,
 many Rack activists left the country sutreptitiously or went
 into hiding to av6id detention. These circumstances further
 complicated-the task of accurately accounting for the many
 persons who:rep6rtedly have'disappeared.  Government press
 curbs imposed'ih:December'i986 prohibited news reporting oil
 detention cases and dn unrdsolved litigation concerning
 detenti6ns without prior government clearance, which rendered
 the task of accounting-for missing persons still more'
 problematic.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Security legislation, in particular the Internal Security Act
 (ISA), allows police generally unsupervised discretion in the
 arrest and detention of suspects and in the interrogation of
 detainees.- People ddtained under the ISA may receive visits
 from their attorneys and-families only at the discretion of
 the Commissioner of Police. This permission is often denied.
 The ISA alfows for lengthy periods of incommunicado detention
 during which authorities are not obliged to present formal
 charges, a situation which provides considerable potential for
 police abuse of detainees. Laws exemptfng law enforcement
 officials from both criminal and civil liability for "good
 faith" acts undertaken in enforcing the state of emergency
 have been cited by many observers as giving police a license
 to engage in'abusive conduct.
 
 
 276
 SOUTH AFRICA
 In 1986 and 1987, many persons who had been released after
 being detained under state of emergency and security
 regulations gave accounts of beatings and other abuses by
 police. One detailed 1986 survey, prepared by a medical panel
 of the Detainees' Parents Support Committee (DPSC), indicated
 that 83 perdent of 500 released detainees showed signs of some
 physical abuse. Another survey, released in April by the
 National Medical and Dental Association, found that over half
 of the ex-detainees surveyed had been physically assaulted
 while in custody.
 Many persons reported that they had been held in solitary
 confinement during their detention. Others gave accounts of
 torture by police, including applications of electric shocks
 to hands, feet, and genitals. Many former detainees in the
 Port Elizabeth area reported that police had supplemented
 routine beatings and electric shocks with repeated suffocation
 as a means of extracting information. According to their
 affidavits, police tied wet plastic or canvas bags around the
 heads of prisoners and repeatedly applied rubber innertubes
 over their noses and mouths to suffocate them, often to
 unconsciousness. Journalists and others detained in
 KwaNdebele during the year produced a number of eyewitness
 accounts detailing the apparently routine beatings suffered by
 detainees in that homeland.
 Most torture occurred during and immediately following
 arrest. The chances of physical abuse taking place apparently
 diminish once a detainee is processed and made part of the
 general inmate population. Instances of abuse in prisons,
 while not unheard of, appear to be less frequent than at
 police stations.
 Those who work with released detainees, and academics who have
 studied the issue, maintain that youthful detainees are more
 subject to beatings and other forms of torture than are older
 detainees. One academic study of 83 children released in 1987
 found that 64 of them complained of assault and one-third were
 suffering "definable psychiatric illness." In April a news
 report described the case of Trevor Makhoba, a 16-year-old
 Soweto resident who claimed he was subjected to electric
 shocks while in detention. A pathologist who examined him
 within 72 hours of release confirmed he had thermal burns on
 his fingers "consistent with electrical burns." A police
 spokesman conceded Makhoba had a "strong case."
 On August 13, 22 young people ranging in age from 14 to 20
 years were arrested in Petrus Steyn, Orange Free State, for
 their support of the South African Youth Organization. Most
 were released after 2 days. Many of them alleged they had
 been assaulted by the police while in jail, and eight of them
 have filed assault charges. On September 2, a school boycott
 was called to protest the detentions. Large numbers of police
 arrived and attacked children (some as young as 8 years of
 age) leaving the school with hard rubber clubs. Six children
 were treated for injuries, and another six arrested.
 Police and other security force members were seldom held
 accountable in 1987 for abuse of detainees. While the
 Government conceded in some cases that such abuses occurred,
 the courts often imposed only token punishments on those found
 guilty. In 1987 the Government completed an investigation of
 credible allegations by Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, Secretary
 General of the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference,
 that he had been tortured while in detention. A court
 
 
 277
 SOUTH AFRICA
 permitted one of the six accused SADF personnel to pay a small
 "admission of guilt" fine and absolved the other five
 soldiers. In October the Law and Order Minister, responding
 to the protests of Eastern Cape human rights activists,
 pledged to investigate charges of police torture of detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The ISA authorizes the Minister of Law and Order to order
 detention without trial for varying--in some instances
 unlimited--periods of time. Under Section 28 of the ISA, the
 Minister of Law and Order may issue "preventive detention"
 orders allowing for detention for up to 180 days in "unrest
 situations." Under Section 29 of the ISA, senior police
 officiils have-broad powers to detain people for interrogation
 when offenses such as terrorism, sabotage, or inciting a
 revolution, are suspected. Access to ISA detainees is severely
 restricted.
 On June 11, 1987, the Government renewed the June 1986 state
 of emergency and issued new regulations which tightened and
 extended those originally promulgated in June 1986. Under the
 revised 1987 rules, the period for which SADF members and
 police officers down to the rank of constable are empowered to
 detain persons was extended from 14 days to 30 days. Police
 station cells may be used as the place of detention for the
 first 14'days only (the previous limit was 30 days), after
 which detainees must be transferred to prison cells unless the
 Commissioner of Police grants an exception. After 30 days the
 Minister of Law and Order may extend the detention for an
 indefinite period of time, limited onlyby the duration of the
 state of emergency. In June the Government issued new rules
 concerning the treatment of state of emergency detainees,
 giving them many of the rights granted to ordinary prisoners
 awaiting trial. However, in July an appeals court reaffirmed
 that emergency detainees may be denied access to lawyers and
 have no right to a hearing before the Minister extends the
 detention.
 As in 1986, black trade union officials and members of the UDF
 were particular targets of state of emergency detentions. By
 the end of 1987, most of the national leadership of the UDF
 had been detained and it was estimated that three of every
 four detainees were members of the UDF or affiliated
 organizations. The Government has detained the executive of
 the UDF-affiliated National Educational Crisis Committee
 (NECC), an umbrella organization of parents, teachers, and
 students, which had entered into negotiations with the
 Government to end the widespread school boycotts of 1986.
 Opposition political leaders charged that many people were
 being detained under the emergency regulations on dubious
 evidence, often on the word of informers, who themselves may
 have been under pressure to accuse others.
 In April the Government acknowledged that 19,209 people had
 been detained between June 12, 1986, and April 15, 1987. It
 was unclear whether this figure included detentions of less
 than 30 days. The DPSC estimated that 30,000 people had been
 detained between June 1986 and October 1987, of whom
 approximately 8,000 were under the age of 18. According to
 government statistics, only 2,260 of these detainees had been
 criminally charged as of May 31. At the end of the year, the
 DPSC estimated a total of 1,500 people were still being
 detained under the state of emergency, with an additional 350
 held under the ISA. The Government's refusal to provide
 
 
 278
 SOUTH AFRICA
 specific statistics or complete lists of those being held made
 it difficult to confirm this or any other estimates of the
 number of detainees.
 In September the Minister of Law and Order said that
 115 children under the age of 18 were being held under the
 state of emergency and that 13 boys under the age of 17 were
 in detention under the ISA as of July 31. At the end of 1987,
 human rights groups estimated that some 250 children under the
 age of 18 were still in detention.
 Statistics on detentions failed to account fully for what
 appeared to be a common police tactic of detaining political
 activists, especially youths, and holding them for a few hours
 or overnight, during which time they were interrogated,
 threatened, and sometimes beaten. In addition, many people
 have been arrested on criminal charges during incidents of
 unrest. Human rights monitoring groups estimate that at the
 end of 1987 at least 1,500 people, many of them under the age
 of 18, were serving sentences for "public violence" as a
 result of convictions stemming from incidents of political
 unrest.
 Many political figures, community and human rights activists,
 lawyers, churchmen, trade union officials, journalists, and
 others have been detained under the state of emergency.
 Prominent figures remaining in detention at the end of 1987
 included UDF leaders Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli;
 Zwelakhe Sisulu, editor of the newspaper New Nation; law
 professor Raymond Suttner; and Eastern Cape activists Edgar
 Ngoyi, Henry Fazzie, and Mkuseli Jack.
 ANC leader Nelson Mandela, imprisoned after being convicted
 for sabotage in 1964, continued to serve a life sentence,
 despite repeated domestic and international calls for his
 release. International calls have also been made for the
 release of Zeph Mothopeng, leader of the PAC. In August the
 State President said that the renunciation of violence,
 previously an absolute condition for release of Mandela and
 other long-serving political prisoners, would be henceforth
 but one of several factors considered for a form of parole.
 In November Mandela's ANC colleague Govan Mbeki and several
 other long-serving political prisoners were freed (see
 below). State President Botha subsequently said that future
 releases of "security prisoners" would be determined by parole
 boards.
 The ISA also authorizes the Minister of Law and Order to issue
 "banning" orders severely restricting the activities of any
 person judged by the Minister to be endangering law and order,
 threatening state security, or "promoting the aims of
 communism" or an unlawful organization. According to the South
 African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR), over 1,400 South
 Africans have been banned at some time since 1950. In 1987
 the Government appeared to have abandoned the practice of
 banning persons under the ISA, possibly as a result of some
 banning orders being overturned by courts in 1986. However,
 numerous state of emergency detainees released from detention
 were subjected to restrictions on their movements and on their
 involvement in political matters. Still others, who had not
 been detained, were placed under state of emergency
 "restriction orders" which seriously curtailed their
 antigovernment activities. In December the Government placed
 stringent travel and contact restrictions on Govan Mbeki, the
 recently released ANC leader, and rallies planned in his honor
 
 
 279
 SOUTH AFRICA
 were banned. Banishment is still practiced in the
 'independent" homeland of Transkei. The DPSC reported in
 November. that 14 people are known to be banished to remote
 areas of-Transkei.
 Forced labor is not used in South Africa as a means of
 political coercion or education or as a sanction against
 political or ideological opinions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The South African judiciary is headed by the Appellate
 Division of the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein and six regional
 Supreme Courts. All judges of South Africa's higher courts .
 are white, as are the vast majority of its magistrates. They -
 are appointed to the bench by the State President. Their
 service is-until age 70, and they cannot be removed from
 office except by impeachment by-Parliament. -By tradition,
 judges of the Appeal Court and the Supreme Courts are
 appointed to the bench from the ranks of the elite corps of
 South African supreme court practitioners ("advocates").
 South Africa has an adversarial system of criminal justice
 drawn from a mixed heritage of Roman-Putch and British
 jurisprudence. Trials of lesser offenses are heard by
 magistrates, who are career employees of the civil service in
 the executive branch. More serious offenses, including
 capital crimes, are tried in the SupremeCourts.
 Determinations of guilt or innocence are made by the presiding
 judge or magistrate- There are no juries. Judges in capital
 and other serious cases are empowered to appoint two
 assessors, who. serve as factfinders and who have the power to
 overrule the presiding judge on questions of fact but not on
 questions of law. Defendants in criminal cases, including
 "political",cases, have the right to counsel, but a 1987 �
 survey showed that 80 percent of those convicted in ordinary
 criminal cases had no representation. Courts usually appoint
 counsel in capital cases where the defendant cannot afford his
 or her, own lawyer.
 Persons charged with common crimes are presumed innocent until
 proven guilty, although Parliament has modified this general
 presumption -of- innocence for many security offenses. The ISA.
 effectively places the burden of proof of innocence on an
 accused for a -number of -offenses enumerated in the Act. Both
 security-related and common crimes cases are tried in civilian
 courts. Security trials are often held in remote locations,
 far from metropolitan areas, apparently in order to reduce
 attendance at such cases by journalists, human rights
 observers, and supportersof the accused. Because of case
 backlogs, postponements, and the practice of hearing cases
 concurrently, criminal trials, and particularly security
 cases, can sometimes take months, even years, to complete.
 The power of the South African judiciary at all levels is
 circumscribed by stringent security legislation--rewritten and
 tightened in 1987--and by the jurisprudential principle of
 parliamentary sovereignty, under which judges possess no
 authority to alter, strike down, or refuse to enforce properly
 enacted acts of Parliament. Nevertheless, the courts have
 been the focal point for much litigation to counter human
 rights abuses. Since the state of emergency declaration in
 June 1986, there have been a number of legal challenges to
 both the state of emergency and to the legality of the
 detention of persons under state of emergency regulations. In
 
 
 280
 SOUTH AFRICA
 the initial months of the June 1986 emergency, the courts
 ordered a small number of detainees freed and declared some
 emergency regulations unlawful. In most cases, however, the
 Government rewrote and reissued the regulations in ways that
 effectively prevented further court challenges. Moreover, the
 courts have consistently stated that the state of emergency
 itself was lawfully declared. In some instances, the
 Government has admitted abuses and reached out-of-court
 settlements.
 While South Africa's high courts have traditionally maintained
 a high degree of integrity and independence, there were
 indications during 1987 that the Government was seeking to
 increase its political influence over the judiciary. The
 Chief Justice of the Appeals Court agreed to remain in his
 position past the mandatory retirement age of 70, apparently
 in order to prevent a more liberal justice from succeeding
 him. There was evidence that the Government was acting to
 ensure that important security-related cases were heard only
 by more conservative, progovernment judges.
 The Delmas/Pretoria "treason" trial entered its third year
 during 1987. It appeared that the Government was using the
 unprecedentedly long trial to deny liberty to important
 government opponents who are among the accused. It is
 considered the most significant security/political trial in a
 generation, involving charges of high treason, murder, and
 other security offenses against 19 defendants who are members
 of the UDF, AZAPO, and various black civic organizations.
 Charges against 3 of the original 22 accused were dismissed in
 November 1986. Three important government opponents among the
 accused, Popo Molefe, Moss Chikane, and Patrick Lekota, all
 prominent UDF officials, have been denied bail and kept in
 custody throughout the trial. In March the trial judge
 dismissed one of the two assessors for having signed a UDF
 petition. The defense motion for a mistrial in the wake of
 this unprecedented action was subsequently rejected.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The system of apartheid involves the Government in extensive
 regulation of social, personal, and family life. A person's
 identification as a member of an ethnic group or race is based
 on definitions and decisions of the Government under the
 Population Registration Act. Under this law, every child born
 in South Africa must be registered and classified according to
 race. In cases of dispute, such as when the parents' racial
 classification is not known, a racial classification board is
 empowered to weigh pseudoscientific "evidence" and to issue a
 verdict on a person's race.
 Under apartheid, association in many social settings is not a
 matter of free choice. The Separate Amenities Act allows
 public premises to be reserved for the exclusive use of
 persons of a particular race, and a substantial degree of
 social segregation, "petty apartheid," still legally exists in
 South Africa. In recent years, however, the Government has
 expanded the scope of administrative exceptions to apartheid
 laws and has allowed most restaurants, hotels, theaters,
 cinemas, private hospitals, parks, libraries, and other public
 facilities, upon application, to admit persons of all races.
 Many but by no means all private establishments have opted for
 "multiracial" status. The Government has allowed local option
 decisions on some social apartheid issues such as segregation
 
 
 281
 SOUTH AFRICA
 of business districts. Some local authorities, notably in the
 urban centers of Johannesburg and Cape Town, have used their
 limited discretion to desegregate facilities under their
 control, while others have not. By the end of the year, 55
 city governments had desegregated central business districts
 under an amendment to the Group Areas Act permitting such
 action in commercial areas.
 The Group Areas Act (GAA) of 1950 provides generally that
 certain designated areas of land can be owned or lived on only
 by individuals of specified races and that residential areas
 must generally be segregated on the basis of race. Under the
 Act, urban areas are designated for whites, coloreds, and
 Asians. Blacks are disqualified from owning and from
 occupying land in urban areas not designated for them.
 Authority to designate black urban areas is established by the
 Black Communities Development Act of 1958.
 Interracial couples must reside in the area-designated for the
 less advantaged racial group, vitiating the benefits of the
 repeal of the miscegenation laws in 1985. Notwithstanding the
 GAA, a growing number of so-called gray areas exist in some
 major cities, where blacks, coloreds, and 'Asians reside in
 technically white areas, often without government
 interference. Some private schools in white-designated areas
 admit black, colored, and Asian students. Criminal
 convictions for violations of the GAA have been rare in'recent
 years. Only 4 convictions resulted from 1,000 complaints
 filed during 1986. However, during 1987 some groups and
 individuals took it upon themselves to identify GAA violators,
 with the objective of forcing the Government to act. A deputy
 minister responsible for enforcement of the GAA told
 Parliament in 1987 that he had personally reported violations
 of the Act. In October the Government agreed in principle
 that certain residential areas might eventually be opened to
 all races upon local endorsement (with regional and national
 review provisions). It also indicated, however, that existing
 provisions of the GAA would be strictly enforced and
 reiterated that it would not permit multiracial public schools
 or seek repeal of the Separate Amenities Act.
 For blacks, even the right to reside in a segregated urban
 township is not available if one is deemed a "citizen" of one
 of the "independent" homelands. Such persons are regarded as
 aliens in "white" South Africa, and, notwithstanding their
 birth in South Africa, are subject to restrictions similar to
 those for any foreigner (see also Section 2.d. and Section 3).
 They must obtain work permits in order to reside in urban
 areas of "white" South Africa, and if they succeed in
 obtaining a work permit, they may not be accompanied by their
 spouses and children. Hundreds of thousands of such persons
 are forced by housing shortages to reside away from their
 families, often in overcrowded single-sex dormitories in urban
 areas.
 The Goverrment owns virtually all urban black township
 property and subsidizes a program of rental housing. Local
 aufhorities in the black townships administer the program and
 collect rents. In 1986 Parliament granted blacks the
 opportunity to acquire permanent land tenure in appropriate
 group areas. Previously, blacks had only been able to lease
 land for 99 years, with the lease transferable and renewable
 upon sale. At the end of 1987 only a few houses had been sold
 to blacks on a permanent tenure basis, apparently due to
 bureaucratic delays.
 
 
 282
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Many urban townships are lacking in some or all modern
 amenities, such as electricity and running water, but continue
 to become more crowded as rural poverty drives many people to
 seek jobs in urban centers. The restricted amount of land
 available in the townships has driven up prices for housing
 lots and led to corruption among township officials
 controlling the allocation of these lots. Some declared
 townships are little more than permanent shantytowns with
 "houses" constructed of fiberboard and corrugated iron. The
 lack of housing for blacks also has led to the development of
 large squatter communities. A report by the Black Sash
 organization estimated that some 5 million South African
 blacks were without adequate shelter. Townships are often
 located at extraordinarily long commuting distances from
 cities, where most employment opportunities for South Africa's
 blacks are found.
 The Land Acts of 1913 and 1936 limit rural land to white
 occupation, except for farm laborers whose numbers and freedom
 of movement are regulated by a number of other acts. In
 addition to the GAA, these Acts are the chief statutory bases
 for the South African Government's practice of "forced
 removals." Under these laws over the last three decades, the
 Government has forcibly reclocated black South Africans from
 "white" land, often to areas in the homelands with inadequate
 infrastructure and insufficient land and water for profitable
 agriculture. The South African Council of Churches (SACC) has
 estimated that since 1961, the Government has forcibly
 resettled approximately 3.5 million blacks, coloreds, and
 Asians. Government figures issued in 1984 asserted that 2
 million blacks had been resettled since 1960. In early 1985,
 the Government announced a suspension of forced removals in
 favor of a policy of negotiating with affected communities on
 relocation issues. However, in July 1987, the State President
 qualified this "no forced removals" pledge in a letter stating
 that there would be no forced removal "unless it is
 accompanied with the provision of better living conditions."
 In some situations, however, the Government has engaged in
 effectively coercive removals by refusing to maintain the
 infrastructure of black communities it seeks to remove and
 engaging in physical threats and aggressive actions aimed at
 convincing reluctant people to "agree" to move.
 On December 2 the Government forcibly removed some 600 people
 from Noordhoek (near Cape Town) to a tent city in
 Khayelitsha. Although the Government labeled them
 "squatters," some of the families removed had been in
 Noordhoek for generations. Most lost their jobs in Noordhoek
 as they were no longer close enough to commute. At the end of
 1987, human rights groups were concerned that the Government
 planned to forcibly remove several other "squatter"
 communities around the country.
 The Government continued its efforts to move the 8,000
 remaining residents of the 60-year-old black community of
 Oukasie, near the town of Brits, to a site near the
 Bophuthatswana border. Many of these people opposed removal
 on the suspicion that the community where they would be
 resettled would eventually be incorporated against their will
 into the "independent" homeland of Bophuthatswana, a move that
 could strip them of their South African citizenship. In the
 case of the people of the Mogopa clan, whose situation had
 become desperate since their forced resettlement on arid land
 in 1984, the displaced clan threatened to march en masse to
 reoccupy their former land. The Government offered to find a
 
 
 283
 SOUTH AFRICA
 mutually acceptable- alternative site, and at the end of 1987
 negotiations continued.
 Studies completed during 1987 indicated that the Government's
 policy of settling blacks on arid land far from population
 centers was beginning to have serious consequences in the area
 of nutrition as well as housing. The Operation Hunger
 organization, in a survey of malnutrition, reported that South
 African rufal blacks, particularly those in the "independent"
 homelands, may be more impoverished than rural Africans in
 neighboring countries..
 Various laws give police the authority in specific
 circumstances to enter homes without a warrant, including
 situations where an officer has xeason to believe a warrant
 would be issued but the delay caused by first obtaining the*
 warrant would defeat.the purpose of the search. In practice,
 police often enter and search homes of black activists as a
 means of intimidation.
 Section.2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 During 1987 the Government took a number of measures to
 further restrict both the local and foreign press., Despite
 these restrictions, some-segments of Sbuth Africa's largely
 white-owned press.continued, when possible, to engage in at
 times vigorous criticism of the Government and its policies.
 State of emergency regulations impair freedom of expression
 and press by making "subversive statements" a criminal offense
 (e.g., encouraging srikei, boycotts, oi the promotion of
 disinvestment). The regulations also ban television coverage,
 still photography, sketching, and radio recording from areas
 covered by the state of emergency. Media may not report on
 police .or security force operations in "unrest situations,"
 except'as inf6rmation, always limited, is released by the.
 Government. Penalties for infractions include fines up to
 $8,000 and imprisonment up to 10 years.
 In December 1986, the Government issued an even tighter set of
 press restrictions which make it a criminal offense to publish
 material on political unrest, detention cases, the treatment
 of detainees, and various types of political activity without
 prior government clearance. These restrictions greatly
 reduced media coverage, particularly through television, of
 political unrest.
 In 1987 the Government repeatedly threatened to take action
 against the press, particularly what it calls the "alternative
 media," a group of mostly liberal newspapers, including
 church-sponsored weeklies, not associated with the major
 establishment publishing houses. In August new regulations
 streamlined the method by which publications can be censored
 and gave .the Minister of Home Affairs the power to close a
 publication for up to 3 months. These new measures further
 curbed the ability of journalists to report on activities such
 as-labor Zisputes, "extraparliamentary" organizations, and
 life and thought in the black community. The latest
 xega-ations.,are sufficiently vague to create an atmosphere of
 uncertainty among journalists, resulting in a situation in
 which self-censorship is rife, and many newspaper editors must
 surrender ultimate editing responsibility to their lawyers.
 While-there were no known convictions of journalists in 1987
 under the various laws or regulations, some were detained (see
 Section l.d.). In addition, journalists have experienced
 
 
 284
 SOUTH AFRICA
 various forms of harassment, including the theft of personal
 papers and stoning of their houses.
 The Government also impeded the flow of information from South
 Africa by refusing visa requests by foreign journalists or by
 subjecting them to inordinate delays. In early 1987, the
 Government refused to grant a visa for anyone to replace the
 departing New York Times correspondent; the paper subsequently
 hired a South African citizen. In May American correspondent
 Steve Mufson was expelled from South Africa, and Detroit Free
 Press correspondent David Turnley was ordered to leave in
 November. The Government reported that 238 foreign
 journalists had been refused new or renewed visas during the
 July 1986-May 1987 period.
 Under the Publications Act (applicable to most periodicals,
 with the exception of newspapers), the importation,
 possession, and publication of politically or morally
 "undesirable" works is prohibited. Materials subject to
 censorship include those found to be "indecent or obscene,"
 "blasphemous," or "prejudicial to the safety of the State."
 Committee decisions are subject to review by a Publications
 Appeal Board. The board's decisions are not subject to
 judicial review, except in rare instances.
 The Government exercises a near monopoly on television and
 radio broadcasting through the state-owned South African
 Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). With some exceptions, SABC
 reflects progovernment viewpoints both in its news reporting
 and editorial policy. While the Government professes that
 SABC is politically independent, a wide range of the political
 spectrum, from the liberal Progressive Federal Party to the
 right-wing Conservative Party, characterizes the SABC as an
 editorial arm of the ruling National Party. In August the
 State President personally intervened to change a television
 news story concerning the resignation of colored Labor Party
 leader Allan Hendrickse from the Cabinet.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The ISA seriously obstructs freedom of assembly, as it gives
 magistrates the power to ban or impose conditions on the
 holding of public meetings and to close off areas to the
 public to prevent prohibited gatherings. A ban on all outdoor
 gatherings except sports events or specially authorized
 meetings, in effect since 1976, was renewed again in 1987.
 Also banned are indoor meetings of many antigovernment
 organizations, including the UDF, AZAPO, the Release Mandela
 Campaign, and the DPSC. In 1987 tighter restrictions were
 placed on funerals of political activists or victims of
 unrest, limiting the number of mourners and prohibiting
 political speeches. Police frequently arrested persons in
 townships on charges of participating in illegal gatherings.
 The Government also maintained a ban on a number of important
 political organizations, including such as the PAC, the ANC,
 and the Congress of South African Students.
 During 1987 the Government continued a policy of hindering the
 UDF by detaining key leaders. Although the movement contains
 elements that adhere to the more revolutionary values of the
 ANC, most UDF member organizations advocate nonviolent
 political and social change. In October 1986, the Government
 declared the UDF an "affected organization," meaning it could
 no longer receive funds from abroad. This action was
 subsequently overturned by a court ruling, and the
 
 
 285
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Government's appeal of this decision was still pending at the
 end of 1987.
 A number of protest demonstrations on college campuses were
 forcibly dispersed by police, resulting in many injuries and
 arrests. In October the Minister of National Education and
 Culture announced new regulations requiring universities to
 curb.antiapartheid protests on their campuses as a condition
 for continued state funding. Several prominent university
 officials-rejected these conditions as representing
 unacceptable restrictions on free speech, peaceful assembly,
 and academic freedom, and many students, mostly at
 English-speaking universities, demonstrated against the
 regulations.
 The South African Labor Relations Act recognizes the right of
 employees to form and to join trade unions and to engage in
 collective bargaining. In 1987 more than 2 million workers
 were union members in a labor force of 12 million. Slightly
 over a million of these union members were black, compared to
 about 100,000 black union members in 1979, before blacks were
 granted full status as employees and allowed to form trade
 unions.
 The Labor Relations Act does not cover the approximately 2
 -million farm workers and domestic servants (about one-sixth of
 the total labor force). These workers, nearly all of whom are
 black, enjoy few protections under the law. With the
 qualified exception of KwaZulu. none of the homelands has
 labor legislation to match the post-1979 reforms passed by the
 South African Parliament. Ciskei and Transkei have-banned-,a
 major tradetunion active in the Eastern Cape (the South
 African.Allied Workers Union), and Bophuthatswana has
 prohibited unions headquartered elsewhere from operating in
 its territory.
 The right to strike under the Labor Relations Act is qualified
 by a mandatory prestrike conciliation process that can take as
 long as,2 months to complete. Nearly all strikes in recent
 years have been staged by black unions, and most of them have
 been technically illegal. In certain circumstances, an
 employer may fire a striker (whether the strike is legal or
 illegal) on grounds-of breach of the person's employment .
 contract. A 1985 opinion of the Industrial Court, however,
 significantly improved the position of legal strikers. In
 June 1987, the Industrial Court ruled that employees taking
 part in "work stayaways" (such as one called to mark Soweto
 Day on June 16) were not acting illegally as long as they did
 not make economic or political demands on the employer.
 In September the Government tabled before Parliament the
 proposed labor relations amendment bill. Trade union leaders
 feared that this legislation would make legal strikes more
 difficult by giving state labor inspectors authority to
 indefinitely-extend the period of conciliation (during which a
 strike would not be legal).at the request of one of the  -
 parties in the dispute. The proposed amendments would also
 outlaw sympathy strikes and boycotts and weaken the power of
 the Industrial Court, which has a reputation for fairness.
 This toughened legislation was seen as a response to a wave of
 -strikes in the first half of 1987. A strike of several months
 by some 17,000 black workers against the government-owned
 South African Transport Services was marked by violence and
 destruction of property. In August approximately 250,000
 
 
 286
 SOUTH AFRICA
 black mine workers engaged in a 3-week wage strike, the
 largest work stoppage in South African history. Although the
 National Union of Mineworkers failed to obtain the wage
 increases it demanded, the massive strike demonstrated the
 ability of black trade unions to mobilize workers and
 articulate grievances.
 South African trade unions are independent of the Government.
 A few of them have links with a political party or movement,
 including the all-white South African Confederation of Labor,
 with about 100,000 members, which is widely believed to have
 ties to the right-wing Herstigte Nasionale Party (HNP);
 COSATU, which is a de facto ,ally of the UDF; and the United
 Workers Union of South Africa, which is associated with
 Inkatha. The Government does not prohibit trade union
 relations with the international labor movement, but none of
 the South African labor federations have chosen to affiliate
 with any international labor organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 South Africa has a wide variety of religious denominations,
 and the Government generally respects freedom of worship.
 Religious organizations are allowed to hold meetings and other
 activities without interference as long as they do not
 seriously challenge government policies. As with other
 aspects of South African life, churches are often divided
 along racial lines, but many churches (including a growing
 number of white churches) challenge apartheid on moral
 grounds. The Defense Act provides alternative service options
 for religious objectors to national military service (whites
 only are drafted). However, End Conscription Campaign (ECC)
 activists maintain that such options are granted only rarely,
 and that members of mainstream Christian churches never
 qualify for these alternatives. Conscientious objectors on
 nonreligious grounds continue to be subject to a maximum
 6-year sentence for refusing to serve.
 The Government is often at odds with a number of the country's
 church leaders, some of whom are outspoken critics of the
 apartheid system. These include Anglican Archbishop of Cape
 Town Desmond Tutu; Rev. Allan Boesak, President of the World
 Alliance of Reformed Churches; and Archbishop Denis Hurley,
 Head of the Catholic Archdiocese of Durban. Some church
 leaders, most notably Archbishop Tutu, have openly advocated a
 range of actions by the international community against South
 Africa. Such remarks drew heavy criticism from government
 officials.
 Churchmen have been frequent targets of detention, nearly
 always without charge, both by South African authorities and
 by police in the "independent" homelands. Sister Bernard
 Ncube, President of the Federation of Transvaal Women, was
 released in October after 16 months in detention. Dean Simon
 Farisani of the Evangelical Lutheran Church was released from
 detention in February but has remained abroad, fearing that he
 would be restricted to the "independent" homeland of Venda
 upon his return to South Africa. In March Father James
 Paulsen, an American citizen, was released by the authorities
 in Transkei, where he had been held without charge since
 December 1986. Father Paulsen reported that he had been
 tortured by Transkeian police during his detention. In
 October Rev. Abram Maja, Executive Secretary of the Northern
 Transvaal Council of Churches, was-acquitted after being
 charged with possession of subversive documents. Rev. Maja
 
 
 287
 SOUTH AFRICA
 had spent over 1 year in-detention, however, before having the
 opportunity to defend himself in court.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Since the repeal of the pass laws in 1986, black South African
 citizens'are no longer required to-carry government-issued
 passes in order to prove to law enforcement officers their
 right to be present in an urban area. While this represented
 a significant reform, some government critics charge that a de
 facto system of influx control has been-maintained through
 urban housing shortages, antisquatting laws, and sanctions
 against employers who hire "illegal aliens" from the four
 "independent" homelands. Regulations requiring "citizens" of
 "independent" homelands to obtain work permits for employment
 in the rest of South Africa could provide a basis for future
 "deportations" of large-numbers of people to the "independent"
 homelands.
 Assignments of blacks to homelands take place irrespective of
 the wishes of those assigned and without regard to the fact
 that they may not have been born,-mor ever lived in or even
 visited, their putative homeland. When a homeland is granted
 "independence" by the Government, blacks assigned to that
 homeland lose their -outh African citizenship and receive the
 "citizenship" of the homeland. An estimated 8 million blacks
 'have lost South African citizenship under this'policy by South
 African legislation granting "independence" to four
 homelands: Transkei (1976); Bophuthatswana (1977); Venda
 (1979); and Ciskei (1981). Other homelands may be moving
 toward such spurious "independence" (-see Section 3). -
 In 1986 a new law provided for "restoration" of South African
 citizenship -to a limited class of blacks who were
 denationalized as a result of homeland "independence"
 grants--those with "permanent residence' rights in South
 Africa. The Goverriment has estimated that this reform will
 apply only to about 1.75 million of the 4 million "Citizens"
 of "independent" homelands Tesiding outside those homelands.
 South Africans must possess valid travel documents in order to
 travel abroad ox to emigrate legally. These documents
 generally are not difficult for whites to obtain, although
 some white antiapartheid activists Aiave been denied
 passports. Blacks assigned to an "independent" homeland
 usually experience difficulty in obtaining South African
 passports as the Government takes the position that they are
 not citizens of South Africa. In some instances, this has the
 effect of-deterring international travel as some blacks refuse
 to travel on a homeland-passport,-insisting that the
 Government rerognize them as citizens of South Africa. In
 1982 the Rand Supreme Court ruled that-the Minister of Home
 Affairs has the absolute discretion to revoke a passport
 -without giving any reasons for his action. The Government
 often refuses passports to persons whom it regards as
 radically critical of the status quo, e.g., in May to a number
 of South Africans planning to attend a World Council of
 Churches conference in Lusaka (including UDF Co-President
 Albertina Sisulu and Bishop Solomon Serote of the Evangelical
 Lutheran Church), and in September to Jay Naidoo, Secretary
 General of COSATU, and several other prominent persons invited
 to a major conference on South Africa in the United States.
 Although South Africa is not a party to international
 conventions on -refugees, the Government provides informal
 
 
 288
 SOUTH AFRICA
 sanctuary to as many as 225,000 Mozambicans displaced by civil
 strife. These refugees are allowed to remain in the homelands
 of KaNgwane and Gazankulu or work as farm laborers in the
 eastern Transvaal. Those Mozambicans outside these areas
 without permission who are apprehended are forcibly
 repatriated to Mozambique without an interview to determine
 whether they are refugees and whether they can be safely
 returned. The Government reports it returns up to 1,800
 Mozambicans per month. It is not known how many of these are
 refugees and how many are economic migrants. Relief
 assistance in the homelands is provided by South African
 private and voluntary organizations as well as by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the
 Government permits access by international observers to areas
 where these refugees are found.
 The Government has taken harsh measures to prevent the entry
 of more Mozambicans. It erected an electrified fence,
 reportedly without warning signs, along the South African
 border with Mozambique. In 1987 at least 40 people were
 electrocuted while trying to enter South Africa.
 The SACC estimates the total number of South African exiles to
 be 250,000 or more. The number of South Africans who are
 officially registered as refugees in neighboring countries and
 benefit from assistance from the U.N. High Commisioner for
 Refugees has not grown significantly since 1985 and remains
 approximately 22,000. Most of these refugees are affiliated
 in some way with one of the antiapartheid organizations in
 exile.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The extent to which South African citizens have the right to
 change their government democratically depends on race. The
 majority of them, the blacks, have no such right. The new
 Constitution created a tricameral Parliament with separate
 chambers for whites, coloreds, and Asians. Officially
 registered political parties may operate freely. The
 respective groups are represented in the tricameral Parliament
 on a racial ratio of 4/2/1--white/colored/Asian. Members of
 each house are elected from separate, racially based voter
 rolls. Each house has primary responsibility for its "own
 affairs," i.e., legislation affecting its own racial
 constituency. The State President has complete discretion to
 decide which issues of general concern are to be treated by
 all three chambers. If the three chambers fail to reach
 consensus on legislation that has been declared to be "general
 affairs," the bill may be referred to the President's Council,
 an appointed body composed of whites, coloreds, and Asians,
 for a ruling. If the bill is ruled on favorably by the
 President's Council, the bill is deemed to have been passed by
 Parliament. The ruling white National Party controls the
 President's Council. The lines between "own affairs" and
 "general affairs" are not always precise. Matters that are
 usually considered general affairs include foreign policy,
 defense, national security, and black affairs. Education is
 normally dealt with as an "own affair" but is subject to
 general laws prescribing norms and standards for salaries,
 curriculum, and examinations.
 The terms of the new Constitution and the existence of a white
 majority in Parliament ensure control by the white House of
 Assembly over key general affairs. While there is opposition

 SOUTH AFRICA
 in the House of Assembly, the majority National Party has
 controlled South African political power and legislative
 affairs since its first parliamentary victory in 1948. Within
 the National Party, opinions on reform of the apartheid system
 range from moderate to reactionary. Internal differences are
 in theory resolved in party caucuses, but in practice the
 State President, who is also the National Party leader,
 resolves disputes. In elections in May among white voters,
 the ruling National Party won 123 of the 166 white House of
 Assembly seats. The Conservative Party replaced the
 Progressive Federal Party as the official opposition, gaining,
 along with the far right-wing HNP, 30 percent of the total
 vote.
 In August Allan Hendrickse, leader of the colored House of
 Representatives, resigned his cabinet position to protest
 delays in repealing apartheid laws and threatened to veto the
 Government's plan to delay the 1989 "white election" until
 1992. At the end of. 1987, Indian House of Delegates leader
 Amichand Rajbansi was the only non-Afrikaner member of the
 Cabinet.
 Political participation for. blacks, who have no representation
 in Parliament, remains limited to a franchise in their
 respective homelands or, in the case of urban blacks, to a
 franchise enabling them to vote for black local government
 officials. -In 1987 the SAG continued to be committed to the
 "grand apartheid" scheme of eventually giving "independence"
 to more homelands. The Government announced agreement in
 September between it and representatives of Lebowa, QwaQwa,
 Gazankulu, and KwaNdebele to give more autonomy to these
 homelands. in December the Government announced that the
 large black township of Botshabelo, near Bloemfontein, had
 been incorporated into the homeland of QwaQwa. According to
 opinion polls, residents of Botshabelo had strongly opposed
 this move. At the end of the year, rumors persisted that
 QwaQwa was also slated for "independence," but there was no
 official confirmation of this.
 KwaNdebele had been slated in December 1986 to be the fifth
 homeland to become "independent." The Government reassessed
 these plans, however, because of continuing political violence
 in the homeland and revelations of extensive corruption and
 criminal allegations against George Mahlangu, the KwaNdebele
 Chief Minister. At the end of the year the issue was still
 unresolved, and the situation in KwaNdebele remained tense.
 In December the Government announced that the township of
 Ekangala near Pretoria had been transferred to KwaNdebele.
 More than 10 million blacks live in townships near white urban
 areas. The only voting rights they are able to exercise are
 those granted under the Community Councils Act of 1977 and the
 Black Local Authorities Act of 1982. The latter Act elevated
 the formal status of black municipal authorities to that
 enjoyed by white municipal governments. However, black local
 governments still face critical problems of inadequate
 financial resources and lack of political credibility.
 Although violence against black town councillors decreased in
 1987, they continued to be viewed by most blacks as
 collaborators with the Government. In many areas, seats on
 town councils remained vacant due to community opposition, and
 many who did serve on these bodies were forced to live in
 guarded, fortified compounds. In late 1987, the Government
 claimed that 85 percent of local black authorities were fully
 functioning.

 The Government has proposed some formulas to give blacks a
 limited role in the political process. Legislation in 1985
 replaced all-white provincial councils, which oversee
 utilities and other local services, with multiracial Regional
 Services Councils (RSC's), with no racial group to hold more
 than 50 percent of the seats. The Government, however, has
 failed to draw any blacks with popular support into the
 RSC's. Representation on the RSC's is allocated according to
 the amount of utilities the various areas consume, a formula
 which results in black areas receiving only a small percentage
 of the seats. In 1987 the Government- proposed a national
 council, a body to which blacks would be elected or appointed
 to serve in an advisory capacity regarding a new
 constitutional political structure for South Africa. The
 national council has been denounced by all major
 extraparliamentary groups as a device to give the appearance
 but not the reality of power sharing. At the end of 1987, a
 parliamentary committee was reviewing the proposal with
 particular regard to the disproportionate representation
 envisioned in the original bill, which would leave whites in
 control of the council.
 In November the Government launched the Natal/KwaZulu Joint
 Executive Authority (JEA), which will administer various
 government services in the province, but will not exercise any
 legislative powers. Some observers saw the JEA as the first
 step towards a multiracial provincial legislature, such as
 envisioned in the Indaba (see below), while others
 characterized it as a move to preempt the Indaba.
 The Indaba--a convention representing all racial groups and a
 wide range of social and political organizations--met for
 several months in 1986 to formulate proposals for a new
 constitution for a unified KwaZulu/Natal. It was initiated by
 politicians outside the Government, and the ruling National
 Party had observers but no participants in the Indaba. The
 proposals provide (among other provisions) for a bill of
 rights, firm constitutional guarantees of individual
 liberties, and a universal franchise to elect a bicameral
 legislature. The Government has not endorsed the Indaba
 proposal but has yet to make a formal cabinet response.
 Indaba leaders are continuing with plans for a widespread
 education campaign among the voters (of all races) of KwaZulu
 and Natal, leading eventually to a referendum on the proposals.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government extends little cooperation to various United
 Nations bodies or private organizations attempting to
 investigate the Government's human rights record. During 1987
 the Government permitted the International Commission of
 Jurists to send a delegation to investigate the human rights
 situation in South Africa. The Government refused numerous
 requests by foreigners to meet with Nelson Mandela.
 Since the October 1986 vote of an International Red Cross
 conference in Geneva to expel a South African government
 delegation from the conference, the Government has permitted
 the ICRC to maintain only a reduced staff in South Africa.
 The ICRC continues to negotiate with the Government for access
 to all prisoners arrested for security-related offenses,
 including those detained under the state of emergency. In
 1987 the ICRC did not visit any category of prisoners,
 
 
 291
 SOUTH AFRICA
 includin? those several hundred security prisoners who were
 visited in previous years.
 Many South African organizations bbserve, report, and contest
 human rights violations in the country. In addition to black
 political organizations, the Lawyers for Human Rights, the
 Black Sash, thb Legal Resources Center, the SACC, the DPSC,
 the ECC, the Center for Applied Legal Studies, the Human
 Rights Trust in Port Elizabeth, and other groups are actively
 involved in a wide range of human rights issues and assist
 persons who suffer from the application of apartheid and
 security laws. The annual report of the SAIRR is a key source
 on human rights questions in South Africa. In December 1986,
 the Goyernment entered restriction orders against a number of
 Black Sash, DPSC, and ECC leaders, prohibiting them from
 engaging in certain types of political activity.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social status
 South Africa's black majority and, to a somewhat lesser
 extent, the colored and Asian communities, suffer from
 pervasive, legally sanctioned discrimination based on race in
 political, economic, and social aspects of life. For example,
 in the area of education, according to SAIRR, per capita
 expenditure for education during 1984-85 was 6.22 times
 greater for whites than for blacks. In 1987 the Government.
 announced a 40 percent increase in spending for black
 education, but reiterated that separate educational facilities
 would be maintained. Black enrollment at "white" universities
 has been growing slowly. After the 1984-86 political unrest,
 which disrupted education in many of the country's townships,
 most black students ended their school boycotts in 1987.
 Security forces maintained a strong presence around schools in
 many of the major townships, and student activists were often
 harassed or detained.
 In August Parliament removed the last statutory authorization
 of racially based job reservation by repealing a law which had
 reserved 13 categories of skilled and supervisory occupations
 in the mining industry for whites. However, the draft
 regulations to replace these provisions would still severely
 limit the number of blacks-who could compete for these
 positions by imposing language, citizenship, and education
 requirements.
 Women of all races in South Africa suffer varying degrees of
 legal, cultural, and economic discrimination, most of which is
 based on tradition rather than codified in law. Women
 traditionally earn lower wages than men and are generally
 underrepresented in the country's political and business
 establishment. No women presently serve as ministers in the
 Government. Two women serve as members of the State
 President's Council. Five of the 178 seats in the
 Parliament's white House of Assembly are held by women. The
 colored House of Representatives has two women members, and
 the Asian House of delegates has one. Women have generally
 achieved more success in electoral politics at the local than
 at the national level.
 Black women suffer not only from extensive legal
 discrimination under South Africa's system of apartheid, but
 also from other legal disabilities based on sex. Black women
 are regarded by South African law as perpetual minors.
 Maternity benefits are not guaranteed to women of any race
 
 
 292
 SOUTH AFRICA
 under South African law, and pregnancy is a legal basis for
 dismissal from a job. A women's rights movement has taken
 hold in South Africa, and women's organizations, often
 multiracial, have been at the forefront of the struggle
 against both race and sex discrimination.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Government released the following unemployment statistics
 in 1987: whites, 3.5 percent; coloreds, 10.7 percent; Asians,
 10.8 percent; and blacks, 17.5 percent (not including the
 "independent" homelands, where unemployment is much higher).
 Many private observers believe that this greatly understates
 actual unemployment, as many blacks do not register as
 unemployed. Private estimates of total black unemployment
 (including the homelands) are in the 25 to 30 percent range.
 In some areas, especially in the eastern Cape, black
 unemployment rates are dramatically higher, reaching over 50
 percent.
 The Labor Relations Act of 1956 provides a mechanism for
 negotiation between labor and management to set industry-by-
 industry minimum wage standards. At present, some 101
 industries come under the provisions of the Act. There is no
 universal minimum wage in South Africa. The Occupational and
 Safety Act prohibits the employment of minors under the age of
 16 in certain industries. The Act also sets forth minimum
 standards for employment, including a standard workweek of 46
 hours in most industries, as well as vacation and sick leave.
 The Machinery and Occupational Safety Act mandates minimum
 standards for the design and use of certain types of
 industrial machinery and the standards are enforced.
