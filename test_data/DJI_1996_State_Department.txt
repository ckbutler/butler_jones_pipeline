 DJIBOUTI
 Despite 1992 constitutional changes that permitted the creation of four political
 parties, President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and the People's Rally for Progress
 (RPP), in power since independence in 1977, continued to rule the country.
 Djibouti's two main ethnic groups are the politically predominant Issa (the tribe of
 the President which is of Somali origin) and the Afar (who are also numerous in
 Ethiopia and Eritrea). The Afar comprise the largest single tribe in Djibouti but are
 outnumbered by the Issa and other Somali clans (Issak and Gadabursi) taken to-
 gether. The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 In 1994, the Government and a faction of the Afar-led Front for the Restoration
 of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) signed a peace accord, ending 3 years of civil war.
 As part of the accord, the Government agreed to recognize the FRUD as a legitimate
 political party. The Government named two FRUD leaders to key cabinet posts in
 1995, but no Afar has been named since then. The FRUD was legalized in March
 but a party congress had not been held by year's end. The other two officially recog-
 nized opposition parties, the Party for Democratic Renewal (PRD) and the National
 
 
 Democratic Party (PND), do not hold parliamentary seats, in large part because the
 PND boycotted the 1992 legislative elections. As a result, the RPP won all 65 par-
 liamentary seats. With the reelection of President Gouled in 1993, it now holds all
 significant government posts as well.
 The 8,000-member National Police Force (FNP) has primary responsibility for in-
 ternal security and border control and is overseen by the Ministry of Interior. The
 Ministry of Defense controls the army and the gendarmerie, and a small intelligence
 bureau reports directly to the President. Civilian authorities generally maintain ef-
 fective control of the security forces, but there were instances in which the security
 forces acted independently of the Government's authority, and some members com-
 mitted a number of human rights abuses.
 Djibouti has little industry; services and commerce provide most of the national
 income, which is largely generated by the foreign expatriate community of 12,000,
 including 3,300 French soldiers, and the state-controlled maritime and commercial
 activities of the Port of Djibouti, the airport, and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railroad.
 Only a few mineral deposits exist in the country, and the arid soil is unproductive-
 only 10 percent is pasture and 1 percent is forested. People are free to pursue pri-
 vate business interests and to hold personal and real property. That part of the
 gross national product that benefits citizens (and thus excludes the expatriates) is
 estimated at about $250 per capita.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor despite a limited
 multiparty political system. Members of the security forces committed several
 extrajudicial killings. There were credible reports that some members of the security
 forces beat detainees and denied proper medical treatment to some inmates. The
 Government continued to harass, intimidate, and imprison opponents. It continued
 to arrest and detain persons arbitrarily, holding them beyond the 48 hours per-
 mitted by law, and to infringe upon citizens' right to privacy. The judiciary is not
 independent of the executive. The Government permitted freedom of the press but
 cracked down heavily on union leaders and politicians critical of the President. Dis-
 crimination against women persists, and the practice of female genital mutilation
 continued to be nearly universal. Discrimination against ethnic minorities persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--Security forces were responsible for
 at least five extrajudicial killings. On January 9, while trying to break up a student
 demonstration over nonpayment of scholarships, the FNP in Ali Sabieh shot and
 killed 16-year-old Mohamed Idriss. Security forces killed two inmates at Djibouti's
 main Gabode prison during a February 3 riot over poor prison conditions (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). On May 2, the FNP in Djibouti City shot and killed a bystander while
 breaking up a demonstration over the detention of the Government's former Treas-
 urer. The Government has not punished the perpetrators of any of these killings.
 In January there was a credible report that 26-year-old Mohamed Abdillahi Ismail
 died in his prison cell after not receiving treatment for tuberculosis. There were po-
 litical undertones in the July 13 death in custody of Mohamoud Mohamed Ali; Ali
 was a potential witness in a criminal case against a former high-ranking politician,
 Moumin Bahdon Farah. The Government claimed that Ali died from tuberculosis.
 There was no police investigation and only a superficial autopsy. Another prisoner
 died from tuberculosis due to official negligence (see Section i.e.).
 There were no developments regarding the 1995 killings of Randa's religious lead-
 er, Ali Houmed Souleh, and an associate, Said Aramis. The Government continued
 to hold 11 soldiers accused of taking part in the killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the 1995 abduction of four persons by armed men
 in the north, or the 1995 kidnaping of a traditional Afar chief at Alalli Dada by un-
 known persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other inhu-
 mane, cruel, degrading, or humiliating punishments. Torture is punishable by 15
 years in prison. However, there were credible reports that police and prison officials
 sometimes beat and otherwise physically abused prisoners and detainees. In Janu-
 ary the PRD's newspaper reported that Djama Hersi Omar, a security guard alleg-
 edly involved in a theft case, was punched, kicked, hanged by his feet, and had his
 head dipped in ice water by members of the gendarmerie. The gendarmerie denied
 the accusations. In March the PND's newspaper reported that Djama Dabar Waberi
 was kicked and punched by security forces for his antigovernment views.
 
 
 Prison conditions are harsh and characterized by severe overcrowding. Gabode
 prison, built for 300 persons, has more than twice that many inmates. Reportedly,
 prisoners must pay authorities to obtain food. The February 3 riot at Gabode prison
 was started by inmates who were unhappy about not being fed adequately. Security
 forces killed the inmates while suppressing the riot (see Section L.a.). Several dif-
 ferent groups of inmates went on hunger strikes during the year to protest poor nu-
 trition and inadequate health care. Mohamed Abdillahi Ismail died of tuberculosis
 in his cell in January, according to the PND's newspaper. When the inmate's condi-
 tion worsened, he was transferred to an isolated cell in the prison infirmary rather
 than transported to a local hospital. Reports also indicate that illegal aliens jailed
 for crimes sometimes have young children with them. There were, however, no re-
 r ts of rape of female prisoners. The International Committee of the Red Cross
 ICRC) staff no longer reside in the country. When present, they normally had ac-
 cess to all prisoners. An ICRC representative from Nairobi, Kenya visited the main
 prison in Djibouti during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1994 Penal Code stipulates that the
 State may not detain a person beyond 48 hours without an examining magistrate's
 formal charge. Detainees may be held another 48 hours with the prior approval of
 Djibouti's public prosecutor. Persons charged with political or national security of-
 fenses may be detained as long as an investigation is underway. Nevertheless, the
 police often disregarded these procedures, normally arresting persons without war-
 rants and sometimes detaining persons for lengthy periods. The Penal Code provides
 for bail and expeditious trial. Incommunicado detention is used.
 In May, in the midst of a strike by school teachers, security forces detained
 Mariam Hassan Ali, the Secretary General of the teachers union, and three union
 leaders for several hours without providing any explanation. In June the official
 newspaper reported that 18 inmates waited months to be released because of inac-
 tion by then-ustice Minister Moumin Bahdon Farah. Mohamed Mahamoud Ali, the
 potential witness in the theft case against Farah, was arbitrarily detained from
 June 20 until his death on July 13 (see Sections l.a. and 1.c.). Amir Adaweh, the
 editor-in-chief of the PND's newspaper La Republique, spent several days in deten-
 tion in July after being accused of organizing a protest in support of political pris-
 oners. In August the Government sentenced five members of a splinter group within
 the ruling party, including three former ministers, to a 6-month prison term and
 fines of $1,200 for criticizing President Gouled (see Section i.e.).
 An Afar politician, Muhyadin Matdih Vedir, was allegedly arrested in August on
 political grounds at the request of the Ethiopian government. There were no devel-
 opments inthe cases of alleged terrorists Awalle Guelle Assone and Mohamed Has-
 san Farah, who were arrested in 1994 for the 1990 bombing of a cafe. The Govern-
 ment's investigation into their roles in the attack was ongoing at year's end.
 Mohamed Ai Areyt was arrested in 1995 as part of the same case. In April the
 French Government issued an international arrest warrant for PND president Aden
 Robleh Awaleh and his wife, Aicha Omar Dabar, for their part in the cafe bombing.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and magistrates are appointed for life terms. In practice, however, the judici-
 ary is not independent of the executive. Constitutional provisions for a fair trial are
 generally respected in nonpolitical cases. There were reportedly political reasons for
 the Ma ouster of four of the five appellate court judges: Zakaria Abdillahi Ali,
 Emile David, Chantal Clement, and Nabiha Djama Sed. The Government also re-
 placed Chief Prosecutor Ali Mohamed Afkada for political reasons.
 In June 1995, the Government took steps to strengthen the rule of law by dis-
 banding the special State Security Court, which in the past had handled cases of
 espionage, treason, and acts threatening the public order or "the interest of the re-
 public" outside normal judicial channels. Another special court, the Superior Court
 of Justice, rules on cases of embezzlement of public funds and is theoretically em-
 powered to try the President and government ministers. The Supreme Court is the
 only judicial body that can overrule decisions of the lower courts. A Constitutional
 Council rules on the constitutionality of laws, including those related to the protec-
 tion of human rights and civil liberties. In August the Constitutional Council ruled
 that the Parliament's disciplinary committee wrongly denied the parliamentary im-
 munity of three legislators. The Government ignored the Constitutional Council's
 ruling and launcheda .personal attack in the press on the Council's members.
 The legal system is composed of legislation and executive decrees, French codified
 law adopted at independence, Shari'a (Islamic) law, and traditions of the native no-
 madic peoples. Crimes committed in urban centers are dealt with in accordance with
 French-inspired law and judicial practice in the regular courts. Civil actions may be
 
 
 brought in these courts or in the traditional courts. Shari'a law is restricted to civil
 and family matters.
 The Constitution states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty, has the
 right to legal counsel, and the right to be examined by a doctor if imprisoned. Legal
 counsel is available to the indigent in criminal and civil matters. Court cases are
 heard in public before a presiding judge and two accompanying judges. The latter
 receive assistance from two persons-assessors-who are not members of the bench,
 but who possess a sufficient legal sophistication to comprehend court proceedings.
 The Government selects the assessors from the public at large, but credible reports
 indicate that political and ethnic affiliations may play a role in the appointment
 process.
 There were five political prisoners: Moumin Bahdon Farah, the former Justice
 Minister; Ahmed Boulaleh Barreh, the former Defense Minister. Ali Mahamade
 Houmed, the former Industry Minister; Ismael Guedi Hared, the former presidential
 cabinet Director, and Abdillahi Guirreh, a former ruling party Annex President. Ac-
 cused of inciting people to violence, using tribalism for political ends, and dissemi-
 nating false information, the five were stripped of their party membership. After
 claiming in a published statement that President Gouled rules Djibouti by terror
 and force without regard to the Constitution, the five were sentenced to 6 months
 in jail, fined $1,200, and prohibited from running for elected office for a period of
 5 years. The Constitution prohibits such condemnations of the President.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy. Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home, correspondence, and
 communications. The law also requires that the authorities obtain a warrant before
 conducting searches on private property. However, in practice, the Government does
 not always obtain warrants before conducting such searches, and it monitors the
 communications of some regime opponents (see Section 1.d.).
 There was a credible report that members of the "political police" have kept attor-
 ney Aref Mohamed Aref under surveillance, threatened his life, and harassed his
 personal secretary. Aref often represents clients in high profile cases involving al-
 leged human rights violations. The Centre for the Independence of Judges and Law-
 yers, which intervened on Aref's behalf, asked the Government to protect Aref and
 investigate the threats against him.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 The Government owns the electronic media, the most important medium for
 reaching the public. It also owns the principal weekly newspaper, La Nation. The
 official media generally do not criticize the President or the Government. There are
 several opposition-run weekly and monthly publications which circulate freely and
 openly criticize the Government.
 There are no specific laws or other criminal sanctions that threaten academic free-
 dom. In general, teachers may speak and conduct research without restriction so
 long as they do not violate the laws on sedition.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to free assembly is
 provided for in the Constitution, and the Government generally respected this right
 in practice. However, the Ministry of Interior requires permits for peaceful assembly
 and monitors opposition activities. Some opposition leaders effectively practiced self-
 censorship and, rather than provoke a government crackdown, refrained from orga-
 nizing popular demonstrations.
 The Constitution provides for four political parties. Nonpolitical associations must
 register with the Ministry of Interior in accordance with a preindependence law.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. Virtually the entire population
 is Sunni Muslim. The Government imposes no sanctions on those who choose to ig-
 nore Islamic teachings.
 The foreign community supports Roman Catholic, French Protestant, Greek Or-
 thodox, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Foreign clergy and missionaries may per-
 form charitable works, but proselytizing, while not illegal, is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution allows freedom of movement. This right may be lim-
 ited only by law.
 In general citizens may travel or enigrate without restriction or interference.
 However, some Afar leaders have had their passports revoked or denied, and Mus-
 lim women planning to travel to certain Gulf countries may be prohibited from
 doing so unless accompanied by a spouse or an adult male.
 DjIouti hosts almost 75,000 refugees and illegal immigrants, according to govern-
 ment sources. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) acknowledges
 
 
 only the presence of some 21,000 refugees, largely from Somalia, resident in three
 main refugee camps. There are also 1,500 Ethiopian urban refugees registered with
 the UNHCR. Between 1994 and 1996, the UNHCR, in cooperation with the Govern-
 ment, organized repatriation to Ethiopia for 31,000 refugees and migrants from the
 city of Djibouti.
 An estimated 10,000 to 18,000 Afars displaced by the civil war continue to live
 in Ethiopia, although not in refugee camps. The Government states that the Afars
 are welcome to return. However, Afar refugees perceive the northern region as un-
 safe. In addition, many of the Afars' homes and lands are occupied by Djiboutian
 soldiers and their families.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment, in practice citizens have not yet been allowed to exercise fully this right.
 The RPP has carefully controlled the implementation of the new four-party system,
 and, with the opposition largely refusing to participate, easily ensured total RPP
 control of the legislature in 1992 and President Gouled's reelection to a fourth term
 in 1993. Many Afars, particularly su pporters of the FRUD, claim that the Constitu-
 tion was crafted to ensure the President's domination of virtually all aspects of the
 Government, including the legislature and judiciary.
 The Government signed a peace agreement with the FRUD in 1994, which set the
 stage for the inclusion of FRUD members in senior government posts. In June 1995,
 the Government named to a newly reshuffled Cabinet two FRUD faction leaders
 who signed the peace accord. No Afars have been named to the Cabinet since that
 time. The FRUD was registered as a political party this year but has not held a
 party congress. The Government recognizes only one of two FRUD factions. The two
 leaders who signed the peace accord are members of the recognized faction; the un-
 recognized faction includes members who refused to accept the terms of the accord.
 Although legally entitled to participate in the political process, women are largely
 excluded from senior positions in government and in the political parties. There are
 no women in the Cabinet or in Parliament. The highest ranking woman in the coun-
 try is Mrs. Khadija Abebe, President of the Court of Appeals. At least three other
 women serve as judges, and one is a director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has been hostile to the formation of local human rights groups.
 In 1993 the Government imprisoned Mohamed Houmed Souleh, the leader of the
 Association for the Defense of Human Rights and Liberties (ADDHL), after he criti-
 cized military abuses in the civil conflict. He was arrested and released several
 times thereafter. In 1996 Souleh and the ADDHL stopped publicly criticizing the
 Government, which continued to deny the ADDHL recognition. No other known
 human rights groups exist, and, except for the ICRC, no international human rights
 groups are known to have visited the country during the year (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of language, race, sex
 or religion, discrimination against women and ethnic minorities is widespread. In
 particular, the enforcement of laws to protect women and children is weak.
 Women.-Violence against women exists but reported cases are few. The Govern-
 ment has been concerned about the problem of rape and included in the 1994 Penal
 Code, which entered into force in April 1995, stiff sentences for rapists, ranging up
 to 20 years in prison. However, there have as yet been no cases tried under the
 code. When violence against women occurs, it normally is dealt with within the fam-
 ily or clan structure rather than in the courts. The police rarely interfere in domes-
 tic violence cases, and the media report only the most extreme cases, such as mur-
 der.
 Women legally possess full civil rights, but in practice, due to traditional societal
 discrimination in education and custom, they play a secondary role in public life and
 do not have the same employment opportunities as men. There are only a few
 women in the professions, and women are largely confined to wage employment in
 small trade, clerical, and secretarial fields. Customary law discriminates against
 women in such areas as inheritance, divorce, property ownership, and travel (see
 Section 2.d.). As the French-inspired legal code does not sanction such discrimina-
 tion, educated women increasingly seek to defend their interests through the regu-
 lar courts.
 
 
 Children.-The Government devotes virtually no public resources to the advance-
 ment of children's rights and welfare. A few charitable organizations work with chil-
 dren.
 According to an independent expert, as many as 98 percent of females 7 years or
 older have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned
 by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological
 health. In Djibouti FGM is generally performed on girls between the ages of 7 and
 10. In 1988 the Djiboutian National Women's Union began an educational campaign
 against FGM, particularly infibulation, the most extensive and dangerous form of
 sexual mutilation practiced on women and girls. The campaign has had only mar-
 . nal impact on the prevalence of this custom, which is pervasive in rural areas.
 udicial reforms enacted in 1991 stipulate that anyone found guilty of genital muti-
 lation of young girls may face a heavy fine and 5 years in prison. However, the Gov-
 ernment has not convicted anyone under this statute or under the provisions of the
 Penal Code, which specifically prohibits FGM. The Government has not specifically
 addressed other forms of child abuse, which are often lightly punished. For example,
 when a child is raped or otherwise abused, the perpetrator is usually fined an
 amount sufficient to cover medical care for the injured child. The Government has
 yet to use provisions of the Penal Code to deal with domestic violence and child
 abuse more severely.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Although disabled per-
 sons have access to education and public health facilities, there is no specific legisla-
 tion that addresses their needs, and there are no laws or regulations that prevent
 job discrimination against disabled people. The disabled have difficulty finding em-
 ployment in an economy where approximately 60 percent of the able-bodied male
 adult population is underemployed or jobless.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Government continued to discriminate
 against citizens on the basis of ethnicity in terms of employment and job advance-
 ment. The Issa, the dominant Somali clan, control the ruling party, the civil and
 security services, and the military services. The President's subclan, the Mamassan,
 wields disproportionate power in affairs of state.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Constitution, workers are free to join
 unions and to strike provided that they comply with legally prescribed require-
 ments. In the small wage economy, about 70 percent of workers are union members,
 concentrated in individual private or state-owned enterprises. Previously, the Gov-
 ernment exerted control over individual unions by making membership mandatory
 in the state-organized labor confederation, the General Union of Djiboutian Workers
 (UGTD). Since 1992 unions are free to join or form other confederations. While the
 UGTD is now nominally independent of the Government, it maintains close ties to
 the RPP. However, the Democratic Labor Union (UDT) has gained increasing union
 support despite government harassment.
 The prescribod legal requirement for initiating a strike calls for the representa-
 tives of employees who plan to do so to contact the Interior Ministry 48 hours in
 advance. All strikes during the year were legal. In January secondary school teach-
 ers struck unsuccessfully over nonpayment of salaries and for better benefits. School
 teachers also struck unsuccessfully in April, May, June, and September over non-
 payment of salaries and working conditions. Although the Labor Law prohibits em-
 ployer retribution against strikers, the Government on one occasion arbitrarily ar-
 rested several hundred striking workers, including labor leaders. The Government
 also suspended, fired, or transferred scores of teachers active in the union to less
 desirable assignments in rural areas.
 The Government replied to the International Labor Organization (ILO) concerning
 a complaint lodged by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU) both in 1995 and in 1996. The Government stated that the unions were
 unwilling to negotiate and requested that the ILO furnish a consultant who could
 train trade unionists, draft a labor code, and review social legislation. The Govern-
 ment did not respond to the ICFTU's specific allegations. The ICFTU alleges that
 members of the Inter-Trade Union Association of Labor/Gneral Union of Djibouti
 workers (UDTIUGTD) who struck on September 6, 1995, faced arbitrary arrest,
 threats, dismissals, or suspensions by the Government. Union headquarters were
 closed and sealed at that time. The workers were protesting the Government's re-
 fusal to enter into a dialogue with the trade unions over proposed legislation that
 would have had an adverse impact on their living standards. The ICFTU also lodged
 a complaint regarding the arrests of school teachers who struck in January. The
 Government said that it supports trade unions but added that police intervention
 
 
 was necessary to prevent social upheaval. In May security forces again seized the
 UGTD/UDT headquarters and froze their bank accounts.
 Unions are free to maintain relations and exchanges with labor organizations
 abroad. The UDT has been a member of the ICFTU since 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although labor has the legal
 right to organize and bargain collectively, collective bargaining rarely occurs. Rela-
 tions between employers and workers are informal and paternalistic. Wages are
 generally established unilaterally by employers on the basis of Ministry of Labor
 guidelines. When disputes about wages or health and safety issues arise, the Min-
 istry of Labor encourages direct resolution by labor representatives and employers.
 Workers or employers may request formal administrative hearings before the Min-
 istry of Labor's Inspection Service. The Service has been charged by critics with poor
 enforcement, due to its low priority and inadequate funding. The newly appointed
 Chief Labor Inspector promised in September to address these problems. The law
 prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employers guilty of such discrimination are
 legally required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. The Ministry gen-
 erally enforces the law. In February the directors of the government-owned electric
 utility and telephone companies prohibited employees from attending a seminar on
 the role of unions in economic development sponsored by the UGTD, UDT, and the
 Conference Arabe pour les Accidents du Travail.
 An export processing zone (EPZ) was established in December 1994. Firms in the
 EPZ are exempt from the Government's social security and medical insurance pro-
 grams. Instead, they must provide either government or private accident insurance.
 The minimum wage in the EPZ is approximately $1 per hour. The regular work-
 week is 40 hours, while in the EPZ it is 45 hours. An employee having worked for
 the same firm in the EPZ for at least 1 year has the right to 15 days of annual
 leave compared to 30 days in the rest of the country (see also Section 6.e.).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and while this is generally observed, security forces reportedly some-
 times compel illegal immigrants to work for them to avoid deportation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for the employ-
 ment of children is 14 years, and the law is generally respected. However, the short-
 age of labor inspectors reduces the likelihood of investigations being carried out, ac-
 cording to union sources. Children are generally not employed under hazardous con-
 ditions. Children may and do work in family-owned businesses, such as restaurants
 and small shops, at all hours. Many street beggars are young children whose par-
 ents have forced them to beg to help support the family.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Only a small minority of the population is en-
 gaged in wage employment. The Government administratively sets minimum wage
 rates according to occupational categories, and the Ministry of Labor is charged with
 enforcement. The monthly wage rate for unskilled labor, set in 1976, is approxi-
 mately $90 (15,000 Djiboutian francs). However, some employers ask their employ-
 ees to work up to 12 hours per day and pay them an additional wage. Some workers
 also receive housing and transportation allowances. Most employers pay more than
 the minimum wage, recognizing that it does not provide adequate compensation for
 a worker and family to maintain a decent standard of living.
 By law the work week is 40 hours, often spread over 6 days. Workers are guaran-
 teed daily and weekly rest periods and paid annual leave. The Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for enforcing occupational health and safety standards, wages, and
 work hours. Because enforcement is ineffective, workers sometimes face hazardous
 working conditions, particularly at the port. Workers rarely protest, as they fear re-
 placement by others willing to accept the risks. There are no laws or regulations
 permitting workers to refuse to carry out dangerous work assignments without jeop-
 ardy to continued employment.
