 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are firmly rooted. Human rights are guaran-
 teed in theory by the Japanese constitution and secured
 in fact by a just and efficient legal system.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 We are not aware of any instances of torture being commit-
 ted in Japan.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. The accused are guaranteed a public
 trial with defense counsel and the right to cross examina-
 tion. In addition they are protected from self-incrimina-
 tion and from the application of ex-post facto laws.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 We do not know of any cases in Japan in which authorities
 have entered homes without first obtaining a legal warrant,
 and the standards for issuing such warrants are adequate
 to guard against arbitrary searches.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Basic human needs in Japan are provided for primarily by
 the social infrastructure that has grown apace with Japan's
 economy. Food, shelter, health care, and education are

 available widely in good quality, with the government
 generally acting as the provider of last resort to the
 needy. Welfare standards are maintained more by the
 efforts of the private sector than by explicit government
 policy, for the Japanese employer traditionally assumes a
 paternal responsibility for the welfare of his employees
 and theirfamilies. Japanese at all income levels share
 in Japan's prosperity.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Citizens have the right to change their place of residence,
 to travel freely both within Japan and abroad, and to
 emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All adult citizens share the right to vote, and this right
 is enjoyed in practice. Vote is by secret ballot. Poli-
 tical interest groups can organize and engage in non-violent
 political activity regardless of their political hue. Five
 opposition parties are active, ranging from a Communist
 party to a moderate conservative party. Labor unions are
 well organized and play an essential role in bringing workers
 into the political process. Elections are completely honest
 and open, and they accurately reflect the public will.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 We know of no requests by any organizations to investigate
 human rights conditions in Japan.
