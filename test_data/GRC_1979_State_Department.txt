 GREECE
 Since the collapse of the military junta and the restora-
 tion of democracy in 1974, Greece has given strong proof
 of its commitment to human rights. The post-junta con-
 stitution, which entered into force in June 1975, reflects
 the spirit and includes many of the provisions contained
 in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights. Greece has a multi-party, democratically elected
 parliament which represents   a broad range of ideologi-
 cal persuasions. Tue head of government is the Prime
 Minister, who is appointed by the President f6llowing the
 results of parliamentary elections. On the recommendation
 of the Prime Minister, the President appoints the other
 members of the government. Parliamentary elections were
 most recently held in November 1977 and were vigorously
 contested. The judiciary- is independent of both the
 executive branch of government and parliament and operates
 within a civil law framework with precedents from Roman
 law and French and German sources. An active and un-
 fettered press functions throughout the country. In
 practice, through a combination of constitutional guaran-
 tees and administrative practices, the Greek Government is
 committed to the scripulous observance of human rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the constitution
 and respected in practice.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by the constitution and respected
 in practice.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaran-
 teed by the constitution and respected in practice.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are guaranteed by the constitution
 and respected in practice. Unless arrested during the
 commission of a crime no person can be arrested without a
 wariant stating the reasons for the arrest. Within 24
 hours of the time of arrest,the accused must be brought
 before the examining magistrate or, if the accused is
 outside the seat of the magistrate, "within the time which
 is absolutely necessary for his convenience." Defense
 lawyers are available under all circumstances.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home as well as an individual's
 personal and family life are guaranteed by the constitu-
 tion and respected in practice.

 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Greek Government is committed to the fulfillment of
 the basic needs of its citizens for food, shelter, health
 care and education. In the economic sector, successive
 post-World War II governments have increasingly met this
 commitment as Greece's economic development has accelerated.
 Progressive tax legislation and price restraints have been
 utilized to achieve a more equitable income distribution.
 Real worker income in the past decade has risen 80%;
 48% between the restoration of democracy in 1974 and 1978.
 Real farm income rose 50% between 1969 and 1976, the last
 year for which data are available. Between 1974 and 1978
 wages and salaries as a percentage of gross national
 product have increased from 47% to 55.5%. There is
 virtually no unemployment in Greece, and a large percen-
 tage of Greeks own their own homes. Free public health
 care is available throughout Greece. Primary education
 is free and compulsory, and the government has sc.:ght to
 make higher education, which is available to all citizens
 meeting academic entrance requirements, more accessible
 through the expansion of facilities.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly
 is guaranteed by the constitution and the law and re-
 spected in practice.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The constitution and the law prohibit any impediment to
 the freedom of movement within the country, to travel
 abroad, or to emigration. These quarantees are respected
 in practice.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Greece is a multi-party democracy in which all citizens
 enjoy full political rights without regard to race, sex,
 religion or political persuasion. All opposition parties
 function freely, have access to the media and hold public
 meetings. Women have the same political, economic and
 social rights as do men and participate fully in Greek
 society. Equal wages are guaranteed by the constitution,
 and women have traditionally been represented in the profes-
 sions. At present there are eleven women in the 300-
 member Parliament including one who is also a deputy
 minister in one of the 20 major ministries. Labor rights,
 including the right to organize, bargain collectively and
 to strike, are guaranteed by the constitution and the law
 and respected in practice.

 While Greece is one of the most ethnically and religiously
 homogeneous societies in the world, there are several
 small minorities including Moslems, Jews and non-Orthodox
 Christians. The law prohibiting discriminatory practices
 against minorities is respected. The various minority
 groups have participated in the increasing prosperity of
 Greece and enjoy full political rights. Currently two
 Moslems are members of Parliament. The Greek Government
 is committed to the scrupulous observance of the provi-
 sions of the Treaty of Lausanne relating to political and
 educational rights of the Moslem minority in Greece.
 While occasional concern is expressed by members of
 minority groups alleging bureaucratic difficulties in
 dealing with lower levels of Greek state organizations
 about such matters as driving licenses and land transfers,
 there is no evidence that-these difficulties have their
 origins in an organized pattern of practices or that they
 reflect an official policy of discrimination. In 1977,
 the government removed provisions of the military service
 law which were especially onerous to the small Jehovah's
 Witnesses sect.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 To the best of the Department of State's knowledge, the
 Greek Government has not objected to visits and investi-
 gations by human rights organizations. Amnesty Inter-
 national has a chapter in Greece.
