 NAMIBlIA
 Formerly German South West Africa, Namibia since 1915 has been
 ruled by the Republic of South Africa. Under the terms of the
 Tripartite Agreement signed in New York on December 22, 1988,
 by the People's Republic of.Angola, the Republic of Cuba and
 the Republic of South Africa, South Africa agreed to implement
 the U. N. Plan for the independence of Namibia in accordance
 with United Nations Security-council- Resolution (UNSCR) 435.
 Implementation of the UN Plan began on April 1, 1989, and will
 continue until Namibia becomes independent, which is scheduled
 to occur by April 1, 1990. Until independence the South
 African Government through its Administrator-General (AG) will
 continue to administer the territory under the supervision and
 control of the Special Representative of the U.N.
 Secretary-General (SRSG) and the United Nations Transition
 Assistance Group (UNTAG).
 The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) won
 Namibia's first free election in November for a Constituent
 Assembly which will prepare a new constitution, but it failed
 to gain the two-thirds majority-needed to have a free hand in
 in drafting the constitution. SWAPO, primarily an African
 nationalist organization with previous ties to Eastern Europe,
 Angola and Cuba, had waged a 23-year bush war against South
 Africa for Namibia's independence. Until recently, SWAPO
 advocated a Marxist-oriented economic and political system in
 Namibia, but since implementation of the U.N. Plan it has
 espoused the importance of a free market economy and
 democratic principles. At SWAPO's suggestion, the Constituent
 Assembly adopted the framework for the Constitution which will
 embody the basic principles governing the organization and
 powers of the government, the holding of elections, and
 gTotection of human rights agreed to in July 1982 by the
 parties involved in the U.N. Resolution 435 negotiation
 process.
 The Transitional Government of National Unity installed by
 South.Africa in 1985 was disbanded in March 1989 and its
 functions absorbed by the Administrator-General. A general
 cease-fire took effect in the guerrilla war in the north in
 September 1988 and held until April 1, 1989. On that date,
 SWAPO sent hundreds of armed members of its military wing, the
 Peo ple's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), across Namibia's
 northern border, violating the cease-fire and its obligations
 under UNSCR 435. Widespread fighting erupted throughout
 northernNamihia, in which over 300 PLAN fighters and about 30
 members of the reactivated special counterinsurgency unit
 known as "Koevoet" (which means crowbar in Afrikaans) and
 other security forces were killed. Following vigorous
 diplomatic efforts by the countries concerned, on May 19,
 1989, South Africa, Angola, and Cuba agreed that the situation
 was under sufficient control so that implementation of the
 U.N. Plan could proceed.
 After mid-May, implementation of the U.N. Plan radically
 changed the political atmosphere. The South African Defense
 Force (SADF) withdrew on schedule, and a residual 1,500 SADF
 men, who were confined to base under UNTAG monitoring,
 departed shortly after the elections in November. The South
 West African Territorial Force (SWATF) was disbanded, and its
 weapons placed under UNTAG control. Over-40,000 exiled
 Namibians, mostly SWAPO members, were repatriated. Exiled
 SWAPO leaders, including SWAPO President Nujoma, returned and
 openly campaigned in the electionp. Under the terms of the UN
 Plan, on July 20 after talks with the SRSG, the AG released 24
 
 
 247
 NAMIBIA
 political prisoners. SWAPO had called for the release of
 another 8 being held in Windhoek jail, but the SRSG was
 advised by an independent jurist that they should not benefit
 from the political prisoner amnesty program. At year's end,
 three were still being held: one was serving a 20 year
 sentence for sabotage and murder as a result of a bomb blast
 in Oshakati in 1987; the other two were serving lesser
 sentences for bombings in 1987 and 1988. In addition, amnesty
 was granted to persons born in Namibia who chose to return
 under the auspices of the United Nations High Commission for
 Refugees (UNHCR).
 Many of the detainees held by SWAPO in prisons in Angola were
 released, although 256 remained unaccounted for, and 115 were
 presumed dead. Many were allegedly murdered by SWAPO while
 being held in SWAP0 prisons in Angola. South West African
 laws deemed by the SRSG to be prejudicial to holding of free
 and fair elections--including many security laws used to
 suppress political activity--were repealed. The AG disbanded
 Koevoet on September 30. The AG also created the O'Linn
 Commission, a special commission under a respected human
 rights advocate with broad powers to investigate charges of
 intimidation and election malpractice. This commission made
 two judgments against instances of police and political party
 misconduct. It found alleged former members of Koevoet guilty
 of assaulting SWAPO supporters on their way to a police
 station in Ovamboland to obtain permission to hold a political
 rally. The Commission also found against a policeman in
 Caprivi who attempted to cover up an assault on a SWAPO
 supporter.
 Certain persistent problems plagued the implementation
 process. Reports of misconduct by the South West African
 Police (SWAPOL), such as intimidation at political rallies and
 harassment of pro-SWAPO supporters, continued through
 September. SWAPOL was also accused of being pro-Democratic
 Turnhalle Alliance (DTA). In addition, former members of the
 SWATF were reportedly responsible for many incidents of
 anti-SWAPO harassment and intimidation. Press reports issued
 during the election period from UNTAG and the AG's office
 indicated that both SWAPO and the DTA practiced intimidation
 against each other and the smaller parties. Responding to an
 increase in incidents through August, the SRSG called on the
 leadership of the political parties in September to agree on a
 code of conduct aimed at reducing violence and ameliorating
 the atmosphere of mutual suspicion and tension.
 Unfortunately a terrorist incident marred the implementation
 process. Extremist whites were allegedly responsible for a
 bombing attack in August on an UNTAG office in Outjo in which
 a Namibian citizenwas killed. Three suspects, members of the
 "White Wolves,* a self-proclaimed white supremacist
 organization, were arrested and arraigned on charges of arson
 and murder in September. Press reports citing police
 investigations, alleged that the White Wolves had ties to other
 extremist-groups in South Africa. On December 5, the suspects
 escaped from police custody and were still at large at year's
 end. Also in September a prominent white official of SWAPO
 was assassinated.- SWAPOL arrested a suspect 2 days later, who
 remained in police custody in Windhoek prison at the end of
 1989 charged with murder. Anonymous callers identifying
 themselves as White Wolves claimed responsibility for the
 murder and threatened other white activists with death.
 Except for the April 1 incursion, SWAPO has not been linked to
 terrorist incidents.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were several charges of politically motivated killings
 during 1989. In Rundu in August, two policemen shot and
 killed a former Koevoet member who had joined SWAPO. While
 the policemen claimed they fired in self-defense, local human
 rights advocates suspected the former Koevoet member was
 murdered. Also in August, Petrus Joseph was murdered,
 allegedly because he had complained of police harassment for
 some time. Petrus, along with Paulus David and four other
 ex-Koevoet members, had obtained a court order in March 1989
 to restrain members of the security forces from intimidating
 and harassing them. David testified in court that senior
 officers had ordered Koevoet members to arrest and intimidate
 people suspected of being SWAPO supporters. Between March'and
 August 1989, Petrus Joseph continued to complain of police
 harassment, and in early August he was shot dead in his home
 by police. Police claimed Petrus had threatened them with a
 pistol, forcing them to shoot in self-defense. The police
 also said they had found hand grenades in Petrus' home. A
 formal inquest into the case was convened in Rundu in
 September, with members of Namibia's Legal Assistance Center
 acting for the victim's family. The results of the inquest
 were scheduled to be heard in December, but the accused
 policemen did not appear in court. The inquest hearing was
 rescheduled for February 1990. The Legal Assistance Center
 said the policemen had not been properly subpoenaed.
 In mid-August several persons, reportedly white extremists
 with links to South African extremist groups, launched an
 attack with guns and incendiary grenades against UNTAG
 facilities at Outjo; one Namibian security guard was killed.
 Three men were arrested in September and October and charged
 with arson and murder in this attack. The three men escaped
 from police custody December 5 and were still at large at
 year's end. A policeman shot during the escape died on
 December 19. In late September; a DTA member was beaten to
 death by a group of SWAPO supporters in Ovamboland; the DTA
 claimed that the attack was motivated solely because the
 person was a member of the DTA. The murder sparked interparty
 fighting between DTA and SWAPO supporters, leading to the
 deaths of several SWAPO members. In mid-September a policeman
 was killed while in hot pursuit of a criminal who sought
 refuge in the town of Otjiwarongo in northern Namibia. A mob,
 reportedly of SWAPO supporters, sought to protect the
 fugitive. The policeman wounded two attackers from the mob
 before he was overpowered and beaten to death. Also in
 September, a senior white official of SWAPO, Anton Lubowski,
 was assassinated in front of his home by unknown gunmen;
 police arrested a suspect 2 days later, who at year's end was
 in detention and charged with murder. In each instance of
 killing the South African authorities convened an inquest. In
 most of these cases, various perpetrators have been arrested
 and charged, though none had come to trial by the end of
 1989. Local human rights groups expressed dissatisfaction
 with these proceedings. No security force member has been
 prosecuted, although a case is still pending for security
 force members held for the 1986 murder of Immanuel Shifidi at
 a political rally. Several of the.killings did not appear to
 
 
 249
 NA41BIA
 have been directly motivated by politics, but because of the
 tense atmosphere preceding the elections, every confrontation
 between the local population and'the police took on political
 overtones.
 Former detainees of SWAPO forces who returned'to Namibia in
 July alleged that many detainees had been executed without
 trials or hearings in the SWAPO prisons in Angola. The
 detainees produced a list of 74 persons believed-to have been
 killed by SWAPO security personnel. The deaths dated from
 1976 to 1988; none was alleged to have occurred in 1989.
 SWAPO spokesmen said the movement did detain persons whom it
 identified as spies for South Africa but had released all of
 them.
 b. Disappearance
 The former SWAPO detainees released a list of 449 names of
 persons believed to be still held by SWAP0 in prisons in
 Angola. The former detainees claimed that several hundred
 others, whose names they did not know, were also being held.
 SWAPO leaders said they had released all of their detainees.
 The U.N. Special Representative, who has a mandate under the
 U.N. Plan to ensure the release of all political prisoners
 held by both sides, sent a team to Angola and Zambia in
 September to investigate the fate of those reported to be
 missing. Subsequently, from a list of 1,100 names, the team
 accounted for over half of the reported missing and detained.
 By mid-December the number-unaccounted for stood at 256. At
 that~time Namibians were still-coming forward to identify
 themselves as persons on the "missing" list. The UNTAG
 mission continued to meet regularly in Windhoek (capital of
 Namibia) to resolve the remaining cases.
 Prisoners released by the South'Africans in June and July
 alleged that a number of prisoners had died while in custody
 or been taken into the bush and killed. Under previous
 security laws.police were not required to notify their
 superiors or relatives of the detainees of detentions, and
 detainees could be held in any location desired by the
 detaining officers. Amnesty International (AI), in its August
 1989 report on Namibia, noted that it remains impossible to
 say exactly how many people disappeared while in South African
 custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Allegations of security force abuses declined in 1989, but the
 events of April 1-led to a sudden resurgence of charges of
 brutality by the police and members of the SWATF 101
 battalion. Allegations against Koevoet and SWATF surged
 dramatically following the April 1 SWAPO incursion. There
 were 400 complaints against SWAPOL elements from April 1 to
 August 1. Many of these incidents stopped short of armed
 violence.' There were also a number of reports of civilians
 beaten by members of the security forces, particularly by
 members of Koevoet, although many acts of violence attributed
 to Koevoet were committed by active or demobilized members of
 SWATF. By August 1989 continuing reports of misconduct and
 harassment, including beatings, of civilians by former Koevoet
 members reached such a point that the Special Representative,
 supported by the Security Council, demanded that they be
 withdrawn from the police force. This was accomplished in
 October.
 
 
 250
 NAMIBIA
 Former SWAPO detainees, on their return to Namibia, stated
 they had been beaten and tortured by their SWAPO guards while
 imprisoned. Some claimed they had been tortured because they
 were intellectuals or better educated than the SWAPO inner
 circle. Many, including women, displayed extensive scars.
 Men were commonly beaten on the back, buttocks, and legs; a
 number said they were hung upside down from trees or roof
 beams and beaten. Women were burned on their breasts with
 lighted cigarettes. Several detainees said they knew
 personally of victims who were beaten or tortured to death.
 AI also cited, in its report on Namibia, allegations by
 detainees of torture and deplorable conditions of imprisonment
 in SWAPO-controlled camps in Angola.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although security legislation which permitted detention
 without trial has been repealed in accordance with the U.N.
 Plan, and while security forces are now obliged to notify the
 UNTAG police monitors when they make an arrest, reports and
 allegations of SWAPOL misconduct continued to be a serious
 problem into September. SWAPOL was accused of making arrests
 without warrants, and there were a few cases of incommunicado
 detention. As the election drew near, political tension
 between DTA and SWAPO supporters increased which resulted'in
 more reports of SWAPOL misconduct. With DTA and SWAPO
 confrontations on the rise, SWAPOL's role in handling the
 confrontations increased and so did reports and allegations of
 misconduct. SWAPOL also conducted the investigation of
 allegations against itself, since UNTAG served in a monitoring
 and not investigatory capacity. While UNTAG police monitors
 have been unable to prevent all abuses, few of SWAPOL's
 arrests resulted in formal charges, and most of those arrested
 were released within a few hours. Relatives of people who are
 arrested often appeal directly to UNTAG police monitors for
 assistance. UNTAG monitors cannot overturn arrests, but they
 can confirm the identities of those arrested, monitor
 investigations of police behavior, and report abusive behavior
 or police misconduct.
 There were no reports of:new detentions by the security forces
 in 1989. Police must now present the accused before a
 magistrate within 24 hours and lay a formal charge. The
 accused has the right to be represented by an attorney,
 although the police do.not always facilitate access. The
 Government stopped funding in 1989 a legal aid program. On
 capital offense charges, however, the State still is required
 to provide and pay for an advocate.
 Former detainees of SWAPO claimed that no judicial procedures
 were observed in connection with their detention. They
 publicly stated to the press and international organizations
 that they were often not even informed that they had been
 arrested. Many claimed they were simply thrown into dungeons;
 they were not advised of any rights or of the charges against
 them. None was tried or brought before any hearing; the
 purpose of the torture cited above, according to some
 detainees, was to extract confessions and to force the victims
 to implicate others, who would be arrested and tortured as
 well. Some of these confessions were allegedly videotaped and
 shown to senior SWAPO leaders as "evidence" of the detainee's
 guilt; most were accused of spying for South Africa. Many of
 the detainees believe that they were the victims of a party
 purge, singled out because of political differences, tribal
 affiliation, or because they were *intellectuals."

 N~AMIBIA
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive branch (now the
 AG), and the Supreme Court in Windhoek is widely respected for
 its integrity. There are only two court levels in Namibia,
 magistrate and supreme. The Supreme Court is the high court.
 For appeals, cases are subject to appellate review by the
 South African Court-of Appeals in Bloemfontein. Although
 Namibia was in transitional status, the State's Attorney could
 still appeal politically sensitive cases to Bloemfontein,
 because the SRSG had neither jurisdiction over the legal
 system nor any relationship with the Namibian courts. Trials
 are pdblic, and defendants have a right to counsel. There is
 little criticism of the courts themselves, which administer a
 Roman-Dutch legal-system, whereby cases are heard by a
 magistrate or a panel of judges. Former criticism of the
 legal system concerned the widespread use of detention without
 trial, notably under AG 9 of 1977 or Section 6 of South
 Africa's Terrorism Act of 1967. Those brought to trial now
 can expect a fair hearing based on the legal merits of their
 case, and there is a right of appeal. Defendants are
 considered innocent until proven guilty.
 In March 1989, a full bench of the Supreme Court of Namibia
 invalidated South African President P.W. Botha's decision in
 March 1988 to halt the trial of six security force members
 charged with'the Jnurder of Immanuel Shifidi at a political
 rally in 1986. An appeal to the South African court in
 Bloemfontein is still pending. Since implementation of the UN
 Plan, legal rights groups have noted the light sentences that
 the Supreme Court has given for crimes caused by or related to
 political motives of political party supporters or members of
 the police.
 The Namibian courts, supreme and magistrate, also have been
 careful not to involve themselves in cases which might
 threaten the implemenfation of the UN Plan. In May, 11
 so-called *headmen" (9 from Ovamboland, 1 from Caprivi and 1
 from Kaokoland) brought a case against the Special
 Representative, UNHCR, SWAPO, the Council of Churches, the AG,
 and the South African Defense Minister. The headmen were
 trying to stop the refugee repatriation process from Angola
 until adequate protection'-could be provided to them and their
 communities. They argued that the refugees--who the headmen
 claimed were really ex-PLAN fighters--represented a threat to
 their safety. The Supreme Court issued an interim order that
 the AG provide protection for the headmen but later reversed
 its decision.
 Traditional tribal courts continued to operate in the tribal
 areas. These courts deal mostly with minor criminal offenses,
 such as petty theft and infractions of traditional customs.
 Cases are heard by a village or tribal headman or chief, who
 may receive advice from a traditional council or civil
 servant. Procedures are informal and vary from tribe to
 tribe; observers report that the system can work well to
 resolve minor problems by communal consensus but, because of
 the lack of review and the strength of traditional authorities
 in the rural areas, is also subject to abuse.
 
 
 252
 N1AMIBIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Security legislation before implementation of the U.N. Plan
 allowed almost unlimited powers of search and seizure.
 Invasion of the home was commonplace in the northern areas.
 Press reports during the April fighting indicated that
 security forces drove their heavily armored vehicles through
 the homes of persons suspected of supporting the guerrillas.
 Allegations of warrantless searches, threats against
 civilians, and intrusive interrogation to establish the
 whereabouts and identities of returnees (including PLAN
 fighters repatriated as refugees) continued to concern UNTAG
 and other observers until late in the year.
 Outside the north, surveillance and monitoring of mail and
 telephones of political activists appeared to decline.
 However, legislation pertaining to the gathering of security
 information, Post Office Act No. 44 and National Security Act
 No. 19, remained in force throughout 1989 and gave the AG the
 right to intercept telephone calls and mail without a
 warrant. There is no evidence that the AG invoked these
 powers after April 1.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 There were many instances of the use of excessive force and
 violations of humanitarian law by both South African security
 forces and SWAPO military units in the course of the 23-year
 bush war. Over the years, many innocent civilians were killed
 in the conflict. However, the de facto cease-fire which came
 into effect in August 1988 led to a lessening of tensions
 along the border and the reports of violations declined
 through the rest of 1988 and into 1989.
 The events of April 1 led to a resurgence in accusations of
 serious violations. During the fighting and for many weeks
 afterward, many reports and allegations surfaced of security
 forces beating civilians during interrogation in their efforts
 to locate SWAPO infiltrators.
 The fighting itself in April produced lopsided casualty ratios
 of 10 to 12 SWAPO infiltrators killed for every 1 taken
 prisoner. Sources who claimed to have examined some of the
 bodies state that many of the dead appeared to have been shot
 through the head at close range. Photos of roughly 18 PLAN
 members taken by a photojournalist from the London-based
 Sunday Telegraph and shown on the U.S. program "South Africa
 Now" were examined by a forensic expert from Guys Hospital in
 London and and a U.S. forensic expert. The two claimed that
 the bodies appeared to have been shot at close range. Local
 police claimed that their investigations failed to confirm
 these allegations. The buried bodies were exhumed in July and
 autopsies performed on each. Most of the forensic facilities
 and experts were South African. Several inquest hearings were
 scheduled then postponed. Since the elections no apparent
 follow-up of the status of the investigation or rescheduling
 of the inquest have been made.
 SWAPO as a guerrilla movement was accused of serious
 mistreatment of its detainees (See Sections l.c. and l.d.).
 As a political party it, along with the DTA, was responsible
 for acts of intimidation and violence against voters during
 the election campaign.
 
 
 253
 NA1IA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Many laws circumscribing freedom of speech were repealed in
 1989 as part of the U.N. Plan. The SRSG ensured that all laws
 which would prevent free and fair elections were repealed, in
 particular those relating to political expression.
 Restrictions on obscenity remained in effect, but the press
 reported freely on political, security, and economic matters.
 The daily newspapers, which are generally party organs, were
 quite vigorous in their criticism of the AG, UNTAG, the U.N.
 Plan, and each other.
 In late September, a Namibian publisher, two newspaper editors
 and an American journalist, Scott Stanley, were arrested on
 the "criminal" charge of defaming the O'Linn Commission, a
 Namibian government commission charged with investigating
 allegations of election fraud and malpractice. Stanley had
 interviewed its chairman, Bryan O'Linn, in July and wrote a
 commentary for his news organization critical of O'Linn. The
 piece charged that O'Linn was pro-SWAPO and not fit to head
 the Commission. O'Linn called the allegation contemptuous,
 and the State brought charges against Stanley and two Namibian
 newspapers that published the commentary. The trial judge
 found that Stanley had misquoted and otherwise denigrated
 O'Linn. On November 21, all defendants were found guilty on
 some of the counts against them and received fines. Stanley
 was found guilty on one of two counts and fined the equivalent
 of $96.
 The South West African Broadcasting Corporation (SWABC)
 operates under a board appointed by the Administrator-General.
 SWABC newscasts on radio and television have traditionally
 been biased in favor of the status quo and against SWAPO,
 referring to it prior to April 1 as a terrorist organization.
 Following April 1, 1989, SWABC modified its news policy to
 permit mention of SWAPO as a political party like the others
 but continued to be highly biased against SWAPO. Three
 reports issued at intervals in 1989 by an independent
 monitoring group, NPP-435, documented instances of SWABC
 bias. The SRSG insisted that improvement in the broadcast
 media's performance was essential to creating the conditions
 for free and fair elections. SWABC's bias did diminish
 somewhat during the year, but the network's newscasts still
 had relatively low credibility among many listeners and
 viewers.
 With the repeal of most security legislation related to
 political offenses, academic freedom is now respected in
 Namibia. Local scholars are free to publish, travel, speak,
 and participate in local politics for the first time in many
 years without fearing loss of employment or prosecution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Namibians generally enjoy the freedoms of peaceful assembly
 and association. The repeal of pertinent security legislation
 has resulted in greater freedom of assembly and unprecedented
 political rallies were held throughout the country.
 Political rallies do not require approval, but parties must
 provide prior notice of meetings under proclamation AG 23 of
 1989, and must conform to certain guidelines relating to
 safety and traffic. In August a SWAPO rally was peacefully
 
 
 254
 NAMIBIA
 dispersed for failing to conform with the requirement that the
 police be notified 3 days in advance; party organizers had in
 fact notified the local magistrate, as was required under old
 legislation. In late September, the DTA held a march through
 Windhoek's black township of Katutura. Although the party had
 received permission from the AG's office in August to use a
 loudspeaker truck to do political campaigning, it did not have
 prior permission to hold a march. The AG's office ruled that
 the march was illegal under the terms of AG 23.
 A SWAPOL commander in the north was accused before the AG's
 Commission on Intimidation (the O'Linn Commission) of having
 deliberately staged a police attack on a peaceful assembly of
 SWAPO supporters in Ovamboland in June. In September police
 in Windhoek used plastic bullets to disperse a group of
 striking workers (see Section 6.a.). Students and government
 workers in northern Namibia staged a walkout in July to
 protest continued police abuses. The aim of the 1-month long
 school boycott, involving 160,000 students in 518 schools, was
 to urge the Government to remove ex-Koevoet members from the
 police force. A number of spontaneous demonstrations
 occurred, which led to some minor clashes.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Namibians enjoy the free practice of religion. Almost all
 Namibians are Christian, with the Evangelical Lutheran Church
 in Namibia (ELCIN) being the single largest denomination.
 Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Dutch Reformed, and the
 African Methodist Episcopal Churches are also active. There
 is one Jewish synagogue in Windhoek, and a small community of
 Muslims.
 Church leaders, who consistently condemned the use of violence
 in the past, also spoke out against the use of violence and
 intimidation by the political parties and urged reconciliation.
 Past travel restrictions against church leaders have been
 lifted. Foreign church visitors have without exception been
 granted visas, although some after delay or protest, to travel
 to Namibia.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Under the terms of the U.N. Plan, all Namibian refugees who
 fled the country during the conflict were entitled to register
 with UNHCR for repatriation. More than 42,000 Namibians who
 wished to return registered, and 42,736 had returned to
 Namibia by the end of 1989. This included the senior
 leadership of SWAPO, other exiled politicians, and several
 thousand PLAN fighters who repatriated as civilian refugees
 after their units in Angola were disarmed and disbanded. The
 former SWAPO detainees who returned were also repatriated
 under UNHCR auspices. Many of the non-SWAPO returnees accused
 UNHCR and its implementing agency in Namibia, the Council of
 Churches in Namibia (CCN), of partiality towards SWAPO, of
 attempting to cover up or ignore SWAPO human rights abuses,
 and of disregarding the legitimate needs of non-SWAPO
 returnees. The non-SWAPO political parties also accused UNTAG
 of failing to seek out vigorously persons detained by SWAPO
 whose repatriation SWAPO wished to prevent.
 
 
 255
 NiAMIBIA
 UNHCR's and UNTAG's inability to locate these SWAPO detainees
 in SWAPO or Angolan custody came under-particular criticism.
 SWAPO and the Angolan authorities either could or would not
 account fully for those believed to be missing.
 The dusk-to-dawn curfew in the northern operational area was
 lifted in early 1989, then reimposed during the April
 fighting. It was lifted again in May. During the voter
 registration process several observers claimed that Namibians
 living in Walvis Bay and traveling to Swakopmund were subject
 to delays and harassment at the border. UNTAG intervention
 with the authorities alleviated the problem.
 South Africa, through the Administrator-General, still
 provided travel documents to Namibians. These, however, were
 provided routinely to all Namibians not charged with or wanted
 for a criminal offense. Several senior SWAPO leaders have
 traveled to and from Namibia on South African passports. If*
 denied a passport, a Namibian could apply to the Minister of
 Home Affairs in South Africa. However, the Ministerdid not
 have to provide a reason for denial, and there was no right of
 appeal through the courts.
 There were no known deportations in 1989. The portions of the
 South West Africa Regulations Act which permitted deportation
 of aliens who threatened public order were repealed in June.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 In 1989, for the first time in their history, Namibians of all
 ethnic groups exercised this right over 5 days, November 7 to
 11, electing a Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution
 for an independent Namibia. Ten registered political parties
 contested the U.N.-supervised elections. SWAPO won the
 election, receiving 57 percent of the 670,830 votes cast--a
 turnout of more than 97 percent of the eligible voters. SWAPO
 gained 41 seats in the 72-seat Constituent Assembly, a
 majority, but not the two-thirds majority needed to adopt a
 constitution within the 1982 guidelines. The DTA, which
 dominated the Transitional Government since 1985, won 28
 percent of the vote and 21 seats in the Assembly. The
 remaining parties were: United Democratic Front, 4 seats;
 Action Christian National Party, 3 seats; Namibia National
 Front, 1 seat; National Patriotic Front, 1 seat; and Federal
 Convention of Namibia, 1 seat. The SRSG certified the
 elections as "free and fair," and the competing parties
 agreed.
 All parties cooperated in the initial work of the Constituent
 Assembly, which, in late December, adopted the Standing
 Committee's report on the outlines of a Namibian
 constitution. The report reflected the ideas on which all
 parties have agreed in principle: a 5-year term executive
 presidency; a bicameral legislature; protection of fundamental
 human rights; and national elections based on proportional
 representation. The Standing Committee was preparing a draft,
 in consultation with legal experts, which would be presented
 to the full Assembly in early 1990. The majority party along
 with others in the Assembly will determine how the government
 will be formed. The Constituent Assembly will likely
 transform itself into a national assembly, and no other
 nationwide elections are scheduled for the near future.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The attitude of the South African Government and the AG has
 undergone a dramatic change with the implementation of the UN
 Plan. Many observers from international human rights and
 humanitarian and religious organizations visited Namibia in
 1989 and traveled extensively throughout the country,
 conducting their own investigations of the independence
 process, police abuses, and the stories of the SWAPO
 detainees. Several human rights and information services
 established full-time offices in Namibia to monitor
 implementation.
 The Namibian Legal Assistance Center (LAC), which operates
 five offices in Namibia, assisted indigent defendants and has
 played an important role in political and security cases since
 its founding in 1988. The Center faced a court challenge from
 the AG's legal staff in mid-1989, but the Windhoek Supreme
 Court dismissed the AG's case in August, forcing an
 out-of-court settlement which fully recognized the right of
 the LAC to continue its work.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Much of the discrimination based on race built into the
 structure of the Namibian Government created by South Africa
 remained in place in 1989. Although the ethnically based
 second-tier executive and legislative authorities were
 abolished and their functions transferred to the AG, the
 separate second-tier civil services and schools were
 retained. As required by the U.N. Plan, only those laws
 prejudicial to the holding of free and fair elections were
 repealed, though many parties and observers demanded the
 complete abolition of all ethnic classifications,
 institutions, and authorities. The AG resisted this on the
 grounds that administrative chaos would ensue and that the
 complete restructuring of the Government should be left to the
 country's first independent government.
 Pending restructuring, the system of racial classification
 remained essentially the same as in 1988. Most Namibians
 carried an identity document under the Identification of
 Persons Act of 1979. This document identified them as members
 of one of the following ethnic groups: Ovambo, Whites,
 Damara, Herero, Kavango, Nama, Colored (mixed race),
 Kaokovelder, Bushmen, Rehoboth Baster, Caprivian, and Tswana.
 A large proportion of the taxes collected from a particular
 ethnic group stayed with that group, resulting in a gross
 disparity in the distribution of government revenues. The
 second-tier administration for the country's 80,000 whites had
 a budget of $23 million while the authority for the 650,000
 Ovambos (from which SWAPO derives its political base) had a
 budget of $350,000.
 Social facilities were generally open to all races, although
 private businesses could--and on occasion did--restrict
 clientele based on race, and a few refused to admit members of
 UNTAG. The law did not require segregation in housing, but
 economic factors produced essentially the same effect, with
 separate townships for blacks and coloreds remaining part of
 the structure of local municipalities. Some hospitals, such
 as the state hospital in Windhoek, admitted all patients but
 
 
 257
 NAMIT1A
 had separate wings for different races.
 Nonracial private schools have operated in the territory for
 several years; most are affiliated with the churches. The
 public schools were under the ethnic second-tier structure and
 were segregated. All of the political parties declared that
 upon independence public education would be integrated but
 some, such as the National Party, insisted that different
 ethnic groups should be allowed to maintain segregated private
 schools.
 Women continue to face discrimination in both the traditional
 and modern sectors, particularly in regard to financial and
 legal matters. The coming of independence is not likely to
 change this situation soon; discrimination is almost as deeply
 entrenched in the "liberation movement" as it is in the
 current Government. Under traditional practice, which was
 still in effect for a majority of the population, a woman is
 not independent. She is usually a ward of her father until
 she marries; then she is a ward of her husband. There is
 still de facto discrimination against women in employment in
 the modern sector.
 Family violence appears to be a deep-rooted and common
 problem. The cpurts treated cases of wife beating as
 assaults, but because of traditional attitudes regarding the
 subordination of women, most such cases did not get to court.
 The police do not normally interfere in domestic disputes.
 Some community groups and government bodies were targeting
 women in their development programs. Among these were the
 Council of Churches' Namibian Women's Voice, the Women of
 Namibia, and the Namibian Women's Organization in Ovamboland.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The legal right to associate in labor unions, long enjoyed by
 white and colored workers, was extended to blacks only in July
 1978. Black union membership has grown markedly over the last
 3 years. About 70 percent of all workers in the largest
 private sector of the economy, mining, are unionized. Union
 officials in 1989 claimed a membership of 50,000 out of a
 private sector work force of at least 230,000. The total work
 force is estimated at 400,000. The country's 20,000 to 30,000
 farm workers employed on white-owned farms remain unorganized,
 and many are subject to a regime of paternalistic
 authoritarianism that gives them little say regarding their
 conditions of employment and little access to outside
 assistance.
 Labor issues and politics are closely related; most of the
 unions with a majority of black workers are sympathetic
 towards SWAPO, and many union leaders are also SWAPO
 officials. For example, until his murder Anton Lubowski,
 SWAPO's sble white senior official, was Secretary of Finance
 and Administration of the National Union of Namibian Workers
 (NUNW). Unions are allowed to publicize their views and did
 so in the November elections.
 Namibian workers have and exercise the right to strike. With
 the approach of independence, politically motivated industrial
 action abated somewhat, but labor-management relations remain
 turbulent. Workers often stop work before observing all the
 required steps for the settlement of disputes which are
 
 
 258
 NAMIBIA
 mandated by local labor codes. Employers, in turn, have the
 right to dismiss legally or illegally striking employees, and
 in the past have done so with relative impunity. No sanctions
 are applied against the employer. During a legal strike an
 employer can try to reach an agreement with workers by means
 of a conciliatory board composed of management and union
 members. However, the employer is not compelled to reach a
 resolution, and in the case of an illegal strike, the employer
 has the right of lockout. Proclamation R. 101 of 1985, which
 contained a "bill of fundamental rights" that sought to
 restrict the advocacy and organization of work stayaways and
 boycotts, was repealed as part of the settlement process in
 July.
 In 1989 workers continued to strike individual firms over pay
 and other issues. The firing of a labor organizer from a
 local brewery resulted in a walkout of sympathetic workers in
 September. The brewery then dismissed the strikers. When the
 strikers gathered peacefully outside the brewery, reportedly
 to get their final paychecks, the police ordered them to
 disperse and then opened fire with plastic bullets, injuring a
 number of workers. This excessive use of force led to
 sympathy strikes against other firms owned by the holding
 company which owned the brewery; it also produced a boycott
 against the brewery by local black businessmen.
 Namibia has been a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) since 1978. Trade unions are free to
 affiliate with international trade union organizations. The
 ban on the NUNW, a SWAPO-affiliated body which operated from
 exile in Angola, has been lifted, and it is now operating
 publicly in Namibia. The NUNW is affiliated with the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Namibian Supreme Court recognized the right of collective
 bargaining without intervention by a government agency in
 1985. The Wiehanan Commission created in 1986 to revamp
 Namibia's outdated labor laws released its comprehensive
 report in February 1989. A second report was completed in
 December 1989 and outlines recommendations on changes in labor
 practices which may be considered by the independent
 government. The report covers international labor standards,
 conditions of service, labor relations, employment, training
 and development, social security, and labor administration and
 suggests the establishment of a special judicial body to deal
 with labor disputes. It also establishes a system of
 industrial courts. None of the commission's recommendations
 will automatically become policy; it will be up to the new
 government to draw up strategies and national labor policies.
 Namibia in 1989 used a method of resolving labor-management
 disputes through conciliation boards under the Wage and
 Industrial Council Ordinance. Under this approach, employees
 or employers have been able to apply to the South
 African-appointed Administrator-General (AG) to appoint a
 conciliation board composed of members of both management and
 the unions, whose decisions in principle become binding on
 both sides. The decisions in principle are binding if
 publicly declared so by the AG on the recommendation of the
 conciliation board. The board is composed of both management
 and union members with no independent arbitrator, a fact that
 can make it difficult to reach agreement. The conciliation
 
 
 259
 NAMIIA.
 board operates essentially on the basis of a gentlemen's
 agreement, because no law evokes sanctions against an
 employer. If a dispute cannot be resolved by the conciliation
 board, unions can seek the advice-of an independent mediator.
 Should this option fail, the two parties could turn to an
 arbitrator whose recommendations would be binding.
 General unions, i.e., unions representing workers in more than
 one industry, are permitted in Namibia. A major issue remains
 the recognition of unions by individual companies and whether
 these unions can then be registered with the AG. Unregistered
 union3 can bargain on behalf of their members if they are
 recognized by management, but they do not have access to
 conciliation boards. Disputes also have arisen, sometimes on
 political lines, over which union is entitled to represent the
 workers at a particular company. New wage concessions and a
 minimum wage were negotiated in the building industry in 1989.
 There are no export processing zones or offshore processing
 facilities in Namibia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law. The implementation of the
 U.N. Plan threw additional light on labor practices in the
 white farming sector. Reports by 17 former SWAPO fighters who
 were released from a police-run farm in September indicated
 that conditions amounting to forced labor existed in 1989.
 Illiterate and isolated farm workers in some instances
 received little compensation, were unable to leave the farm
 without the owner's permission, were forbidden to speak to
 outsiders, and were, in some cases, subject to physical
 punishment by their employers. In one court case in
 September, evidence given by witnesses revealed that workers
 on one farm were being paid as little as 30 cents a day; the
 farm workers resorted to poaching game to feed their families.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment across the board is 15.
 Minimum age regulations are generally enforced in the wage
 sector pursuant to the Employment Act of 1986, Section 12.
 However, children below the age of 15 often work on family
 farms and in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no statutory minimum wage in Namibia. Several unions
 adopted a "living wage," i.e., one adequate to provide a
 worker and his family with basic shelter, food, and clothing,
 as a theme in 1988 and 1989. However, trade union leaders
 have not settled on a figure. An unskilled worker in the
 mining sector earns an average $275 per month.
 Government-mandated occupational health and safety standards
 are similat to those found in South Africa, but enforcement of
 these standards outside the formal sector is slack. Improved
 safety conditions remained a strong union demand in the mining
 sector, particularly in the wake of an accident in November
 1988 which killed seven miners at the Kombat mine near
 Tsumeb. The inquest proceedings found the company had been
 negligent and was culpable for the deaths. Namibia also has
 legislation mandating leave (including maternity leave) and
 overtime standards. An employer cannot require a female to
 work in a factory 4 weeks before the expected birth date or 8
 
 
 260
 weeks after delivery.
 The standard legal workweek is 46 hours under the 1986
 Conditions of Employment Act, which also allows for 10 hours
 of overtime per week, at time and a third. The employee must
 freely agree to work overtime. Legally, an increase of more
 than 10 hours of overtime per week has to be approved by the
 Manpower Commission.
