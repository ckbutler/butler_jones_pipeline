 MADAGASCAR
 The Democratic Republic of Madagascar, the fourth largest
 island in the world, is governed by a president and a
 parliament (National Popular Assembly), both elected by direct
 universal suffrage. The President selects the members of the
 Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), the highest policymaking
 body. President Didier Ratsiraka, in power since 1975, has
 broad constitutional powers, and his position is further
 strengthened by the influential role played by his political
 party, the Vanguard of the Malagasy Revolution (AREMA), which
 holds an overwhelming majority in the National Popular
 Assembly. Elections are actively contested within the
 controlled political framework sanctioned by the Government.
 This framework permits political activity by only the seven
 parties making up the National Front for the Defense of the
 Revolution. The Front, established in 1976 by the Malagasy
 Constitution, was conceived as a unifying framework for
 building socialism in Madagascar while allowing for party
 diversity. No legal political parties exist outside of the
 Front, which is a kind of surrogate for a single-party state.
 The political orientation of the seven parties in the National
 Front ranges from moderate and pro-Western to radical and
 pro-Soviet.
 The Malagasy internal security system is composed of the urban
 police force and the National Gendarmerie, the latter having
 jurisdiction in the provinces. On occasion, the National
 People's Army is also used for internal security purposes.
 Starting in 1982, the Government reversed its long-standing
 Socialist policies, which had led to wide-scale
 nationalization of agriculture, industry, and commerce and to
 economic stagnation. At that time, the Government introduced,
 with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, an
 austerity program involving major reforms,'including
 devaluation of the Malagasy franc and moves to privatize many
 of the 300 government-controlled companies. This program has
 begun to show positive results, especially in the production
 and marketing of rice. However, economic growth (2 percent in
 1987) has not kept pace with population growth (3 percent),
 real incomes have declined, and unemployment remains high,
 especially among the youth (60 percent of the population is
 under age 25).
 Although fundamental liberties and individual rights are
 guaranteed by the Constitution, several of these rights, such
 as freedom of assembly, are restricted in practice or are
 subject to exclusionary clauses in most laws. In 1988 the
 Government easied some press restrictions but continued to
 censor articles that criticized directly the Government and
 the "SocialistRevolution." In February Madagascar finally
 held the long-awaited "kung-fu" trial, in which 245
 practitioners of this martial art were tried for a variety of
 offenses, including endangering the security of the State.
 Most of the 245 had been-provisionally released after arrest
 in 1985, but 37 had been held in preventive detention for over
 2 years and without charge until November 1987. The speedy
 6-day trial resulted in 29 people receiving prison sentences
 that were either suspended or shorter than the time they had
 already served, thus bringing about their immediate release.
 All charges were dropped against the others.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 While there have been recurring rumors of politically
 motivated killings in recent years, there has been no
 conclusive evidence to substantiate such rumors. In 1988 four
 separate murders of clergymen again raised speculation that
 the Catholic Church, whose officials often speak out on
 controversial issues, is being targeted by unknown political
 groups to silence church criticism.
 In 1988 the Government undertook a major campaign, involving
 military and police forces, to eradicate the well-armed and
 burgeoning cattle rustling and banditry endemic to the
 southern areas of Madagascar. By June the Government
 announced that over 200 bandits had been killed in security
 operations and an even larger number of persons had been
 arrested, including at least 50 local officials. According to
 unconfirmed reports, many of the 200 or more dead had been
 caught by law and order forces while committing a crime and
 were summarily executed.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of politically motivated
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While there were no documented cases of physical torture
 occurring in Madagascar, some organizations in the security
 apparatus, notably the state secret police, have a reputation
 for ruthless methods. The kung-fu prisoners allegedly
 suffered from very cruel treatment while in detention. There
 have also been credible reports of the alleged use of torture
 by the armed forces in the Government's campaign against
 outlaw bandits in Madagascar's southwest.
 Malagasy prisons are increasingly inhumane in terms of living
 conditions. Some prisoners are not fed regularly, medical
 care is not provided, infections are commonplace, prisoners
 rarely have the opportunity to wash, and clothing is not
 provided. The death toll rises significantly among prisoners
 during the cold winter months. Amnesty International's (AI)
 1988 report is critical of this situation and notes that it
 has received reports indicating at least one prisoner died
 each day in early 1987 in Antanimora prison. Causes were
 believed to range from malnourishment to malaria and
 tuberculosis.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In a normal criminal case, the accused must be charged or
 released within 3 days after arrest. Generally, defendants in
 ordinary criminal/civil cases are charged formally within the
 specified time frame and, upon being charged, are allowed to
 obtain an attorney. Counsel is readily available, and
 court-appointed counsel is provided for indigents.
 
 
 191
 MADAGASCAR
 Under Malagasy law, persons suspected of activity against the
 State may be detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to
 indefinite extension if considered necessary by the
 Government. In particular, the Government has held detainees
 in security cases for extended periods, as with the 37 kung fu
 adherents. Also, certain defendants involved in coup-plotting
 cases have been held in pretrial detention for periods ranging
 from 20 months to over 5 years. Since the release of the kung
 fu defendants, there has been no evidence of other arbitrary
 political detentions.
 Exile has not been used as a means of control in the recent
 past. However, in January the Malagasy Supreme Court rejected
 the appeal of two military officers on their conviction in
 1983 of plotting against the security of the State, possession
 of unauthorized arms, and other charges. One officer's
 sentence of internal exile ("deportation") was upheld. This
 term means that the prisoner is incarcerated in a prison on an
 island off the main national territory.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malagasy Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary, and in practice the judiciary seems to function
 without outside influence from the executive.
 The judiciary has three levels of courts: lower courts for
 civil and criminal cases carrying limited fines and sentences,
 a Court of Appeals which includes a Criminal Court for cases
 bearing sentences of 5 years or more, and a Supreme Court.
 The judiciary also has a number of special courts designed to
 handle specific kinds of cases under the jurisdiction of the
 higher courts. A Constitutional High Court, with a totally
 separate and autonomous status, may review the
 constitutionality of laws, decrees, and ordinances and ensures
 the legality of elections. Although the Chairman of the
 National Popular Assembly can seek a ruling on the
 constitutionality of proposed laws, this judicial review
 function is in practice most often performed at the request of
 the President. For example, he may request an advisory
 opinion before sending proposed legislation to the Assembly
 for a vote, or after receiving legislation from the Assembly
 before promulgating it into law. A High Court of Justice,
 charged with prosecuting malfeasance in the Government, is
 provided for in the Constitution but has never come into
 existence. A Military Court has jurisdiction over all cases
 involving national security. The definition of national
 security is largely a matter of interpretation by the
 authorities, but includes acts constituting a threat to the
 nation and its political leaders, invasion by foreign forces,
 and riots that could lead to an overthrow of the Government.
 In exceptional cases, civilians may be tried in the Military
 Court if they are charged with having broken military laws.
 The kung-fu trials took place in February in an ordinary
 criminal court in the presence of a jury. The trial was
 public, and human rights monitors from the Christian Council
 of Churches were permitted to attend. Once the 245 cases came
 to trial, the proceedings were conducted fairly and quickly,
 according to most observers. In 1984-85 these martial arts
 enthusiasts had been involved in street battles with a
 government-sponsored paramilitary youth group, and later with
 the army. The Government, which had come to perceive the
 
 
 192
 MADAGASCAR
 popular kung-fu devotees as a threat, proscribed the practice
 of kung-fu. When the ban was ignored, troops sent to attack
 the movement's headquarters in July 1985 killed the leader of
 the movement and at least 20 followers, according to
 government sources.
 At the end of 1988, there were no known political prisoners,
 and none of the students who were arrested following student
 demonstrations in 1987 remained in prison.
 The Government showed interest in 1988 in learning about other
 judicial systems and appreciated the visit of U.S. Supreme
 Court Justice O'Connor.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The State does not generally intervene in nonpolitical aspects
 of the lives of the people. The home is inviolable under
 Malagasy law, and there are no provisions for entering private
 premises without a search warrant. This protection does not
 apply, however, in the case of a declaration of a state of
 emergency or a state of siege. In their suppression of
 kung-fu gangs, for example, the military entered some homes
 without court orders and ransacked them.
 The Malagasy may make their own decisions, without government
 coercion or interference, in such matters as changing jobs or
 residence, marriage, having children, and joining permitted
 political parties or social organizations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Private citizens have freedom to criticize government
 officials and policies without fear of arrest by the local
 authorities, but such criticism must be carefully worded.
 Direct criticism of the President or the "Socialist
 Revolution" is not tolerated.
 Madagascar has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa,
 and Malagasy citizens attach great importance to the press,
 which often has an impact on the nation's policymaking
 apparatus. The press covers critically a range of policy
 issues, such as economic management. However, the Government
 through the Ministry of Interior reviews the content of
 newspapers prior to printing. When censorship is enforced,
 the newspaper leaves blank those columns where the offending
 articles would have appeared. In instances of violations of
 censorship, the Ministry has used its administrative authority
 to suspend publication. In 1988 the Government allowed
 previously barred journalists from a foreign newspaper to
 visit Madagascar, and it lifted an 8-year old ban on the
 Paris-based weekly Jeune Afrique. Earlier, the locally
 published regional magazine, Indian Ocean Review, contained
 several blank pages where an article on the call for a
 national debate was to have appeared. There is one
 government-owned newspaper. One of two major independently
 owned newspapers stopped publication in 1988 due to financial
 difficulties. Several other dailies and weeklies are
 published by party groups and independent publishers,
 including the outspoken and candid Catholic newspaper,
 Lakroa. The Government owns the radio and television stations.
 
 
 193
 MADAGASCAR
 Academic freedom is respected in theory. However, any public
 lectures or teachings which condemn Madagascar's Charter of
 the Socialist Revolution would be violating the Constitution.
 The Government announced the decentralization of Madagascar's
 university from one university with six regional campuses into
 six separate self-governing universities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are restricted.
 Permits are required to hold public meetings and can be denied
 by the Government if officials believe that the meeting poses
 a threat to the State or endangers national security. Those
 denied a permit can appeal these decisions before the
 administrative chamber of the Supreme Court. Persons and
 groups belonging to parties of the National Front are
 permitted to organize and assemble. Nevertheless, since
 political activity by groups outside the National Front is
 prohibited, dissenting political opinion is limited.
 Widespread student unrest, which occurred in 1987 in
 opposition to educational reform measures announced by the
 Government, did not recur in 1988. However, student
 organizations and government officials did meet to discuss
 possible solutions to resolve a serious shortage of campus
 housing, which has led to a widely publicized "squatter"
 problem, with some students living in classrooms.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government is secular, and there is no official religion.
 There is no discrimination on the basis of religious
 affiliation, and persons are free to follow the faith of their
 choice. Over half of the population is Christian, with the
 remainder following traditional Malagasy religious beliefs or
 other faiths. Missionaries and clergy are generally permitted
 to operate freely. The Catholic Church has been particularly
 active in raising political consciousness among the
 economically deprived. In 1988 the Government banned an
 organization affiliated with the Catholic Church from holding
 a national political debate on the state and future of the
 nation. The separate murders of four Catholic clergymen in
 1988 added fuel to rumors of a political campaign of violence
 against the Church. However, there has been no evidence to
 link the four killings to such a campaign.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Officially there is no restriction on travel within the
 country. However, since May 1988, the start of the campaign
 to eradicate cattle rustling, villagers in the southwest must
 get permission to leave their villages. For all Malagasy,
 official approval must be obtained for trips outside the
 country, but there has been only one known instance in which
 approval was denied due to the person's political views.
 Foreign travel is impeded by the difficulty in obtaining
 foreign currency. The Malagasy franc is not convertible
 abroad, and the Government limits the amount of hard currency
 that can be obtained for foreign travel. There is no refugee
 population in Madagascar.
 
 
 194
 MADAGASCAR
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The electorate's choice is constrained by the nature of the
 political system, since the only political parties allowed to
 operate in Madagascar are those which are members of the
 National Front. However, there exists a range of ideological
 and policy views among the seven Front parties, and within
 this spectrum there are viewpoints represented that are at
 odds with the policies of the administration. Thus, the
 electoral process does give the voters a chance to choose
 among candidates expressing differing views in local and
 regional elections, as well as in the parliamentary and
 presidential campaigns.
 The 137 members of the National Popular Assembly are elected
 by universal suffrage for 5-year terms. The President is
 elected to a 7-year term. The next elections for both are now
 scheduled for 1989 after the Supreme Revolutionary Council, in
 October 1987, extended the terms of the Assembly deputies by 9
 months for, according to official reports, economic reasons.
 The electoral process, although not completely free from
 irregularities, has been essentially straightforward in recent
 elections. The political system in Madagascar also reflects a
 considerable degree of regional balance.
 The President controls all major policy decisions. Most
 legislation is initiated by the executive branch. Legislation
 originated by legislators is passed to the executive for
 review and approval before coming up for a vote in the
 Assembly.
 Women have a lengthy tradition of involvement in high-level
 political activity, and currently women are members of the
 Cabinet, the Supreme Revolutionary Council, and the Assembly.
 Women are also very active and play major roles in the various
 political parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not cooperated with groups wishing to
 investigate alleged human rights violations and has denied
 visas to AI representatives. When the President's opponent in
 the 1982 election campaign called for supervision of the
 elections by AI, the President rejected the proposal as being
 in derogation of national sovereignty. In the absence of
 private human rights groups, the Christian churches in the
 country have taken the lead in advocating human rights.
 Although the Government is sensitive to allegations of human
 rights abuses, it has not officially responded to questions or
 criticisms from the churches or any other group.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Madagascar is inhabited by an estimated 10.3 million people of
 both Malayo-Polynesian and African origin. While there
 appears to be no customary practice of institutional or
 systematic discrimination on the basis of ethnic grouping in
 Madagascar, a serious outbreak of violence and plunder of
 Indian-owned property occurred across Madagascar in March
 1987. This prosperous community, estimated at some 18,000
 persons of Indian origin and referred to locally as "karana,"
 
 
 195
 MADAGASCAR
 is primarily engaged in commerce. While no Indians died in
 these riots, several looters were killed, many were wounded
 and property damage was great. The simultaneous outbreak of
 these riots in cities across the island and the relative
 absence of damage outside the Indian community gave rise to
 speculation that these incidents were carefully coordinated
 and organized. There was some speculation that these
 anti-Indian riots may have been orchestrated by the
 Government. The Chinese and French communities also have
 experienced some resentment from the Malagasy, mainly because
 of their success in commerce.
 Madagascar has what is essentially a matriarchal society, and
 a highly visible role for women has long been recognized as an
 integral part of the country's sociological framework. Women
 have a prominent role in the business and economic life of the
 country, with many of them managing or owning business
 concerns or filling management positions in state industries.
 Education at all levels is open to women. However, women in
 rural areas and among the urban poor face a greater degree of
 hardship. In addition to the responsibilities associated with
 raising a family, the realities of subsistence agriculture
 force these women to engage in farm labor and related
 activities.
 While women are not discriminated against in the workplace,
 discrimination does exist in marriage and property rights. In
 the case of divorce or the death of the husband, the wife
 inherits only one-third of their joint wealth. On the other
 hand, the wife receives a pension if her husband dies, but the
 reverse is not true. Women's rights groups as such do not
 exist, but groups of professional women and women within the
 political parties are working to change these aspects of
 family law.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor force of 4.9 million is mostly agrarian (85
 percent), and union labor accounts for less than 5 percent of
 the total. The Malagasy have the right to establish and join
 labor unions and to strike. In reality, strikes in Madagascar
 are a rarity because of the severe unemployment problem and
 the politicization of the labor federations. However, there
 are occasional wildcat strikes. In these, the Government
 generally sides with management for the restoration of order.
 Of the nine national labor organizations in existence, seven
 are affiliated with the seven political parties within the
 National Front for the Defense of the Revolution. The
 remaining two unions in 1979 signed a protocol of agreement
 with the dominant political union in the nation pledging
 support for the Malagasy "Socialist Revolution." The primary
 focus of the unions is party politics, and they are usually
 active only during election campaigns.
 Given the small fraction of Madagascar's population which is
 unionized, labor unions play an insignificant role in national
 life. Several of the unions are members of the World
 Federation of Trade Unions based in Prague, or of the World
 Confederation of Labor. One union, the Confederation of
 Malagasy Workers, has links with the Brussels-based
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 
 
 196
 MADAGASCAR
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Union activity is governed by the Malagasy Labor Code of May
 18, 1975 which guarantees free unions and the right to bargain
 collectively. The Labor Code, which covers all workers except
 for civil servants and the merchant marine, prescribes an
 arbitration procedure which must be followed in
 labor/management disputes. Should this procedure not lead to
 a settlement, workers individually, or as represented by a
 union, may call a strike. There are no export processing
 zones in Madagascar, labor legislation is applied uniformly
 throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor in Madagascar within the definition
 set forth by the International Labor Organization.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Malagasy Labor Code describes a child as any person,
 regardless of gender, under the age of 18. The minimum age
 for employment is 14, but the use of child labor is prohibited
 in those areas where there is apparent and imminent danger.
 In reality, many young children work with their parents in the
 rural areas on family farms. In the urban areas many children
 earn a living as parking attendants, newspaper vendors, etc.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Malagasy Labor Code and its enforcing legislation describe
 the working conditions for employees. Malagasy law
 distinguishes between agricultural and nonagricultural work.
 There is a 44-hour workweek in nonagricultural and service
 industries. There are also provisions for holiday pay, sick
 and maternity leave, and insurance. There are several minimum
 wages in Madagascar according to categories of work. The
 lowest (for unskilled workers) is approximately $20 per month
 and is inadequate to ensure the average family a decent
 standard of living.
 The Labor Code has rules concerning building safety, machinery
 and moving engines, operational safety, and sanitation
 standards. It appears that, in practice, the rules and
 regulations of the Code are adhered to by employers and are
 enforced by the authorities. Labor inspectors carry out
 regular visits to industrial work sites. Violations of
 safety, sanitary, operational, and other Work Code laws are
 the subject of reports by these inspectors. If the violations
 are not remedied within a specified time frame, the violators
 are legally charged and subject to various penalties.
