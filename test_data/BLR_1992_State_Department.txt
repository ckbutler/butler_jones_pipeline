 BELARUS
 Belarus declared independence in 1991 after the failed Moscow coup. It subse-
 quently embarked on a cautious path of economic and political reform and took
 steps to strengthen itself as an independent state. Popular elections have yet to be
 held in Belarus, and a new constitution has not yet been approved. Its form of gov-
 ernment continues to parallel closely that of the former Soviet Union. The Supreme
 Soviet, the legislative branch, is technically the highest ruling body of the country;
 
 
 710
 
 its Chairman, Stanislav Shushkevich, is Head of State. However, with the 1991 de-
 mise of the Communist Party of Belarus, most power passed to the Council of Min-
 isters, headed by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. The Council wields executive
 power and issues decrees that have the force of law. It remains dominated by ex-
 Communist Party members, as does the Supreme Soviet. The nationalist Belarusian
 Popular Front (BNF) is the principal opposition poup. In 1992 it spearheaded a
 massive petition drive to force a referendum on dissolving the Supreme Soviet and
 holding new elections. Although the petition garnered 380,000 certified signatures,
 more than the 350,000 required by law, the Supreme Soviet rejected the referendum
 on October 29 on purported legal grounds.
 In January the Supreme Soviet passed a resolution removing the Belarusian Com-
 mittee for State Security (KGB) from the jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers and
 placing it temporarily under parliamentary supervision. In reality, the KGB contin-
 ues to report to the Council of Ministers as well as to Supreme Soviet Chairman
 Shushkevich. The KGB appeared to have undergone reform; opponents of the Gov-
 ernment reported no harassment from security services in 1992. The armed forces
 did not appear to involve themselves in domestic law enforcement. There were no
 reported human rights violations on the part of the military with the exception of
 te practice of hazing which reportedly continues much the way it was practiced in
 the former Soviet Umon. There have been reports of excessive use of force by police
 on detainees.
 Belarus has a centrally planned economy in which state-owned enterprises domi-
 nate. The Government announced its intention to pursue market reform of the
 largely state-owned economy. Parliament adopted laws on investment, enterprises,
 and bankruptcy and debated draft laws on property, demonopolization, and privat-
 ization. Continuing to subsidize foodstuffs and other basic goods in order to prevent
 social strife, the  vernment made clear that it prefers social stability to a quick
 transition to a market economy. Rather than close down, many factories gave work-
 ers mandatory unpaid vacations and cut workweeks back to 4 days or less. The
 economy remains highly dependent on that of the Russian Federation for energy
 supplies and other raw materials. Approximately 80 percent of Belarusian exports
 go to Russia.
 In spite of the limited extent of political reform, respect for human rights in
 Belarus progressed in some areas, including freedom of travel, freedom of speech,
 and freedom of worship. The Government did not attempt to suppress political activ-
 ity. However, freedom of the press came under strain because of the Government's
 apparent desire to limit media criticism of its actions through the use of slander
 laws, and because of its continuing sponsorship of the largest circulation daily news-
 papers. In addition, the Government s considerable progress with respect to freedom
 of religion was compromised by its dispute with the Roman Catholic Church over
 the latter's status in Belarus and its accusations that the Catholic Church was at-
 tempting "Polonization" of the western regions of Belarus (see Section 2.c.). Elec-
 tronic monitoring of residences and telephones reportedly continues.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence that such
 killings occurred.
 b. isappearance. .-There were no reports of abductions, disappearances, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The current Belarusian Constitution provides for inviolability of the person but con-
 tains no explicit ban on torture and other degrading forms of pumshment. There
 have been reports of police beatings in prisons and detention centers. The use of
 physical force against prisoners is officially sanctioned in some instances. For exam-
 ple, it is employed on prisoners found harming or threatening to harm other pris-
 oners or prison personnel. The Government says it monitors and keeps statistics on
 the use of force by prison guards. Prison authorities must report each incident of
 the use of force by prison guards to the General Prosecutor's office. A medical eval-
 uation of the prisoner is also required when force has been used. The new draft con-
 stitution expressly forbids torture and cruel and unusual punishment.
 There were numerous reports that prison conditions were substandard and treat-
 ment degrading. At the Orshankskaya prison in Orsha, inmates complained of over-
 crowding (three times intended prison capacity) and of the denial of hospital care
 to seriously ill inmates. Similar problems appear to exist at the No. 15 prison in
 Grodno, where serious outbreaks of tuberculosis were reported. The authorities at-
 tribute crison conditions to lack of canacitv. the extra burden of Relarusian oris-
 
 
 711
 oners being returned from Russia and Ukraine, decaying physical plant, and local
 neighborhood movements opposed to the construction of new prisons.
 Cruel and degrading treatment of military conscripts a previous practice in the
 former Soviet Union, remained a problem in Belarus in 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Ex&i -Criminal procedures remain similar to
 those in the former Soviet Union. Persons may be detained arbitrarily and without
 an arrest warrant. The criminal code, however, requires that detainees be charged
 or released within 72 hours. Once arrested and charged, defendants may spend
 many months awaiting trial. At the request of the state prosecutor, a detainee may
 be kept in pretrial detention for up to 3 months. This period can be extended even
 further at the request of either the regional or the republic state prosecutors, for
 a maximum term of 1  years in pretrial detention. Up to half of all persons de-
 tained for serious crimes are held in pretrial detention at some point. Detainees
 may be visited by their counsel withoutlimitation, although reportedly some detain-
 ees had difficulty in gaining access to an attorney. There is no pretrial release or
 bail for detainees, who may not correspond or receive family visitors without the ex-
 press permission of the state prosecutor.
 e. Denial c( a Fair Public Tria.-The court system, retaining much of the struc-
 ture of the Soviet system, has three tiers: district, city or oblast (province), and re-
 public. Higher courts serve as appellate courts but many also hear trials in the first
 instance. Lacking an adequate understanding of the role of an independent judici-
 ary, some judges continue to be influenced by the political leadership.
 Trials are generally public, although they may be closed on grounds of national
 security. In practice, however, attendance at open trials may be arbitrarily re-
 stricted. For example, at the June trial of Supreme Soviet Deputy Yevgeniy Novlkov
 on slander charges, there were credible reports opposition deputies and journalists
 were not allowed to be present.
 Defendants have the right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses, and present
 evidence. The court appoints an attorney for defendants who do not have one. There
 have been reports that some defendants had difficulty in gaining access to lawyers
 and court materials. Although technically the burden of proof is on the prosecutor,
 as a practical matter the presumption of innocence is not always strictly observed.
 There were no reAorts of political prisoners in Belarusian prisons in 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 Government efforts to reform the KGB, electronic monitoring of residences and tele-
 phones reportedly continued. Permission of a prosecutor is legally required before
 a wiretap may be installed. Except in cases of pursuit, a search warrant, issued by
 the prosecutor, is needed in order to enter a private home.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although freedom of the press is provided for
 in existing legislation, it has yet to be fully observed in practice. The Government
 reportedly attempted to use laws on slander to clamp down on unwanted criticism
 of government actions. The monthly opposition newspaper Svoboda was the subject
 of repeated law suits and was charged with libel and fined for publishing materials
 critical of officials. An independent newspaper in Grodno also faced and lost a simi-
 lar lawsuit. The trial of Supreme Soviet Deputy Novikov was indicative of a possible
 official desire to limit criticism of the Government. The Government's use of slander
 laws appeared to be an attempt by the Government to encourage self-censorship.
 Journalists not working for the small independent press (or newspapers from Rus-
 sia) came under pressure to limit or soften material critical of the Government. The
 Government's information division held weekly meetings with the editors of govern-
 ment-sponsored newspapers at which content and editorial policy were discussed.
 During 1992 the largest circulation newspapers experienced financial difficulties
 connected with the price reform. Five such newspapers appealed to the Government
 for additional financial help. The Government responded by becoming their chief fi-
 nancial backer, which gave it a say in what should or may be published.
 Prime Minister Kebich reportedly said he intended to provide financial support
 to all the press except publications opposing the Government. Supreme Soviet
 Chairman Shushkevich expressed displeasure with this state of affairs and opposed
 the trend toward monopolization of the press in government hands. The opposition
 BNF introduced legislation that would forbid the Government from having control
 of more than one newspaper. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Information introduced a
 draf piece of legislation that would provide the stats-controlled press-but not the
 independent newspaper publishers-with significant tax benefits.
 Nearly all radio and television stations are owned by the Stats (with the exception
 of cable stations that generally do not air news programs and are dependent on gov-
 ernment-owned facilities). Increasingly over the course of the year, broadcast news
 
 
 712
 tended to take positions favorable to the Government. Sharp criticism of the Govern-
 ment and its leadership was usually avoided. Belarusians continued to receive tele-
 vision and radio broadcasts from the Russian Federation, including the television
 station Ostankino from Moscow. Recently the national State Television-Radio Com-
 pany of Belarus denied the opposition BNF (along with other organizations) a re-
 quest for air time to voice its views. The stated reason for the denial was that, if
 it granted free television air time to the Popular Front, it would have to grant it
 to all other political parties. However, this appeared to be an effort on the part of
 the Government to avoid giving air time to the principal opposition.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Demonstrations are still gov-
 erned by the old Soviet law on demonstrations which requires application to local
 officials 10 days in advance. No denials of permission to hold demonstrations were
 reported in 1992. Public demonstrations occurred frequently. Both the opposition
 BNF and the pro-Communist opposition often use Minsk's main square to dem-
 onstrate their disagreements with the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religimoi-Freedom of religion is respected in Belarus. In December
 the Supreme Soviet passed a law on freedom of religious beliefs and organizations
 which prvides wide guarantees for freedom of religion. Religious organizations are
 allowed t engage in cultural, educational, and charitable activities. However, there
 is still some bureaucratic antipathy toward religion in general and toward the major
 churches and the Jewish community in particular.
 There is no state religion, but the overwhelming majority of Belarusians are Or-
 thodox Christians, and the September celebration of the millennium of Orthodox
 Christianity in Belarus received wide government support. The Orthodox Church in
 Belarus remains formally linked to the Russian Orthodox Church and recognizes the
 primacy of the Moscow Patriarch. Belarusian nationalists, such as those in the BNF,
 have strongly criticized the Church for being too closely tied to Moscow and not
 doing enough to serve the national interests of Belarus.
 The Roman Catholic Church in Belarus claims some 1.5 million members, roughly
 15 percent of the population. Relations between the Church and the Government are
 strained due to the historical association of the Church with Poland, which ruled
 the western part of Belarus as recently as 1939. The Government has not yet offi-
 cially recognized Archbishop Kazimir Svyontek as the head of the Church in
 Belars, ostensibly because he is a Belarusian of Polish origin. The Government
 Svyontek and Polish priests with agitating for Poland (including displaying
 POlh flagsand symbols) and engaging in a purposeful policy of Polonization of the
 western regions of Belarus, where Polish influence remains strong. At Svyontek's di-
 rection, these activities have ceased. Priests from Poland have ministered to Roman
 Catholic congregations in Belarus because the one Catholic seminary in Grodno can-
 not meet the demand for Catholic priests in Belarus. The Government asked some
 Polish priests to leave the country for engaging in activities not in accordance with
 their visa status and stated that Belarus would prefer Catholic missionaries from
 any Slavic country other than Poland to minister to Catholics in Belarus. Belarus
 established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in November.
 The State is in the process of returning churches previously confiscated by the So-
 viet government to the Orthodox and Roman Catholic religious organizations. This
 process led to numerous property disputes between the Churches and the State as
 well as between the two Churches. Other organizations that occupy what was once
 church property are also involved. Local officials reportedly showed favoritism in
 preferring to meet the requests of the Orthodox Church to those of the Catholic
 Church.
 In addition to the Catholic and Orthodox churches, 16 other religious sects freely
 function in Belarus. Baptists have reported a tolerant attitude towards their work
 on the part of the Government. For example, the city of Minsk provided 8 hectares
 to the local Baptist church to build a retirement home and medical facility.
 The remaining Jewish community in Belarus has a correct if not cordial relation-
 ship with the State. The community's concerns are focused on three major issues.
 The first is the restoration of buildings for its use, especially previously confiscated
 syagogues which have been turned into theaters, warehouses, and meeting halls.
 Unlike many previously confiscated Christian churches, no confiscated synaggue
 has been returned to the Jewish community. The second is the construction of a
 building on an old Jewish cemetery in Pinsk. Following growing international pro-
 test and pressure, the Government recently ordered local authorities to cease con-
 struction at the site. The third issue is maintaining the vitality of the Jewish com-
 munity in the face of the continuing wave of emigration to Israel, Western Europe,
 and the United States. Although the absolute number of Jewish emigrants has fall-
 en since 1990. a substantial outflow of Belarusian Jews continues.
 
 
 713
 Visits of foreign evangelists and religious leaders were numerous during 1992.
 Missionaries from many countries are active in Belarus. Bibles and other religious
 materials are available for sale in the Belarusian, Russian, and Polish languages.
 Rallies were held in public stadiums with official permission and with no attempt
 at government interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Fo'   Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Belarusian citizens were T eneraly   rmove about within the coun-
 try. All adults are still issued interna passports, which serve as primary identity
 documents and are required for travel and hotel registration.
 The right to choose one's place of residence, although guaranteed by law, was re-
 stricted in practice. Despite its formal abolition by the Soviet government in October
 1991, the "proeiska" (pass) system survived in Belarus; under it, all Belarusians are
 officially required to register their place of residence and may not change their resi-
 dences without official permission. The authorities limited the number of residence
 permits in Minsk and the five regional centers of Brest, Grodno, Mogilev Vitebsk,
 and Gomel. The Supreme Soviet reviewed this system of mandatory residence reg-
 istration in 1992, and the Interior Ministry's draft law on registration proposes its
 abolition.
 The Ministry of the Interior has also sent a draft law to the Supreme Soviet for
 review that would liberalize foreign travel procedures for Belarusian citizens. If
 adopted, it would abolish altogether the prerequisite of mandatory official permis-
 sion for travel abroad. The proposed law would also reduce the number of jobs offi-
 cially classified as ving access to "state secrets." Under the new law, would-be emi-
 grants denied uner the "state secrets" prvision would have the right to appeal
 their refusal to the Council of Ministers or, if refused again, to the Supreme Court.
 If denied by the Supreme Court, refuseniks could then rea pply after 6 months and
 demand a new investigation into the case. The case woul no Io  r be under the
 jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. The new law apparently will not change the
 current 5-year term of refusal based on "access to state secrets." The Supreme So-
 viet is expected to pass the law in 1993.
 However, pending its approval, the former Soviet procedures remained largely in
 effect, including Soviet legislation restricting emigration by those with access to
 'state secrets." Six would- be emigrants were refused exit visas to Israel in 1992 on
 grounds of access to state secrets. Belarusian draft-age men who had not yet com-
 pleted their obligatory military service were also restricted from emigating. The So-
 yiet-era requirement that Be arusian citizens obtain an exit visa efore traveling
 was still strictly enforced in 1992 but was dropped as of January 1, 1993. Woul-
 be emigrants and travelers no longer needed an invitation from a irst-degree rel-
 ative. Instead, they could submit an invitation from any relative or friend abroad.
 Many m    ere Belarusians were able to travel abroad than in previous years, but most
 were either government officials or businessmen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change theirgovernment although guaranteed by law, has
 not yet been tested in free elections. The current P'arhient was chosen for a five-
 year term under Soviet election rules in 1990. Voting is secret and suffrage isuni-
 versal for citizens 18 years of age and older. The BNF spearheaded a massive signa-
 ture-gathering campaign in the spring an effort to force a referendum on holig
 new parliamentary elections, gathering over 385,000 verified signatures. When the
 Central Election Co   ission certified the signatures and presented the petition to
 the Supreme Soviet for consideration, the Supreme Sovet hastily adjourned on
 April 29. When it reconvened in October, it rejected the referendum, alleging that
 bth the initiating group and the Election Commission had violated the referendum
 law. The opposition argued that this further undermined the Government's claim to
 legitimacy.
 At the same time that it Rjected the proposed referendum, the Supreme Soviet
 passed a nonbinding resoluti  declaring as priority goals the passage of a new con-
 stitution by 1993 and the holding of new elections in March 1994, a year earlier
 than mandated by the current Constitution. A drat of the new constitution is under
 review in the   r S     oviet. Foreign legal experts have reviewed the document
 and found it significantly inadequate in numerous areas, most notably that of citi-
 zen rights.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of womenn  n politics and g-
 ernent. Social barriers to women in politics, however, remain fairly strong, and
 oost top leadership positions are held by men. Women hold no ministerial-level po-
 sitions and less than 5 percent of seats in Parliament. A number of women do, how-
 ever, hold posts at the vice-ministerial level.
 
 
 714
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 estigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights monitors reported bureaucratic obstacles and posturing on the p art
 of the Government when investigating alleged human rights violations. The
 Belarusian League of Human Rights was founded in October and plans, according
 to its founders, to investigate alleged human rights violations and to invite inter-
 national human rights groups to Belarus for the same purpose. The League has not
 been in existence long enough to affect government behavior in a signifcant way.
 The Government has not hindered the travel of international human rights groups
 to or in Belarus.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The law on citizenship, passed by the Supreme Soviet, grants citizenship to any
 peron ling permanently on the territory of Belarus as of October 19, 1991. Those
 coming to Belarus after this date and wishing to become a citizen must submit an
 application, know Belarusian ("enough for communication"), agree to support the
 Uonstitution and laws, have a legal source of income, and have lived in the country
 for 7 years. (The 7-year residence requirement is waived for those who were pre-
 viously citizens of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and for those who are
 currentl in the armed forces, who wish to become citizens, and who are prepared
 to take te oath of allegiance to Belarus.)
 Belarusians account or about 78 percent of the population of over 10 million; 13
 percent are Russians, 4 percent Poles, 3 percent Ukrainians, and there are Lithua-
 nians and Jews among the remaining 2 percent. Tensions between nationalities are
 minor. The Belarusian language was made the official language, but Russian re-
 mains the predominant working language, with most Belarusians speaking Russian
 at home. The introduction of Belarusian as the mandatory language of instruction
 in schools is being phased in gradually. A movement is under way to make Russian
 the second official language of the country.
 Official anti-Semitism occurred under Soviet rule. In an unprecedented develop-
 ment, the prosecutor of Belarus instituted a criminal case against an openly anti-
 Semitic newspaper for incitement of ethnic hatred.
 Statistics are not available on the incidence of abuse directed against women.
 Some fledgling women's rights organizations are attempting to increase awareness
 of women a issues in the country. Domestic violence against women, often alcohol
 related, is a significant problem in Belarus. In addition to the regular court system,
 there are "communal courts" where women can use pressure from friends, neigh-
 bors, and coworkers to help rectify such situations.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The independent trade union movement is still in
 its nascent stages in Belarus. Although several significant independent trade unions
 were formed, the former Belarusian branch of the USS.Rs All-Union Central
 Council of Trade Unions--currently the Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus-is
 by far the largest trade union in the country. This so-called trade union of 5 million
 members is not considered independent in practice since it follows government or-
 ders.
 The right of workers to form and join unions is governed by the law on trade
 unions passed by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet in April. The law gives workers
 the right to form independent trade unions. In practice, workers often are automati-
 cally inducted into the government-affiliated Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus.
 Independent labor leaders believe that the official trade unions' control over social
 functions usually performed by the State (such as pension funds) is an obstacle to
 the growth of true, independent trade unions.
 The independent trade unions include the Free Trade Union of Belarus (with
 about 10,000 members), the Confederation of Labor of Belarus (about 4,000 mem-
 bers), the Independent Miners Union (3,000), and the Union of Air Traffic Control-
 lers.
 Pending a new law on labor disputes, there were several strikes in 1992. The
 most important strike was launched in March by the Independent Miners Union of
 Belarus at the potassium mines in Soligorsk. The miners were on strike for several
 months (some miners also went on a hunger strike). The miners received significant
 pay increases and reached agreement with the Government and management on
 sharing a portion of the mining enterprise's hard currency revenue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is guaranteed by existing legislation dating from the Soviet era.
 Since the economy is still largely in the hands of the State, unions usually seek re-
 dress at the mlitiral level.
 
 
 715
 The workers! right to organize was reportedly violated when the Executive Com-
 mittee of the Minsk City     cil repeatedly denied the Belarusian Confederation
 of Labor the use of a facility in which to old union meetings. In July the Confed-
 eration was fined for holdinga union meeting oudoors.
 Plant management allegedly threatened members of the Belarusian Confederation
 of Labor with the loss of jobs and discriminated against them in assigning respon-
 lhilities on the job. Some independent union members were reportedly fired be-
 cause of their union activity. For example, Sergei Trukhin, a trade union activist
 at Minsk Taxi Park No. 3, was fired from his job under what Belarusian trade union
 leaders said was a pretext. Legally, the law on trade unions bars discrimination
 against trade union organizers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While there is no explicit prohibi-
 tion of forced or complsory labor, it is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Current law establishes a statu-
 tory minimum age or employment of 16. In certain cases, such as the death of the
 family's chief wage earner, special permission may be sought for a 15-year-old to
 assume full-time employment. Reportedly, this law is effectively enforced through
 the Procurator General's office.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Supreme Soviet sets a minimum wage, pe-
 riodically'raised in response to inflation, which is effectively enforced. However, the
 minimum wage is too small to provide a decent standard of living.
 The Labor ode sets a limit of 41 hours of work per week and requires at least
 one 24-hour rest period per week. Because of the difficult economic situation, many
 workers find themselves working considerably less than 40 hours per week. Often
 factories require workers to take unpaid "vacations" due to lack of demand for fac-
 tory production. The law establishes minimum conditions of workplace safety and
 worker health- however, these standards are often ignored. No central, effective en-
 forcement mehianism exists.
