 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) is a one-party state controlled by the Vi-
 etnamese Communist Party (VCP). The VCPs constitutionally mandated leading
 role and the occupancy of all senior government positions by Party members ensures
 the primacy of Politburo guidelines. The National Assembly, chosen in elections in
 which all candidates are approved by the Party, remains largely subservient to the
 VCP, as does the judiciary. Most Assembly members belong to the VCP. The Na-
 tional Assemblyplayed a stronger role than in the past by seriously debating and
 revising proposedlegislation. The Government is working to reduce formal involve-
 ment of the Party in government operations, and government officials have some
 latitude in implementing policies. The Government continued to restrict signifi-
 cantly civil liberties on national security grounds.
 The military services are responsible for external defense, including the border de-
 fense force. While they have no direct responsibility for maintaining internal secu-
 rity, the military forces are seeking to establish for themselves a role in public edu-
 cation and campaigns against perceived threats to society. The Ministry of Interior
 is responsible for internal security. It controls the police, a special national security
 investigative agency, and other units that maintain internal security. Acting under
 the control of the Party and the Government, the Ministry enforces laws and regula-
 tions that significantly restrict individual liberties and violate other human rights.
 The Ministry of Interior also maintains a system of household registration and block
 wardens to monitor the population, concentrating on those suspected of engaging,
 or being likely to engage, in unauthorized political activities. Members of the secu-
 rity forces committed human rights abuses.
 Vietnam is a very poor country undergoing a transition from a centrally planned
 to a more market-oriented economy. Agriculture, primarily rice cultivation, employs
 two-thirds of the work force and accounts for one-third of gross domestic product
 (GDP). As a result of reforms, the country has experienced rapid growth in many
 industries, including construction, petroleum, textiles, and light manufacturing. Ex-
 ports, led by crude oil, rice, marine products, textiles, and foodstuffs, have increased
 sharply. Estimated annual GDP per capita has increased to approximately $300.
 Particularly in urban areas, economic reforms have raised the standard of living and
 reduced party and government control over, and intrusion into, people's daily lives.
 The Governments human rights record continued to be poor. The Government
 continued to repress basic political and some religious freedoms and to commit nu-
 merous abuses. While the VCP moved to reform procedures and debate within itself,
 the Government denied citizens the right to change their government and signifi-
 cantly restricted freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, privacy, and
 religion. The Government arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens, including de-
 tention for peaceful expression of political and religious objections to government
 policies, and denied them the right to a fair and expeditious trial. The Government
 continued its longstanding policy of not tolerating most types of public dissent and
 of prohibiting independent religious, political, and labor organizations. There were
 credible reports that security officials beat detainees. Prison conditions were harsh.

 Societal discrimination and violence against women remained problems. Trafficking
 in children for prostitution within Vietnam and to other countries grew, although
 the Government moved to combat the problem.
 Within still narrow parameters the National Assembly and the press engaged in
 increasingly vigorous debate on legal, economic, and social issues, and there was
 continued progress in building a legal infrastructure. In July a new Civil Code took
 effect that included an administrative court system to deal with complaints about
 abuse and corruption by state officials. The trend toward reduced government inter-
 ference in people's daily lives continued, as did the trend toward economic liberaliza-
 tion. The Government allowed people slightly greater freedom of expression and as-
 sembly to protest grievances, but intermittently restricted some activities of clergy.
 There were credible reports that some political prisoners were denied visitation
 rights and that certain prisons employ the use of forced labor, sometimes as part
 of commercial ventures.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no known politically mo-
 tivated extrajudicial killings. LAttle information is available on the extent of deaths
 in police custody or on official investigations into such incidents. The Government
 is investigating a case reported in the domestic media wherein police may have tried
 to cover up the death of a man in police custody by attempting to depict his death
 as a suicide.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits physical abuse. However, there is evidence that security officials
 beat detainees and used threats and other psychological coercion to elicit confes-
 sions. There were no known reports of torture of detainees. Little information is
 available on the extent of police brutality during interrogations. In September police
 beat and detained a foreign journalist reporting on a political demonstration in the
 capital.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Conditions generally do not threaten the lives of pris-
 oners, but some released prisoners reported that the death rate among male pris-
 oners due to disease and violence was high. Overcrowding, insufficient diet, and
 poor sanitation remain serious problems. Conditions in pretrial detention are par-
 ticularly harsh, and there were credible reports that detainees were sometimes de-
 nied access to sunlight, exercise, and reading material. Most prisoners have access
 to basic health care and, for those with money, to supplemental food and medicine.
 However, there were credible reports that some political prisoners were denied visi-
 tation rights and that some prisons employ the use of forced labor, sometimes as
 part of commercial ventures (see Section 6.c.). Prisoners sentenced to hard labor
 complained that the diet and health care were insufficient to sustain their health,
 especially when they were detained in remote, disease-ridden areas.
 Several political prisoners with serious medical conditions are being held in harsh
 conditions in remote prisons with little access to medical care. For example, Dr.
 Doan Viet Hoat (see Section i.e.) continued to serve a 15-year sentence at the
 Thanh Cam camp, in a remote and malaria-ridden area of Thanh Hoa province,
 1,400 kilometers from his home and relatives. His location has made it difficult for
 his family to provide medicine for his kidney disorder. Similarly, Do Van Thac, im-
 prisoned for 14 years (reduced to 12 years) on charges of attempting to overthrow
 the Government, remains imprisoned in remote Nam Ha province despite having
 suffered a stroke and suffering from heart disease. Dr. Nguyen Dan Que has been
 held in isolation in Camp Z30A-K3 in Xuan Loc, Dong Nai province for nearly 3
 years. Reports indicate Thich Hai Tang, a Buddhist monk convicted of involvement
 in a demonstration by Buddhists in Hue in 1993 and sentenced to 4 years in prison,
 is ill and being held in solitary confinement.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of its prison and deten-
 tion system, although it did allow an Australian parliamentary delegation to visit
 one prison in 1995. The United Nations Working Group on Human Rights visited
 several prisons in October 1994.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government continued to arrest peo-
 ple arbitrarily. Although the 1990 Criminal Procedure Code provides various rights
 for detainees, including time limits on pretrial detention and the right of the ac-
 cused to have a lawyer present during interrogation, in practice the authorities
 often ignore these legal safeguards.
 Law enforcement officials appear able to arrest and incarcerate people without
 presenting arrest warrants. In cases where a warrant is presented, the procurator
 
 
 800
 rather than an independent judiciary approves issuance of warrants. Once arrested,
 detainees often are held for lengthy periods without formal charges or trial. Nguyen
 Xuan Tu, also known as Ha Sihu, and Le Hong Ha were held without trial from
 December 5, 1995 until their 1-day trial on August 22. Ha was released on Decem-
 ber 9.
 Those arrested for peaceful expression of their views are likely to be charged
 under any one of several provisions in the Criminal Code outlawing acts against the
 State.
 No official statistics are available on what percentage of the prison population
 consists of pretrial detainees or the average period of time such detainees have been
 held. It is difficult to determine the exact number of political detainees in part be-
 cause the Government does not usually publicize such arrests and frequently con-
 ducted closed trials and sentencing.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control but has em-
 ployed internal exile to restrict the movement of certain political or religious dis-
 sidents. For example, credible reports indicate that the leader of the United Bud-
 dhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), Thich Huyen Quang, remains in a remote area
 of Quang Ngai province, where he was involuntarily moved from his pagoda in 1995.
 Similarly, two Buddhist monks, released in 1995 after serving sentences, were re-
 moved from their base pagoda in Hue in November and restricted to their home vil-
 lages.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-While the Constitution provides for the independ-
 ence of judges and jurors, in practice the VCP controls the courts closely at all lev-
 els, selecting judges primarily for political reliability. Credible reports indicate that
 party officials, including top leaders, instruct courts on how to rule on politically im-
 portant cases. The President a ppoints judges.
 The ourt system onsists of local people's courts, miitary tribunals, and the Su-
 preme People s Court. The Supreme People's Court can review cases from the lower
 courts or tribunals. In addition, local mass organizations are empowered to deal
 with minor breaches of law or disputes. Economic courts handle commercial dis-
 putes, and administrative courts deal with complaints by citizens about official
 abuse and corruption; they have addressed few cases since their creation in 1993.
 In July the 838-article Civil Code came into effect, a major step in efforts to
 strengthen the rule of law.
 The People's Procuracy has unchecked power to bring charges against the accused
 and serves as prosecutor during trials. A judging council, made up of a judge and
 one or more people's jurors (lay judges), determines guilt or innocence and also
 passes sentence on the convicte    e relevant people's council appoints people's ju-
 rors, who are required to be people of high moral standards but who are not re-
 quired to have legal training.
 Trials are generally open to the public, although judicial authorities sometimes
 closed trials or strictly limited attendance in sensitive cases. For example, the 1-day
 trial of Ha Si Phu, Le Hong Ha, and Nguyen Kien Giang on August 22 was closed
 to the public. The Government did not respond to requests by foreign diplomats to
 attend the trial. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial and to have
 a lawyer, and the defendant or the defense lawyer has the right to cross-examine
 witnesses. In political cases, however, there are credible reports that defendants
 were not allowed access to government evidence in advance of the trial, to cross-
 examine witnesses, or to challenge statements. Little information is available on the
 extent to which defendants and their lawyers have time to prepare for trials. Those
 convicted have the right to appeal. Although Vietnam has made some progress in
 developing a legal system, many judges andother court officials lack adequate legal
 training. Gove  ent efforts to deveop a fair, effective judicial system were under-
 mined by the lack of openness in the judicial process and the continuing subser-
 vience of the judiciary to the Party.
 The Government continued to hold a number of political prisoners incarcerated for
 the peaceful expression of dissenting religious or political views. For example, Doan
 Viet Hoat is serving a 15-year sentence for publishing a reformist newsletter. His
 family reports that the Government has withheld food, medicine, and letters that
 the have sent him, and denied him reading materials. Others arrested with him,
 including Pham Duc Kham, Ngyen Van Thuan, and Le Duc Vuong, are also serv-
 ing lengthy prison sentences. Human rights activist Nguyen Dan Que, sentenced to
 20 years' imprisonment in 1991 for publicly supporting political reform and respect
 for human rights, remains in isolation in prison despite being in poor health. Nine
 people, including Nguyen Dinh Huy, remain in prison for trying to organize a con-
 ference on democracy in Ho Chi Minh City in 1993. At least seven Catholic priests
 of the Congregation of the Mother Co-redemptrix remain in prison under long sen-
 tences imposed after their 1987 arrest and conviction on charges of "sowing disunity
 
 
 801
 between the people and State." Following diplomatic appeals, in February the SRV
 released pliticalprisoner Doan Thanh Liem from prison and allowed him and his
 family to emigrate for humanitarian reasons.
 ang Minh Chinh was released on June 14 upon completion of his 12-month sen-
 tnce. Chinh was arrested with Do Trung Hieu in 1995 for spreading "antisocialist
 propaganda," apparently for writings that urged the party to admit past mistakes
 and move toward national reconciliation (see Section 2.a.). Chinh and Hieu were
 convicted of "abusing democratic privileges" and sentenced to 12 and 18 months' im-
 prisnment, respectively. Ha Si Phu was released December 9 after completion of
 his 12-month sentence, including 8 months detention (see Section 2.a.).
 Vietnamese exile groups have claimed that there are as many as 1,000 political
 prisoners in the country; other reliable sources put the figure closer to 200. Amnesty
 International lists 70 prisoners held for political reasons, but suggests that the num-
 ber may be higher. The Government continued to release prisoners as part of regu-
 lar amnesties to commemorate important national holidays.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Corresrpondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy of hoeand correspondence. The Gov-
 ernment continued, however, to operate a nationwide system of surveillance and
 control through household registration and block wardens who use informants to
 keep track of-individuals' activities. Citizens must register when they change loca-
 tions. However, many foreign observers believe that this monitoring was done with
 less vigor and efficiency than in thepast, as the authorities focused on those sus-
 pected of involvement in unauthorized political or religious activities. Anecdotal evi-
 dence suggests that government monitoring is stricter in the south, especially in Ho
 Chi Minh City. In urban areas, most citizens were free to maintain contact and
 work with foreigners.
 The Government continued to open and censor mail, confiscate packages, and
 monitor telephone, electronic mal, and fax transmissions. The Party now exerts less
 pressure on people than it has in the past to belong to one or more mass organiza-
 tions, which exist for villages, city districts, schools, workers (trade unions), youth,
 and women. Membership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the Govern-
 ment or in state companies and is vital for promotion to senior levels of the Govern-
 ment. At the same time, diversification of the economy has made membership in
 mass organizations and the VCP less essential to financial and social advancement.
 The Govement ontinued to implement a family planning policy that urges all
 families to have no more than two children. In principle the Government can deny
 promotions and salary increases to government and party employees with more than
 two children. In practice the penaty is not applied to employees in good standing.
 For others, there are no penal ties for those with more than two children, but local
 regulations permit fines based on the cost of extra social services incurred by the
 larger family, or reductions in state subsidies for those services. These penalties are
 not uniformly or universally applied.
 While foreign language periodicals are widely available in the cities, the Govern-
 ment regularly censors articles about the country in foreign periodicals for sale
 within the country. The Government has not allowed citizens free access to the
 Internet, citing concerns for national security and cultural preservation. It formally
 restricted access to satellite television to top officials, foreigners, hotels, and the
 press by a November edict.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but in practice the Government severely limits these freedoms, espe-
 cially concerning political and reli ous subjects.
 Both the Constitution and the Criminal Code include brad national security and
 antidefamation provisions that the tovernmient uses to strictly limit such freedoms.
 The Party and Gove   vent tolerated public discussion and even criticism somewhat
 more than in the past, although less than in the period from 1987 to 1989. For ex-
 ample, citizens could and did complain openly about bureaucratic lethargy, adminis-
 trative procedures, corruption, and even economic policy. However, the Govement
 continued to clamp down on free speech that strayed outside narrow limits to ques-
 tion the role of the Party, criticize individual SRV leaders, promote pluraism,
 multiparty democracy, or question the regime's policies on sensitive matters such
 as human rights. There continued to be an ambiguous line between what con-
 stituted rivate speech about sensitive matters, which would be tolerated, and pub-
 lic speech in those areas, which would not. On August 22, the authorities tried and
 convicted two dissidents, Ha Si hu and Le Hong Ha, a former security official, on
 charges of illegally possessing secret government documents (see Section i.e.). Ha
 Si lhu was arrested on December 6, 1995 for criticizing the regime. Le Hong Ha
 
 
 802
 was arrested at the same time for involvement with efforts to convince the Party
 to address past mistakes.
 The Party, Government, and Party-controlled mass organizations control all print
 and electronic media. The Government exercises oversight through the Ministry of
 Culture, supplemented by pervasive party guidance and national security legislation
 sufficiently road to ensure effective self-censorship in the domestic media. In July
 the Government threatened to prosecute three state- or party-owned newspapers for
 "disclosing state secrets' after they criticized government actions in the nation's
 aviation and oil industries.
 The Government also approved a number of new newspapers for publication; none
 are privately owned. With apparent party approval, several newspapers engaged in
 investigative reporting on corruption and mismanagement as well as in open and
 sometimes heated debate on economic policy. The Government made no effort to
 limit access to international radio, to which many citizens listen regularly, although
 it restricted access to the Internet and censored foreign publications (see Section
 1.f.).
 Foreign journalists must be approved by the Foreign Ministry's Press Center and
 must be based in Hanoi, and the-number of foreign staff allowed each foreign press
 organization is limited. The Center monitors journalists' activities and decides on
 a case-by-case basis whether to approve their interview, photograph, film, or travel
 requests. A Foreign Ministry official accompanies foreign journalists during all
 interviews with Vietnamese. The Government censors television footage and delays
 export of footage by several days.
 On September 9, uniformed and plain clothes police beat, kicked, and detained a
 foreign journalist for taking photographs of a small protest demonstration in Hanoi.
 The Foreign Ministry announced on September 13 that it would investigate the inci-
 dent, the iirst physical assault on a journalist about which information is publicly
 available. In September the Government refused to extend the visa of a correspond-
 eat working for an international business magazine, effectively expelling him For ar-
 ticles that he had written which displeased the Government.
 A general trend toward increased information flow appeared to extend into the
 university system. Foreign academic visitors working temporarily at universities
 said that they were able to discuss nonpolitical issues widely and freely in the class-
 room, but government monitors regularly attended classes taught by foreigners and
 Vietnamese without official notification. Academic publications usually reflect the
 views of the Party and the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association-The right of assembly is re-
 stricted in law and practice. People wishing to gather in a group are required to
 apply for a permit, which local authorities can issue or deny abitrarily. However,
 people routinely gathered in informal groups without government interference. The
 Government does not permit demonstrations that could be seen as having a political
 purpose, but was more tolerant than in the past of occasional popular demonstra-
 tions about specific grievances against local officials. Nonetheless, the Government
 did not tolerate extended demonstrations. For example, authorities arrested several
 leaders and suppressed a protest over expropriation of land for a golf course fi-
 nanced abroad.
 With a few exceptions, the Government prohibits the establishment of private,
 independent organizations, insisting that individuals work within established,
 party-controlled organizations. Citizens may not establish any sort of independent
 organization, including political parties, labor unions, religious, or veterans organi-
 zations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Both the Constitution and government decrees provide
 for freedom of worship, but the Government continued to restrict severely religious
 activities it defined as at variance with state laws and policies. The Government
 generally allowed people to practice the religion of their choice, and participation in
 religious activities throughout the country continued to increase. However, the Gov-
 ernment also maintained policies designed to control religious hierarchies and orga-
 nized religious activities, in part because it fears that organized religion may under-
 mine the Party's authority and influence.
 Religious organizations must obtain government permission to hold training semi-
 nars, conventions, and celebrations outside the regular religious calendar, to build
 or remodel places of worship, to engage in charitable activities or operate religious
 schools, and to ordain, promote, or transfer clergy. All religious groups continued
 to face difficulty in obtaining teaching materials, expanding training facilities in re-
 sponse to increasing demand for clergy, and publishing religious materials.
 The Government requires all Buddhist monks to work under the party-controlled
 Buddhist umbrella organization. The Government has actively continued to sup-
 press efforts by the UBCV to operate independently. The tension between the Gov-
 
 
 803
 ernment and the UBCV, which resurfaced in 1992 and increased in 1993-94, contin-
 ued in 1996. Despite SRV claims to the contrary, credible reports indicate that the
 UBCV's leader, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, remains under house arrest or
 other confinement in a remote area of Quang Ngai Province. Worshipers in several
 Buddhist, Catholic, and Cao Dai sect centers of worship regularly report that under-
 cover government observers attend worship services and monitor the activities of
 the congregations and clergy.
 The Government has sought to control the Catholic Church hierarchy, in part by
 requiring that all clergy to belong to the government-controlled Catholic Patriotic
 Association. It has also insisted on approving Vatican appointments. The Church hi-
 erarchy remained frustrated with the Government's restrictions. In a February 2
 letter to the Archbishop of Hanoi, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet prohibited elder
 Bishop Huynh Van Nh     from being assigned to any est. The Government prohibits
 the Catholic Church from educational and charitable activities because it will not
 accept government supervision and authority, as Buddhist congregations do.
 The Government allowed bishops and priests to travel freely within their dioceses,
 but continued to restrict their travel outside these areas. The Government has lim-
 ited the Church to operating 6 major seminaries throughout the country, totaling
 approximately 700 studnts. rhe Government allows the Church to recruit new stu-
 dents only every 2 years. All students must be approved by the Government, both
 upon entering the seminary and prior to ordination as priests. The number of grad-
 uating students was insufficient to support the growing Catholic population, esti-
 mated at 5 million. In his February 2 letter, the Prime Minister reiterated that local
 officials have the right to approve or disapprove the selection of candidates for train-
 ing, continuation of study, and ordination. This power lies principally with the Peo-
 ple's Committee of the province or city where the candidate lives.
 In November the Government reported that it had closed a Zen Buddhist center
 in Dalat alleging that its leader was not a real monk and had been sexually abus-
 ing his followers. There is evidence that the monk and the center had been legally
 registered as a Buddhist center since before 1975. There are reports that the fol-
 lowers allegedly abused by the monk have denied the reports and are seeking to
 sue government newspapers for spreading false reports. Witnesses reported that po-
 lice destroyed the center.
 The Christian Missionary Alliance of Vietnam, the only government-approved
 Protestant organization in the country, enjoyed slightly greater freedom to operate.
 Church attendance grew despite continued government restrictions on proselytizing
 activities. Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) reported continued arrests and
 government harassment of some ethnic Hmong Protestants for proselytizing in
 northern Vietnamese villages. In February police in Ho Chi Minh City and Pleiku
 disbanded meetings held by Christians that included expatriates. Police interro-
 gated, then released, the participants. The authorities in Hanoi questioned, har-
 assed, and fined a US. citizen for distributing pens bearing a Christian religious
 symbol. According to reports, police interrogated her repeately during October and
 November, before fining and expelling her. There have been reports that members
 of the Cao Dai religion have also been subject to arbitrary detention and persecu-
 tion.
 There is no officially sanctioned umbrella organization for Protestants. Reports in-
 dicate that Protestant congregations are not allowed to cooperate on joint religious
 observances or other activities.
 The Government restricts exit permits for Muslims seeking to make the hajj (see
 Section 1.d.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Most citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country. However,
 there were credible reports that local authorities required members of ethnic minor-
 ity groups to obtain permission to travel outside certain highland areas. Officially,
 citizens must obtain permission to change their residence. In practice many people
 continued to move without approval, although this prevented them from obtaining
 legal work permits. Foreigners are generally free to travel throughout the country.
 A though the Government retains the right to approve travel to border areas, to
 some areas in the central highlands, and to some islands, in practice foreigners can
 easily travel to most border areas without approval.
 The Government still requires citizens traveling abroad, including government of-
 ficials, to obtain exit and reentry visas. Both law and regulation provide for the
 right of all citizens to obtain an exit permit, except for. Members of the small Mus-
 lim community seeking to make the hajj; political activists; certain Buddhist clerics;
 the mentally ill; those serving prison sentences; under criminal investigation; hold-
 ing state secrets; suffering serious health problems; involved in tax or real estate
 disputes; or whose sponsors are engaged abroad in activities opposed to the Govern-
 
 
 ment. The Government maintains the right to reject exit visa applications in these
 categories.
 The Government continued to permit limited departure for some Vietnamese seek-
 ing to emigrate. The U.S. Orderly Departure Program (ODP) continued to resettle
 immigrant and refugee beneficiaries in the United States, including Amerasians,
 former reeducation camp detainees, and family unification cases, at the rate of
 about 2,000 persons per month. Other nations operate smaller resettlement pro-
 grams for Vietnamese citizens. There are some concerns that members of minority
 ethnic groups, particularly highland peoples, such as the Montagnards, may not
 have ready access to these programs. The Government continued to deny exit per-
 mits for certain Montagnard applicants for emigration to the United States. Former
 politicalprisoner Doan Thanh Liem emigrated to the United States through the
 ODP in February.
 Citizens' access to exit permits is frequently constrained by factors outside the
 law. Refugee and immigrant visa applicants to the ODP sometimes encounter local
 officials who arbitrarily deny exit permits based on personal animosities or the offi-
 cial's perception that an applicant does not meet program criteria.
 In May Vietnam and the United States reached an agreement in principle to
 allow several thousand Vietnamese living in refugee camps in Southeast Asia to
 apply for resettlement in the United States, provided that they first return to Viet-
 nam and apply in writing. The two governments are consulting on implementation
 of the agment
 The Governent generally permits Vietnamese who emigrate to return to visit,
 but it considers them Vietnamese citizens and therefore subject to the obligations
 of a Vietnamese national under the law even if they have adopted another country's
 citizenship. However, Vietnamese who have emigrated are not able to obtain Viet-
 namese passports. Because overseas Vietnamese are both a valuable potential
 source of foreign exchange and expertise and a potential security threat, the Gov-
 ernment generally encourages them to visit Vietnam but monitors many of them
 carefully.
 In 1988 Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to increase acceptance of voluntary
 repatriates, provided that there was financial assistance. The agreement included
 a commitment to waive prosecution and punitive measures for illegal departure
 from Vietnam of persons who return under the UNHCR Voluntary Repatriation Pro-
 gram. Vietnam also agreed to permit the UNHCR to monitor the returnees through
 direct visits. More than 106,000 Vietnamese have returned voluntarily. The
 UNHCR, which extensively monitors those who have repatriated voluntarily, reports
 that they do not face retribution or discrimination. There was no credible evidence
 to substantiate claims that refugees returning under UNHCR auspices were har-
 assed because of their status as returnees.
 The Constitution allows consideration of asylum for foreigners persecuted abroad
 under certain circumstances. Otherwise, Vietnam is not signatory to, and does not
 have provisions for, the granting of asylum or refugee status in accordance with the
 standards of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its
 1967 Protocol. There were no reports of individuals requesting asylum in Vietnam.
 In the past, Vietnam admitted refugees from Cambodia, most of whom were ethnic
 Vietnamese, most recently 30,000 persons between 1993 and 1995. The Government
 cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are not free to change their government. All authority and political power
 is vested in the VCP; political opposition and other political parties are not toler-
 ated. The VCP Central Committee is the supreme decisionmaking body in the na-
 tion, and the Politburo is the locus of policymaking. The Eighth Congress of the
 VCP in June replaced the Secretariat of the Central Committee with a standing
 board, consisting of five members of the Politburo, to oversee day-to-day implemen-
 tation of leadership directives. Debate and criticism are limited to certain aspects
 of individual, state, or party performance determined by the VCP itself. No public
 challenge to the legitimacy of the one-party state or even debate on the subject is
 permitted (see Section 2.a.).
 Citizens elect the members of the National Assembly, ostensibly the main legisla-
 tive body, but the Party approves all candidates, almost all of whom are VCP mem-
 bers. During its semi-annual month-long sessions in April and October, the National
 Assembly engaged in increasingly vigorous debate on economic, legal, and social is-
 
 
 805
 sues, including corruption, management of the budget, and foreign investment. Leg-
 islators questioned and criticized ministers. However, the National Assembly re-
 mained subservient to the VCP. It does not initiate legislation and may not pass
 legislation that the Party opposes. Party officials occupied most senior government
 and National Assembly positions and continued to have the final say on key issues.
 The law provides the opportunity for equal participation in politics by women and
 minority groups, but in practice they are underrepresented. Most of the top leaders
 are male. In June the Party for the first time elected a woman to the Politburo.
 Women hold a few important positions, including vice president and several vice
 *inisterships or equivalent positions. The president of the National Assembly, who
 is also a Politburo member, is a member of an ethnic minority.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit private human rights organizations to form or
 operate. It generally prohibits private citizens from contacting international human
 rights organizations. The Government permitted international visitors to monitor
 implementation of its repatriation commitments under the Comprehensive Plan of
 Action and carried on a limited dialog with foreign human rights organizations
 based outside Vietnam. The Government continued to refuse entry to some major
 international human rights NGO's. However, the Government did permit the Sep-
 tember visit by a delegation from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
 The Government has shown increased willingness to discuss human rights issues
 bilaterally with other governments if such discussions take place under the rubric
 of 'exchanges of ideas" rather than as "investigations." Several foreign governments
 held official talks concerning human rights issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, religion, or
 social class. Enforcement of these prohibitions has been uneven. People released
 from reeducation camps over the years have reported varying levels of discrimina-
 tion in the areas of housing and education. They are generally not eligible to regain
 their citizenship rights until 1 year after their release. They and their families are
 not allowed employment with the Government, although this prohibition was less
 problematic than in the past because of the growth of private sector job opportuni-
 ties.
 Women.-Although the law addresses the issue of domestic violence, there is cred-
 ible evidence that the problem is on the rise, and that the laws are not enforced
 adequately. International NGO workers and many women have stated that domestic
 violence against women is common. Most divorces are due to domestic violence, al-
 though many women remain in abusive marriages rather than confront the stigma
 of divorce. Domestic abuse appears to be more prevalent in rural areas.
 The Government, international NGO's, and the press reported a marked increase
 in recent years in the trafficking of women both domestically and abroad for pur-
 poses of prostitution. Organized rings reortedly lure poor, often rural, women with
 promises of jobs or marriage and force them to work as prostitutes. Some are kid-
 napped and sold as wives to men in other countries. The press and anecdotal
 sources indicate that the problem of sex tourism is growing, with increasing pros-
 titution of children. The Government is working with NGO's to supplement law en-
 forcement measures in these areas.
 While there is no legal discrimination, women face deeply ingrained social dis-
 crimination. Despite extensive provisions in the Constitution, in legislation, and in
 regulations that mandate equal treatment, and although some women occupy high
 government posts, in general few women are able to compete effectively for higher
 status positions. The Government has not enforced the constitutional provision that
 women and men must receive equal pay for equal work. The large body of legisla-
 tion and regulations devoted to the protection of women's rights in marriage as well
 as in the workplace and the new labor law calling for the preferential treatment of
 women are distant from the reality of many, if not most, women.
 The party-controlled Women's Union has a broad agenda to promote women's
 rights, including political, economic, and legal equality, and protection from spousal
 abuse. NGO's and international organizations regard the Union highly, but they and
 Women's Union representatives believe that it will take some time to overcome soci-
 etal prejudices. The Government also has a Committee for the Advancement of
 Women, led by the Vice President, who is a woman.
 Children.-Reputable international organizations, including the U.N. Children's
 Fund (UNICEF), commend the Government's interest in children's issues and its
 
 
 806
 
 promotion of child welfare. While education is compulsory, the authorities do not en-
 force the requirement, especially in rural areas (see Section 6.d.). The Government
 has continued a nationwide immunization campaign, and the government-contrlled
 press regularly stresses the importance of health and education for all children. De-
 spite some success, UNICEF estimates that there are still 3 million children living
 in "especially difficult" circumstances.
 Widespread poverty has contributed to the reported increase in trafficking of mi-
 nors domestically and to foreign destinations as prostitutes. UNICEF reported that
 responsible government agencies are seriously engaged in combatting this abuse.
 There is no information publicly available on the extent of child abuse (see Section
 6.c.).
 People With Disabilities.-The Government provides little official protection or
 support for the disabled, and there are no laws mandating physical access to build-
 ings. However, the 1994 Labor Law requires the State to protect the rights and en-
 courage the employment of the disabled. It includes provisions for preferential treat-
 ment for firms that recruit disabled persons for training or apprenticeship and a
 special levy on firms that do not employ disabled workers. It is uncertain whether
 the Government enforces these provisions. The Government has permitted inter-
 national groups to assist those who have been disabled by war or by subsequent ac-
 cidents involving unexploded ordnance.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Government says that it is op-
 posed to discrimination against ethnic minorities, there continued to be credible re-
 ports that local officials sometimes restricted ethnic minority access to education,
 employment, mail services, and travel, both domestic and foreign. The Government
 continued to implement policies designed to narrow the gap in the standard of living
 between ethnic groups living in the highlands and lowland ethnic Vietnamese by
 granting preferential treatment to domestic and foreign companies investing in
 highland areas. There were anecdotal reports that the Government continued to re-
 press some highland minorities for suspected ties with resistance groups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All unions are Party-controlled. Workers are not free
 to form or join unions of their choosing unless they have obtained approval from
 the local office of the Party-controlled Trade Union Federation of Vietnam (VGCL).
 The VGCL is the umbrella organization under which all local trade unions must op-
 erate. The 1994 Labor Law requires provincial trade union organizations to estab-
 lish unions at all new enterprises with more than 10 employees as well as at exist-
 ing enterprises that currently operate without trade unions. Management of those
 companies is required to accept and cooperate with those unions. However, many
 jaint ventures and small, private companies, especially at the retail level, do not
 have unions.
 The Labor Law provides for the right to strike under certain circumstances. It
 calls for management and labor to resolve labor disputes through the enterprise's
 own labor conciliatory council. If that fails, the matter goes to the provincial labor
 arbitration council. On July 1, new labor courts within the people's court system
 came into being. The new courts have begun to hear a small number of cases, but
 still are in the early stages of development. Unions have the right to appeal a coun-
 cil decision to the provincial'people's court and to strike. However, the law prohibits
 strikes at enterprises that serve the public and those that are important to the na-
 tional economy or national security and defense; these functions are defined by the
 Government. The law also grants the Prime Minister the right to suspend a strike
 considered detrimental to the national economy or public safety. On August 29, the
 Prime Minister prohibited strikes in 54 occupational sectors and businesses includ-
 ing public services, businesses producing "essential" goods, and businesses serving
 national defense under the Ministries of Interior and National Defense.
 The number of strikes increased in 1996, primarily against foreign-owned compa-
 nies but also involving state-owned and private finns. The Government tolerated
 these strikes, which were mostly illegal. None was organized by the VGCL or its
 affiliate unions. The Labor Law prohibits retribution against strikers, and there
 have been no credible reports of such retribution. In the wake of several highly pub-
 licized strikes, the SRV has promulgated new procedures for settlement of strikes
 as well as individual claims related to labor problems. The new procedures took ef-
 fect on July 1.
 Unions are not legally free to, and do not in practice, join, affiliate with, or par-
 ticipate in international labor bodies.
 
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize unions in their enterprises, but they must be approved by the provincial or
 metropolitan branch of the VGCL. They also can bargain collectively through the
 party-approved unions at their enterprises. In the past, the State generally set
 wages, since most employees worked for state companies. With the growth of the
 private sector and the increased autonomy of state firms, a growing percentage of
 companies are setting wages through collective bargaining with the relevant unions.
 Market forces also play a much more important role in determining wages. The
 Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination on the part of employers against em-
 ployees seeking to organize.
 The Government has approved formation of a number of export processing zones
 and new industrial zones, which are governed by the same labor laws as the rest
 of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Law prohibits all forms
 of forced labor. However, there were credible reports that some prisons employ the
 use of forced labor, sometimes as part of commercial ventures.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Law sets the minimum
 age for employment at 15 years. Children as young as 13 can register at trade train-
 ing centers, which are a form of vocational training. There are compulsory education
 laws, but they are not effectively enforced, especially in rural areas where children
 are needed in agriculture. However, the culture's strong emphasis on education
 leads people who can afford it to send their children to school rather than to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law requires the Government to set
 a minimum wage, which changes with inflation and other economic changes. The
 monthly minimum wage for foreign-investment joint ventures is $35 (385,000 dong)
 in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city and $30 (330,000 dong) elsewhere. The minimum
 monthly wage for Vietnamese-owned companies is $11 (120,000 dong). This mini-
 mum wage alone is insufficient to provide a worker and family with a decent stand-
 ard of living. Many workers receive bonuses and supplement their incomes by en-
 gaging in entrepreneurial activities. A decreasing number of workers receive govern-
 ment-subsidized housing. The Government enforces the minimum wage at foreign
 and major Vietnamese firms.
 The Labor Law sets working hours at a maximum of 8 hours per day and 48
 hours per week, with a mandatory 24-hour break each week. Any additional hours
 require overtime pay, and the law limits compulsory overtime. It is uncertain how
 well the Government enforces these provisions.
 The Labor Law requires the Government to promulgate rules and regulations to
 ensure worker safety. The Ministry of Labor, in coordination with local people's com-
 mittees and labor unions, is charged with enforcing the regulations. In practice, en-
 forcement is inadequate because of the Ministry's inadequate funding. Anecdotal
 evidence indicates that workers, through labor unions, have been more effective in
 forcing changes in working conditions than has the Government. There was no in-
 formation on the ability of workers to remove themselves from work situations that
 endanger health or safety without jeopardy to their continued employment.
