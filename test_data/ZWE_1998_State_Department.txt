 ZIMBABWE
 President Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
 Front (ZANU-PF) have dominated the legislative and executive branches of the
 Government since independence in 1980. The Constitution allows for multiple par-
 ties; in addition to ZANU-PF, there are a large number of smaller parties. However,
 they are poorly organized and led, poorly financed, and subject to periodic intimida-
 tion by the ruling party and government security forces. Late in 1997, the Par-
 liament amended the election laws to allow for increased access to fimding for oppo-
 sition candidates; these changes went into effect in early 1998. Thejudiciary is inde-
 pendent, but the Government occasionally refuses to abide by court decisions.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) are responsible for maintaining law and
 order. The Zimbabwe National Army and Air Force are responsible for external se-
 curity. The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) under the Ministry of State Se-
 curity is responsible for internal and external security but no longer has powers of
 arrest. Members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy based on agricultural production. The country has abundant arable
 land, minerals, good infrastructure, a diversified manufacturing sector, an educated
 and disciplined work force, and a strong tourism sector. Its chief hard currency
 earners are tobacco, gold, ferroalloys, nickel, and tourism. The economy suffered
 from poor economic management, government corruption, high inflation and high
 real interest rates, a dramatic slide in foreign exchange values, high budget deficits,
 and high unemployment. Over half the population relies on subsistence agriculture.
 The formal sector unemployment rate exceeds 40 percent. During the year, the econ-
 omy declined and real disposable fell due to high inflation and higher imported
 input costs. Throughout the year, the Government faced increased pressure from
 urban labor groups andrural low-income groups as the standard of living dropped.
 
 
 In November protests and riots broke out over a 67 percent increase in the price
 of gasoline and cooking fuel. Rioters burned several vehicles.
 The Government respected some of the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there was a worsening in some areas, and significant problems remained, including
 incidents of police killings, torture, and brutality, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary
 pretrial detention, security force intimidation of opposition party candidates and
 their supporters, failure to fully investigate assaults on opposition candidates, re-
 strictions on academic freedom, infringements on citizens' privacy, and, despite the
 new electoral law, restrictions on opposition party financing. The political process
 remained heavily tilted in favor of the ruling party.
 As a result of widespread irregularities in the voters' rolls and charges of election
 fraud by opposition candidates, the High Court ordered that a previously disquali-
 fied independent candidate be allowed to contest a Harare city council ward seat.
 The High Court subsequently barred the Registrar General from holding those elec-
 tions until the rolls were reviewed. By year's end, those Harare city council ward
 elections had not been held.
 Supporters of the ZANU-PF candidate in the February by-election in Chitungwiza
 attacked independent Member of Parliament (M.P.) Margaret Dongo with a gasoline
 bomb. The police failed to arrest any individual on the scene, and the Government
 has not pursued a case against the suspect identified by Dongo. Although the small
 independent press was increasingly open and critical of the Government, there was
 some self-censorship. The electronic media-the major source of information for
 most citizens-remained totally under government control, and strict anti-defama-
 tion laws led to self-censorship. The three privately-licensed television stations faced
 financial difficulties and merged into one station under the name Joy TV. It remains
 restricted to broadcasting on a channel leased from the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Cor-
 poration; creation of an independent transmission facility is restricted under the
 Broadcasting Act. Domestic violence against women remained widespread, and tra-
 ditional, often illegal, discrimination against women and the disabled continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government security forces, but there were reports of the use of excessive
 force. Government sources reported that at least eight persons were shot and killed
 during the January 19-22 food riots. The largely spontaneous riots were sparked
 by price increases on basic commodities such as bread, maize meal, and cooking oil,
 against the background of an overall declining standard of living for the average cit-
 izen. In one widely-publicized case, police shot a 12-year-old girl from Gweru on
 January 20, while she was fleeing from a demonstration on which the security
 forces had opened fire. At year's end, no police suspect had been identified, and the
 case remained under investigation. Local human rights organizations set up a legal
 defense fund for the victims and called for the establishment of an independent com-
 mission of inquiry to investigate citizen complaints of human rights abuses arising
 from the food riots. By year's end, no security officers had been arrested or charged
 with those deaths nor had the Government set up an investigation.
 In November police fired into a crowd protesting fuel price increases in the city
 of Mutare. One person was killed. The officer who fired the shot was not prosecuted
 (see Section 1.c.).
 Harsh prison conditions contributed to the average of 25 deaths per month; most
 persons died from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), according to 1996
 statistics, the latest available (see Section 1.c.).
 By year's end, the Government had not responded formally to the Legal Resources
 Foundation (LRF) and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) report on
 atrocities committed during the 1982-87 Matabeleland crisis. However, in March
 Minister without portfolio Eddison Zvogbo apologized, in his personal capacity and
 in a symbolic departure from government practice, for the atrocities committed by
 government forces in Matabeleland.
 In November the murder of a white farmer coincided with the occupation of her
 farm by squatters. Police arrested a former employee, but squatters were not be-
 lieved to be responsible for the crime.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and cruel and inhuman treatment. The issuance
 of the ZRP service charter and improved training has resulted in better treatment
 of suspects and the public. However, the ZRP showed poor training in riot control;
 it used live ammunition, tear gas, and clubs to disperse crowds during the food riots.
 
 
 There were widespread reports that at least 10 persons were shot and injured dur-
 ing these riots; the victims deny that they were engaged in any criminal activity
 at the time. In addition, Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa called in the
 Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) during the riots, and authorized them to use fire-
 arms to restore order, even when there was no imminent threat to life.
 ZRP/ZNA actions resulted in a number of injuries to demonstrators and bystand-
 ers including a child in his Harare home and a woman in Mabvuku whose arm had
 to be amputated. There were several other credible cases of woundings from stray
 police bullets.
 There were credible reports that the ZRP beat and tortured detainees during the
 food riots. In one case, police reportedly beat a woman in a Mabvuku home and in
 another tied loaded tear gas canisters to the heads and between the legs of 2 men
 who the police believed were withholding information concerning the burning of a
 police car during the riots. In still another case, police allegedly beat persons they
 believed to be University of Zimbabwe students who the ZRP considered to be agi-
 tators during the food riots. An officer in at least 1 Mabvuku police station admitted
 beating an innocent 19-year-old man, who is seeking monetary compensation.
 Although the ZRP service charter, and improved tralning generally have resulted
 in better treatment of suspects and the public, there were several credible reports
 that police beat suspected looters at their homes and at police stations during ques-
 tioning. Police were accused by the victims of using whips, hoses, and batons to beat
 the victims. Several of the victims sought medical treatment for serious ZRP-in-
 flicted injuries and reported their cases to the police and human rights organiza-
 tions. There were reports that the police clubbed students in March and used tear
 gas in June to disrupt demonstrators at the University of Zimbabwe (see Section
 2.a.).
 Following the Government's announcement on October 31 of a 67 percent increase
 in fuel prices, street demonstration and rioting broke out in several major cities.
 Angry crowds burnt several vehicles and threatened commuter omnibus drivers who
 had increased their fares in response to the higher fuel prices. Police arrested 27
 persons in Bulawayo on November 2 for destruction of public property, including the
 destruction of 19 vehicles. Twenty persons were injured during the street violence
 but no charges of police brutality were filed.
 The Government has not actively pursued past allegations of torture nor pros-
 ecuted CIO or ZRP officers for such abuses. The CIO continued to refuse to pay
 court-ordered damages to a 1990 torture victim.
 Prison conditions remained harsh and have improved little since the CCJP issued
 its 1993 report describing extreme overcrowding, shortages of clothing, and poor
 sanitary conditions. Overcrowding and poor sanitation aggravated outbreaks of chol-
 era, diarrhea, and AIDS-related illnesses. Government prison service authorities re-
 viewed overcrowding in prisons during a July workshop and concluded that expo-
 sure to HIV/AIDS was a major cause of deaths in detention. However, no exact fig-
 ures were available, and prison authorities called for more research to address this
 growing problem, with some arguing for early release of such terminally ill pris-
 oners. The Government has established a successful community service sentencing
 program to try to alleviate prison overcrowding. The Legal Resource Foundation, in
 cooperation with the prison service, has established a human rights training pro-
 gram for prison officials. Officials who mistreat prisoners are routinely punished.
 The Government permits international human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions. The law
 requlres that police inform an arrested person of the charges against him before he
 is taken into custody. Warrants of arrest issued by the courts are required except
 in cases of serious crimes or where there is the risk of evidence disappearing. The
 Ministry of Home Affairs paid $112,500 (Z$4.5 million) in damages for wrongful ar-
 rest cases in 1996, the last year for which statistics were available.
 Although a preliminary hearing before a magistrate is required within 48 hours
 of an arrest (or 96 hours over a weekend), the law is often disregarded if a person
 does not have legal representation. A 1992 amendment to the Criminal Procedures
 and Evidence Act substantially reduced the power of magistrates to grant bail with-
 out the consent of the Attorney General or his agents. However, in practice a cir-
 cular issued by the Attorney General giving a general authority to grant bail has
 lessened the negative impact of the rule. High Court judges grant bail independ-
 ently.
 During the January food riots, police arrested over 200 persons for alleged looting
 or public disorder. There were numerous credible reports of forced confessions, tor-
 ture, and physical abuse (see Section 1.c.). Many appeals were filed against the re-
 sulting convictions. In Harare the looting suspects initially were denied bail, which
 
 
 467
 the Law Society of Zimbabwe successfully challenged as being based on political con-
 siderations, not the law. At year's end, many of those cases still were pending.
 Originally promulgated 30 years ago and widely used during the Ian Smith re-
 gime to silence political opponents, the Official Secrets Act and the Law and Order
 Maintenance Act (LOMA) grant the Government a wide range of legal powers.
 LOMA gives extensive powers to the police, the Minister of Home Affairs and the
 President to prosecute anyone for political and security crimes that are not clearly
 defined.
 In December 1997, opposition M.P. The Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole was con-
 victed and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment under the LOMA for conspiring to
 assassinate President Mugabe in 1995. In January Sithole filed an appeal, and the
 sentencing judge called for a pardon in light of Sithole's age, poor health, and evi-
 dence of the Government's prior notice of the assassination plan. At year's end,
 Sithole remained free on bail pending a ruling on his appeal.
 The Government proposed new legislation to replace the LOMA-the Public Order
 and Security Bill (POSB). However, the new draft bill, while significantly amended
 from the 1997 version following strong public protests from human rights and legal
 organizations, contained several negative elements similar to the LOMA, including
 vague definitions of political and security crimes, harsh penalties for failure to re-
 port the acts of others, and restrictions on freedom of assembly, speech, and associa-
 tion. The POSB passed Parliament but as of year's end, the President had not
 signed this legislation. Consequently, the LOMA remained in effect.
 According to the Government, the total prison population was reduced to 18,000
 from 22,000 in 1996, due in large part to alternative sentencing under the commu-
 nity service program for youth offenders. The Government reports that 6,000 pris-
 oners are pretrial detainees. Detainees spent an average of 6 months incarcerated
 before their trials because of a critical shortage of magistrates and court inter-
 preters.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary has a well-deserved reputation for independence. However,
 on occasion the executive branch refuses to abide by judicial decisions.
 The Customary Law and Local Courts Act of 1990 created a unitary court system,
 consisting of headmen's courts, chiefs' courts, magistrates' courts, the High Court,
 and the Supreme Court. With this restructuring, civil and customary law cases may
 be heard at all levels of the judiciary, including the Supreme Court.
 Judges are appointed for life and can be removed from the bench only for gross
 misconduct. They can not be discharged or transferred for political reasons. Mag-
 istrates, who are part of the civil service rather than the judiciary, hear the vast
 majority of cases and are sometimes subject to political pressure. Military courts
 deal with disciplinary or court-martial proceedings. Police courts, which can sen-
 tence a police officer to confinement to camp or demotion, handle disciplinary and
 misconduct cases. Trials in both these latter courts meet internationally accepted
 standards for fair trials; defendants in these courts have the right to appeal to the
 Supreme Court. All levels of the judiciary often make rulings unpopular with the
 Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary rigorously
 enforces this right. Every defendant has the right to a lawyer of his choosing. How-
 ever, well over 90 percent of defendants in magistrates' courts do not have legal rep-
 resentation. In criminal cases, an indigent defendant may apply to have the Govern-
 ment provide an attorney, but this is rarely done and rarely granted. However, in
 capital cases the Government provides an attorney for all defendants unable to af-
 ford one. Litigants in civil cases can request legal assistance from the NGO Legal
 Resources Foundation. The government-established Citizens Advice Bureau was
 eliminated due to budget constraints in 1997. All litigants are represented in the
 High Court. The Supreme Court has instructed magistrates to ensure that unrepre-
 sented defendants fully understand their rights and to weigh any mitigating cir-
 cumstances in criminal cases, whether or not the accused presents them as part of
 his defense.
 The right to appeal exists in all cases and is automatic in cases in which the
 death penalty is imposed. Trials are open to the public except in certain security
 cases. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and the right to present wit-
 nesses and question witnesses against them. Defendants and their attorneys gen-
 erally have access to government-held evidence relevant to their cases. The legal
 system does not discriminate against women or minorities. However, some High
 Court judges imposed lenient sentences in some cases of rape and child sexual
 abuse, andlocal women's and legal organizations challenged these decisions.
 
 
 468
 The Government generally abided by court decisions even when it was strongly
 opposed to the rulings. However, the Government routinely delayed payment of
 court costs or judgments awarded against it. For example, the CIO continued its re-
 fusal to pay damages awarded by the High Court to a former opposition party offi-
 cial whom CIO agents had tortured in 1990.
 Local legal and human rights organizations strongly criticized the Attorney Gen-
 eral for declining to prosecute the Mayor of Chitungwiza, Joseph Macheka, for
 shooting to death one man and wounding two others who allegedly attempted to rob
 Macheka's liquor store during the January food riots. Macheka was the successful
 ruling ZANU-PF party candidate in a contentious mayoral election campaign
 against an independent. The Attorney General determined that Macheka was acting
 in self-defense and that prosecution, therefore, was not in the public interest. Legal
 and human rights critics accused. the Attorney General of bowing to political pres-
 sure and usurping the function of the court.
 Legal and human rights activists continued to criticize the Governmen s efforts
 to adopt constitutional amendments detrimental to human rights protections. For
 example, Amendment 11 (1992) changed the Constitution to allow corporal punish-
 ment of minors after the Supreme Court ruled that caning of minors constituted
 cruel and inhuman punishment. Amendment 14 (1996), which denies both men and
 women the right to confer automatic residency on their foreign spouses, was passed
 in response to a 1994 Supreme Court ruling declaring that women should have the
 same rights as men to confer residency and citizenship on their spouses (see Section
 2.d.). Amendments to the Constitution are not ratified by the public but are subject
 only to the ZANU-PF-dominated Parliament's approval.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or cor-
 respondence. Human rights groups are concerned that Amendment 14 erodes these
 constitutional rights by repealing Section 11 of the Constitution which-specifies pro-
 tection for the right to the privacy of one's home and from the compulsory acquisi-
 tion of property without compensation. Although Government authorities generally
 respect citizens' right to privacy and violations are subject to legal sanction, it is
 widely known that the Government sometimes monitors private correspondence and
 telephones, particularly international communications. Police routinely engaged in
 unauthorized searches of homes during the January food riots, seeking evidence or
 looted property.
 The need for land reform is accepted almost universally, however, there are prob-
 lems with implementation of the 1992 Land Acquisition Act (Land Act). Under the
 Land Act, farmers whose lands have been designated for acquisition may appeal
 only the amount of compensation, not the initial decision to acquire their farms.
 President Mugabe repeatedly has said the Government would not compensate for
 land, but only for improvements, a position not sustainable under the act. However,
 the President reversed that position during the Government's September 9-11 land
 conference for international donors, when government ministers promised to abide
 by the act. In the past, the act was implemented largely along racial lines; the Gov-
 ernment stated that black-owned commercial farms would not be subject to acquisi-
 tion. However, some of the original 1,461 farms designated in November 1997 for
 compulsory land acquisition, many of which remain on the revised list, are owned
 by the black, urban elite. In some cases, land apparently was targeted for acquisi-
 tion to achieve political goals.
 By year's end, approximately 400 farms were removed from the list of those to
 be acquired following the filing of 1,420 administrative appeals with the Ministry
 of Lands and Agriculture. In November the Government issued notices that it
 owned 841 farms, leading to a number of farm in the east being invaded by impov-
 erished blacks some of whom were armed. The Government called for the squatters
 to vacate the farms they had occupied in order to proceed with an orderly resettle-
 ment program. The Government stated that its resettlement program would begin
 with 118 primarily underutilized and derelict farms offered by commercial farmers.
 By year's end, the Government had resettled only 4 of the designated farms, and
 it continued to send unclear messages about its resettlement program. On one hand,
 President Mugabe made statements during the year that the Government would
 confiscate farms and pay only for improvements to the land (for example, buildings
 and irrigation systems), but not for the land itself. In December Mugabe stated that
 the Government would take farms and issue IOUs for payment at a later date. On
 the other hand, senior ministers stated that the resettlement program would pro-
 ceed along the path outlined during the September land donors conference. How-
 ever, government officials continue to avoid any detailed discussion about the issue
 
 
 469
 of compensation. At year's end, the resettlement process remained mired in bureau-
 cratic and financial gridlock.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion but allows for legislation to limit this freedom in the "interest of defense, public
 safety, public order, state economic interests, public morality, and public health." Al-
 though the independent press is increasingly open and critical of the Government,
 there is some degree of self-censorship in private media and a high degree in the
 government-controlled press. For example, government-owned media reported that
 the March 3-4 national "stayaway" called by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
 Unions (ZCTU) was a failure, despite widespread evidence of mass participation.
 Self-censorship is aggravated by antidefamation laws that make no distinction be-
 tween public and private persons. In addition an extremely broad Official Secrets
 Act makes it a crime to divulge "any information acquired in the course of official
 duties."
 The Government showed a modest increase in tolerance for private media criti-
 cism of official corruption during the Chidyausiku Commissions investigation into
 fraud and malfeasance in the management of the war victims compensation fund.
 However, the Commission's report, which was submitted to the Government in July,
 was not made public by years end.
 In March an outspoken ZANU-PF parliamentarian, Dzikimai Mavhaire, was re-
 moved from his position as Masvingo provincial chairman and barred from hblding
 any party office for 2 years by the party's politburo. While debating in the legisla-
 ture, Mavhaire called for presidential term limits and said that President Mugabe
 had to go. President Mugabe threatened to discipline the Speaker of Parliament,
 Cyril Ndebele, for subsequently ruling that Mavhaire had legislative immunity for
 any statements made in Parliament. The party did not punish the speaker, but the
 party's disciplinary actions against Mavhaire remain in effect. In March the Infor-
 mation Minister Chen Chimutengwende told the state-controlled broadcasting serv-
 ice and newspapers not to report any statements or activities by the ZCTU.
 The major print media (seven English language newspapers and one local-lan-
 guage tabloid) belong to the Mass Media Trust, a holding company heavily influ-
 enced by the ruling party. The Ministry of Information controls the Zimbabwe Inter-
 Africa News Agency wire service. A new consortium, Associated Newspapers of
 Zimbabwe (ANZ), backed by foreign (60 percent) and domestic (40 percent) inves-
 tors, has launched the first of five new weeklies tailored to community-level reader-
 ship.
 The Government controls the only two daily newspapers, the Chronicle and the
 Herald; the ANZ delayed its plans to launch a new countrywide daily until 1999.
 The small independent press consists primarily of three weekly and three monthly
 magazines. They carefully monitor government policies and open their pages to op-
 position critics. Other minor independent publications exist with fewer than 3,000
 subscribers.
 All radio and television channels are government owned and controlled. Following
 a Supreme Court ruling that the Government's monopoly on telecommunications
 was unconstitutional because it interfered with the right to freedom of expression,
 the Government granted a broadcasting license to private television station Joy Tel-
 evision (Joy TV). However, Joy TV's independence has been questioned because of
 the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Commission's (ZBC) apparent favoritism both in grant-
 ing Joy TV a license, which was denied to earlier bidders, and in speculation over
 possible ZBC editorial control of Joy TV programming. President Mugabe's nephew,
 Leo Mugabe, reportedly has financial ties to Joy TV.
 Books and films are subject to review by the Zimbabwe Board of Censors. A film
 on the liberation struggle, which the National War Veteran's Association claimed
 was offensive and which was seized by the police in 1996, is now publicly available.
 The University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Amendment Act and the National Council for
 Higher Education Act curtail academic freedom by restricting the independence of
 universities, making them subject to government influence, and extending the dis-
 ciplinary powers of the university authorities against staff and students. Police used
 tear gas on campus and arrested several UZ students during May and June after
 students protested government delays in disbursement of their subsidies, and al-
 leged corruption in the administration of campus housing and food services, and
 nepotism in the foreign student sponsorship program.
 Te University closed in June following 3 days of violent student protests against
 the new fee structures; a show of solidarity with UZ classmates disrupted classes
 at both the Harare Polytechnic and the National University of Science and Tech-
 nology in Bulawayo. The UZ's new executive policy of appointed rather than elected
 
 
 470
 deans of faculty caused further dissatisfaction among students. The UZ reopened for
 continuing students only on October 25 but at year's end was not scheduled to admit
 new students until February 1999. In April police shot and injured a student
 protestor (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, however, the Government imposed some restrictions in prac-
 tice. Permits are not required for meetings or demonstrations. The Government was
 criticized sharply by human rights and labor leaders for its use of excessive force
 countrywide to restore law and order, following the January food riots. At least
 eight persons were killed and many were injured as a result of the police and mili-
 tary crackdown against suspected looters (see Sections L.a. and 1.c.).
 UZ students also accused the Government of encouraging the excessive use of
 force by the ZRP, leading to the April 23 shooting in the neck of a UZ student dur-
 ing campus protests (see Section 1.c.). The officer responsible for the shooting was
 suspended. Police disrupted student demonstrations in March, May and June (see
 Section 2.a.).
 In October police attempted to stop a: demonstration in support of constitutional
 reform during which some participants also tried to protest the country's interven-
 tion in the Congo. Police in Harare stopped the National Constitutional Assembly's
 (NCA) October 31 peaceful demonstration in support of a new constitution amid ru-
 mors that the event would turn into a protest against military involvement in the
 Democratic -Republic of the Congo. Demonstrations also occurred in other cities,
 with small numbers of persons participating. The police initially gave the NCA per-
 mission to hold the planned peaceful rally but rescinded permission on the day of
 the march following a series of press articles alleging that the march would include
 antiwar protestors. The NCA obtained a court order and held a generally peaceful
 demonstration in January 1999 directed at raising public awareness of constitu-
 tional reform issues.
 The Constitution provides for freedom- of association for political and nonpolitical
 organizations, including a broad spectrum of economic, social and professional
 groups, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. The formation
 of unions and political parties is not restricted. Organizations generally are free of
 governmental interference as long as their activities are viewed as nonpolitical.
 In a case brought by a women's nongovernmental organization (NGO), the Su-
 preme Court ruled unconstitutional those sections of the Private Voluntary Organi-
 zations Act of 1995, which had empowered the Minister of Social Welfare, Labor,
 and Public Service to suspend the executive body or "any member of the executive
 committee of an organization and to appoint persons to manage the affairs of the
 organization for a specified time." Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling, several new
 NGO's- decided to set up their organizations as "associations" connected with estab-
 lished NGO's so that their executive bodies would not be subject to government in-
 terference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice.
 In response to a 1994 Supreme Court ruling that Zimbabwe's law allowing men,
 but not women, to confer residency rights on their foreign born spouses was dis-
 criminatory and unconstitutional, the Government proposed a constitutional amend-
 ment establishing the practice in the Constitution. After an outcry from civic, par-
 ticularly women's, organizations, the Government withdrew the amendment and
 proposed a revised bill which the Parliament passed in 1996. The new law allows
 neither men nor women to confer citizenship on their foreign born spouses automati-
 cally. At year's end, the Ministry of Home Affairs had not implemented the new im-
 migration regulation.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. Zimbabwe provides first asylum. According to the Government, 130 asylum
 seekers were given refugee status, and at least five persons were denied first asy-
 lum during the year. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a
 valid claim to refugee status. There were reportedly 941 refugees in Zimbabwe from
 more than 20 countries; the largest groups consisted of 199 Rwandans, 148 Burun-
 dians, 115 Sudanese, 113 Congolese (Democratic Republic of the Congo), 88 Somalis,
 and 73 Angolans.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although theoretically citizens have the legal right to change their Government
 democratically; the political process continued to be tilted in favor of the ruling
 party. Two legislative changes went into effect lowering the bar for opposition can-
 didates to run for office and increasing the size of the electorate. The Political Par-
 ties Finance Act (PPFA) no longer based government financial grants on the number
 of members already in Parliament, but on a percentage of votes received in the last
 general election, with a minimum of 5 percent required.
 However, many opposition candidates continue to criticize the threshold as being
 too high, and only a few contested the September rural district council elections.
 There was minimal voter turnout for those elections and voting was delayed by one
 day in parts of Chipinge, where ZANU-PF does not have a stronghold, due to the
 absence of voting materials and irregularities in the voters' rolls. Independent elec-
 tion observers from a democracy NGO reported widespread fraud and intimidation
 in those elections where independents challenged ZANU-PF candidates.
 The unsuccessful independent Chitungwiza mayoral candidate, Fidelis Mhashu,
 petitioned the High Court on December 28, 1997 to have the election results thrown
 out, alleging that the election was not conducted in accordance with the Electoral
 and Urban Council Acts; that the voters roll used was defective; that his supporters
 suffered widespread intimidation; and that his votes were miscounted. On December
 3, the judge dismissed the case ruling that Mhashu did not explain sufficiently why
 he waited 3 months after the election of file his case.
 President Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party remained the dominant political force
 within the country. President Mugabe won reelection in March 1996 with little op-
 position in an election considered generally free and fair by hundreds of NGO mon-
 itors. In the 1995 parliamentary general elections, ZANU-PF captured 117 of the
 120 popularly elected seats. The 10 chiefs who sit as Members of Parliament (M.P.)
 are elected by their peers. The President also appoints 8 provincial governors, who
 sit as M.P.s, and 12 nonconstituency M.P.s. All 30 of these persons are ZANU-PF
 members. Constitutional Amendment 9 authorized the President to unilaterally de-
 clare a state of public emergency for a period of up to 14 days. Amendment 10
 granted the President sole power to dissolve Parliament and to appoint or remove
 a vice-president and any minister or deputy minister. That Amendment also allowed
 the President to appoint 20 M.P.s as detailed above. The net result of these constitu-
 tional amendments has been to consolidate the poiver of the executive branch and
 to limit the independence of M.P.s.
 There is no effective parliamentary opposition and the legislature remained subor-
 dinate to the executive branch. However, the Parliamentary Reform Committee re-
 leased a report in May, following more than a year of nationwide consultations,
 which recommended significant changes in key areas. It proposed that Parliament
 be given greater powers and resources to enhance public participation in govern-
 ment and increase legislative oversight of the executive branch. However, at year's
 end the executive branch had not responded to the report, although the Parliament
 proceeded with those recommendations that were within its power to carry out uni-
 laterally. There are many small opposition parties, but their growth is inhibited by
 a variety of factors, including the olitical Parties Finance Act (PPFA) (sections of
 which the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional in 1997), the Government's virtual
 monopoly of the electronic media, and credible reports of security force harassment
 of opposition and independent candidates and their supporters. In addition to seri-
 ous institutional problems, the opposition parties' lack of organization and leader-
 ship played a significant role in their poor electoral showing.
 There are institutional problems with the management and supervision of elec-
 tions. Although the Ministry of Justice technically administers the Electoral Act, the
 Registrar General's Office falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs. With a meager
 budget and a tiny staff seconded from the Ministry of Justice, the Electoral Super-
 visory Commission lacks the institutional capacity to oversee all of the country's
 polling stations. Nor do commissioners have the executive authority to order that
 an irregularity be corrected. Despite an attempt to computerize the voters' roll, it
 contains a very large number of redundancies or errors, including misspellings, mul-
 tiple entries, and names of deceased. Rural district council elections were held in
 September based on the national voters' roll despite strong opposition criticism of
 inaccuracies in the national election registry.
 Women participate in politics without legal restriction. However, according to
 local women's groups, husbands-particularly in rural areas-commonly force their
 wives to vote for the husband's preferred candidates.
 Twenty of the 150 M.P.s are women, including the Deputy Speaker of Parliament.
 Three cabinet ministers with portfolios, three ministers of state, and three deputy
 
 
 ministers are women. All major ethnic groups are represented in Parliament and
 in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Government permits local civic and human rights groups to operate,
 it monitors their activities closely, in particular those of the Catholic Commission
 for Justice and Peace and Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS).
 Other groups that promote human rights include the Legal Resources Foundation,
 the Southern African Foundation of the Disabled, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human
 Rights, the Child and the Law Project, the Musasa Project, the Zimbabwe Women
 Lawyers Association, the Women's Action Group, Women and Law in Southern Afri-
 ca, Women in Law and Development in Africa, Zimbabwe Women's Resource Centre
 and Network, Women and AIDS Support Network, and the Human Rights Research
 and Documentation Trust of Southern Africa. These NGO's worked on human rights
 and democracy issues including lobbying for revision of the Public Order and Secu-
 rity Bill, increasing poor women's access to the courts, raising awareness of the
 abuse of children, and eliminating irregularities in voter rolls. The Foundation for
 Democracy in Zimbabwe (FODEZI) was established in July 1997 as a watchdog or-
 ganization to support independent candidates. Amnesty International, Transparency
 International, and the International Committee of the Red Cross operate in
 Zimbabwe. The Government does not discourage representatives of international
 human rights groups from visiting Zimbabwe.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that "every person in Zimbabwe" is entitled to fun-
 damental rights whatever his race, tribe, place of origin, political opinions, color,
 creed, or sex.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is common
 and crosses all racial and economic lines. It extends throughout the country, and
 at times results in death. According to Women in Law and Development in Africa
 (WILDAF), domestic violence accounts for more than 60 percent of murder cases
 tried in the Harare High Court. The Musasa Project, a women's rights organization,
 established the first shelter in Zimbabwe for victims of domestic violence in 1997.
 This Harare-area shelter housed over 200 women throughout that year. Human
 rights groups noted that increased training improved police community relations of-
 ficers' handng of domestic violence cases. The media increasingly reported inci-
 dents of rape, incest, and sexual abuse of women and children.
 There was a significant increase in the number of reported rape cases country-
 wide; the majority of cases involved minor victims and family member abusers. Po-
 lice in the Midlands Province recorded a 43 percent increase in reported juvenile
 rape cases,_from 60 to 86, in the first quarter of the year, police in Zimbabwe's sec-
 ond largest city, Bulawayo, reported that an average of one woman was raped daily
 in that city between January and May, with one-third of the victims between the
 ages of 1 and 15 years. One hundred and seventy persons had appeared in the
 Harare courts for rape as of June. There were approximately 2,000 cases of rape
 reported in the first 6 months of 1997, up from 1,400 cases in the first half of 1996.
 Women's groups and the police believe the actual number is much higher, but the
 majority of cases go unreported because of the social stigma of rape. When cases
 come to court, lengthy sentences for rape and wife beating are generally imposed.
 However, a "binding over" order (an order to appear in court to respond to an accu-
 sation of violent behavior) is issued based only on actual physical abuse and not on
 threats of violence. In addition, the courts do not have the power to oust an abusive
 spouse from a matrimonial home.
 Since independence the Government has enacted major laws aimed at enhancing
 women's rights and countering certain traditional practices that discriminate
 against women. However, women remain disadvantaged in Zimbabwean society. Il-
 literacy, economic dependency, and prevailing social norms prevent rural women in
 particular from combating societal discrimination. The literacy rate for women over
 the age of 15 is estimated to be 80 percent while the male rate is about 90 percent.
 The 1998 United Nations Development Program's Human Development Report
 noted that in most regions of the country girls are underrepresented relative to boys
 in secondary schools. Despite legal prohibitions, women still are vulnerable to en-
 trenched customary practices, including the practice of pledging a young woman to
 marriage with a partner not of her choosing; the custom of forcing a widow to marry
 her late husband's brother; and the custom of offering a young girl as compensatory
 payment in interfamily disputes.

 The Legal Age of Majority Act (LAMA) and the Matrimonial Causes Act recognize
 women's right to own property independently of their husbands or fathers. However,
 while unmarried women may own property in their own names, women married
 under customary law are not allowed to own property jointly with their husbands.
 Nevertheless, during the September land conference, women's rights organizations
 effectively lobbied the Government to agree to create legislation giving married
 women joint spousal title to property offered under the resettlement program.
 Women's groups successfully lobbied legislators to abandon efforts by some parlia-
 mentarians to repeal the LAMA- Several male parliamentarians had argued for the
 reversal of the LAMA because of its perceived threat to parents' ability to choose
 marriage partners for their daughters. The Administration of Estates Amendment
 Act, which came into effect in October 1997, removes inheritance laws unfavorable
 to widows. Women's groups have praised the act as a major step toward ending the
 unfair and unequal distribution of inherited assets for women. At year's end, the
 new inheritance amendment was awaiting the President's signature to become law.
 Divorce and maintenance laws are favorable toward women, but women generally
 lack awareness of their rights under the law.
 Research conducted by the Training and Research Support Centre (a Harare-
 based NGO) revealed that one in three working women at all levels were subjected
 to sexual harassment in the workplace, as defined by Zimbabwean legal experts.
 The October 1996 to February 1997 study was based on questionnaires from 528
 working women.
 Although labor legislation prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of
 gender, women are concentrated in the lower echelons of the work force and com-
 monly face sexual harassment in the workplace.
 Several active women's rights groups, including WILDAF, the Musasa Project, the
 Zimbabwe Women Lawyers' Association, and the Women's Action Group, con-
 centrate on improving women's knowledge of their legal rights, increasing women's
 economic power, and combating domestic violence. Groups that focus on the issues
 of protection of women against domestic violence and sexual transmission of HIV/
 AIDS included the Women and AIDS Support Network and Musasa Project There
 is a gender affairs office in the Office of the President headed by Minister of State
 Oppah Rushesha.
 Children.-The Government continued to demonstrate its strong commitment to
 children's rights and welfare through a system of primary health care and education
 overseen by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. However, budget cuts and
 the lack of adequate attention to AIDS prevention are eroding the Government's ca-
 pacity to address children's needs in these areas. As a result of the AIDS epidemic,
 the number of orphans is projected to rise quickly. From a small number in 1990,
 there were an estimated 150,000 orphans in 1995, growing to a projected 543,000
 in 2000 and 918,000 in 2005. This will put a tremendous strain on both formal and
 traditional social systems to cope with the exploding problem. At the household
 level, there is an increased burden on the extended family, which has traditional
 responsibility for caring for orphans. Many grandparents are left caring for the
 young, and in some cases children or adolescents are heading families. At the pro-
 vincial and national levels, the governments are saddled with increasing demands
 for community orphan projects, orphanages, health care and school fees. The num-
 ber of street children, with the related problems of theft, street violence, drug use
 and violent death, is increasing.
 The Children's Protection and Adoption Act, the Guardianship of Minors Act, and
 the Deceased Person's Maintenance Act all protect the legal rights of minor chil-
 dren. While there is no compulsory education, Zimbabwe has made considerable
 progress in providing education for girls, and overall primary school attendance has
 increased by more than 400 percent since independence. About 93 percent of chil-
 dren reach grade 5. With the reintroduction of school fees in urban schools and
 rural secondary schools, however, enrollment has declined. If a family is unable to
 pay tuition costs, it is most often female children who leave school.
 There are an estimated 12,000 homeless street children in Zimbabwe, many of
 them the children of former Mozambican refugees or AIDS orphans. The number of
 incidents of child abuse, including incest (long taboo in Zimbabwean society), infan-
 ticide, child abandonment, and rape is increasing. It is not known yet whether the
 statistics reflect the fact that more cases are actually occurring or only that more
 are being reported. There are reports of child labor (see Section 6.d.). The Ministry
 of Justice's Vulnerable Witnesses Committee established victim-friendly courts
 (VFC) in 1997 to improve the judicial system's handling of child victims of rape and
 sexual abuse. There was a large volume of rape cases in the Harare VFC, which
 led to calls by children's rights advocates for additional courts to be established in
 
 
 474
 
 surroundin areas. The criminal justice system has special provisions for dealing
 with juvenie offenders.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is rarely per-
 formed in Zimbabwe. However, according to press reports, the initiation rites prac-
 ticed by the small Remba ethnic group in Midlands Province include infibulation,
 the most extreme form of FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-President Mugabe appointed a disability activist to Par-
 liament in 1995 to represent the needs of the disabled. The Disabled Persons Act
 of 1992 specifically prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in em-
 ployment, admission to public places, or provision of services and is viewed by advo-
 cates of the disabled as model legislation. In practice, however, the lack of resources
 for training and education severely hampers the ability of disabled people to com-
 pete for scarce jobs. Although the act stipulates that Government buildings should
 be accessible to disabled persons, for budgetary reasons this is rarely implemented.
 Disabled people face particularly harsh customary discrimination. According to tra-
 ditional belief, people with disabilities are considered bewitched, and reports of dis-
 abled children being hidden when visitors arrive are common.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Shona ethnic group makes up 77 per-
 cent of the population, Ndebele 14 percent, Kalanga 5 percent, whites 2 percent, and
 other ethnic groups 2 percent. Government services are provided on a nondiscrim-
 inatory basis, and the Government has sought to expand and improve the previously
 "whites only" infrastructure in urban areas to provide health and social services to
 all citizens. Nevertheless, in social terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified
 country. While schools and churches are all legally integrated, social interaction
 among racial groups is rare. Racial tensions have been sharpened by the Govern-
 ment's land reform program, which has threatened to compulsorily acquire pri-
 marily white-owned commercial farms without compensation. There were sporadic
 illegal occupations of white-owned farms by landless peasants. Although intertribal
 relations are generally very good, the disproportionate number of Shona speaking
 teachers and headmasters in Matabeleland schools remained a sensitive issue.
 Members of the Ndebele community criticized the Government's unequal distribu-
 tion of national resources and the Governments failure to compensate victims of the
 1980's Matabeleland killings. Some Ndebele youths in Bulawayo protested the 10th
 anniversary celebrations of the 1987 Unity Accord (ending predominately Ndebele-
 supported PF-ZAPU and Shona-backed ZANU political fighting after independence),
 accusing the Government of marginalizing the Ndebele ethnic group.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1985 Labor Relations Act (LRA) provides pri-
 vate sector workers with freedom of association and the right to elect their own rep-
 resentatives, publish newsletters, and set programs and policies that reflect the po-
 litical and economic interests of labor. Workers are free to form or join unions with-
 out prior authorization. The LRA allows for the existence of multiple unions per in-
 dustry, provided that each is registered with the Ministry of Public Service, Labor,
 and Social Welfare (MPSLSW). While the Government may deregister individual
 unions, the High Court has ruled that the LRA does not give the Minister the power
 to suspend or deregister the national umbrella labor confederation, the Zimbabwe
 Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
 Approximately 20 percent of the formal sector work force belongs to the 33 unions
 that form the ZCTU. ZCTU officers are elected by delegates of affiliated trade
 unions at congresses held every 5 years. While the Government encouraged the
 ZCTU's formation, anticipating that it would form the labor arm of ZANU-PF, it
 no longer directly influences ZCTU actions. The Government and the ZCTU often
 clash on economic policy, particularly the Economic Structural Adjustment Program
 . The Government usually does not consult either the ZCTU or employers before im-
 plementing policy decisions that affect the workplace. This lack of consultation often
 results in reactions that disrupt labor relations, thereby promoting uncertainty and
 even strikes.
 Following the Governments efforts in December 1997 to impose significant in-
 come and other tax increases without consultation, the ZCTU organized a nation-
 wide, 1-day work stoppage that month, and a 2-day "stayaway" in March. These
 were the two most successful labor actions in the country's history. The ZCTU also
 led two successful stayaways on November 11 and 18 to protest a 67 percent in-
 crease in fuel prices, and to demand a 20 percent pay increase for private and public
 sector workers. In a period of serious and prolonged economic decline, the ZCTU has
 gained widespread support at the forefront of an energized labor movement. Despite
 ZCTU Secretary General Morgan Tsvangirai's insistence that his organization seeks
 
 
 only to protect workers' rights, many citizens view the ZCTU as the only effective
 political opposition to the ruling ZANU-PF.
 The LRA allows for the formation of multiple national federations. A second um-
 brella labor organization, the Zimbabwe Federion of Trade Unions (ZFTU), was
 launched in October 1996 with the stated purpose of providing an alternative of the
 ZCTU. The new organization states that its goal is to work in collaboration with
 the Government, and it is openly critical of the ZCTEJ. The ZFTU's origin, leader-
 ship, and membership remained unclear at year's end. Although key personnel have
 not been identified publicly, most observers believe that they are principally former
 senior ZCTU leaders, some of whom were involuntarily separated from that organi-
 zation. No ZFTU activity has been observed.
 Public servants and their associations, the Public Service Association (PSA), the
 Zimbabwe Teachers Association (ZIMTA), and the Zimbabwe Nurses Association
 (ZINA), are not covered by the provisions of the LRA. Instead, their conditions of
 employment are provided for under the Constitution. Although civil servants con-
 stitutionally are barred from forming unions, in 1995 ZIMTA stated its intention to
 affiliate with the ZCTU and the PSA_ All public servants are deemed essential and
 are prohibited from striking.
 Under the threat of a 5-day nationwide strike from the ZCTU, President Mugabe
 agreed in early September to an unprecedented meeting of his senior cabinet offi-
 cials, employers, and ZCTU representatives to negotiate the repeal of tax increases
 scheduled for the end of the year. This was the first time since independence that
 labor negotiations had taken place on such a large scale. On September 9, Mugabe's
 Cabinet announced tax cuts to which the Government had agreed earlier, including
 a sales tax rollback, the elimination of 5 percent economic development levy on sala-
 ries and wages, a shift in income tax categories, and the postponement of implemen-
 tation of a proposed 15 percent tax on pension fund earnings. Workers viewed this
 agreement as a great success for the ZCTU and a concession by the Government
 However, by the end of September, high inflation and significant devaluation of the
 Zimbabwean dollar had eroded the tax rollback gains.
 Under pressure from the ZCTU and the civil servants associations, the Govern-
 ment strongly encouraged private sector employers and workers in major industries
 to negotiate salary increases in their respective national employment councils
 (NECs). The Government itself negotiated with civil servants (primarily through the
 PSA, which represents approximately half of the civil servants), for a pay raise. As
 a result of the new empowerment of the labor movement, employers were more will-
 ing to negotiate. By year's end, most NECs had approved at least a 20 percent in-
 crease for private sector workers, and civil servants received a 25 percent pay in-
 crease.
 The Labor Relations Amendment Act (LRAA) of 1992 specifies that workers may
 establish independent worker committees, which exist side by side with unions, in
 each plant. Worker committees must also be registered with the MPSLSW, which
 is free to refuse registration. Trade union officials believe that the formation of
 worker committees was an  attempt to dilute union authority. However, the ineffec-
 tiveness of worker committees demonstrated the need for the experienced worker
 representation of the established trade unions.
 The International Conference of Free Trade Unions (ICFTJ) has criticized
 Zimbabwean labor legislation for giving "wide scope to the authorities to declare
 that a given enterprise or industry constitutes an essential service, and then impose
 a ban (on strikes) on it." The authority to reclassify a previously nonessential serv-
 ice as essential was not used in 1997 or 1998. However, President Mugabe issued
 a ban on most collective job actions on November 27.
 Workers in sectors deemed "nonessential" have the right to strike, provided the
 union advises the Government 2 weeks in advance of its intention to do so. The Gov-
 ernment often has declared strikes illegal on the basis of failure to give timely no-
 tice. If the MPSLSW finds that administrative requirements were not met for a
 strike, it can issue a disposal order that gives the employer the right to dismiss
 striking workers. There were no reports that this occurred in 1998. Relatively few
 industry-specific strikes occurred, as employers were more willing to negotiate with
 the newly empowered labor movement. From January to September, new wage
 agreements were concluded in 16 industrial sectors, resulting in a 34 percent in-
 crease over the average basic wage for all sectors of $11.25 (Z$450) per month.
 In November a one-day national strike brought much of the country to a stand-
 still. Mobs of rioters burned cars and an army truck. In Harare most factories and
 businesses closed down (see Section l.a.).
 In November Mugabe used his presidential powers to make it illegal for unions
 or employers to stage collective action to apply pressure on the Government to
 change laws. The Government can outlaw a union if it defies the ban and assess
 
 
 476
 fines of up to $2,500 (Z$100,000). The Government also banned minibus operators
 from "facilitating" illegal collective actions.
 The ZCTU and its officials are free to associate with international labor organiza-
 tions and do so actively. The ZCTU is affiliated with the ICFTU and the Southern
 African Trade Union Coordinating Council.
 b. The Right to Organize -and Bargain Collectively.-The LRA provides workers
 with the right to organize. As originally-written, this act was silent on the right to
 bargain collectively. However, the 1992 LRAA permits unions to bargain collectively
 over wages. Worker committees, which by law are not organizationally part of the
 unions or the ZCTU, are empowered to negotiate with the management of a particu-
 lar plant on the conditions of labor and codes of conduct in the workplace, except
 for wages. The Labor Relations Tribunal (LRT) had 1,200 cases pending in Septem-
 ber, some of which have been awaiting a hearing for more'than 7 years.
 Collective bargaining wage negotiations take place on an industrywide basis be-
 tween the relevant union and employer organizations sitting on joint employment
 boards or councils. These bodies submit their agreements to the Registrar in the
 MPSLSW for approval. The Government retains the power to veto agreements that
 it believes would harm the economy. However, it does not directly involve itself in
 labor negotiations unless requested to do so by one of the two parties. When no
 trade union represents a specific sector, representatives of the organized workers,
 such as the professional associations, meet with the employer associations, under
 the mediation of labor officers from the MPSLSW. Public sector wages are deter-
 mined by the Salary Service Department of the MPSLSW, subject to the approval
 of an independent Public Service Commission (PSC). Each year PSC officials meet
 with PSA representatives to review wages and benefits. These reviews result in a
 recommendation that is forwarded to the MPSLSW. The Minister is not required
 by law to accept the recommendation.
 Employees designated as being in managerial positions are excluded from union
 membership and thus from the collective bargaining process. There were some re-
 ports that firms designated excessive numbers of employees as being in managerial
 positions in order to exclude them from the collective bargaining exercises.
 The LRA prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members.
 Complaints of such discrimination are referred to labor relations officers and may
 subsequently be adjudicated by the LRT. Such complaints are handled under the
 mechanism for resolving cases involving "unfair labor practices." The determining
 authority may direct that workers fired due to antiunion discrimination should be
 reinstated, although this has yet to be utilized in practice.
 The LRAA streamlined the procedure for adjudicating disputes by strengthening
 the LRT. Labor relations officers hear a dispute; their decision may be appealed to
 regional labor relations officers, after which the LRT may hear the case. Ultimately,
 it may be appealed to the Supreme Court. In 1993 the Government filled long va-
 cant positions on the LRT, but at year's end the LRT boards were still not fully
 staffed.
 The Export Processing Zones Act states the LRA shall not apply to workers in
 export processing zones. The ZCTU has negotiated directly with EPZ employers to
 allow some unions in the EPZ, although their number and level of activity remain
 low.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 and bonded labor by children. There were no reports that it occurred (see Section
 6.d.). Compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there were no reports that it was
 practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded labor by children. There were no reports that
 it occurred. Legislation passed in March 1997 bans employment of children under
 the age of 12 and restricts employment of those between the ages of 12 and 17 to
 light work during school holidays for periods not exceeding 6 hours per day. Light
 work is defined as work not likely to prejudice the education, health, safety, rest
 or social, physical, or mental development of a child. All hazardous employment,
 overtime and night shift work is banned for those under the age of 18. However,
 there is little to no enforcement of these laws. Children work in the agricultural sec-
 tor, and there were reports that children worked as domestics and as car-watchers
 on the streets. Although schooling is not compulsory, over 90 percent of children at-
 tend school through grade 5 (see Section 5).
 Child labor in the formal agricultural sector, such as on tea and coffee planta-
 tions, reportedly involves children working in the fields after school during the
 planting and harvesting seasons and full-time during school holidays. Long hours
 are common. Children often work alongside their parents and their working condi-
 tions approximate those of adults. While some form of child labor or child work on
 
 
 477
 large commercial farms is widespread, agrcultural organizations maintain that the
 labor performed is not exploitative, involuntary, contrary to law, or outside of cul-
 tural norms that allow children to engage in field work with their families. Anec-
 dotal evidence suggests some school schedules and calendars are tailored to allow
 children to work in the fields during busy farming periods. Economic hardship often
 makes child labor imperative for families to make ends meet.
 The AIDS epidemic now effects 20 to 25 percent of the population, and the rate
 of infection is accelerating. As a result, more children are forced to work in a variety
 of sectors to fill the income gap left by ill or deceased relatives. The number of chil-
 dren in adoptive homes or living on the streets is increasing rapidly. The number
 of AIDS orphans is expected to reach 543,000 by the year 2000, and 910,000 by the
 year 2005. The deteriorating economy also is forcing more children to work. Al-
 though child labor in the agricultural, domestic, and informal sectors increasingly
 is discussed, the Government and NGO's have been unable to gather concrete data
 on the number of cases.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The maximum legal workweek is 54 hours, and
 the law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest period per week. Working condi-
 tions are regulated by the Government on an industry-specific basis. The Constitu-
 tion empowers the PSC to set conditions of employment in the public sector. Govern-
 ment regulations for each of the 22 industrial sectors continue to specify minimum
 wages, hours, holidays, and required safety measures. In recent years, in an effort
 to opt out of the wage bargaining system, the Government mandated wage param-
 eters and specified minimum wage increases only for domestics and gardeners. Due
 to an ineffective monitoring system, many such workers are remunerated below the
 minimum wage.
 The minimum monthly wage for domestics and gardeners is approximately $12.50
 to $15.00 (Z$500 to Z$600) and is the de facto minimum wage for other workers.
 In most instances, the employer must provide housing and food to workers or allow-
 ances for such. On commercial farms, the employer may provide schooling for work-
 ers' children. The minimum wage is not sufficient to sustain a decent standard of
 living for a worker and family. The ILO pegs Zimbabwe's food poverty datum line
 at $100 (Z$4,000) per month. However, escalating inflation and substantial devalu-
 ation of the Zimbabwe dollar significantly reduced the standard of living for most
 workers. Workers in sectors covered under collective bargaining agreements re-
 ceived wage increases averaging 34 percent following several strikes. Inflation in-
 creased steadily, hovering around 30 percent in September, and eroded those gains.
 In theory, labor relations officers from the MPSLSW are assigned to monitor devel-
 opments in each plant to assure that government minimum wage policy and occupa-
 tional health and safety regulations are observed. In practice these offices are
 understaffed, cannot afford to inspect routinely workplaces, and must rely on vol-
 untary compliance and reporting by employers.
 Many of the basic legal protections do not apply to the vast majority of farm,
 mine, and domestic workers. Health and safety standards are determined only on
 an industry-specific basis. Despite the lack of general standards, there was a signifi-
 cant decrease in the number of occupational injuries and deaths. Seventy-five fatal
 job accidents had been reported as of September, compared with 200 in 1997. Simi-
 larly, 4,867 occupational injuries were reported during this same time period, com-
 pared with 14,000 in 1997. In theory workers have a legal right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment;
 in practice they risk the loss of their livelihood.
