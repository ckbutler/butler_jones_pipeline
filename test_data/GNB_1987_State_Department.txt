 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau adopted a constitutional form of
 government in May 1984, when the 4-year-old Revolutionary
 Council established after the 1980 coup d'etat was abolished.
 Following the promulgation of the Constitution, one-party
 elections were held for the National Popular Assembly, which
 in turn elected General Joao Bernardo Vieira to a 5-year term
 as President of the Council of State and chose the other
 members of the Council. According to the Constitution, the
 Assembly decides fundamental questions of internal and
 external policy, but it meets infrequently and effective power
 and day-to-day control rests in the hands of the President,
 the Council of State, and the party. The President serves as
 Head of State, Commander-in-Chief, and General Secretary of
 Guinea-Bissau's sole political party, the African Party for
 the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). Although
 the President is the most powerful member of the Council,
 decisionmaking is collegial rather than autocratic. The party
 selects all candidates for office.
 The armed forces (FARP) are responsible for state security,
 both external and internal, as mandated by the Constitution.
 The FARP leaders are usually members of the PAIGC and often
 hold key positions in the Politburo or Central Committee.
 Guinea-Bissau remains one of the least developed nations,
 dependent upon foreign aid for its survival. The Government's
 postindependence efforts to exercise central control over the
 economy resulted in chronic shortages of most basic
 commodities, high unemployment, and a weak national currency.
 In 1987 the Government, continuing a program of economic
 reform which began in late 1983, imposed a series of severe
 austerity measures to stimulate agricultural production and
 promote a shift from a state-run centralized economy to a free
 market system. While the 1987 reforms resulted in strong
 growth of the private sector, inflation remained high and the
 urban populations witnessed a sharp drop in their standard of
 living and purchasing power.
 Persons accused of political crimes are tried by military
 tribunals. Approximately 40 men remain imprisoned on an
 island in the Bijagos Archipelago. Most of these prisoners
 are serving sentences for complicity in a plot to overthrow
 President Vieira in October 1985. There have been no
 executions since six leaders of the 1985 plot were executed in
 July 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMANWRIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of officially inspired political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no known instances of torture and other cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment in 1987. The
 
 
 132
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment. However,
 prison conditions are unsanitary and cramped, and interrogation
 methods are severe. Prisoners' families routinely bring them
 food and medical supplies.
 Amnesty International (AI) received reports in 1986 that some
 of the detainees arrested in connection with the 1985 coup
 plot had been beaten and otherwise ill-treated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Arrests in Guinea-Bissau are frequently arbitrary, as arrest
 procedures are undefined and the use of arrest warrants is the
 exception rather than the rule. The modern legal system,
 inherited from the Portuguese colonial regime but modified by
 the Constitution, includes important procedural rights, such
 as the right to counsel and the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. Bail procedures
 are observed erratically. The Government has on occasion
 detained members of movements deemed hostile to the regime,
 such as the Yanque-Yanque religious movement. The Government
 has the legal right to exile prisoners but did not do so in
 1987.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Guinea-Bissau.
 Conscientious objectors are not exempt from military service.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and many
 urban dwellers continue to bring judicial disputes to
 recognized traditional counsellors. The official judicial
 system is based on the Portuguese model. With some exceptions,
 intervals between arrest and trial are often lengthy. All
 defense lawyers are court-appointed, as private legal practice
 is prohibited. The judiciary is a part of the executive
 branch. Trials involving state security usually are not open
 to outside observers and are conducted by military tribunals.
 FARP members are tried by military courts for all offenses.
 The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for both
 civilian and military cases except those involving national
 security matters, in which instance the Council of State
 reviews all decisions.
 The 1986 trials of former Vice President of the Council of
 State, Colonel Paulo Correia, and 55 others took place before
 the Superior Military Tribunal, the highest military court.
 The 12 persons sentenced to death appealed to the Council of
 State for clemency and, as 9 result, 6 had their death
 sentences commuted to 15-year prison terms. AI attended one
 session of the trial, and its 1987 report states it informed
 the Government of its concern that the trial had not conformed
 to international standards of fairness. However, it noted
 there had been an invited audience and the defendants had
 legal counsel.
 Of those convicted in the 1986 trials described above, an
 estimated 40 men remain incarcerated at a prison labor camp on
 an island in the Bijagos Archipelago. Although isolated from
 outside observers, the prisoners are reportedly under light
 guard and are responsible for growing much of their own food.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of domicile,
 person, and correspondence. These guarantees are not always
 respected in cases of serious crimes or state security when,
 for example, the use of search warrants is rare. International
 and domestic mail is subject to surveillance and censorship.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of intellectual, artistic,
 and scientific expression, with the significant exception of
 cases in which these rights are exercised in a manner "contrary
 to the promotion of social progress." In fact, the Government
 controls all information media and views the press as a vehicle
 of the party. Self-censorship by journalists is common;
 however, some criticism and questioning of policies is
 permitted, although never of individual officials. In 1987
 one journalist was fired from the national radio station
 following an-interview with a minister during which he,
 allegedly asked hostile questions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, an4 Government approval is not required for
 peaceful assemblies and demonstrations. However, all existing
 organizations and associations are linked to the Government or
 the party, including the sole labor union, the National Union
 of the Workers of Guinea-Bissau (UNTG), and antigovernment
 meetings are not tolerated.
 The UNTG is affiliated with-the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions and is a member of the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity. Strikes, while not specifically
 forbidden, do not occur. The manufacturing sector is extremely
 small and many major enterprises are state owned. The
 overwhelming Inajority of salaried workers are employees of the
 State, and the UNTG is forbidden to organize these public
 workers.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution and has
 been respected. Christians, Muslims, and animists worship
 freely, and proselytizing is permitted. However, the
 Government is concerned over a new and growing religious
 movement known as the Yanque-Yanque. This movement, founded a
 few years ago by a woman who claims to receive visions and to
 have healing powers, finds its support mainly among young
 people of the Balanta tribe. Yanque-Yanque is a monotheistic
 religion which rejects traditional animist, Christian, and
 Muslim values and is characterized by unusual and sometimes
 violent rituals which include the taking of a locally produced
 narcotic mixture. These rituals have occasionally caused
 physical harm to participants and even to persons outside the
 movement. The Yanque-Yanque reject modern social and economic
 structures including, by implication, the Government. While
 Yanque-Yanque does not presently constitute a political
 movement, the Government has maintained surveillance on
 members and occasionally questioned, detained, and even
 arrested its leaders on narcotics charges. The occasional
 
 
 134
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 taking of drugs, without any legal repercussions, is
 characteristic of the rituals of some other local religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are allowed to move freely throughout Guinea-Bissau.
 Foreign travel is not restricted, nor is citizenship revoked
 for political reasons. Thousands of persons have emigrated
 for economic reasons. Return of expatriates is encouraged,
 although the 1986 deaths of two opposition members in a
 mysterious car accident during their forced repatriation from
 Senegal convinced some government opponents that they would
 not be welcomed back to Guinea-Bissau. While sympathetic to
 the principal of asylum, Guinea-Bissau does not host
 significant numbers of refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The present political system makes no provisions for
 democratic change of government. Guinea-Bissau is led by the
 PAIGC party and military (FARP) elite, headed by President
 Joao Bernardo Vieira. By the terms of the Constitution, all
 political activity must take place within the party/state
 structure. The 1984 electoral slates for the National Popular
 Assembly at the district, regional, and national levels were
 party-prepared lists. The President, members of the Council
 of State, and National Popular Assembly deputies are elected
 to 5-year terms. There are provisions for constitutional
 amendments and national referendums to be initiated by the
 National Popular Assembly. No single ethnic group dominates
 party/government positions, but Papel and Creole (mixed-race)
 groups, predominantly located in and around the capital of
 Bissau, have disproportionate representation in the Government.
 Women have legal equality with men and hold some influential
 jobs in the party and the Government. The current Minister for
 Labor and Social Security and the President of the National
 Popular Assembly are both women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although international human rights groups have visited
 Guinea-Bissau, their visits have always been tightly
 controlled. The Government invited an Al mission to visit in
 1986. AI delegates held discussions in June 1986 with
 President Vieira and many other officials and, as noted,
 attended one session of the trial of Correia and others.
 There are no local human rights groups in Guinea-Bissau.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The population of Guinea-Bissau comprises diverse tribal
 groups, each with its own language, customs, and social
 organization. The Fula, Mandinga, Balanta, Manjaca, and Papel
 are important groups. Creoles enjoy an advantageous position
 within the society due to their generally higher level of
 education and their links abroad. Although the President and
 other influential leaders regularly urge the nation to
 overcome ethnic differences, the perception of economic
 dominance by Creoles (and to a lesser extent Fulas) has
 created resentment among other ethnic communities. Most of
 
 
 135
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 the defendants in the 1986 coup trial were members of the
 Balanta ethnic group.
 Discrimination against women, while officially prohibited,
 continues within certain ethnic groups, especially the Muslim
 Fulas and Mandinkas of the North and East. Among those groups
 female genital mutilation is still practiced, despite official
 prohibition and educational campaigns against this custom.
 Women enjoy higher status in the societies of the Balanta,
 Papel, and Bijagos groups living mainly in the southern
 coastal region.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 In an overwhelmingly rural and agricultural society,
 traditional division of labor practices both between sexes and
 age groups continue to prevail. Children in all rural
 communities work in the fields and at home for no pay. The
 Government does not attempt to discourage this practice and in
 fact delays the opening of schools until the rice season has
 ended. Even in the small modern sector, labor laws are
 ill-defined and unevenly enforced in Guinea-Bissau, due
 primarily to the extreme economic underdevelopment of the
 society. However, there are government regulations covering
 such matters as job-related disabilities and vacation rights,
 and the Government in 1987 approved a new labor code which set
 a minimum age of 14 for general factory labor and of 18 for
 heavy or dangerous labor, including all labor in mines. The
 normal workweek is 35 hours. There is no minimum wage.
