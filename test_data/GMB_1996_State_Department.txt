 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is controlled by President Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, the military leader-
 ship that joined him in a coup d'etat, and other members of the cabinet formed sub-
 sequently. Jammeh is the former chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling
 Council (AFPRC) that seized power in a coup d'etat in 1994, deposing the democrat-
 ically elected government of Sir Dawda Jawara. Jammeh became President follow-
 ing controversial elections in September that observers considered neither free nor
 fair. Following his election, Jammeh dissolved the AFPRC and declared the Cabinet
 to be the sole ruling body until the National Assembly is elected in January 1997.
 President Jammeh and his party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Con-
 struction (APRC), strongly backed by the armed forces, continue to dominate the
 Government and to repress most genuine opposition forces. The judiciary remained
 sensitive to government pressure.
 The Gambian National Army (GNA) reports to the Minister of Defense (who is
 now the President). The police report to the Minister of Interior. The National Intel-
 ligence Agency (NIA), established in 1995 by government decree, reports directly to
 the Head of State but is otherwise autonomous. The AFPRC Government and some
 members of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 The Gambia's population of just over 1 million consists largely of subsistence
 farmers growing rice, millet, maize, and groundnuts (peanuts), the country's pri-
 mary export crop. The private sector, led by reexporting, fisheries, horticulture, and
 tourism, contracted after the 1994 coup, but appears to be rebounding. Cuts in
 international economic assistance coupled with high population growth have wors-
 ened the economic decline.
 The Government's poor human rights record continued as it committed wide-
 spread and repeated human rights abuses, but it improved somewhat during the
 year. Although the Government repealed a decree banning all political activities, in
 practice citizens still do not have an effective opportunity to change their govern-
 ment, although parliamentary opposition is becoming increasingly significant. Secu-
 rity forces beat and abused detainees. The AFPRC arrested and detained senior gov-
 ernment officials and members of the press. It held detainees incommunicado and
 did not acknowledge their detentions; detained armed forces and police personnel
 without charge; banned political parties and specific individuals from political activ-
 ity; curbed political activities, publications, and other communications; violently dis-
 rupted opposition campaign trips; and intimidated the press. The rights to travel
 and the right to transfer funds or assets for senior officials of the former Jawara
 government remained restricted in several cases. Prison conditions remained poor,
 and the courts remained subject to executive influence. AFPRC decrees abrogated
 due process and allowed the Government to search, seize, and detain without war-
 rant or legal proceedings. The AFPRC ordered the arbitrary arrest, firing, and re-
 tirement of government officials and civil service employees loyal to the previous
 goverment. Discrimination against women persists. While health professionals
 have focused greater attention on the dangers of female genital mutilation (FGM),
 the practice is widespread and entrenched.
 The AEPRC took some steps toward the formation of democratic institutions, but
 still retained control. A new Constitution defining most aspects of the Second Re-
 public was approved in a national referendum in Augst and came into effect in
 January1997 with the inauguration of the President. However, restrictive security
 decrees remain in effect. Given harsh press intimidation, the independent press has
 shown caution and practices self-censorship.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were no developments in the 1995 deaths of Saidbou Haidara or Finance
 Minister Ousman Koro-Ceesay. The opposition used the lack of investigation in
 these cases to criticize the Government during the presidential campaign.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disapparances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The AFPRC did not suspend the previous Constitution's prohibition against torture
 and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment and the new Constitution also
 forbids such practice. However, there were reports by detainees that agents of the
 State used torture or the threat of torture in interrogating them.
 In January one of the detainees on trial for sedition testified that soldiers beat
 him in an attempt to obtain a confession from him. A woman on trial for sedition
 said that she was threatened with electric shock when she failed to answer ques-
 tions regarding clandestine publications alleged to have been in her possession.
 At the height of the September presidential election campaign, soldiers dragged
 100 to 200 members of the opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) from their
 vehicles headed to Banjul. The soldiers ripped off the UDP members' party-labeled
 shirts, fired shots over their heads, confiscated their public address system, and
 burned UDP election materials. The opposition party members were forced to go to
 NIA headquarters where they were harassed and beaten, stripped of their clothing,
 and forced to run from the building. One senior member of the 1DP leadership who
 refused to run was beaten with a rifle butt and suffered a broken hand.
 Conditions at Mile 2 and Janjanbureh prisons remained poor. Mile 2 prison was
 reported to be austere, overcrowded, and lacking in medical facilities. Prisoners are
 locked in their cells for over 20 hours each day. Other reports indicate that the
 AFPRC assigned military guards to augment the corrections staff at the prison, and
 there were credible reports of malnourishment, illness, and beatings of military and
 security detainees. Women are housed separately.
 Conditions in one local jail were reportedly unsanitary and overcrowded. Inmates
 slept on cement benches or the floor with no blankets. They were served two small
 meals a day, one consisting only of rice. There was one water tap in the cell area,
 but often no water.
 The Government permitted no visits by international human rights groups. The
 African Center for Democracy and Human Rights Studies submitted numerous in-
 formal requests throughout the year to inspect prison conditions and the status of
 detainees, but its requests were repeatedly thwarted by the Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The sections of the Constitution that pro-
 tect against arbitrary arrest and detention were superseded by various decrees of
 the AFPRC. While there are provisions in the new Constitution that will provide
 protections, the restrictive security decrees that limited the previous Constitution
 remain in force. The AFPRC frequently and arbitrarily arrested military and police
 personnel, civil servants, parastatal staff, and media representatives. In 1995 the
 AFPRC declared by decree that the NIA would have the power to search, seize, de-
 tain, or arrest any individual or property without due process, and that the Minister
 of Interior could order a 90-day detention without charge and not subject to writ
 of habeas corpus. In January the AFPRC issued Decree 66, extending indefinitely
 the period the Minister of Interior may hold a person without charge. The new Con-
 stitution does not supersede these decrees, which remain in force.
 The regime subjected prominent civilians in and out of government to lengthy sur-
 prise interrogations in uncomfortable circumstances, often lasting overnight, and de-
 tained some officials for extended periods.
 Member of Parliament Lamin Waa Juwara was reported missing in March. In-
 quiries by family members were met with claims that the Government knew noth-
 ing about his detention or whereabouts. Senior government officials have privately
 acknowledged to a foreign diplomat that the Government is holding Juwara, but it
 has not publicly acknowledged his detention or charged him with any offense.
 In January and in July, the Supreme Court rejected writ of habeas corpus appli-
 cations for Housainou Njie and Momodou Cadi Chai, held in detention for political
 reasons since October 1995. The Court maintained that Decrees 57 and 66 give the
 Government the right to detain prisoners indefinitely. They were unconditionally re-
 leased on November 4.
 In January two visiting Senegalese journalists were seized and harassed by the
 NIA. They were later released only after repeatedly explaining their presence in the
 country.
 
 
 A student and freelance reporter was arrested in February and detained for 7
 days by the NIA, reportedly for submissions he made to the British Broadcasting
 Corporation Focus on Africa program.
 The Government brought charges against all independent newspapers in March
 for failing to make annual returns (information regarding ownership of the paper
 and a signed bond). The newspapers said that the returns had been made, and the
 charges were subsequently dropped.
 In April the NA detained reporter S.B. Danso for 24 hours reportedly in reaction
 to a story he wrote about Mrs. Tuti Fal Jameh, wife of the Head of State.
 In June the NIA arrested and interrogated journalist Ansmana Badjie in connec-
 tion with "negative reporting." He subsequently left the country fearing persecution.
 In May journalists Alieu Badara Sowe and Bruce Asemota were arrested at their
 respective offices. They were held incommunicado for 16 days and then released.
 Both Badara and Sowe had written articles reporting fraud and dismissals in the
 national police department. While in detention, police demanded that they reveal
 their sources. Newspaper stories stated that Asemota was beaten.
 Prior to the September 26 presidential election, opposition supporters were ar-
 rested and allegedly intimidated by the security and armed forces (see S ction 1.c.).
 Following the election, there were several reports of opposition supporterp being ar-
 rested and detained for allegedly making critical remarks about the government
 party.
 In September the public relations officer for the opposition UDP disappeared fol-
 lowing the party's launching ceremony. His mother said that men claiming to be
 NIA officers came to her residence looking for him. He a peared in Dakar a week
 later, claiming he had to flee his country because he was harassed and intimidated
 by the MA.
 The authorities generally did not permit families independent observers, or other
 private citizens to visit military, police, or civilian detainees. Family members of de-
 tainees were subjected to intimidation and harassment by security forces, who made
 verbal threats and unannounced searches. In July two wives of detainees were fol-
 lowed home by NIA agents after meeting with a local human rights organization.
 Their houses were immediately searched and they were threatened with detention.
 The AFPRC did not provide an accounting of detainees. Since the dissolution of
 the AFPRC, the President and the Cabinet govern. The decision regarding arrests
 and detentions lies with the executive branch. A journalist and a local nongovern-
 mental organization named 29 military and police personnel whom they claimed
 have been arrested and detained since July 22, 1994. Of these 11 were released un-
 conditionally on October 29. The reasons for these arrests and detentions are largely
 unknown. Along with military, police personnel, and civilians in long-term deten-
 tion, the authorities detained an unknown number of additional people for shorter
 periods, ranging from hours to days. The majority of the 35 people arrested in Octo-
 ber1995, allegdly for attempting to organize a demonstration, were released by the
 end of 1996. The remainder reportedly have been charged with sedition. In August
 the AFPRC issued a decree banning a number of former political parties and their
 members from political activity for 30 years (see Section 3).
 The Head of State pardoned 60 prisoners. In January four soldiers who had been
 detained since the 1994 military coup were granted amnesty. In February 20 pris-
 oners, some who were political detainees from 1995, were pardoned. In July 13 polit-
 ical detainees were released. In October 11 security detainees were released, fol-
 lowed by 12 political detainees in November.
 The government did not exile opponents. However, three senior officials of the
 former government, President Jawara, Vice President Sabally, and Secretary Gen-
 eral Janxa, remain outside the country under threat of arrest and detention if they
 return. Other officials who were outside the country at the time of the coup are at
 similar risk.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, the courts are traditionally responsive to executive branch pres-
 sure.
 The judicial system comprises a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (based
 in London), the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the magistrate courts (one
 in each of the five divisions plus one in Banjul and one in Kanifing). The new Con-
 stitution provides for a reconfiguration of the courts in which a Supreme Court will
 replace the Privy Council as the ultimate court of appeal. Village chiefs preside over
 local courts at the village level. The AFPRC claimed that the judicial provisions of
 the Constitution remained in effect, but exempted its own decrees from court chal-
 lenge and ignored due process with respect to arrest, detention, and trial.
 The AFPRC appointed a number of commissions to investigate individuals and or-
 ganizations suspected of corruption. These commissions have powers similar to a
 
 
 106
 grand jury, including the authority to imprison and fine for contempt, and to im-
 prison or demand bond from individuals considered likely to abscond. The commis-
 sion findings recommended that the Government ban certain former politicians from
 running for political office for 5 to 20 years.
 Despite these incidents, the judicial system remains structurally intact and recog-
 nizes customary Shari'a and general law. Customary law covers marriage and di-
 vorce for non-Muslims, inheritance, land tenure, tribal and clan leadership, and all
 other traditional and social relations. Shari'a law is observed primarily in Muslim
 marriage and divorce matters. Under Shari'a women receive half of what men re-
 ceive in inheritance. General law, following the English model, applies to felonies,
 misdemeanors in urban areas, and the formal business sector. Trials are public, and
 defendants have the right to an attorney at their own cost.
 Although total numbers are not available, most prisoners detained under the
 AFPRC's anticorruption campaign, or for security reasons, were political detainees.
 The bulk of those detained were released by year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Exist-
 ing Constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search were abrogated as part of De-
 cree 45. AFPRC priorities in security matters and corruption investigations override
 all Constitutional safeguards. Despite the new Constitution, Decree 45 remains in
 force.
 Police seized private property and documents without due process and placed
 armed guards at homes and other properties suspected of having been acquired with
 embezzled or misappropriated funds. The AFPRC froze accounts of people under
 suspicion and prohibited by decree the transfer of their property. A number of in-
 stances remain unresolved. Observers assume that the Government monitors citi-
 zens engaged in activity that it deems objectionable. In the past, surveillance in-
 cluded monitoring of telephones and mail. The AFPRC also denied persons under
 house arrest access to international telephone service.
 Opposition leader Ousainou Darboe fled his home and took refuge in the Senegal-
 ese embassy for 4 days following the presidential elections. The NIA posted agents
 outside Darboe's house, and Darboe claimed that the NIA made repeated death
 threats and harassed him. NIA agents were later withdrawn, and Darboe resumed
 his political activity.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The old and new Constitutions provide for free-
 dom of speech and the press but in practice the AFPRC significantly restricted these
 freedoms. Until August political activities of all kinds, inc luding possession and dis-
 tribution of political literature or engaging in political discourse by any other means,
 was prohibited. Although Decree 89, promulgated in August, lifed some prohibi-
 tions on political activity, an atmosphere of fear remained regarding political action
 and relatively free exercise of political rights began only in December with the open-
 ing of the legislative eletoral campaign.
 The AFPRC attempted to require diplomats to secure government approval for all
 public statements.
 The AFPRC used government decrees, summary arrest, interrogation, and deten-
 tion to intimidate and silence journalists and newspapers that published articles
 that it deemed inaccurate or sensitive (see Section 1.d.). In Marc the AFPRC en-
 acted Decrees 70 and 71, which required all newspapers to pest a $10,000 bond or
 cease publication. While publishers posted the bonds within the allotted time frame,
 the Ministry of Justice rejected the bonds, claiming that the newspapers did not
 meet other conditions, not initially stipulated in the decree. As a result, nongovern-
 mental newspapers ceased publication for 1 week until the Minister of Justice ac-
 cepted the bends. Fear of reprisals and government action forced all newspapers to
 exercise self-censorship. English, French, and other foreign newspapers and maga-
 zines are available. Although still independent, the nongovernment press grew cau-
 tious as the four major independent dailies practiced increasing self-censorship. Fol-
 lowing the September presidential election, there was some lessening of restrictions
 on the press with greater visibility for opposition views and more criticism of gov-
 ernment policies.
 Although the AFPRC called for analysis and criticism-of the way in which it gov-
 erned, it frequently carried out reprisals against individuals who publicly criticized
 the Government. A government-sponsored television station, The Gambia's first,
 began broadcasting nationwide in September. During the presidential election cam-
 paign, the programming consisted mostly of government propaganda. The country
 also receives broadcasts from Senegal. Wealthy private consumers also use satellite
 systems.
 
 
 107
 Radio broadcasts from one government and two private stations normally did not
 reach listeners in the eastern part of the country until power was increased late in
 the year. Private radio stations simulcast news provided by Radio Gambia, the gov-
 ernment station. Senegalese and international radio broadcasts attract wide audi-
 ences.
 During the presidential elections, the government party dominated the public
 media. The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission reported that the Head
 of State had more than 1,400 minutes of air time, while the leading opposition can-
 didate had only 60 minutes.
 There is no university, but a university extension program completed its first aca-
 demic year in August. There are no reports of any government restrictions on aca-
 demic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peacefid Assembly and Association.-AFPRC decrees banned politi-
 cal organizations and political meetings of any kind throughout most of the year.
 WhilelDecree 89 lifted the ban on political activities in August, the AFPRC's subse-
 quent banning from politics of the major opposition political parties, all former
 presidents, vice presidents, and ministers, and other politicians; and its imposition
 of stiff penalties of life imprisonment or a $100,000 fine considerably restricted po-
 litical activity and involvement.
 c. Freedom of Re igion.-The Constitution, which was partially suspended or
 modified after the AFPRC took power, and traditional laws provide for freedom of
 religion. Adherents of all faiths are free to worship without government restriction.
 The new Constitution provides for freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The new Constitution provides for freedom of movement. Freedom of
 movement for ordinary citizens remained unimpeded, but the authorities prohibited
 those under investigation for corruption or security charges from leaving the coun-
 try. Journalists and government officials have been required to produce travel clear-
 ances. Former ministers were not allowed to leave the country.
 In June the Head of State instructed divisional commissioners not to issue pass-
 ports to young people until after September, when the farming season ended.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. The Government provides first asylum and it did so for approximately 1,500
 persons from Liberia and Sierra Leone in 1996, according to UNHCR. The Govern-
 ment works with the UNHCR in approving cases: the UNHCR identifies those that
 qualify for asylum or refugee status and the Government approves. There were no
 reports of persons forced to return to countries in which they feared persecution.
 The Gambia continues to host a p proximately 2,000 Senegales refugees from the
 Casamane region, and the APRC ontinued to work with the UNHCR, the Gain-
 bian Red Cross;" and other organizations in dealing with refugees. Additionally,
 there are hundreds of refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone. While there were no
 reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status, in No-
 vember the Government reevaluated the status of many of the refugees from Liberia
 and Sierra Leone, following an attack on a military barracks near the Senegalese
 border.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have an effective right to change their government, although par-
 liamentary opposition is becoming increasingly significant. The first decree issued
 by the AFPRC in 1994 suspended legislative and executive sections of the Constitu-
 tion, including provisions or Parliament and elections. Although the Government
 repealed a decree banning all political activities, in practice citizens still do not have
 any effective means by which to change their government. Decree 89 allowed the
 resumption of political activities with serious limitations on specific organizations
 and individuals. The Decree banned all persons who held the offices of president,
 vice president, and minister since 1965 from involvement in politics for 30 years
 from the date of the AFPRC's coup d'etat. Banned under the same conditions were
 the People's Progressive Party, the National Convention Party, and the Gambia Peo-
 ples Party. The penalty for violation of the decree is a fine of $100,000 or possible
 life imprisonment. The Decree was widely interpreted as a tactic by the AFPRC to
 eliminate political opponents in the presidential elections.
 Citizens attempted to exercise the right to change their government through a
 democratic process in presidential elections held in September. However, the few
 international observers that were present noted serious problems in the electoral
 process. Foreign governments condemned the election as not free and fair primarily
 because of restrictions imposed by the Government prior to the election.
 
 
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, and there are no
 obstacles to the participation of women in government. Four of the 16 ministers in
 the AFPRC Executive Council (cabinet) were women. The AFPRC appointed more
 women to government positions than the previous government. The new Constitu-
 tion will expand the voting rights of women at the local level.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are few organizations in The Gambia whose mandate permits human rights
 monitoring. The AFPRC promulgated Decree 81 requiring nongovernmental organi-
 zations (NGO's) to register with a National Advisory Council, to be appointed by the
 Government. This Council is to have the authority to deny, suspend, or cancel any
 NGO's right to operate, including international NGO's.
 The AFPRC believes it inappropriate for international human rights observers to
 express concern for those whom the Government suspects of corruption or involve-
 ment in subversion, since the Government considers them criminals. There are two
 organizations whose primary mandate is the promotion of human rights-the Inter-
 national Society for Human Rights (ISHRA) and the African Center for Democracy
 and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS). Both ISHRA and ACDHRS have conducted
 training in democratic rights and civic education. ACDHRS made numerous calls
 throughout the year for the Government to provide information on the judicial sta-
 tus of detainees, account for alleged disappearances and beatings at the hands of
 security forces, and release those held without charge. No visits of prisons were
 granted to international human rights organizations and inquiries as to the status
 of prisoners were often ignored or denied.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The old and new Constitutions prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 disability, language, or social status.
 Women.-Domestic violence, including abuse, is occasionally reported, but its oc-
 currence is not believed to be extensive. Police respond if cases are reported, and
 prosecute offenders if citizens file complaints. The media cover cases on trial.
 Shari'a law is usually applied in divorce and inheritance. Marriages are usually
 arranged, and polygyny is practiced. Women normally receive a lower proportion of
 assets distributed thugh inheritance than do male relatives.
 Empoyment in the formal sector is open to women at the same salary rates as
 men. No statutory discrimination exists in other kinds of employment, although
 women are generally employed in endeavors such as food vending or subsistence
 farming.
 Women face extensive discrimination in education and employment but not at the
 hands of government. Families generally school male children before female chil-
 dren. Females constitute about one-third of primary school students and roughly
 one-fourth of high school students.
 Children.-The Government does not mandate compulsory education and opportu-
 nities for secondr education are limited. The care and welfare of children in dis-
 tress is considered primarily a family responsibility. Authorities intervene when
 cases of abuse or mistreatment are brought to their attention.
 The  practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by
 international health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health,
 is widespread and entrenched. Reports place the number of women having under-
 gone FGM anywhere from 60 to 90 percent. Seven of the 9 ethnic rups practice
 FGM at ages varying from shortly aftr birth until 18 years old. Although a news-
 paper article in Auguat alleged female circumcision was a means to prevent AIDS,
 a subsequent article' in the Government's newspaper said that "the Government
 backs the eradication of female circumcision" . The Government, however, has not
 implemented legislation against FGM and, in the absence of legislation, the judici-
 ary is not prepared to address the problem
 People WitDsabiities.-There are no statutes or regulations requiring acces-
 sibility for the disabled. No legal discrimination against the physically disabled ex-
 ists in employment, education, or other state services. Severely disabled individuals
 subsist primarily through private charity. Less severely disabled individuals are
 fully accepted in society and encounter no discrimination in employment for which
 they are physically capable.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-tLabr law remained unmodified by the AFPRC re-
 gime. The Labor Act of 1990 applies to all workers, except civil servants. The act
 specifies that workers are free to form associations, including trade unions, and pro-
 
 
 109
 vides for their registration with the Government. It specifically prohibits police offi-
 cers and military personnel, as well as other civil service employees, from forming
 unions or striking. About 20 percent of the work force is employed in the modern
 wage sector, where unions are most active. Roughly 30,000 workers are union mem-
 bers, about 10 percent of the work force.
 The Gambian Worker's Confederation and the Gambian Workers' Union are the
 two main independent and competing umbrella organizations. Both are recognized
 by the Government, but relations with the AFPRC were not tested.
 The Labor Act authorizes strikes but requires that unions give the Commissioner
 of Labor 14 days' written notice before beginning an industrial action (28 days for
 essential services). It prohibits retribution against strikers who comply with the law
 regulating strikes. Upon application by an employer to the Supreme Court, the
 Court may prohibit industrial action that is ruled to be in pursuit of a political ob-
 jective. The Court may also forbid action judged to be in breach of a collectively
 agreed procedure for settlement of industrial disputes. Because of these provisions
 and the weakness of unions, few strikes occur.
 Unions may affiliate internationally, and there are no restrictions on union mem-
 bers' participation in international labor activities. The country applied in June
 1995 to join the International Labor Organization. It has been accepted in principle,
 but must make modifications to its labor and employment laws.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Act of 1990 allows
 workers to organize and bargain collectively. Although trade unions are small and
 fragmented, ollective bargaining takes plae. Each reognized union has guidelines
 for its activities specified'y the appropriate industrial council established and em-
 powered by the Labor Act. Union members' wages exceed legal minimums and are
 determined by collective bargaining, arbitration, or agreements reached between
 unions and management after insuring that the agreements are in compliance with
 labor law. No denial of registration has been reported. The act also sets minimum
 contract standards for hiring, training, terms of employment, wages, and termi-
 nation of employment. The act provides that contracts may not prohibit union mem-
 bership. Employers may not fire or discriminate against members of registered
 unions engaged in legal union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Criminal Code prohibits com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment is 18 years. There is no compulsory education, and because of limited
 secondary school openings, most children complete formal education by age 14 and
 then begin work. Employee labor cards, which include a person's age, are registered
 with the Labor Commissioner, but enforcement inspections rarely take place. Child
 labor protection does not extend to youth performing customary chores on family
 farms or engaged in petty trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-Minimum wages and working hours are estab-
 lished by law through six joint Industrial Councils-Commerce, Artisans, Transport,
 Port Operations, Agriculture, and Fisheries.
 Labor, management, and the Government are represented on these councils. The
 lowest minimum wage is about $1.35 (14 dalasis) per day for unskilled labor. This
 minimum wage is not adequate to sustain a suitable standard of living for a worker
 and family. Only 20 percent of the labor force, those in the formal economic sector,
 are covered by the minimum wage law. The majority of workers are privately or
 self-employed, often in agriculture. Most citizens do not live on a single worker's
 earnings but share resources within extended families.
 The basic legal workweek is 48 hours within a period not to exceed 6 consecutive
 days. A 30-minute lunch break is mandated. In the private sector, the workweek
 includes 4 8-hour work days and 2 4-hour work days (Friday and Saturday). Govern-
 ment employees are entitled to 1 month's paid annual leave after 1 year of service.
 Private sector employees receive between 14 and 30 days of paid annual leave, de-
 pending on length of service.
 The Labor Act specifies safety equipment that an employer must provide to em-
 ployees working in designated occupations. The Factory Act authorizes the Ministry
 of Labor to regulate factory health and safety, accident prevention, and dangerous
 trades and to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance with safety standards. En-
 forcement is spotty owing to insufficient and inadequately trained staff. Workers
 may refuse to work in dangerous situations and may demand protective equipment
 andclothing for hazardous workplaces.
