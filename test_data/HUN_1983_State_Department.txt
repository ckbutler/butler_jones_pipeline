 HUNGARY
 Hungary is ruled by a relatively small group within the
 Hungarian Socialist Workers' (Communist) Party, which maintains
 a monopoly on political power. Although a number of citizens'
 rights are prescribed by the Constitution, in practice the
 exercise of such rights is determined and controlled by the
 party.
 Political expression is tightly controlled, and participation
 in the political process is not possible outside the limits set
 by the party. The party has sought public support through an
 explicitly stated policy of social reconciliation under the
 tenet "he who is not against us is with us." The Communist
 Party's mass umbrella organization, the Patriotic People's
 Front, has also sought to ally itself more broadly with what it
 interprets as the aspirations of the Hungarian people.
 The Hungarian authorities deny that judicial sentences are
 meted out for political reasons, stating instead that arrests
 and prosecutions are for crimes "against the state and
 humanity." Nevertheless, Hungarian officials themselves admit
 that there are political prisoners. Emigration is possible
 within limits. Visits abroad, including to Western countries,
 are also possible within limits. Atheism is the official
 dogma. The practice of religion is allowed only within the
 framework of agreements reached between the Hungarian churches
 and the Government. Secret police, arbitrary prosecutors, and
 other coercive institutions exist, but have been somewhat
 curtailed.
 The Soviet Union has maintained military forces in Hungary
 since the end of World War II. Approximately 60,000 Soviet
 soldiers are currently stationed there--roughly the same number
 as prior to the 1956 revolution. This, and Hungary's
 geographic position, allow the Soviet Union a large degree of
 influence over Hungarian domestic and foreign policies.
 The human rights situation during 1983 reflected a
 contradictory pattern not unfamiliar to recent Hungarian
 history, with both positive and negative developments.
 Notably, the authorities harassed dissidents involved in
 samizdat (unofficial) publishing and distribution, indicating a
 desire to control such activities more tightly. A "boutique"
 used to circulate samizdat materials was forced to close.
 While no human rights activists were known to have been
 arrested or imprisoned, party cultural policy tightened and the
 authorities succeeded in preventing the substantial growth of a
 would-be autonomous peace movement which questioned Soviet as
 well as NATO nuclear weaponry. There was some indication of a
 desire to increase participation in the political system,
 including the party's decision in principle to require
 multiple candidates (though not parties) for most parliamentary
 and local council seats at the 1985 elections, and
 decentralization of some governmental authority. If this
 measure is fully carried out, it could be an important
 development in the system, although state institutions are not
 as important as party ones. There were several advances in
 Church-State relations. Economic reforms, emphasizing
 individual initiative and encouragement of private
 entrepreneurial spirit, continued to unfold, and Hungarians
 were provided new possibilities for traveling and working
 abroad.

 On balance, the human rights situation for non-conformists
 became slightly tighter, but the population as a whole, though
 burdened by economic uncertainties, probably was freer of the
 type of economic restrictions and interference with private
 life which had been widespread in the early years of Communist
 rule. Political rights are still tightly circumscribed.
 Hungary continued to evolve as a state offering its population
 considerable possibilities for self-expression, limited largely
 to the economic and cultural areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There is no evidence that killing for political motives
 occurred in Hungary during the reporting period.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reported disappearances in Hungary during
 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution states: "In the Hungarian People's Republic,
 citizens have the right to the protection of life, integrity of
 the body, and the preservation of good health." There are no
 known instances of torture in 1983 or in recent years.
 Citizens, in principle, may bring complaints against the
 police. Mistreatment of those who may have participated in the
 1956 revolution is believed to have ceased gradually after the
 end of the so-called consolidation phase in 1960-62, although
 there are reports that some who were involved and who remain in
 Hungary continue to have their activities limited. In 1983,
 the Government destroyed a number of graves in a Budapest
 cemetery which survivors of the 1956 revolution believe to be
 the resting place of anti-regime fighters who died then. The
 Government claims that after 25 years all graves may be
 routinely levelled, and it does not confirm the identities of
 those buried in the disputed graves. However, the sites of
 those who died on the Government side during 1956 were not
 disturbed.
 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in Hungary:
 "workhouse", which allows some privileges of visiting, outside
 work, and leave; "jail", which is more punitive, and "prison",
 which means a maximum-security penitentiary. Confinement
 conditions vary in relation to the category level of
 incarceration, but all levels are believed to provide adequate
 diet and health care. Hardened criminals are confined
 separately from those convicted of petty crimes. With varying
 degrees of frequency, depending an levels of imprisonment,
 prisoners are allowed visits by family members, other relatives
 and friends. There does not appear to be deliberate and
 willful or systematic mistreatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Citizens are generally free from arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of what offense
 he or she is suspected of having committed, and can be held at
 
 
 1011
 a police station for a maximum of 72 hours before charges must
 be filed. There is no right of bail or of provisional pretrial
 liberty. Although authorities have some discretion to grant
 pretrial liberty, they rarely do so. In cases of suspicion for
 major crimes, a person can be held in jail 30 days before
 trial, renewable twice for a maximum of three months.
 Hungary's new penal code, adopted in 1979, contains an article
 on incitement which permits officials to prosecute for a wide
 range of utterances or statements. There are reports of
 individuals being sentenced for denouncing the Communist Party
 or the Soviet presence in Hungary. Not all cases of incitement
 involve political matters, and frequently such cases result in
 short or suspended sentences.
 Another penal code provision on "espionage" provides for
 punishing "a person who obtains, collects, or gives out data
 which can be used against the Hungarian People's Republic with
 the purpose of forwarding them to a foreign government or
 organization...." Neither the nature of the data transmitted
 nor the nature of the recipient organization is clearly
 defined, thus allowing a broad interpretation by the
 authorities of the kind of "data" considered to be proscribed.
 In general, however, the new penal code is somewhat more
 lenient than the previous code. It provides lesser penalties
 for so-called political crimes on a small scale, such as
 offhand statements against the party or Government. Many such
 crimes are now misdemeanors, with the first offense often
 resulting in a short (three months) suspended sentence and a
 fine (usually about $40.00, which is roughly equivalent to 20
 percent of a worker's monthly wage). At the same time, the new
 penal code has taken a harder line against economic corruption;
 these crimes often incur more severe penalties. It appears to
 be difficult to get reduced or suspended sentences in
 corruption cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution stipulates that all court proceedings are
 open, except for cases specifically exempted by law (those
 involving morals or state secrets); and that "all courts are
 independent" and "subject to laws." All courts deal with
 criminal, political, and security cases. There are very few
 closed trials in Hungary. Those which are closed usually
 involve "national security" not otherwise defined. The
 Hungarian Government claims that defendants in closed trials
 are guaranteed the same rights as in any other trial. in
 general, judicial procedures are investigatory rather than
 adversarial in nature. There is no trial by jury. Defendants
 have the right to choose their own counsel. In political
 cases, it is assumed that the outcome is determined in advance
 by the authorities. Non-political trials are more likely to be
 handled in an impartial manner than are trials involving
 offenses considered to be political or crimes "against the
 state."
 The latest official information on political prisoners was the
 1980 public statement by the Hungarian Minister of Justice. He
 said that two-tenths of one percent of all Hungarians in jail
 can be classified as political prisoners, indicating an actual
 total of less than 50 individuals. The Minister described
 three categories of political prisoners: those accused of war
 crimes, espionage, and "incitement against the Hungarian
 Constitution." There is no independent information to either
 substantiate or rebut the Minister's statement.
 
 
 1012
 Additionally, approximately a dozen young men are believed to
 be serving jail sentences of up to three years for having
 refused conscription on the grounds of conscientious objection
 to military service.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Under the motto announced by Kadar in the early 1960's, "He who
 is not against us is with us," Hungarian practice has become
 more tolerant with respect to private activities of
 individuals. Gathering personal information by formal systems
 such as block wardens, widespread use of informers, and overt
 intrusions of the police into the daily life of persons have
 been substantially curtailed. Western radio broadcasts are not
 jammed. Parents who provide religious instruction to their
 children in their homes apparently are not harassed.
 Membership in the Communist Party or in party youth and other
 organizations is not mandatory, though the absence of
 membership will have an adverse impact upon career
 possibilities in some fields.
 The Constitution guarantees citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, as well as the secrecy of correspondence and
 privacy of the home, but in practice these are violated when
 the authorities determine this to be "in the interests of
 socialism." However, Hungarian practice does appear to afford
 a measure of due process. For example, search warrants are
 necessary in all cases. House searches require a court order,
 and must be carried out in the presence of two witnesses. A
 written inventory must be prepared of items removed from the
 premises. Available information corroborates general adherence
 to these procedures. It is assumed that such procedural steps
 as issuance of search warrants are "expedited" in instances of
 special interest, such as state security cases.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and press are subject to limitations in practice.
 According to the Constitution, these rights are qualified by
 the need to conform to the "interests of socialism and the
 people." A Hungarian citizen is, in practice, unable to speak
 publicly against the Communist form of government or Hungary's
 alliance with the Soviet Union. If the citizen opposes these
 basic tenets publicly, he or she may be subjected to varying
 measures of admonishment, harassment, and punishment. There is
 no legal protection for the citizen who exceeds the political
 limits on expression established by the Communist Party.
 Hungarian press, radio and television are government-owned and
 centrally managed. They observe current party guidelines,
 which include the maxim that the role of a journalist is to
 further the cause of Communism. Writers and editors themselves
 are presumed to understand the basic premises of domestic and
 foreign policy. Editors of newspapers or journals who do not
 conform sufficiently through self-censorship are subject to
 removal. The most recent case involved an iconoclastic
 literary journal, Mozgo Vilag ("Changing World"). Its chief
 editor was fired because, as the Ministry of Culture
 announcement said, for two years he had followed an editorial
 
 
 1013
 policy which raised the question of whether the journal was
 still Marxist. Some carefully nuanced differing views
 occasionally appear in the press and literature, but they are
 usually well within the general constraints imposed by the
 party. Recent examples include a wide-ranging debate on
 economic policy that lasted for several months in late 1982 in
 the pages of a popular economic magazine and a similar debate
 in 1983 on the sensitive question of the situation of the
 Gypsies, Hungary's largest minority. The weekly journal of the
 writers union has carried several articles questioning why the
 daily press does not discuss specific domestic and
 international problems more candidly.
 The authorities have banned the circulation of certain books or
 articles considered not to conform with accepted positions.
 The right to publish may be restricted for political reasons.
 The most recent example involved the prominent poet, Sandor
 Csoori, who was forbidden to publish for one year and sharply
 criticized in a press article after he wrote a preface to the
 autobiography of Miklos Duray, a Czechoslovak citizen of
 Hungarian nationality. The book was published (in Hungarian)
 in the United States, and Csoori's foreword, which discussed
 the issue of the Hungarian minorities who live in several
 neighboring communist countries, included criticism of the
 political and social system in Hungary and those countries.
 Western viewpoints can be heard infrequently on Hungarian radio
 and television. These may be the views of a Western spokesman,
 broadcast together with those of other participants in a panel
 discussion, or straight reporting of a Western official's
 comments on a topical international issue, such as U.S.-Soviet
 relations or events in Afghanistan or Poland. Hungary does not
 jam Western radios, and Austrian and Yugoslav radio and
 television broadcasts reach much of the country. Hungary
 permits some access to Western literature and films, including
 some television programs and about forty American films
 annually. Some Western periodicals are available in limited
 quantities in Hungary, usually at newsstands frequented by
 foreigners.
 Dissident activity in Hungary remains largely confined to
 several hundred intellectuals who live primarily in Budapest.
 Political dissidence is kept in check by official harassment.
 Hungary's economic progress over the last decade, its emphasis
 on consumerism, and its greater willingness than other Warsaw
 Pact governments to permit more frequent travel to the West
 have also contributed to the relative marginality of the
 dissident movement vis-a-vis Hungarian society as a whole. The
 Government has shown a general willingness to tolerate without
 explicit reply or rejoinder some expressions of dissent.
 However, it has occasionally expelled or permitted the
 emigration to the West of outspoken opponents of the political
 system. In at least two such cases, individuals later have
 returned to Hungary and resumed their residence and dissident
 activities.
 Hungarian dissidents meet irregularly for private discussions
 of political and other topics. One of the several groups of
 Hungarian dissidents is active in the distribution of
 prohibited books and articles in samizdat form. Since December
 1982, the authorities have engaged in a campaign of harassment
 against the samizdat activists. A popular Tuesday evening
 "boutique", which operated out of a downtown apartment for
 several years and had been a central distribution point, was
 raided on several occasions and material was confiscated.
 
 
 1014
 Samizdat activists while driving in their cars have regularly
 been stopped by the police in obvious harassment. During one
 such incident, a dissident editor suffered a concussion and was
 hospitalized for three days as a result of a beating when he
 objected to a search of his personal effects that was not
 authorized by warrant. He was tried in December for attacking
 the police who stopped him, and received a six-month sentence
 suspended for three years. There have been occasional press
 articles attacking the dissidents and their alleged Western
 supporters. One samizdat newsletter which was started in 1983
 announced that it was discontinuing publication after only two
 issues because of the police harassment, and the closing of the
 "boutique." However, seven issues of the most sophisticated
 samizdat publication, the journal Beszelo which discusses
 subjects and themes not permitted in the official press, have
 been circulated since late 1981 (four during 1983). Each of
 the most recent issues was printed in approximately 2,000
 copies, which were then passed informally to a wider readership
 throughout the country. Distribution of Beszelo and other
 samizdat literature is now believed to occur in a decentralized
 fashion.
 No arrests for dissident activity are known to have Occurred in
 1983. The editors of Beszelo were fined approximately $100
 each for unauthorized publishing in 1983, and during the summer
 amendments were made in the relevant law which would permit the
 authorities to impose higher fines by administrative means
 without the need to resort to court trial. However, the
 primary means by which the authorities seek to discourage or at
 least moderate dissident activities remain the tactics of
 influencing job possibilities and travel requests both
 positively and negatively.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 the right to form associations, these rights are qualified by
 the need to conform to the "interests of socialism and the
 people."  In practice, government approval or tacit acceptance
 is required for the exercise of these rights. As noted above,
 Hungarian dissidents are loosely organized. In December 1979,
 young intellectuals and professionals formed a group which they
 called the Foundation for the Assistance of the Poor (known by
 its Hungarian acronym SZETA). The stated purpose of the group
 was to raise money and provide financial, legal, and other
 assistance for the poor within Hungarian society. Their most
 significant recent activity was the samizdat publication during
 1983 of a well-printed collection of essays, poems, and
 drawings by thirty-seven writers and artists, some of them
 prominent members of the establishment. The proceeds from the
 sale of this book, In The Dark, were to be donated to the
 poor. Other dissidents meet frequently at an informal "free
 university" in Budapest, where academicians and dissidents
 lecture on topics which are not discussed in formal university
 institutions.
 A fledgling organization called "Peace Group for Dialogue" was
 organized in the second half of 1982 by young people, primarily
 university students and recent graduates. It sponsored several
 activities including lectures by Western peace activists. It
 held discussions with the official peace organization and with
 the authorities in an effort to carve out for itself an
 autonomous place in the country's political spectrum. It
 founded chapters outside Budapest in several cities and held a
 
 
 1015
 national coordinating conference. Approximately 450 members
 marched for the first time through Budapest on May 7, and then
 joined a larger group marching under the sponsorship of the
 state-controlled National Peace Council. The authorities have
 brought effective pressure against it. In May, they reversed
 themselves at the last moment and refused passports to Peace
 Group members who had intended to take part in a conference in
 the Western sectors of Berlin. In July, they prevented the
 holding of a peace camp in the eastern part of Hungary by
 refusing visas to or expelling Western sympathizers and by
 briefly detaining some 20 members of the Peace Group who sought
 to stage symbolic actions in the streets of Budapest and
 several other cities. The membership of the Group is believed
 to have dwindled considerably from a one-time high of several
 hundred. Many young people apparently concluded that the
 authorities were not prepared to tolerate a genuinely
 autonomous organization, and they did not wish to risk their
 careers by remaining with an organization whose members were
 increasingly being treated as dissidents.
 The Hungarian National Trade Union Council is one of the
 party's mass organizations and is controlled and directed by
 the party. It serves the purpose of indoctrinating workers in
 party policy. It also purports to represent worker interests
 within certain bounds. The Secretary General of the Council is
 a member of the HSWP Politburo, and participates in its
 deliberations. On the local and enterprise level, the Council
 has a veto right over nominations of managers by the state, and
 administers a system of shop distribution of benefits such as
 bonus money, profit sharing, enterprise-controlled housing,
 health care, and union vacation plans. Stewards can veto
 management decisions on personnel actions, plant safety and
 other work-related issues which do not comply with collective
 agreements and labor regulations. Disputed questions are
 referred to higher authorities for arbitration.
 The Hungarian Constitution does not provide for the right to
 strike, and government measures assure that strikes are rare.
 A number of Hungarian commentators have pointed out recently
 that they are not, however, prohibited by law. During 1983,
 the Trade Union Council's daily newspaper has carried several
 articles describing strikes in Hungary.  While explaining the
 official position that strikes are not an appropriate or
 necessary tool to protect workers' rights in Hungary, one such
 article acknowledged that there have been at least two or three
 localized strikes of several hours' duration in each of the
 major branches of Hungarian industry in the past seven or eight
 years. These strikes are described as due to the failure of
 management and union officials to implement existing agreements
 or to utilize other existing methods of conflict resolution.
 No major work stoppage which has either affected an entire
 industrial sector or assumed nation-wide proportions has taken
 place in over a quarter of a century.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although freedom of conscience and freedom of religious
 practice are guaranteed in the Constitution, they are subject
 to restrictions. The state opposes religion in principle, but
 does not rigorously impede its practice. Although steadfastly
 committed to atheism, the authorities profess the acceptability
 of believers and non-believers working together in the interest
 of "socialist society." The Government has generally improved
 relations with the hierarchies of the major religious
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 65
 
 
 1016
 denominations, many of which have representatives in the
 Parliament. At the same time, the state appears to be
 purposefully undermining the future of religion in Hungary by
 limiting the number of church-sponsored schools and by often
 imposing administrative hurdles to the construction of new
 churches. Holding religious beliefs prevents a citizen's
 advancement in government and in society in general.
 Some 19 religious denominations in Hungary are recognized by
 law; in addition, several smaller groups, such as Jehovah's
 Witnesses, exist but are not officially recognized.   Sizable
 religious groups in Hungary include Roman Catholics (5.25
 million), Reformed Calvinists (2 million), Evangelical
 Lutherans (0.5 million), and Jews (100,000). The only
 rabbinical seminary in Eastern Europe is in Hungary. The total
 number of persons manifesting some religious belief is
 estimated at 8.5 million out of a population of 10.7 million.
 There were several positive developments in church-state
 relations in 1983. The Catholic Church opened a Jesuit-staffed
 center for meditation. This is the first Jesuit facility in
 Hungary since the order was officially prohibited by the
 Government in 1950. Churches also obtained more liberal
 'provisions for the offering of religious instruction to
 children. An hour-long film on the Catholic Church, featuring
 an interview with the Primate, Cardinal Lekai, was shown on
 prime-time evening television. The Cardinal took part in the
 Pope's visit to Poland and Austria. The Pope conducted a
 ceremony in Austria at the grave of Cardinal Mindszenty, the
 former Hungarian Primate once jailed by the Communists. The
 religious denominations in Hungary also have generally good
 access to religious materials, including Bibles and prayer
 books. In many cases they print their own. They also publish
 periodicals and newspapers subject to the same state control as
 the publishing of secular material. During 1983, party and
 state officials expressed increased interest in cooperating
 with religious denominations on social matters of mutual
 concern, including the provision of adequate health care, the
 high divorce and alcohol rates, and juvenile delinquency.
 The churches do not act as organizing centers for dissent.
 Specialized dissension has grown up within the Catholic Church,
 centering around the "basic community" movement, which has
 accused the hierarchy of being dogmatic and
 "collaborationist." The Primate has criticized this movement
 and in 1982-1983 suspended or transferred several priests who
 have been prominent in it. In some instances, these priests
 have advocated conscientious objection to military service.
 The most prominent disciplinary action taken by the hierarchy
 has been against Father Bulanyi, the acknowledged leader of one
 segment of the movement. His right to say mass, preach, and
 administer the sacraments was suspended by the Cardinal in
 1982. Upon request of Cardinal Lekai, Cardinal Cassaroli wrote
 a letter from the Vatican in 1983 conveying the Pope's approval
 of the steps taken by the Hungarian church and calling upon the
 basic communities to obey the hierarchy. The Hungarian
 authorities are not known to have detained or arrested any
 clergy, but approximately a dozen young people have been
 sentenced to prison terms ranging up to three years for
 refusing military service. The right of conscientious
 objection is recognized for only two small denominations, the
 Nazarenes and the Jehovah's Witnesses.
 
 
 1017
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an identity booklet and must
 carry it with them while travelling; they must register with
 local police when moving from one locality to another. It is
 possible to transfer permanently from rural areas to Budapest,
 but permission is not always granted because of overcrowding
 and a scarcity of housing in the capital.
 Hungarian emigration law is restrictive. A person can normally
 apply to emigrate only if over 55 years of age and joining a
 parent, spouse, or child abroad. However, the law provides for
 exceptions in individual cases, and approximately 90 percent of
 Hungarians who apply to emigrate for purposes of family
 reunification eventually receive permission. Persons who are
 refused permission to emigrate may appeal and reapply;
 reapplications are sometimes successful, particularly if there
 are special humanitarian considerations. However, a few
 longstanding cases do remain. There are no systematic official
 sanctions, such as loss of employment or of housing, imposed on
 persons who seek to emigrate, and emigrants may take a modest
 amount of personal property with them.
 Hungary follows a cautiously liberal practice in permitting
 visits to the West, and eased its travel regulations to Western
 countries effective January 1, 1982. More than 500,000
 Hungarians currently visit the West annually, while more than
 5,000,000 visits are made annually to Warsaw Pact countries.
 It is possible to pay for trips to Western Europe and beyond,
 including North America, in Hungarian currency. Hungarian
 citizens now legally have the opportunity to visit the West at
 least once a year, instead of every third year as before, if
 relatives or friends abroad pay the costs. The modest hard
 currency allotment private travellers can receive once every
 three years to defray hard currency expenses was also increased
 in 1982, and adjustments were made to offset partially the
 effects of the devaluation of Hungarian currency in 1983.
 The right of travel remains at the discretion of the state
 rather than a prerogative of the individual. Exit permission
 for both Hungarian tourists and emigrants can be and
 occasionally is denied for vague "reasons of state." An
 official statement published in the Hungarian press in 1983
 claims that 99 percent of applications for travel to the West
 and 99.6 percent of all applications for travel are approved
 annually. These statistics cannot be confirmed independently.
 Persons who have emigrated legally from Hungary have a legal
 right to return. Persons who leave Hungary as visitors with
 permission to stay abroad only temporarily and who then fail to
 return are subject to prosecution and sentencing either in
 absentia or upon their return. Prosecution may not occur or,
 when it does, may amount to a formality leading to a suspended
 sentence and restrictions on travel abroad. Assiduous
 prosecution and other sanctions, such as confiscation of
 personal property and deprivation of former employment,
 sometimes occur.
 New regulations entered into force on July 1 which liberalized
 and simplified procedures for Hungarians to obtain permission
 to work abroad for up to five years. In many instances, a
 Hungarian who desires to work in the West may now get approval
 at the local level. The regulations envisage that the family
 may accompany the worker. The worker must agree to remit
 
 
 1018
 20 percent of hard currency earnings to the Hungarian National
 Bank, which will convert them into a Hungarian currency account
 that may be utilized by the individual within Hungary. The
 worker will be able to retain the remainder of the salary in
 hard currency.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Hungary is ruled by an elite group within the Hungarian
 Socialist Workers' (Communist) Party. There is no sanctioned
 political activity outside the party or the party-approved
 organizations. The Hungarian Constitution states that the
 party represents the "working class" and the "interests of the
 whole of the society." The party uses official or
 quasi-official organizations such as the Patriotic People's
 Front, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League to mobilize
 public support.
 In 1983, the party announced a limited electoral reform in
 which most seats in the National Assembly and all seats in
 local councils in the 1985 elections must be contested by at
 least two candidates. Candidates need not necessarily be
 members of the party, but all have to accept the policies of
 the party-controlled Patriotic People's Front and must be
 acceptable to that body. Multiple political parties will not
 be allowed, nor are similar measures proposed for the party
 hierarchy. Until now, neither elections nor legislative
 activity has provided a genuine opportunity for citizens to
 participate meaningfully in political life. The extent to
 which genuine electoral contests will be permitted and the
 legislative bodies will be allowed to exercise meaningful
 governmental responsibility remains questionable. Several
 small steps have been taken during the year, however, which
 suggest that more substantive scope may be permitted at least
 to local government institutions, though always subject to the
 ultimate authority and control of the Communisty Party which
 will retain the power to intervene as it deems necessary.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Hungarian Government refuses to accept charges or
 investigations of alleged human rights violations, stating that
 this would constitute "interference in internal affairs."
 Hungary has shown some willingness to engage in discussions
 with other countries on all aspects of the Helsinki Final Act,
 including its human rights provisions. In certain elements of
 its bilateral dialogue with some other countries, Hungary has
 been willing to discuss quietly some individual problem cases,
 particularly those dealing with emigration. Amnesty
 International's 1983 Report was concerned with restrictions on
 freedom of expression and movement, imprisonment of
 conscientious objectors, the use of the death penalty, and at
 least one instance in which a dissident was forcibly confined
 in a psychiatric hospital. Freedom House in 1983 called
 Hungary "not free."
 
 
 1019
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Most state-owned enterprises enjoy a comparatively high degree
 of autonomy. Government authorities do not as a rule impose
 specific production quotas on enterprises, but usually rely on
 macroeconomic policy tools to guide the economy. Some consumer
 prices, especially for food, are set largely by free market
 forces. Professional and skilled workers have extensive
 employment opportunities, on a part-time or full-time basis, in
 the private and quasi-private sectors. There are no food
 shortages in Hungary. Limited private farming activities have
 long been encouraged on both state and collective farms.
 Private farming accounts for about one-third of Hungary's total
 farm production. Moreover, the Hungarian Government has
 recently begun encouraging private enterprise-type activities
 in the consumer services sector and in small units within
 industrial enterprises. However, while the significance of
 private industrial activities is growing, the "private sector"
 is not expected to become a large component of the Hungarian
 economy. In short, through the combination of flexible prices
 and enterprise autonomy as well as through government
 encouragement of private farming within collectivized
 agriculture and private enterprise-type activities, Hungary has
 produced an economic system that is somewhat sensitive to
 consumer needs.
 One area of the consumer sector where Hungary is deficient is
 in housing. In 1980, there was an average of 1.5 persons per
 room in Hungarian dwellings. Although this figure reflects
 overcrowding, it is an improvement over 1970 when the average
 was about two persons per room. A substantial portion of this
 improvement in housing conditions can be attributed to the
 Government's encouragement of private home construction.
 A unified rate of exchange for both tourist and commercial
 transactions was established in 1981, and the rate is set
 weekly, generally in line with free market rates in Western
 Europe.
 Life expectancy at birth is 72 years, the infant mortality rate
 is 19.70 per 1,000 live births, and the ratio of caloric supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 is 133.24 percent. Hungary's population (10.7 million) is
 slowly declining; the present annual growth rate is minus
 0.10. Emphasis on education has yielded a published adult
 literacy rate of 98 percent. The primary school enrollment
 ratio was 96 for both male and female children. The percentage
 of population with access to safe water was 65.10, of which
 83.80 lived in urban areas, and 43.10 percent in rural areas.
 The percentage of population below the poverty level is not
 available.
 The party officially espouses the enhancement of the role of
 women in Hungarian society but results to date, as some candid
 articles in the press have acknowledged, remain limited. More
 than one-third of the members of the National Assembly are
 women. Women fill 31 percent of the positions on local
 councils, 42 percent of the leadership positions within the
 committees of the Young Communist League and 51 percent of the
 officer positions in the trade union councils. Nevertheless,
 there are few women at top levels in the Government or party.
 Only one of the 19 members of the Council of Ministers and one
 of the 12 members of the Politburo are female. Women still
 account for only one-eighth of the management positions in
 Hungarian industry-and agriculture. Approximately half of
 these individuals have attained their positions within the
 
 
 1020
 past five years. Women's share of the more senior jobs, such
 as general director at state industrial complexes, is
 considerably lower. Many women in such enterprises tend to
 work in the personnel and social-welfare sections rather than
 in the economic policymaking divisions. Women's share of
 professional positions has been increasing. At present, 7.6
 percent of Hungarian women are professionals. The figure for
 men is 8.6 percent.
 Ethnic minorities such as Romanians, Germans, Serbs, and
 Slovaks make up a very small percentage of the Hungarian
 population. Hungarian minority policy is "liberal" in theory
 and practice. Members of the minorities have full legal
 equality and substantial opportunity to obtain at least some
 education in their native language as well as to foster their
 native culture. Several million ethnic Hungarians live in the
 neighboring countries, particularly Romania and Czechoslovakia.
 A much larger number of Gypsies (estimates range up to five
 percent of the population) live in Hungary. They are not
 recognized as an official minority. Gypsies have equality as
 individuals before the law. In practice, the Hungarian
 Government engages in many programs specifically designed to
 raise the standard of living of Gypsies and help them to adjust
 to the mainstream of Hungarian life. However, Gypsies are on
 average considerably less well educated and poorer than the
 majority Magyar population or the recognized ethnic
 minorities. In recent years, candid discussion has been
 increasing in the press and specialized literature about the
 social and economic difficulties experienced by Gypsies,
 including the fact that considerable popular prejudice exists
 against them.
