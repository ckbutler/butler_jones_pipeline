 LEBANON
 Lebanon is a parliamentary republic in which the President is by tradition a
 Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of the
 Chamber of Deputies a Shi'a Muslim. The Parliament consists of 128 deputies,
 equally divided between Christian and Muslim representatives.
 Non-Lebanese military forces control much of Lebanon. These include about
 30,000 Syrian troops, a contingent of Israeli army regulars, an Israeli-supported mi-
 litia in southern Lebanon, and several armed Palestinian factions. All undermine
 the authority of the central Government and prevent the application of law in areas
 not under its control. In 1991 the Governments of Lebanon and Syria concluded a
 security agreement which provides a framework for cooperation between their
 armed forces. However, Syrian military and intelligence units in Lebanon conduct
 their activities independently of the agreement.
 In 1989 the Arab League brokered a peace settlement at Tail, Saudi Arabia, to
 end the hostilities in Lebanon. According to the Taif Accord, Syrian troops were
 scheduled to be redeployed from Lebanon's coastal population areas to the Biqa' Val-
 ley, with full redeployment to take place thereafter. The Syrian Government has re-
 fused to carry out that redeployment. Lebanese government officials have not
 pressed the issue, citing such reasons as the Lebanese Army's alleged unreadiness
 to take over security functions from Syrian forces. However, pervasive Syrian influ-
 ence over Lebanese politics and decisionmakers lies at the root of the Government's
 unwillingness to engage Syrian authorities on the withdrawal. This relationship
 with Syria does not reflect the will of significant segments of the Lebanese public.
 Israel exerts control in and near its self-proclaimed "security zone" in southern
 Lebanon through its surrogate, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), and the presence
 of about 1,000 Israeli troops. The SLA maintains a separate and arbitrary system
 of justice in the zone independent of Lebanese central authority. SLA officials have
 reportedly deported some alleged criminals to Israel to face legal charges. Also in
 south Lebanon, the Iranian-backed Shi'a Muslim militia, Hizballah, and allied Pal-
 estinian guerrillas continue to be locked in a cycle of raids and counterraids with
 Israeli forces and the SLA.
 Palestinian groups operate autonomously in refugee camps throughout the coun-
 try and maintain a separate, arbitrary system of justice for other Palestinians. Dur-
 ing the year, the Government continued to consolidate its authority in the parts of
 the country under its control, but has made little effort to disarm Hizballah and its
 allies, the SLA, or to reassert state control over the Palestinian refugee camps.
 The security forces comprise the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which may arrest
 and detain suspects on national security grounds; the Internal Security Forces (ISF)
 which enforce laws, conduct searches and arrests, and refer cases to the judiciary;
 and the State Security apparatus and the Surete Generale, both of which collect in-
 formation on groups that may jeopardize state security. The Surete Gonerale is also
 responsible for the issuance of passports and residency permits and for the censor-
 ship of foreign periodicals and movies that treat national-security issues.
 ore te 1975-90 hostilities, Lebanon was an important financ  and commer-
 cial center. The war weakened its commercial leaders hip and infficted massive dam-
 age on the economic infrastructure. In 1995 the economy continued to recover as the
 Government took steps to restore confidence and implement a reconstruction pro-
 gram.
 Since the end of hostilities, the Government has made no substantial effort to im-
 prove human rights conditions. Government abuses included the arbitrary arrest
 and detention of prsons opposing government policies. The Government continued
 to ban demonstrations and partially limit press freedom. There were credible r-
 ports that members of the security forces used excessive force and tortured some
 detainees. Prison conditions remained poor. Discrimination ag   ist women is a
 problem. Although the overall level of armed conflict declined, life and property, es-
 
 
 1214
 pecially in the south, are still threatened by artillery and aerial attacks by the var-
 ious contending forces. These forces continue to carry out abductions, assassinations,
 and terrorist bombings. The right of the people to change their government contin-
 ued to deteriorate. In May Parliament approved a law extending the term of munici-
 pal officials until December 31, 1996, thereby postponing elections which would
 have been required by June. Municipal elections have not been held since 1963. In
 October the Government secured passage of a constitutional amendment to extend
 the term of the current president by 3 years. That move met widespread opposition
 and cast further doubt on the ability of the citizens to change their government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra udicial Killing.-During the year, political killings
 declined as the Government further consolidated its authority over the country.
 However, at least one death was caused by the excessive use of force when on June
 18 an ISF sergeant shot and killed the driver of a car that failed to stop at an ISF
 checkpoint. The sergeant was tried and sentenced to 1 year imprisonment. The Gov-
 ernment has appealed for a more severe punishment.
 Various factions and unknown persons carried out assassinations. On August 31,
 unidentified assailants shot and killed Shaykh Nizar Al-Halabi, a Sunni cleric who
 headed a socio-political organization. Both the Nation's Party, an unknown group,
 and the Fatah-Revolutionary Council-The Correct Path claimed responsibility. On
 July 3, Ahmad AI-Assa'ad, the son of a former Speaker of Parliament, escaped harm
 when assailants threw hand grenades at him during a political rally which he had
 organized and at which he was speaking. The Government has not publicly inves-
 tigated the incident nor arrested several persons identified as suspects.
 There were no developments in the 1994 death of Tariq Hasaniyah, who was al-
 legedly beaten to death by authorities at the Bayt Al-Din Prison, nor in the 1994
 death of Fawzi Al-Rasi, who died while in the custody of the Ministry of Defense.
 On December 13, after six procedural postponements, the Court of Cassation
 began its retrial of Bassem Al-Firkh and Nameq Kamal for their roles in the 1976
 murders of US. Ambassador Francis Meloy, economic officer Robert Waring, and
 their driver Muhammad Mughrabi. In 1994 the Criminal Court declined to convict
 A1-Firkh on grounds that, while he participated in the abduction of Meloy and his
 colleagues, he did not participate in the actual killings. Kidnaping during the politi-
 cal strife from 1975 to 1990 is pardonable by Lebanon's 1991 Amnesty Law, but the
 assassination of diplomats is not. However, the same court found Kamal guilty of
 the murders and sentenced him to death. His sentence was later reduced to 4 years.
 In ordering the retrial of Al-Firkh and Kamal, the Court of Cassation agreedwith
 the public prosecutor's argument that the abduction and murder constitute one
 crime which cannot be separated.
 In 1994 security forces arrested three Iraqi diplomats assigned to Beirut and
 charged them with the murder of an Iraqi dissident. According to press reports, the
 suspects have admitted their guilt, but as of the end of the year no trial has yet
 been held. In June one of the diplomats died while in custody.
 b. Disappearance.-In February armed militia members kidnaped two persons
 from the Jazzine district and held them in captivity for 4 days. Credible sources
 claimed that Hizballah was responsible for the abduction. The Government did not
 investigate the incident or take measures to prevent such incidents from occurring
 in future.
 The Government has taken no judicial action against groups known to be respon-
 sible for the kidnapings of thousands of people during the unrest between 1975 to
 1990. On May 25, Parliament approved a law which will allow those who dis-
 appeared during the civil war to officially be declared dead. The law stipulates that
 interested parties may declare as dead any Lebanese or foreigner who has dis-
 appeared in Lebanon or abroad and for whose disappearance death was the most
 probable explanation. Petitioners may apply for a court certification 4 years after
 a declaration of disappearance and may not benefit from any properties inherited
 until 6 years after such a court certification. The law will facilitate the resolution
 of inheritance claims and second marriages.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continued to be credible reports that the Lebanese security forces used torture
 on some detainees. During the June Shi'a Muslim commemoration of Ashura in a
 Sunni neighborhood, several young Sunni males were arrested and allegedly beaten
 by members of the ISF. Some members of Parliament accused the ISF of torturing
 the detainees with electric shocks and called on the Minister of Interior to inves-
 
 
 1215
 tigate. The Minister ordered an investigation, but had not published any findings
 by year's end.
 In April the Lebanese Association for Human Rights claimed that the Govern-
 ment h~ad failed to take action on the kidnaping and torture of citizens by various
 militias. The Association formed an investigative committee to pursue this issue. In
 October two Russian tourists complained that they had been beaten and then de-
 tained in the local Hizballah Party headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut
 for having taken pictures. In response the Government took no action.
 In August lawyer Majid Fayyad complained publicly that security officers mis-
 treated his client, Tbtissam Nimr AlVAbd, who had been arrested in connection with
 the murder investigation of her husband Munir Al-Ghadban. The lawyer claimed
 that his client was beaten, insulted, and burned with cigarettes while in custody.
 The Government has not investigated the allegation.
 The prison system is regulated by law. In January the Government issued a spe-
 cial decree legalizing a detention facility at the Ministry of Defense (MOD) head-
 quarters building outside Beirut. Samir Jaja', the former leader of the dissolved
 Lebanese Forces militia, has been incarcerated in this facility since April 1994. The
 Government justifies the incarceration of JaJa' as one of only a handful of inmates
 at the high security MOD facility as a precautionary measure to ensure his safety.
 Jaja's lawyers have alleged that he has been mistreated while in prison and that
 his health has been jeopardized by his inadequately ventilated, poorly lit cell three
 floors below ground. In November a prison doctor reported that Ja'ja' was in good
 health, and prison authorities have allowed him increased daily exercise. Ja'ja' is
 not allowed to receive newspapers or have a radio or television set, but in December
 the public prosecutor granted his request for a bible and selected books and maga-
 zmes.
 Prison conditions do not meet internationally recognized minimum standards. In-
 mates lack heat and adequate shower and toilet facilities. The Ministry of Interior
 has acknowledged publicly that the prisons are overcrowded, with 50 to 60 prisoners
 often housed in one cell. There are as many as 60 children detained in prisons shar-
 ing the same facilities as adult prisoners. In June the Parliament's Human Rights
 Commission raised the issue of prison conditions in a letter to the Interior Minister,
 who promised to undertake an investigation. At year's end, the Interior Ministry
 had not released its findings. However, the Interior Minister announced in Decem-
 ber a $50 million budgetary request to rehabilitate the prison system.
 In addition to the regular prisons, the Surete Gonerale, which is responsible for
 the prevention of the illegal entry of foreigners, also operates a detention facility.
 Hundreds of foreigners-mostly Egyptians and Sri Lankans-have been detained
 there pending deportation. They are reportedly held in small, poorly ventilated cells.
 Abuses also occurred in areas outside the State's authority, especially in the Pal-
 estinian refugee camps. There were credible reports that members of the various
 Palestinian groups which control the camps detained and tortured their Palestinian
 rivals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government resorts to arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. The law requires security forces to obtain arrest warrants before
 making arrests. However, military prosecutors, who are responsible for cases involv-
 ing the military as well as those involving espionage, treason, weapons possession,
 and draft evasion, reportedly issue blank warrants to be completed after a suspect
 has been arrested. Arresting officers must refer a suspect to a prosecutor within 24
 hours of arrest, but frequently do not.
 The law requires the authorities to release suspects after 48 hours of arrest if
 they do not bring formal charges against them. Some prosecutors flout this require-
 ment and detain suspects for long periods in pretrial confinement without a court
 order. The law authorizes a judge to remand suspects to incommunicado detention
 for a period of 10 days, with an extension for an additional 10 days. There is a sys-
 tem of bail, but it is only available to those accused of petty crimes, not to those
 accused of felonies. Defendants have the right to legal counsel, but there is no public
 defender's office. The Bar Association has an office to assist those who cannot afford
 a lawyer.
 The army continued thepractice of arbitrary arrest, detaining mainly the former
 members of the Lebanese Forces (LF), the dissolved Christian militia. In March se-
 curity forces arrested 30 LF supporters for having participated in a commemorative
 gathering on the first anniversary of the bombing of a church in the AI-Zuq area
 north of Beirut. Attendees had gathered both to remember those who had died and
 to protest the arrest of former LF leader Samir Ja'ja' and other LF members who
 were accused of committing that bombing (see Sections 1.c. and i.e.).
 Local militias and non-Lebanese forces continued to conduct arbitrary arrests in
 areas outside central Government control The SLA detains an estimated 100-200
 
 
 1216
 Lebanese citizens and an undetermined number of Palestinians at A1-Khiyam prison
 in south Lebanon. During the year, the SLA began to permit the families of detain-
 ees to visit their relatives in the prison. It also released 73 detainees, most of whom
 are Lebanese citizens.
 Israel is known to hold several Lebanese citizens, including Sheikh Abed Karim
 Obaid and Mustafa Dirani, figures associated with the so-called Islamic Resistance.
 Palestinian refugees are subject to arrest, detention, and harassment by the state
 security forces, Syrian security forces, the various militias, and rival Palestinians.
 In the recent past, the Government resorted to exile as a means of punishment.
 In 1991 it pardoned former army commander General Michel 'Awn and two of his
 aides, on condition that they depart the country and remain in exile for 5 years.
 General 'Awn acted as prime minister from 1988 to 1990 and was accused of usurp-
 ing power, He and his aidesremain in exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is generally impartial and independ-
 ent of executive authority. However, influential politicians and Syrian intelligence
 officers sometimes intervene to protect their clients from prosecution.
 The judicial system is composed of the regular civilian courts- military courts,
 which try cases involving military personnel; the Judicial Council, which tries na-
 tional security offenses; and the religious tribunals of the various denominations
 which adjudicate disputes involving marriage, inheritance, and personal status.
 The Judicial Council is a permanent tribunal of five senior judges who adjudicate
 cases involving threats to state security. On the recommendation of the Minister of
 Justice, the Cabinet decides whether to try a case before this tribunal.
 The Ministry of Justice appoints judges according to a formula based on the con-
 fessional affiliation of the prospective judge. The shortage of judges has impeded ef-
 forts to adjudicate cases backloged during the years of internal conflict.
 Trials delays are also caused by the Government's inability to conduct investiga-
 tions in areas outside its control. According to the Minister of Interior, at least 600
 prisoners were in detention awaiting trial during some parts of 1995.
 In June the Military Court found Hassan Yassin, Wafiq Nasser, and Suhayi Al-
 Homsi guilty of participation in the 1994 bombing deaths of Hizballah figure Fu'ad
 Mughnyah and two other persons. The court sentenced Yassin and Nasser to 15
 years of hard labor and Al-Homsi to 3 years of hard labor. The Government also
 convicted in absentia Abmad Al-Hallaq, Tawfiq Nasser, and Ghassan Al-Homsi. Al-
 Hallaq and Nasser were given death sentences and A1-Homsi life with hard labor.
 The military prosecutor appealed several of the verdicts, asking for a more severe
 punishment. The appeal was pending at year's end.
 In June the Judicial Council found former Lebanese Forces commander Samir
 Jaja' and co-defendant Kamil Karam guilty of the 1990 murders of Liberal Party
 leader Dany Chamoun and his family. Ja'ja' was sentenced to death, commuted to
 life in prison at hard labor; Karam was sentenced to 15 years, commuted to 10
 years. Another defendant, Rafiq Saade, was found innocent of murder, but sen-
 tenced to 1 year already served on a weapons charge. Nine others charged in the
 murders, all of whom fled the country prior to their indictments, were found guilty
 of one or more murders. Ghassan Touma, Tony Obeid, Atef Boulos Habre, Naja Anis
 Kaddam, and Elias Georges Awad were sentenced in absentia to death, commuted
 to life in prison. Jean Chahine, Georges Feghali, Elie Akiki, and Jean Samia were
 sentenced in absentia to 15 years, commuted to 10 years. All were ordered to pay
 a nominal sum as compensation to the relatives of the murdered. The verdict of the
 Judicial Council is not subject to appeal. The Government is seeking the extradition
 of those outside of Lebanon.
 The 1994 Al-Zuq church bombing trial, in which Jaja' is also a defendant, was
 continued indefinitely (sine die) in May. In December Jaja' was indicted for plotting
 the 1991 assassination attempt on then Minister of Defense Michel Murr. December
 also saw the beginning of the trial of Ja'ja' and Rafiq Saade for the 1990 assassina-
 tion of former Kata'ib Party member Dr. Elyas AJ-Zayek.
 The legal system is discriminatory in its handling of so-called crimes of honor. Ac-
 cording to the Penal Code, the male killer of a wife, sister, or mother may benefit
 from a reduced sentence if he can demonstrate that he committed the crime in re-
 sponse to an illegitimate sexual relationship conducted by the victim.
 In refugee camps, Palestinian elements operate an autonomous and arbitrary sys-
 tem of justice. The Islamic militia, Hizballah, which operates its own system of jus-
 tice, announced in 1994 that it will apply Islamic law in areas under its control.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although the authorities often detain
 for short periods and without charges political opponents of the Syrian and Leba-
 nese governments.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 the authorities generally show little interest in controlling the personal lives of citi-
 
 
 1217
 zens, they are not reluctant to interfere with the privacy of persons regarded as foes
 of the Government. Laws require that prosecutors obtain warrants before entering
 houses except when the army is in hot pursuit of an armed attacker.
 The Government uses informer networks and monitors telephones to gather infor-
 mation on its adversaries. In May the Prime Minister announced that he would
 refer cases to the Prosecutor-General to prevent the intelligence services from tap-
 ping telephone conversations. Additionally, in a note to the Post and Teleconmuni-
 cations Ministry, the Prime Minster said that he would hold private cellular phone
 companies responsible should they allow government agencies to tap cellular phones
 without warrants.
 Militias and non-Lebanese forces operating outside areas of central government
 authority have frequently violated rights of privacy. Various factions also use in-
 former networks and monitor telephones to obtain information on their adversaries.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Vwlations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-An undetermined number of civilians continue to be killed in South Leb-
 anon, as Hizballah and its associated Lebanese and Palestinian militias, on the one
 hand, and Israeli forces and the SLA, on the other, engae in a cycle of violence.
 The former attacked SLA troops deployed on Lebanese soil and in June conducted
 a rocket attack on northern Israel. lsraeli forces conducted repeated air strikes and
 artillery barrages on purported guerrilla and terrorist targets inside Lebanon.
 There were numerous incidents in the cycle of attack and reprisal. For example,
 in January Israeli forces in south Lebanon employed flechette artillery rounds in an
 exchange with the Islamic Resistance. Several rounds inadvertently struck a contin-
 gent of Nepalese soldiers assigned to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
 (UNIFIL), wounding three of them. In December three Norwegian soldiers assigned
 to UNIFIL were wounded, one seriously, by a similar Israeli artillery round. Three
 Lebanese children were killed on July 9 when their home was hit by fire from an
 Israeli tank. In retaliation the Islamic Resistance fired rockets at settlements in
 northern Israel. Rocket attacks on civilians in northern Israel again took place on
 November 28 when Hizballah forces launched more than 30 Katuysha rockets.
 Beginning in February, Israeli forces imposed a naval blockade along the southern
 Lebanese coast around Tyre, preventing fishermen from carrying on their activities.
 The blockade continued throughout 1995. In November the Israeli Navy captured
 fishermen off the coast of Tyre in south Lebanon and confiscated their boat. Three
 of the fishermen were taken to Naqura and released shortly thereafter;, two other
 fishermen were allegedly interrogated, beaten, and released 8 hours after their ab-
 duction.
 In August the Israeli air force raided two Popular Front for the Liberation of Pal-
 estine-General Command (PFLP-GC) bases, one in Sultan Ya'acoub in the western
 Biqa' Valley, and one in the area of Na'ameh, about 15 kilometers south of Beirut.
 On October 15, Hizballah guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol in southern Leb-
 anon, killing six soldiers and wounding one.
 In June fighting broke out in the Ain A1-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in
 southern Lebanon between rival Palestinian factions. Six persons died and 30 were
 wounded during the approximately 48 hours of fighting.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government generally respects the con-
 stitutional right to freedom of the press. However, it partially limits this freedom,
 or intimidates journalists into practicing self-censorship.
 Lebanon has a long history of freedom of opinion, speech, and the press. Although
 there were repeated attempts to muzzle these freedoms during the year, daily, vocl
 criticism of government policies and leaders continues. Dozens of newspapers and
 magazines are published throughout Lebanon, financed by various Lebanese and
 foreign groups. While the press is normally independent, press content often reflects
 the opinions of these financial backers.
 The Government has several legal tools at it" disposal to control the freedom of
 expression. The Surete Generale is authorized to approve all foreign magazines and
 nonperiodical works including plays, books, and films before they are distributed in
 the market. The law prohibits attacks on the dignity of the head of state or foreign
 leaders. The Government may prosecute offending journalists and publications n
 the Publications Court, a special court empowered to try such matters.
 Moreover, the 1991 security agreement between Lebanon and Syria contains a
 Ursion that effectively prohibits the publication of any information deemed harm-
 fulto the security of either state. Under the risk of prosecution, Lebanese journal-
 ists censor themselves on matters related to Syria.
 During the year, army intelligence officers reportedly discouraged journalists from
 writing favorably about former Lebanese Forces militia commander Samir JaJa' who
 
 
 1218
 was tried for the 1990 murders of political leader Dany Chamoun and his family,
 the 1994 AI-Zuq church bombing, and the 1990 assassination of former Kata'ib
 Party member Dr. Ilyas AI-Zayek (see Section i.e.). Several journalists were sum-
 moned to the army intelligence headquarters where they were questioned for sev-
 eral hours before being released.
 On March 25, student Joseph Noujaym was abducted from his house by security
 officers because he allegedly  stributed leaflets asking for the withdrawal of all for-
 eign forces from Lebanon. No warrant was issued for his arrest. Noujaym was not
 charged with any wrongdoing and was released on March 28.
 In June the Minister of Information asked the owner of a television station to can-
 cel the scheduled broadcast of a program on the controversial themes of civil mar-
 riage and divorce after he received complaints from some religious dignitaries.
 o in June the Publication Court sentenced the owner of Al-Shira' magazine to
 1 month in prison for publishing material judged as insulting to the President. In
 the same month the court also sentenced the editor-in-chief of Ad-Diyar newspaper
 to 3 months in prison for having published an article on the alleged involvement
 of a parliamentarian in drug trafficking.
 Journalist Faris Abi Saab was arrested for covering a labor demonstration on July
 19. Later in the month, he and 78 of the demonstrators were tried and convicted
 for disturbing the peace. Although Saab's case attracted considerable international
 concern, local human rights officials say that the Government was within its rights
 in pursuing the case and noted the Government's swift disposition, as well as the
 court's leniency (see Section 6.a.).
 Lebanon has a strong tradition of academic freedom and a flourishing private edu-
 cational system born of inadequate public schools and a preference for sectarian af-
 filiation. Students exercise the right to form campus associations, and the Govern-
 ment does not usually interfere with student groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Any gup wishing to organize
 a rally must obtain the prior approval of the Interior Ministry, which does not
 render decisions uniformly. The Government banned all rallies in 1995. Nonethe-
 less, some political factions, such as the Shi'a Amal Movement, Hizballah, the Sunni
 Moslem group A-Habash, and supporters of the Prime Minister, held rallies without
 obtaining government permission.
 In at least two instances, the ISF moved to disperse crowds regarded as illegal
 demonstrations. In July security forces fired over the heads of demonstrators pro-
 testing a government decision to increase the price of gasline. Several persons, in-
 cludng some security officers, were injured as a result of aggressive crowd-control
 handln by security forces.
 In August the    F dispersed a gathering in the town of Zahle which assembled
 to welcome a local Member of Parliament, Elie Skaff, who had been recently mar-
 ried. Skaff is regarded as a political rival of the President of the Republic. The well-
 wishers later gathered at Skafi's home to present their congratulations.
 In l~eneral, the Government does not interfere with the establishment of private
 organizations. However, citizens require government approval to establish political
 parties. The army intelligence service monitors the movement and activities of mem-
 bers of opposition groups.
 The Ministry of Interior, which is empowered to grant permits, scrutinizes re-
 quests to establish political movements or parties and to some extent monitors their
 activities.
 Neither Israel nor Syria allow groups openly hostile to them to operate in areas
 under their control.
 c. Freedom ofReligion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foregn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 eraly respects them in practice. However, there are some limitations. Travel to Is-
 rael is prohibited by law but many do so through Israeli-contrlled territory in
 southern Lebanon. All males of between 18 and 21 years of age are subject to com-
 pulsory military service and are required to register at a recruitment office and ob-
 tain a travel authorization document before leaving the country. Husbands may
 block foreign travel by their wives and minor children
 Lebanese armed forces and Syrian troops maintain checkpoints in areas under
 their control. In south Lebanon, the Lebanese Army, the Israeli Ary, and the SLA
 all maintain tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out
 of the so-calledvsecurity zone."
 There are no legal restrictions on the right of all citizens to return. Many emigres,
 however, are reluctant to return for a variety of political, economic, and social rea-
 sons. After years of internal conflict, the recent spread of government authority has
 
 
 1219
 removed barriers that previously hindered domestic travel. The Government has en-
 couraged the return to their homes of over 600,000 persons displaced during the
 civil war. Although some people have begun to reclaim their homes abandoned dur-
 ing the war, the vast majority of displaced persons have not attempted to reclaim
 their property. The resettlement process is slowed by tight budgetary constraints,
 destroyed infrastructure, the lack of schools and economic opportunities, and the
 fear that physical security is still lacking in some parts of the country.
 Most non-Lebanese refugees are Palestinians. The Government has estimated
 their number at 361,000, but this figure includes only the families of refugees who
 arrived in 1948. Other estimates of the actual number of Palestinians now in Leb-
 anon range from 450,000 to 500,000.
 The Government refused to admit two Palestinians deported by Israel in April.
 The two were still lodged at the UNIFIL headquarters in Naqura at year's end. The
 Government issues laissez-passers (travel documents) to Palestinian refugees to en-
 able them to travel and work abroad. However, after the Government of Libya an-
 nounced in September its intention to expel Palestinians working in that country,
 the Lebanese Government moved to prohibit the return of Palestinians living abroad
 unless they obtain an entry visa. The Government maintained that the visa require-
 ment is necessary to ensure the validity of Lebanese laissez-passers, as a large num-
 ber of those documents were forged during the years of strife.
 The Government seeks to prevent the entry of asylum seekers and undocumented
 refugees. There have been no known asylum requests since 1975.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution states that citizens have the right to change their government
 in periodic free and fair elections. However, the last parliamentary election, held in
 1992, was not prepared or carried out impartially. The majority of Christians and
 many Muslims boycotted that election as candidates and voters to protest the hold-
 ing of an election before the redeployment of Syrian forces.
 According to the Constitution, elections for the parliament must be held every 4
 years. The parliament, in turn, elects the president every 6 years. The president and
 parliament nominate the prime minister, who with the president chooses the cabi-
 net. According to the unwritten "National Pact" of 1943, the president is a Maronite
 Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament a
 Shi'a Muslim. Until 1990, sats in parliament were divided on a six-to-five ratio of
 Christians to Muslims. Positions in the Government were allocated on a similar
 basis between Christians and Muslims.
 Under the national reconciliation agreement reached in Tail Saudi Arabia, in
 1989, members of parliament agreed to alter the National Pact to create a 50-50
 balance between uhristian and Muslim members of parliament. The Taif Accord
 also increased the number of seats in parliament and transferred some powers from
 the president to the prime minister and cabinet.
 By Constitution the president is not allowed to succeed himself. Nonetheless, in
 October parliament passed a constitutional amendment by a vote of 110 to 11 which
 extendedthe term of President Elias Hrawi for an additional 3 years. The amend-
 ment was earlier proposed by the president himself and approved by the cabinet,
 despite the existence of strong public sentiment against the move. Supporters of the
 extension maintained that Lebanon should not change its political leadership during
 the peace negotiations with Israel. However, the critics claimed that President
 Hrawi's extension was assured because many of Lebanon's political leaders show
 deference to the influence of Syria on matters related to national security and the
 peace process. The critics also claimed that the amendment was an extraordinary
 move tailored for only one individual, thus undermining the rule of law and casting
 further doubt on the right to citizens to change their government.
 Moreover, the right of citizns to change their government was undermined by a
 decision taken by Parliament in May to extend the term in office of the country's
 municipal officials to December 31, 1996. That action postponed local elections that
 would have otherwise been required by June. Municipal elections have not been
 held since 1963.
 In July Nasri Maloof won a seat in Parliament in an election occasioned by the
 death of the incumbent. An estimated 3.9 percent of the eligible voters in Maloof's
 district cast their ballots. Government critics point to this low voter turnout as evi-
 dence of the public's disaffection with the country's political institutions.
 Women have the right to vote, and there are no legal barriers to their participa-
 tion in politics. Three women were elected to Parliament in 1992. Other women hold
 policy-level positions in the Government.

 Palestinian -efugees have no political rights. An estimated 17 Palestinian factions
 operate in Lebanon, generally organized around prominent individuals. Most Pal-
 estinians live in refugee camps controlled by one or more factions. The leaders of
 the refugees are not elected, nor are there any democratically organized institutions
 in the camps.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights groups operate freely without government restriction, in-
 cluding the Lebanese Association for Human Rights, the Foundation for Humani-
 tarian and Human Rights-Lebanon, and the National Association for the Rights of
 the Disabled. Some of these groups have sought to publicize the detention in Syria
 of dozens of Lebanese citizens. The Government has made no public comments on
 .the issue.
 In January, for the first time since the Al-Khiyam detention center was opened
 in 1985 in the Israeli-occupied "security zone", the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) was allowed to organize family visits to the detainees held there
 (also see Section 1.d.).
 q8ection 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution calls for "social justice and equality of duties and rights among
 all citizens without prejudice or favoritism." In practice, aspects of the law and tra-
 ditional mores discriminate against women.
 Women.-The press reports cases of rape with increasing frequency; what is re-
 ported appears to be only a fraction of the actual level of abuse. In general, battered
 or abused women do not talk about their sufferings for fear of bringing shame upon
 their own families or accusations of misbehavior upon themselves. There are no au-
 thoritative statistics on the extent of spousal abuse. Doctors and social workers be-
 lieve that most abused women do not seek medical help. The Government does not
 provide medical assistance to battered women or victims; it provides legal assistance
 to victims who cannot pay regardless of the gender of the victim. Since 1991 the
 Government has begun to increase sentences on violent crimes in general and to
 seek punishment for males who commit "crimes of honor" (see Section i.e.). The
 Lebanese Association for Combatting Violence Against Women, founded in 1994, has
 been active in lobbying to improve the socio-economic condition of women and to re-
 duce violence against women.
 Women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law, academia,
 the arts, and, to a lesser degree, in business. However, social pressure against
 women pursuing careers is strong in some parts of Lebanese society. Males some-
 times exercise considerable control over female relatives, restricting their activities
 outside the home or their contact with friends and relatives. Women may own prop-
 erty but often cede effective control over it for cultural reasons. In 1994 the Par-
 liament amended a law removing a stipulation that a woman must obtain her hus-
 band's approval to open a business or engage in a trade.
 Only males may confer citizenship on their spouses and children. This means that
 children born to Lebanese mothers and foreign fathers may not become citizens. In
 late 1995, the Parliament approved a law allowing Lebanese widows to confer citi-
 zenship on their minor children.
 Religious groups have their own family and personal status laws administered by
 religious courts. Each group differs in its treatment of marriage, family property
 rights, and inheritance. Many of these laws discriminate against women. For exam-
 ple, Sunni inheritance law gives a son twice the share of a daughter. Although Mus-
 lim men may divorce easily, Muslim women may do so only with the concurrence
 of their husbands.
 Children.-The plight of children is a growing concern, but the Government has
 not allocated funds to protect them. Education is not compulsory, and many children
 take jobs at a young age to support their families. In lower income families, boys
 generally get more education while girls usually remain at home to do housework.
 An undetermined number of children are neglected, abused, exploited, and even
 sold to adoption agents. There are hundreds of abandoned children in the streets,
 some of whom survive by beggg, others by working at low wages. Juvenile delin-
 quency is on the rise; many delinquents wait in ordinary prisons for trial and re-
 main there after sentencing. Limited financial resources have hindered efforts to
 build adequate facilities to rehabilitate delinquents. There are neither child welfare
 programs nor government institutions to oversee the implementation of children's
 programs. A committee for children's rights, formed 2 years ago by prominent public
 
 
 1221
 and private citizens, has been lobbying for legislation to improve the condition *of
 children.
 People With Disabilities.-Over 100,000 people sustained disabilities during the
 civil war. Care of the disabled is generally a function performed by families. Most
 efforts to secure education, independence, health, and shelter for the disabled are
 made by some 100 private organizations for the disabled. In general, these organiza-
 tions are poorly funded.
 Lebanon's heavily damaged cities make no accommodation for the disabled. Build-
 ing codes have no requirements for ease of access.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government. The amended Constitution of 1990 embraces the principles of abolish-
 ing religious affiliation as a criterion for filling all government positions, but no
 steps have been taken to accomplish this.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to the United Nations, an esti-
 mated 250,000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon. Most Palestinian refugees live
 in overpopulated camps that have suffered repeated destruction as a result of fight-
 ing. The Government has instructed relief workers to suspend reconstruction work
 in the camps, and refugees fear that in the future the Government will reduce the
 size of the camps or remove them completely.
 The Government ended its practice of denying work permits to Palestinians in
 1991. Nonetheless, Palestinians still encounter job discrimination. They and other
 aliens may own land of a limited size but only after obtaining the approval of 5 dif-
 ferent district offices. The law applies to all aliens, but for political, cultural, and
 economic reasons it is a pplied in a manner disadvantageous to Palestinians and, to
 a lesser extent, Kurds. The Government does not provide health services to Palestin-
 ian refugees, who must rely on private means.
 In recent years, Palestinian incomes have declined as the Palestinian Liberation
 Organization closed many of its offices in Lebanon, which formerly employed as
 much as 50 percent of the Palestinian work force. Palestinian children have report-
 edly been forced to leave school at an early age because U.N. relief workers do not
 have sufficient funds for education programs. The U.N. estimates that 18 percent
 of Lebanese street children are Palestinian. Drug addiction and crime are increasing
 in the camps, as is prostitution.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except government employees, may es-
 tablish and join unions and have a legal right to strike. Worker representatives
 must be chosen from those employed within the bargaining unit. About 900,000 per-
 sons form the active labor force, 42 percent of whom are members of Lebanon's 160
 labor unions and associations. Twenty-two of the unions, with about 200,000 work-
 ers, are represented in the General Confederation of Workers (CGTL).
 In general, the Government does not control or restrict unions, although union
 leaders allege that the Government has tried to intervene in elections for union offi-
 cials.
 Palestinian refugees may organize their own unions, but restrictions on their
 right to work make this right more theoretical than real. Few Palestinians partici-
 pate actively in trade unions.
 Public school teachers, the staff at Lebanese University, Trans-Mediterranean
 Airways employees, Beirut port workers, and municipal contract workers (prin-
 cipafly garbage collectors) staged strikes in several cities in 1995.
 in June the Government approved a nationwide wage increase, but sought to fi-
 nance it by additional taxes on gasoline and other commodities. The CGTL called
 for a general strike and demonstrations on July 19 to protest the gasoline tax hike.
 Reportedly, the Government arrested about 130 persons and later charged 78 of
 them for creating a public disturbance, conducting a demonstration without a per-
 mit, and carrying guns. Thirty-nine persons were acquitted and 29 were sentenced
 to prisons sentences of either 1 or 3 months, which were later reduced to fines of
 $60 and $120 respectively.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international federations and confederations, and
 they maintain a variety of such affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and to bargain exists in law and practice. Most workers' gups engage in some
 form of collective bargaining with their employers. Stronger federations obtain sig-
 nificant gains for their members, and on occasion have assisted nonunionized work-
 ers. There is no government mechanism to promote voluntary labor-management
 negotiations, and workers have no protection against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although forced labor is not pro-
 hibited by law, it is neither practiced nor condoned by the Government. However
 children, foreign domestic servants, or other foreign workers are sometimes forced
 to remain in situations amounting to coerced or bonded labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The 1946 Labor Code stipulates
 that workers between the ages of 8 and 16 may not work more than 7 hours a day,
 with 1 hour of rest provided after 4 hours. They are also prohibited from working
 between the hours of 7 p.m. and 6 am. There is a general prohibition against 'jobs
 out of proportion with a worker's age." The Code also prohibits certain types of me-
 chanical work for children ages 8 to 13, and other types for those ages 13 to 16.
 The Labor Ministry is tasked with enforcing these requirements, but the civil war
 left it with few resources and a demoralized and sometimes corrupt staff. The Min-
 istry does not rigorously apply the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Ministry sets a legal monthly mini-
 mum wage, which was raised in June to about $156 (250,000 pounds). The law is
 not enforced effectively in the private sector. In theory the courts could be called
 upon to enforce it, but in practice they are not. Trade unions actively try to ensure
 the payment of minimum wages in both the public sector and the large-scale private
 sector, such as education and transport.
 The labor law prescribes a standard 6-day workweek of 48 hours, with a 24-hour
 rest period per week. In practice, workers in the industrial sector work an average
 of 35 hours a week, and workers in other sectors work an average of 30 hours a
 week. The law includes specific occupational health and safety regulations. Labor
 regulations call on employers to take adequate precautions for employee safety. En-
 forcement, the responsibyity of the Labor Ministry, is uneven. Labor organizers re-
 port that workers do not have the right to remove themselves from hazardous condi-
 tions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
