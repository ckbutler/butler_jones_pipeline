 ~GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and multiparty parliamentary democracy in
 which citizens choose their representatives, in free and fair elections. The Pan-
 hellenic Socialist Movement (pasok) holds a majority of parliamentary seats, and its
 leader, Constantine Simitis, has been Prime Minister since 199 . The New Democ-
 racy Party is the main opposition party. The judiciary is independent.
 The national police and security services are responsible for internal security. Ci-
 vilian authorities maintain effective control of all security forces, and police and se-
 curity services are subject to a broad variety of restraints. Some members of the po-
 lice and security forces nevertheless committed human rights abuses.
 Greece has a, market economy with a large public sector that accounts for some
 40 percent of gross domestic product. Residents enjoy a relatively advanced stand-
 ard of living. Greece is a large net recipient of funds from the European Union, de-
 signed primarily to raise per capita gross domestic product.
 The Government respected the human rights of most citizens; however, problems
 remained in some areas, although there was notable progress in others. Security
 force personnel sometimes abused suspects and illegal aliens. The Government con-
 tinued to take corrective action to relieve severe overcrowding and harsh living con-
 ditions in some prisons. Despite religious leaders' acknowledgment of a general im-
 provement in government tolerance,some restrictions on freedom of religion per-
 sisted; police continued to arrest members of non-Orthodox religions for proselytiz-
 ing. However, the Government created a program of alternative military service for
 conscientious objectors. It sometimes placed human rights monitors, non-Orthodox
 religious groups, and minority groups under surveillance. In a significant step, the
 Government formally- abolished Article 19 of the Citizenship Code, which had been
 
 
 1285
 
 used to revoke the citizenship of Greeks who are not ethnically Greek. Although the
 Government has used Article 20 of the Citizenship Code to revoke the citizenship
 of some Greek citizens abroad who asserted a "Macedonian" ethnicity, no such cases
 were reported during the year. Discrimination against ethnic minorities continued
 to be a problem. The Government formally recognizes only the Muslim minority
 specified in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne; it refuses to acknowledge formally the ex-
 istence of any other ethnic groups, principally Slavophones, under the term "minor-
 ity." As a result, some individuals who define themselves as members of a minority
 find it difficult to express their identity freely and to maintain their culture.
 In September a government Ombudsman's office was opened. In December a Na-
 tional Committee for Human Rights was commissioned formally.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 A Romani man was killed in Partheni in April when he refused to stop his car
 for inspection. Police claimed that they exchanged gunfire with the subject in self-
 defense. A trial of the policemen involved was pending at year's end.
 In September a botched hostage rescue operation in Athens resulted in the death
 of the hostage victim. The hostage-taker subsequently died in a hospital under sus-
 picious circumstances. The chief of police who was in charge of the operation re-
 signed in December. In December a public prosecutor charged seven doctors with
 manslaughter based on the medical treatment that the prisoner received.
 In November a policeman shot a foreign student accused of purse snatching at
 point blank range. The policeman was charged with first degree murder. A trial
 date had not yet been set by year's end.
 In 1996 a Romani man was shot and killed by a police officer while lying face
 down on the pavement at a police roadblock in Livadia. The officer was charged
 with involuntary manslaughter, but there was no resolution of the case by year's
 end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and a 1984 law makes the use of tor-
 ture an offense punishable by a sentence of 3 years' to life imprisonment. This law
 has never been invoked. However, security force personnel sometimes abused sus-
 pects during arrests and interrogations and abused illegal aliens. Police also abused
 Roma (see Section 5).
 In July two Albanian teenagers arrested for theft accused police officials of beat-
 ing them while in custody. One revealed burns in addition to bruises. Albanian dip-
 lomats reported the condition of the teenagers to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 In August an investigation by the Ministry of Public Order found the police innocent
 of any abuse.
 In May two Romani teenagers claimed that they were beaten while in police cus-
 tody for attempting to steal ice cream from a kiosk. A trial was pending at year's
 end.
 In the 1996 case of five policemen who beat a man in Iraklion, four of the officers
 were suspended from duty for 15 days. Charges filed by the individual were still
 pending trial at year's end. The court dismissed the charges in a 1996 incident in
 Thessaloniki in which police were accused of beating a man charged with robbery.
 Conditions in some prisons remained poor due to substantial overcrowding and
 outdated facilities. As of September 17, the Ministry of Justice reported that the
 total prison population was 7,129 (of whom approximately 3,221 were foreigners),
 while total capacity of the prison system was 4,332.
 Throughout the summer, detainees at the Drapetsona police detention center
 staged hunger strikes to protest conditions described by a human rights organiza-
 tion as "lack of adequate exercise, lack of natural daylight, insufficient toilet and
 bath facilities, severely limited access to medical treatment and no access to social
 services." The detainees are all non-European Union citizens awaiting deportation.
 In September the Minister of Justice dismissed the prison inspector for "insuffi-
 cient performance" of his duties.
 The Ministry of Justice contracted for renovation of existing prisons, solicited bids
 for construction of 9 new prisons, and announced the hiring of 1,300 prison guards
 (to replace police who currently guard prisons). Construction is proceeding on a new
 center for the rehabilitation of narcotics addicts; it is scheduled to open in early
 1999. The center is designed to house 350 inmates and is to cooperate with the orga-
 
 
 1286
 
 nization for combating narcotics (Okana) to provide detoxification and rehabilitation
 programs for inmates.
 The Government'is inconsistent in permitting prison visits by nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires judicial war-
 rants for all arrests, except during the actual commission of a crime, and the law
 prohibits arbitrary arrest orders. Police must, by law, bring persons who are ar-
 rested on the basis of a warrant or while committing a crime before an examining
 magistrate within 24 hours. The magistrate must issue a detention warrant or order
 the release of the detainee within 3 days, unless special circumstances require a 2-
 day extension of this time limit.
 Defendants brought to court before the end of the day following the commission
 of a charged offense may be tried immediately, under a "speedy procedure." Al-
 though legal safeguards, including representation by counsel, apply in speedy proce-
 dure cases, the short period of time may inhibit the defendant s ability to present
 an adequate defense. Defendants may ask for a delay to provide time to prepare
 their defense, but the court is not obliged to grant it. The speedy procedure was
 used in less than 10 percent of misdemeanor cases. It does not apply to felonies.
 The effective maximum duration of pretrial detention is 18 months for felonies
 and 9 months for misdemeanors. Defense lawyers complain that pretrial detention
 is overly long and overused by judges. A panel of judges may grant release pending
 trial, with or without bal. Pretrial detainees made up 28.5 percent of those incar-
 ceratd, contributing to overcrowding problems, according to Government sources. A
 person convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to 2 years or less may, at the
 court's discretion, pay a fine instead of being imprisoned.
 Exile is unconstitutional, and no cases have been reported since the restoration
 of democracy in 1974. In a significant step, the Government repealed Article 19 of
 the Citizenship Code in June (with effect retroactively to January when the Govern-
 ment introduced the legislation). This article had permitted the Government to de-
 prive Greek citizens of non-Greek ethnic origin who traveled outside Greece of their
 citizenship and refuse them readmittance. Human rights groups sought to make the
 repeal even more retroactive and have encouraged the Government to facilitate indi-
 viduals' application to reacquire citizenship. Human rights monitors estimate that
 there are between 400 and 1,200 individuals who lost citizenship under Article 19
 and who continue to reside in Greece. Members of the Muslim community noted
 that a number of these persons have succeeded in reacquiring citizenship (also see
 Section 2.d.).
 Article 20 of the Citizenship Code, which permits the Government to strip citizen-
 ship from those who "commit acts contrary to the interests of Greece for the benefit
 of a foreign state," remained in force. The Government did not provide statistics on
 citizens affected by this article in 1998, but no cases were reported publicly during
 the year. In the past those affected were citizens abroad who asserted a "Macedo-
 nian" ethnicity (also see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of the judiciary; it is independent in practice.
 The judicial system includes three levels of courts, appointed judges, an examin-
 ing magistrate system, and trial by judicial panels.
 The Constitution provides for public trials, and trial court sessions are open to
 the public, unless the court decides that privacy is required to protect victims and
 witnesses, or the cases involve national security matters. Defendants enjoy a pre-
 sumption of innocence, the standard of proof of guilt beyond a roasonable doubt, the
 right to present evidence and call witnesses, the right of access to the prosecution's
 evidence, the right to cross-examine witnesses, and the right-to counsel. Lawyers
 are provided to defendants who are not able to afford legal counsel only in felony
 cases. Both the prosecution and the defense have the right of appeal.
 Defendants who do not speak Greek have the right to a court-appointed inter-
 preter. The low fees paid for such work often result in poor translation. Foreign de-
 fendants who depend on these interpreters frequently complain that they do not un-
 derstand their trials.
 The legal system' does not discriminate against women or minorities, with some
 exceptions: the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs may base its decision on
 "house of prayer" permit applications by non-Orthodox groups on the opinion of the
 local Orthodox bishop (see Section 2.c.); non-ethnic Greek citizens are prohibited le-
 gally from settling in a large "supervised zone' near the frontier (although this pro-
 hibition is not enforced in practice); and a 1939 law (also not enforced in practice)
 prohibits the functioning of private schools in buildings owned by non-Orthodox reli-
 gious foundations.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 1287
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits invasion of privacy and searches without warrants, and the
 law permits the monitoring of personal communications only under strict judicial
 controls. The efficacy of these safeguards remains an open question. The security
 services continued to monitor human rights groups (see Section 4), non-Orthodox re-
 ligious groups, minority group representatives, and foreign diplomats who met with
 such individuals. On several occasions the press published information about such
 private meetings. Human rights activists reported suspicious openings and diver-
 sions of mail. As far as is known, the Government took no steps to stop such prac-
 tices or to prosecute those involved.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice, but
 with exceptions. Legal restrictions on free speech remain in force and were used in
 some cases by the Government.
 Articles of the Penal Code that can be used to restrict free speech and the press
 include Article 141, which forbids exposing the friendly relations of the Greek state
 with foreign states to danger of disturbance; Article 191, which prohibits spreading
 false information and rumors liable to create concern and fear among citizens and
 cause disturbances in the country's international relations and inciting citizens to
 rivalry and division, leading to disturbance of the peace; and Article 192, which pro-
 hibits inciting citizens to acts of violence or to disturbing the peace through dishar-
 mony among them. Those convicted in the past were allowed to convert their convic-
 tions into a fine of approximately $14 per day.
 In September two journalists in separate cases were convicted and received 4-
 month and 8-month suspended sentences respectively on defamation charges for
 criticizing government ministers. Both cases are under appeal. In October two jour-
 nalists charged in a 1997 case with espionage for publishing confidential govern-
 ment documents were acquitted.
 The public prosecutor in Florina invoked these laws on several occasions in recent
 years, although not in 1998, in attempts to limit the Rainbow Party's use of Slavic
 names for Greek towns. In September a court declared innocent four officials of the
 Rainbow Party charged in 1995 with violating Article 192 when a bilingual sign
 hung outside party headquarters in Florina sparked a riot. The four stated that they
 intended only to inform the bilingual public of the existence of the office. A Rainbow
 Party official charged in 1996 under Article 191 for attempting to bring wall cal-
 endars into the country that identified Greek cities by their Slavic names was ac-
 quitted in November.
 On matters other than the question of ethnic minorities, Greece generally enjoys
 a tradition of outspoken public discourse and a vigorous free press. Satirical and op-
 position newspapers routinely attack the highest state authorities. Members of eth-
 nic, religious, and linguistic minorities freely publish periodicals and other publica-
 tions, often in their native language. The Constitution allows for seizure (though not
 prior restraint), by order of the public prosecutor, of publications that insult the
 President, offend religious beliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate violent over-
 throw of the political system, or disclose military and defense information. However,
 seizures have been rare; none occurred in 1998.
 A dictionary of modern Greek published in May generated several lawsuits from
 individuals who found certain definitions offensive. In July a trial court in
 Thessaloniki ordered removal of one definition from future editions of the dictionary
 and threatened the author with a fine and imprisonment if he did not comply. The
 Supreme Court prosecutor suspended the decision pending review of the case by the
 Court later in the year. In February the Supreme Court upheld a 1997 appellate
 court ruling that sentenced Muslim journalist Abdulhalim Dede to a 6-month sus-
 pended sentence and 3 years' probation for libel. Dede originally was charged in
 1996 under Article 191 (on which he was acquitted) and libel laws for an article he
 wrote about extremist groups in Thrace.
 The Constitution provides that the state exercise "immediate control" over radio
 and television. The state monopoly on radio and televisiop ended in 1989, and a
 plethora of private stations quickly emerged. A 1995 law places ownership and tech-
 nical frequency limits on the electronic media. The licensing of radio stations began
 in late 1996, and the licensing of television stations began in 1997. State-run sta-
 tions tended to emphasize the Government's views but also reported objectively on
 other parties' programs and positions. Private radio and television stations operated
 independently of any government control over their reporting. Turkish-language tel-
 evision programs are widely available via satellite in Thrace.
 
 
 1288
 Resolution of the television station Antenna's appeal of a $350,000 (100 million
 drachmas) fine imposed in 1997 by the National Radio and Television Council
 (NRTC) remained pending at years end. The NRTC fined the television station and
 ordered it to suspend normal programming for 10 minutes daily for 5 days after an
 episode of the Antenna "reality show" allegedly caused a man accused of incest to
 commit suicide before its broadcast. The Ministry of Press and- Mass Media ap-
 proved the Council's decision.  :
 The case of Radio Isik, a Turkish-language station in Komotini, charged with op-
 erating without a license in 1994 and 1995, is still pending.
 In September Abdulhalim Dede, the Muslim owner of Radio Isik, was, sentenced
 to 8 months' imprisonment for illegal construction when he erected a base for a new
 radio antenna intended to extend the range of the station. The sentence was sus-
 pended pending appeal. Dede charged that the Government arrested him in order
 to block expansion of the station's range, noting that the law under which he was
 convicted is violated widely and rarely, if ever, enforced.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. Police per-
 mits were issued routinely for public demonstrations, and there were no reports that
 the permit requirement was abused.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, which was respected except
 in cases involving ethnic minorities. In July the European Court of Human Rights
 held unanimously that Greek courts had violated Article 11 of the European Con-
 vention on Human Rights by refusing to register the "Home of Macedonian Civiliza-
 tion" (as translated by the court) in Florina in 1990. The court rejected the Govern-
 ment's argument that registration of the organization represented a danger to
 Greece's territorial integrity and ordered the Government to pay monetary damages
 to the organization's founders.
 Government authorities legally recognize the existence of the Muslim minority but
 not other minorities (see Section 5). The 1990 Copenhagen document of the then-
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to which the Government is a
 signatory asserts, however, that "to belong to a national minority is a matter of a
 person's individual choice."
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes the Eastern Orthodox
 Church of Christ, to which 95 to 97 percent of the population at least nominally ad-
 here, as the prevailing religion, and the Orthodox Church wields significant political
 and economic influence. The Constitution also provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, non-Orthodox groups face administrative obstacles or legal restrictions on reli-
 gious practice. The Constitution also prohibits proselytism. Two laws from the
 1930's require that to hold services, "known" religious groups must obtain a "house
 of prayer" permit from the Ministry of Education and Religion, which by law may
 base its decision on the opinion of the 1-ml Orthodox bishop. No formal mechanism
 exists to seek recognition as a known religion. Ministry of Education and Religious
 Affairs officials say that they no longer obtain the opinion of the local Orthodox
 bishop when considering "house of prayer" permit applications. According to min-
 istry officials, all pending applications have been issued. Leaders of minority reli-
 gions noted a general improvement in government tolerance during the year, citing
 fewer arrests for proselytizing and-the new conscientious objector law. .
 In February an appeals court upheld the 1994 conviction for usurpation of reli-
 gious authority, of a former Greek Orthodox cleric. The individual was defrocked in
 1993 after asserting that he was a priest in a church not recognized as a "known"
 religion. The 1-year sentence was suspended pending appeal. He since sought per-
 mission to operate a place of worship, but the Government asserts that he did not
 file a valid-application.
 Several religious denominations reported difficulties in dealing with the authori-
 ties on a variety of administrative matters.- Privileges and legal prerogatives grant-
 ed to the Greek Orthodox Church are not extended routinely to other recognized re-
 ligions. The non-Greek Orthodox churches must make separate and lengthy applica-
 tions to government authorities on such matters as arranging appointments to meet
 with Ministry of Education and Religion officials and gaining permission to move
 places of worship to larger facilities.
 A tax bill passed in 1997 created three new taxes on churches and other nonprofit
 organizations. Leaders of some non-Orthodox religious groups claimed that all taxes
 on religious organizations were discriminatory, even those that the Orthodox
 Church has to pay, since the Government subsidizes the Orthodox Church while
 other groups are self-supporting. -
 
 
 1289
 Religious instruction in public primary and secondary schools is mandatory for
 Greek Orthodox students. Non-Orthodox students are exempt from this require-
 ment.
 Police occasionally detained Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses after receiving
 complaints that the individuals were engaged in proselytism. In most cases, the in-
 dividuals were held for several hours at a police station and then released with no
 charges filed. Many reported that they were not allowed to call their lawyers and
 that they were verbally abused by police officers for their religious beliefs. In Feb-
 ruary the European Court of Human Rights found Greece in violation of the Euro-
 pean Convention on Human Rights for convicting-Protestants of proselytism in past
 cases. There were no prosyletism-related court cases during the year.
 The trial of 15 members of the boards of Scientologist associations charged by the
 Government with "unprovoked factual insult" is scheduled for February 1999. The
 board members were charged in October 1996 following a police search of Scien-
 tology headquarters that revealed a file of press clippings on Greek opposition to
 Scientology.
 Early in the year, four teachers were reinstated (three to their original positions
 and one to an administrative position) after a 1997 investigation by the Ministry
 of Education and Religion found that they had not proselytized their students. The
 teachers are members of the Church of Christians, a nondenominational Protestant
 church.
 Although Jehovah's Witnesses are recognized as a "known" religion, in previous
 years the military consistently refused to exempt their clergy from mandatory mili-
 tary service. This practice was found to be in violation of Articles 5 and 6 of the
 European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights
 in two decisions reached in 1997. In January a law providing an alternative form
 of mandatory national service for conscientious objectors took effect. It provides that
 conscientious objectors may work in state hospitals or municipal services for 36
 months. Conscientious objector groups generally characterized the legislation as a
 "positive first step" but criticized the 36-month alternative service term, which is
 double the regular 18-month period of military service. Since January all Jehovah's
 Witnesses, both clergy and laymen, who wished to submit applications for alter-
 native nonmilitary service were permitted to do so. In one case, an application was
 submitted late and the applicant was instructed to appear for mandatory military
 service. The applicant appealed this decision; the results of the appeal are pending.
 Mosques operate freely in Western Thrace and on the islands of Rhodes and Kos,
 where most citizens of the Muslim faith reside. Local officials delayed expansion of
 a mosque in Kimmeria, near Xanthi for over a year, at one point prosecuting 17
 Muslim workman for ignoring a stop-work order. Under public pressure, officials re-
 lented in late 1997 and construction of the mosque was completed. Its minaret re-
 mained unfinished even after the building permit was approved, reportedly in re-
 sponse to objections from local Orthodox officials.
 Differences remain within the Muslim community and between segments of the
 community and the government over the means of selection of muftis (Islamic
 judges and religious leaders with limited civil responsibilities). Under a 1990 presi-
 dential decree, the government appointed two muftis and one assistant muffi in
 Greece, all resident in Thrace. The appointments (made in 1991) were based on the
 recommendations of a committee of Muslim notables selected by the government.
 The government argued that it must appoint the muftis because, in addition to their
 religious duties, they perform judicial functions in many civil and domestic matters
 under Muslim religious law, for which the state pays them.
 Some Muslims accept the authority of the two officially appointed muftis; other
 Muslims, backed by Turkey, have "elected" two different muftis to serve their com-
 munities (though there is no established procedure or practice for "election"). Three
 times in 1998 the Government convicted Mehmet Emin Aga, one of the "elected"
 muftis, of usurping the authority of the official mufti. Earlier convictions (eight over
 3 years) against Aga were upheld on appeal on-four occasions. All of the respective
 sentences remain suspended pending appeal. The other "elected" mufti, who was
 convicted in 1991 of usurping the authority of the official mufti, has appealed to the
 European Court of Human Rights, where his case is pending.
 Controversy between the Muslim community and the Government also continues
 over the management and self-government of the "wakfs" (Muslim charitable organi-
 zations) regarding the appointment of officials as well as the degree and type of ad-
 ministrative control. A 1980 law placed the administration of the wakfs in the
 hands of the appointed muftis and their representatives. In response to objections
 from some Muslims that this arrangement weakens the financial autonomy of the
 wakfs and violates the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne, a 1996 presidential decree
 
 
 1290
 put the wakfs under the adhiinistration -of a committee for 3 years as an interim
 measure pending resolution of outstanding problems.
 Muslim activists complained that the Government regularly lodges tax liens
 against the wakfs, although they are in theory tax-free religious foundations. Recent
 legislation to create a national land and property registry requires the wakfs also
 to register all of their property with the government- The legislation permits the
 government to seize any property that owners are not able .to document. To date
 the government has not sought to enforce either the tax liens or the registration
 requirement.
 Some non-Greek Orthodox religious leaders assert that their followers face dis-
 crimination in reaching the senior ranks of government service. In the military, gen-
 erally only members of the Greek Orthodox faith become officers, leading some
 members of other faiths to declare themselves Orthodox. Only two Muslim officers
 have advanced to the rank of reserve officer.
 The Government took no action to implement or repeal a 1991 law mandating
 that citizens declare their religion on new standardized identity cards based on Eu-
 ropean Union (EU) standards, which could be used for internal EU travel. Current
 identity cards contain a space for religion that may be left blank. _
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution calls fo freedomn of movement within and outside the
 country and the right to return. However, Muslim leaders asserted that Muslims
 face administrative obstacles regarding their voter registration -when seeking to
 change their legal residence within or to the region of Thrace.         g t
 In a significant stp, the Government formally abolished Article 19 of the Citizen-
 ship Code, which had b'een repealed in June 1997. Article 19 was used to revoke
 the citizenship of Greeks who are not ethnically Greek (also see Section 1.d.).
 However, another section of the Citizenship Code, Article 20, permits the govern-
 iment to strip citizenship from those who "commit acts contrary to the interests of
 Greece for the benefit of a foreign state." While the law as written applies equally
 to all Greeks regardless of ethnic backgund, to date it has been enforced in all
 but one case against citizens who identified themselves as members of the "Macedo-
 nian" minority. The Government would not reveal the niimber of Article 20 cases
 that it pursued- in 1998, although'there were no reports of such cases. Dual citizens
 who are stripped of Greek citizenship under Article 20 sometimes are prevented
 from entering the country using the passport of their second nationality.
 The Government maintains restricted military zones along the country's borders.
 Authorities do not restrict Greek citizens from entering these zones, but in 1998 sev-
 eral foreigners were refused official permission to-enter a restricted zone.
 The Government offers asylum under the terms of the 1951 United Nations (U.N.)
 Convention Relating. to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. It cooperates
 with the local office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Implementation
 of 1996 legislation that abolished the requirement that asylum seekers submit their
 applications immediately after entering the country still is pending approval by the
 President.
 Individuals recognized as refugees under the terms of the U.N. Refugee Conven-
 tion are eligible for the residence and work permits necessary to resettle perma-
 nently. New legislation p assed in June allows aliens who have submitted an applica-
 tion but have not yet b     antd refugee status to work legally. In the first 6
 months of 1998, 1,757 individuals submitted applications for refugee status; 127 in-
 dviduas were granted refugee status. Of those refused refugee status 246 were
 granted temporary residence on humanitarian grounds until return to their coun-
 tries of origin becomes possible.
 The Government usually does not recognize the concept of first asylum. Anecdotal
 evidence suggests that thousands of individuals from Turkey, Iraq, and Iran enter
 illegally each year; only a small percentage eventually apply for official refugee sta-
 tus. Some of those who do not apply remain illegally, often living in government
 camps where conditions vary from adequate to very poor. Others proceed on to
 Western Europe, often applying for asylum there. The Government does usually not
 seek. out such individuals for deportation, since Greece and Turkey do not have a
 readmission agreement, the Government finds it practically impossible to deport in-
 dividuals who enter Greece from Turkey.
 During the last 5 months of the year, between 300 and 600 Iraqi Kurds set up
 camp in a square in central Athens. Activists and NGO's charged that the Govern-
 ment was not providing adequate assistance to these individuals.
 Ii December the UNHCR criticized the lack of a coherent, functioning asylum
 process and the fact that the Government continued to deport forcibly some poten-
 tial asylum seekers back to their country of origin (or to the country from which
 they entered Greece) before they could submit formal applications for asylum.
 
 
 1291
 Human rights organizations state that this practice occurred more frequently in
 1998 than in previous years, although precise figures are unavailable. In May and
 July, police deported approximately 110 Albanian workers (allegedly holding valid
 Greek visas) without explanation.
 In January legislation was enacted allowing illegal immigrants to apply for legal
 status. Illegal immigrants could submit the preliminary application for legal status
 from January until the end of May. Approximately 350,000 illegal immigrants sub-
 mitted applications and received a "white card." The white card enables them to re-
 side and work legally in Greece on a short-term basis while meeting the other re-
 quirements necessary to obtain a "green card." The green card serves as a residence
 permit and allows the immigrants to live and work in the country for up to 5 years.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Greece is a multiparty democracy whose Constitution provides for full political
 rights for all citizens and for the peaceful change of governments and of the Con-
 stitution. The Government headed by Prime Minister Constantine Simitis of the
 Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) won in free and fair elections in Septem-
 ber 1996. Parliament elects the President for a 5-year term. Voting is mandatory
 for those over age 18, but there are many conditions that allow citizens not to vote,
 and penalties are not applied in practice. Members of the unicameral 300-seat Par-
 liament are elected to maximum 4-year terms by secret ballot. Opposition parties
 function freely and have broad access to the media.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or minori-
 ties in government or politics, representation of both at the higher levels of political
 life remains low. Women held 2 ministerial positions in the Government and only
 1 of 29 subministerial positions. Of the 300 members of Parliament, 17 were women.
 Women are underrepresented in the leadership of the two largest parties. The head
 of the Communist Party is a woman.
 While the Government generally respects citizens' political rights, there are some-
 times charges that it limits the right of some individuals to speak publicly and asso-
 ciate freely on the basis of their self-proclaimed ethnic identity, thus impinging on
 the political rights of such persons. However, in the 1996 parliamentary elections
 three Muslim deputies were elected in Thrace, one each from PASOK, New Democ-
 racy, and the Coalition of the Left. Romani representatives report that local authori-
 ties sometimes deprive Roma of the right to vote by refusing to register them. How-
 ever, Romani activists also report that some municipalities encourage Roma to reg-
 ister. Municipalities can refuse to register Roma who do not meet basic residency
 requirements, which many Roma have trouble meeting.
 In 1996 the Government transferred responsibility for oversight of all rights pro-
 vided to the Muslim minority under the Treaty of Lausanne (including education,
 zoning, administration of the wakfs, and trade) from elected local governors to the
 government-appointed periferiarch (a regional administrative official) of Eastern
 Macedonia and Thrace. Minority members charged that the transfer reduced their
 ability to use the democratic process to influence decisions that affect them. They
 also charged that the transfer opened the possibility of unequal application of local
 laws, because it created a situation in which Muslims and non-Muslims must go to
 different government offices to apply for documents such as building permits. The
 Government stated that it made the change because the central authorities could
 administer Greece's treaty obligations more effectively.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government allows domestic human rights organizations to operate, but co-
 operation with them varies. In principle it does not prohibit foreign diplomats from
 meeting with officials and other citizens, including critics of official policy. However,
 the security services on occasion monitor contacts of human rights groups, including
 listening in on conversations held between those groups and human rights inves-
 tigators and diplomats, and questioning contacts (see Section 1.). Monitors view
 this activity as a form of intimidation that deters others from meeting with inves-
 tigators.
 In July the Ministry of the Interior announced the establishment of a National
 Human Rights Committee, consisting of government officials and NGO representa-
 tives, that reports to the Prime Minister. The Committee, formally commissioned in
 December, monitors the human rights situation and drafts legislation on human
 rights issues. In September an "Ombudsman's" office was opened pursuant to a
 1997 law to mediate differences that citizens and migrants encounter in their deal-
 
 
 1292
 ings with government offices. One of the four deputy ombudsmen is responsible for
 human right issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law and the full protection of
 individual life, honor, and freedom irrespective of nationality, race, language, or reli-
 gious or political belief. Government respect for these rights in practice is uneven.
 The Government formally recognizes only the Muslim minority specified in the
 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. It refuses to acknowledge formally the existence of, any
 otherethnic groups, principally Slavophones, under the term "minority." As a result,
 some individuals who define themselves as members of a minority find it difficult
 to express their-identity freely and to-maintaln their culture:
 Women.-The incidence of violence against women that is reported to the authori-
 ,ties is low, but Athens' Equality Secretariat, which operates the only shelter for bat-
 tered women, believes the actua incidence is "high." According to the Ministry of
 Public Order, 217 cases of rpe were reported in 1997 compared with 189 cases in
 1996. The General Secretariat for Equality of the Sexes (GSES), an independent
 government agency, asserts that police tend to discourage women from pursuing do-
 nestic violence charges and instead undertake reconciliation efforts, although they
 are neither qualified for nor charged with this task. The GSES also claims that the
 courts are leient when dealing with domestic violence cases. Facilities for battered
 women and their children'exist but are often inadequately staffed t handle cases
 properly.            .
 Prostitution is legal. Prostitutes must register at the local police station and carry
 a medical card that is 'updated every 2 weeks. A Panteion University study reported
 that the number of foreign prostitutes quadrupled between 1991 and 1995. The
 study estimates the current numberf prostitutes to be 16,000. In October and No-
 venb~r, the inedia report6 a :series of scandals involving foreign women forced into
 prostitution. One woman was seriously injured -after attempting to escape her situa-
 tion by jumping from a fifth floor window. Another c6mmitted suicide after she al-
 legedly called the- police' for help and was told to make a written'complaint. In-Octo-
 ber nine- olic6 officers in western Greece were arrested and charged *ith harboring
 a criminal and abuselof power for protecting a nightclub owner who forced foreign
 -women to work ag prostitutes. In the-same month, thrde police 6fficers in northern
 Greece were-charged with the same offense. InNovember 11 police officials were
 charged with-improper issuance of residence permits to foreign women and protect-
 ing a brothel in Athens. The formei chief of police was charged with dereliction of
 duty for the improper issuance of a residence permit to a foreign woman. --
 According to the police, trafficking in women for prostitution, mostly from the
 former Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, has increased sharply in re-
 cent years. The Ministry of Public Order reports that of the 221 foreigners arrested
 for prostitution without a license in the first 8 months of 1998, 85 were from Alba-
 nia and 89 were from the former Soviet Union. According to the Panteion University
 study, 75 percent of foreign- female prostitutes are not told why they are being
 brought to Greece. In 1997 police estimated that foreigners constituted 2,000 of the
 estimated 5,000 prostitutes in Greece. From August 1997 to August 1998, 221 for-
 eign prostitutes were arrested for illegal prostitution.             J
 In March a court in Patras sentenced' a male supermarket manager to 10 months'
 imprisonment for-the sexual harassment of a female subordinate. The decision of
 the court marked the first ever penal sentence for sexual harassment in the country.
 Trade unions report that lawsuits for sexual harassment have been very rare: ac-
 cording to the unions, only four women have filed such charges in the past 2 years.
 In all four cases, the courts reportedly imposed very lenient civil sentences. The
 General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE) women's section states that sexual
 harassment is a widespread phenomenon, but that women are discouraged- from fil-
 ing charges against perpetrators by family members and other coworkers.
 Women enjoy broad constitutional and legal protection, including equal pay for
 equal work. However, the GSES and labor unions maintain that women receive
 lower salaries overall than men because they are hired for lower-level jobs. The Na-
 tional Statistical Service's most recent data (the second quarter of 1997) show that
 women's salaries in manufacturing were 70 percent of those of men in comparable
 positions; in retail sales; womens salaries were 87 percent of those of men in com-
 parable positions. These same groups claim that women face a "glass ceiling" when
 they are considered for promotions in both the public and private sectors. Although
 there are still relatively few women in senior positions, in recent years women have
 entered-traditionally male-dominated occupations such as the legal and medical pro-
 fessions in larger numbers.
 
 
 1293
 According to a report by the women's section of the GSEE, 58.6 percent of the
 country's long-term unemployed are women, while women constitute only 38 percent
 of the work force. The report also noted that women are underrepresented in labor
 union decisionmaking centers; there are only 3 women on the 45-member board of
 directors of the GSEE, and only 133 of 2,067 top-level trade unionists are women.
 The report concludes that the underrepresentation of women is the reason that the
 .women's section has failed to accomplish its major goals, including the establish-
 ment of a "women in trade unions network" and the enactment of trade union af-
 firmative action programs.
 Children.-The Government is committed to providing adequate basic health and
 education services for children. Education is compulsory through the ninth grade
 and free through university. Penal law prohibits the mistreatment of children and
 sets penalties for violators, while welfare legislation enacted in 1992 established
 preventive and treatment programs for abused children and for children deprived
 of a family environment; it also sought to ensure the availability of alternative fam-
 ily care or institutional placement.
 Several Government organizations have responsibility for children's issues. The
 National Welfare Organization, which has a nationwide network of offices, is active
 in the field of child protection. Legislation was passed late in the year to combine
 the Natiorial Welfare Organization with two similar entities in 1999. The Services
 of the new single organization are to be regionalized to provide greater access to
 child welfare services and finding prioritized according to regional needs. In No-
 vember the Government created an Interministerial Committee for Youth and Chil-
 dren.
 According to the Institute of Child Health (ICH), a research center under the Min-
 istry of Health and Welfare, physical punishment is widely regarded as a socially
 acceptable method of disciplining children. In the most recent ICH study, 65 percent
 of mothers and 55 percent of fathers told surveyors that they punished their chil-
 dren physically. The use of such measures decreased over the years as parents
 learned about the benefits of alternative forms of punishment.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children. No national data exist on the
 incidence of child abuse; local authorities are not required to report such cases. In
 a 10-year clinical study of 200 cases, the ICH reports that 59.5 percent involved
 physical abuse, 20 percent involved neglect, and 21 percent involved children who
 were not abused at the time but had a history of abuse. (The study did not cover
 victims of sexual abuse.) An ICH prevalence study of child sexual abuse among 740
 university students revealed an incidence rate of 7 percent among boys and 17 per-
 cent among girls prior to age 18. Societal abuse of children in the form of pornog-
 raphy and child labor is rare. Child prostitution is a growing phenomenon, particu-
 larly in some parts of central Athens.
 Child health specialists say that some social groups, such as Roma and illegal im-
 migrants, are underserved. Children's rights advocacy groups claim that protection
 of high-risk children in state residential care centers is inadequate and of low qual-
 ity. They cite a lack of coordination between welfare services and the courts, inad-
 equate funding of the welfare system, and poor staffing of residential care centers
 as systemic weaknesses in the treatment of child abuse. Child health specialists
 note that the number of children in residential care facilities is decreasing, while
 the number in foster care is rising.
 In recent years, the number of street children who panhandle or peddle at city
 intersections on behalf of adult family members or for criminal gangs has increased.
 In November the Ministries of Public Order and Welfare began to implement a plan
 to return the approximately 3,000 street children in Athens to their families or to
 place them in state institutions. According to the Ministry of Public Order, 78 per-
 cent of these children are Albanian, 12 percent are from other Balkan countries, and
 10 percent are Romani. Parents can reclaim their children but risk deportation if
 they are illegal immigrants.
 People With Disabilities.-Legislation mandates the hiring of disabled persons in
 public and private enterprises employing more than 50 persons. However, the law
 reportedly is enforced poorly, particularly in the private sector. The law states that
 disabled persons should constitute 3 percent of staff in private enterprises. In the
 civil service, 5 percent of administrative staff and 80 percent of telephone operator
 positions are reserved for disabled persons. Legislation passed in June mandates the
 ng of disabled persons in the public sector from a priority list. The disabled are
 exempt from the civil service exam. The Ministry of Labor announced in July the
 creation of 660 subsidized jobs for 3 years for the disabled. Persons with disabilities
 have been appointed to important positions in the civil service.
 The Construction Code mandates physical access for disabled persons to private
 and public buildings, but this law too is enforced poorly. A recent survey showed
 
 
 1294
 
 that over 60 percent of public buildings are not accessible to persons with mobility
 problems. Ramps and special curbs for the disabled have been constructed on some
 Athens streets and at some public buildings, and sound signals have been installed
 at some city street crossings. Since 1993 the Government has been replacing old city
 buses with new ones with stairs specially designed for the disabled. The new Athens
 subway inesunder construction reportedly are designed to provide full access for
 the disabled.                                        ,
 Religious Minorities.-In April a bomb was discovered in front of the Athens of-
 fices of the Central Board of the Jewish Communities in Greece. The Government
 launched an investigation, but those responsible have not been found. In August a
 Jewish cemetery in Kavala was vandalized. An investigation into this incident (as
 is the case with a 1997 vandalization in Trikala) produced no results.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-An increase in xeno uhobia paralleled the in-
 crease in the number of non-Greeks living and working in the country. Antiforeigner
 sentiment is mainly directed against Albanians (who compose over three-fifths of
 the alien population). When the head of a small communityin northern Greece at-
 tempted to impose a curfew on illegal Albanian immigrants in May, a superior au-
 thority immediately repealed it. Local officials in the Peloponnese publicly urged caf-
 etria owners not to serve Albanians and landlords to avoid renting to non-Grees.
 The African community in Athens charged that the killing of a young Nigerian man
 who was selling watches near a stadium in April was a racist at All political par-
 ties and human rights NGO's condemned the act. The perpetrators are in jail await-
 ing trial for murder.
 There are communities that identify themselves as Turks, Pomaks, Vlachs, Roma,
 Arvanites  (who   speak  a   dialect  of Albanian),  and  "Macedonians"  or
 "SlavoMacedonians." Most are fully integrated into society. The Government for-
 mallyrecognizes only the "Muslim minority" specified in the 1923 Treaty of Lau-
 sanne, applying the term to severalbdifferent ethnic communities. Most of the Mus-
 lim  minority (officially estimated at 120,000 persons) is ethnically Turkish or
 Turcophone and lives in western Thrace. The Muslim minority also includes Pomaks
 and Roma. Many Greek Muslims, including Pomaks, identify themselves as Turks
 and say that the Muslim minority as a whole has a Turkish cultural consciousness.
 While use of the terms "Tourkos" and 'Tourkikos" ("Turk" and Trurkish") is prohib-
 ited in titles of organizations, individuals may legally call themselves "Tourkos."
 Use of-a similar adjective, alourkoyenis" (of Turkish descent, affiliation, or eth-
 nicity) is allowed. To most Greeks, the words 'iourkos" and "Tourkikos" connote
 Turkish identity or loyalties, and many object to their use by Greek citizens of Turk-
 ish origin. The 8-month prison sentences of a dozen Muslim teachers, convicted in
 1996 for using the name 'Turkish Teachers of Western Thrace" in a union docu-
 ment, remained suspended pending a ppeal.
 The Treaty of Lausanne provides that the Muslim minority has the right to Turk-
 ish-language education, with a reciprocal entitlement for the Greek minority in
 Istanbul (now reduced to about 3,000). Western Thrace has both Koranic and secu-
 lar Turkish-language schools. Government disputes with .Turkey over teachers and
 textbooks caused these. secular schools serious problems in obtaining faculty and
 teaching materials in sufficient number and quality. Under a 1952 educational pro-
 tocl, Greece and Turkey may exchange annually 35 teachers on a reciprocal basis.
 The teachers serve in Istanbul and Western Thrace, respectively, but in recent years
 the Greek side limitd the exchanges to 16 teachers per country due to the dwin-
 dling needs of the small and aging Greek population in Turkey. Muslim leaders in
 Western Thrace, complained that the Government erected .bureaucratic barriers to
 prevent the Turkish teachers from performing their duties for much of the academic
 ear. In Greece over 8,000 Muslim children attended Turkish-language pimas r
 schools. An additional 150 attended 2 bilingual middle schools with a religious cur-
 riculum. Approximately 700 attended Turkish-language secondary schools, and ap-
 proximately 1,300 attended Greek-language secondary schools. Many Muslims re-
 portedly went to high school in Turkey due to the limited number of places in the
 Turkish-language secondary schools, which are assigned by lottery. Government in-
 centives encourage Muslim and Christian educators to reside and teach in isolated
 villages.
 The law permits the Minister of Education to give special consideration to Mus-
 lims for admission to universities and technical institutes. The law requires univer-
 sities and technical institutes to create a certain number of places for Muslim stu-
 dents each year 464 spaces were available in 1998. The admission exams were
 taken by 124 Muslim students, and 58 women and 54 men were accepted into uni-
 versities and technical schools.
 Th rae a of employment of Muslims in the public sector and in state-owned indus-
 tries and corporations is much lower than the Muslim percentage of the population.
 
 
 1295
 In Xanthi and Komotini, while Muslims hold seats on the prefectural and town
 councils, there are no Muslims among the regular employees of the prefecture. Mus-
 lims in Western Thrace claim that they are hired only for lower level, part-time
 work The Government says that lack of fluency in written and spoken Greek and
 the need for university degrees for high-level positions limit the number of Muslims
 eligible for government jobs.
 Public offices in Thrace do their business in Greek; the courts provide interpreters
 as needed. The office of the nomarch (governor) in Rodopi province, where many eth-
 nic Turks live, has Turkish-language interpreters available. A prosecutor in Rodopi
 issued instructions in 1997 to the Komotini registrar to stop accepting documents
 sealed by the government-appointed muftis unless the language of the documents
 was Greek and to reject as unsealed any documents bearing the Arabic-lettered
 seals used by the muftis for the last 70 years. The instructions were suspended after
 local Muslim officials complained.
 Claims of discriminatory denial of Muslim applications for business licenses, trac-
 tor ownership, or property construction diminished greatly in recent years. However,
 the development of basic public services (electricity, telephones, paved roads) in
 Muslim neighborhoods and villages continues in many cases to lag far behind that
 of non-Muslim areas. Muslim leaders also asserted that the Government routinely
 withholds permission from Muslims seeking to change their legal residence, which
 determines where they vote, from rural to urban communities within Western
 Thrace or from elsewhere in Greece to Thrace. They said permission to change legal
 residency from western Thrace to elsewhere in Greece was granted readily, and
 charged that the practice was part of a government policy to encourage Muslim emi-
 gration from the region and to prevent the urban concentration of Muslims in
 Thrace.
 Other than in one multicultural education "pilot school," the Government does not
 provide instruction in Greek as a second language to Turcophone children in the
 Athens area. Muslim parents report that their children are unable to succeed in
 school as a result of this policy. The Government maintains that Muslims outside
 of Thrace are not covered by the Treaty of Lausanne and therefore do not enjoy
 those rights guaranteed by the treaty.
 The Government refuses to acknowledge formally the existence and "minority"
 status of ethnic groups, principally Slavophones, other than the Muslim minority
 specified in the Treaty of Lausanne. As a result some individuals who define them-
 selves as members of a minority find it difficult to express their identity freely and
 to maintain their culture. Northern Greece is home to an indeterminate number (es-
 timates range widely, from under 10,000 to 50,000 or more) of citizens who are de-
 scended from Slavophones. Some still speak a Slavic dialect, particularly in Florina
 province. A small number of them identify themselves as belonging to a distinct eth-
 nic group, which they call "Macedonian,, and assert their right to minority status.
 (These self-described ethnic "Macedonians" are hereafter referred to as "Macedo-
 nians.") This assertion generates strong objections among the 2.2 million ethnically
 and linguistically Greek inhabitants of the northern Greek region of Macedonia,
 who also use the term to identify themselves. The Government refuses to recognize
 the Slavic dialect as "Macedonian" and denies that it is a language distinct from
 Bulgarian. Members of the minority assert that the Government pursues a policy
 designed to discourage use of their dialect. Greek sensitivity on this issue stems
 from concern that members of the "Macedonian" minority may have separatist aspi-
 rations. Greece's dispute with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over that
 country's name heightened this sensitivity.
 Government harassment and intimidation of some of these people, which has in-
 cluded denying their right to association (see Section 2.b.), monitoring activists'
 meetings with human rights investigators (see Section 2.d.), subjecting them to un-
 usual searches and other harassment at border crossings, and accusing activists
 ublicly of bein agents of a foreign government, continued at a reduced level. In
 y a group cang itself the "Association of Refugee -Children .of Aegean Macedo-
 nia," based outside Greece, held a picnic in Edessa. It was the first time that the
 Government allowed such an event to take place. Approximately 75 of the 125 indi-
 viduals who attempted to enter Greece for the picnic were admitted. The Govern-
 ment said that the others lacked necessary visas,-although picnic organizers accused
 the Government of denying them admission for political reasons.
 Roma frequently face discrimination in employment and in housing, particularly
 when attempting to rent accommodations. They experience police abuse more fre-
 quently than some other groups, including instances in previous years when- police
 raided entire Roma camps based on a warrant to arrest one individual.
 The General Secretariat for Adult Education (GSAE), a government agency, esti-
 mated the Romani population to be 150,000 to 200,000 in 1998. Nonofficial sources
 
 
 1296
 estimate the total at 250,000 to 300,000. Most of the Roma in Western Thrace are
 Muslim; elsewhere, the majority are Greek Orthodox. Almost half are permanently
 settled, mainly in the Athens area. The other half are mobile, working mainly as
 agricultural laborers, peddlers, and musicians throughout the country. The GSAE
 reports that'the number of Roma who move around the country is decreasing gradu-
 ally as families settle into slums in the suburbs of major cities.
 A Romani man was killed on April 1 in Partheni, Thessaloniki, when he refused
 to stop his car for inspection. Police claimed that they exchanged gunfire with the
 subject in self-defense. A cdurt hearing was pending at year's end. Amnesty Inter-
 national charged that in May two-Romani teenagers were beaten while in police cus-
 tody for attempting to steal ice cream from a'kisk. A trial was pending at year's
 end.
 Romani representatives report that local authoities refuse to register Roma as
 legal residents in their municipalities. Until re istered with a municipality, no citi-
 zen can vote or exercise other civic rights suchs as obtaining an official marriage,
 commercial, or driver's license or contributing to social security.
 In August the mayor of Evosmos, Thessaloniki, ordered the eviction of 3,500 Roma
 from a location they had occupied for the past 30 years. The group subsequently was
 evicted from four other locations within the next 15 days. The Ministry of Defense
 allocated land and houses at a former army camp for the group to occupy for the
 next 5 years. Human rights monitors charge that the Govermnent delayed renovat-
 ing the camp in reaction to protests by neighboring residents who do not want the
 Roma in their vicinity. The Government provided funding to several other munici-
 palities to transfer Roma settlements to new areas supplied with Watter, sewers, and
 electricity. It intends to provide portable mobile housing-in addition to "non-mobile"
 housing for Roma who demonstrate financial need.
 Government policy is to encourage the integration of Roma, The Prime Minister
 has designated a member of his staff to coordinate the efforts of all government
 ministries having a role in their integration. Poverty,, illiteracy, and social prejudice
 nevertheless continue to plague large parts of the Romani population; these prob-
 lems are most severe among the Roma who are mobile or who live in slums. Al-
 though the GSAE conducts education and training programs for them, the illiteracy
 rate among Roma is estimated at 80 percent. The Ministry of Education established
 a systeni of identity cards designed to permit students to change schools easily as
 their parents move and is developing a system of satellite schools for Romani settle-
 ments.
 The integration of Roma into social security systems is quite low. It is estimated
 that 90 percent of Roma are not insured by the public social security systems, since
 they are unable or unwilling to make the required contributions. As are all qualified
 Greek citizens, indigent Roma are entitled to free health care. However, their access
 to-health care is at times hindered by the fact that their encampments are located
 far from public health facilities.
 In June the Ministry of Health and Welfare initiated several projects addressing
 the chronic problems of the Roma community. The projects include training courses
 for civil servants,-policemeni and teachers to "increase sensitivity to the problems
 of the Roma," development,6f teaching materials for Roma children, -and the estab-
 lishment of youth centers in -areas close to Roma communities. The Ministry has al-
 ready established six such centers.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and subsequent legislation provide
 for the right of association. All workers, with the exception of the military, have the
 right to form or join unions. Police have the right to form unions but not to strike.
 Approximately 30 percent of workers (nearly 1 million persons) are organized in
 unions. Unions receive most of their funding from a Ministry of Labor organization,
 the, Workers' Hearth, which distributes mandatory contributions from employees
 and employers. Workers, employers, and the state are represented in equal numbers
 on the board of directors of the Workers' Hearth. Approximately 10 public sector
 unions have dues-withholding provisions in their contracts, in addition to receiving
 Workers' Hearth subsidies.
 Over 4,000 unions are -grouped into regional, and sectoral federations and 2 um-
 brella confederations, 1 for civil servants and 1, the General Confederation of Greek
 workers (GSEE), for private sector employees. The GSEE and the ADEDY an-
 nounced that they would merge in'the next 2.years. Unions are highly politicized,
 and there are party-affiliated factions within the labor confederations, but day-to-
 day operations are not-controlled by political parties or the Government. There are
 no restrictions on who may serve as a union official.
 
 
 1297
 
 Legal restrictions on strikes include a mandatory period of notice, which is 4 days
 for public utilities and 24 hours for the private sector. Legislation mandates a skele-
 ton staff during strikes affecting public services, such as electricity, -transportation,
 communications, and banking. Public utility companies, state-owned banks, the
 postal service, Olympic Airways, and the railroads also are required to maintain a
 skeleton staff during strikes.
 The courts have the -power to declare strikes illegal, although such decisions are
 seldom enforced. However, unions complain that this judicial power serves as a de-
 terrent to some of their membership from participating in strikes. In 1998 the
 courts declared a majority of strikes illegal for reasons such as failure of the union
 to give adequate advance notice of the strike or the addition of demands by the
 union during the course of the strike. However, no striking workers were pros-
 ecuted.
 Unions are free to join international associations and maintain a variety of inter-
 national affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation provides for the
 right to organize andbargain collectively in the private sector and in public corpora-
 tions. These rights are respected in. practice. There are no restrictions on collective
 bargaining for private sector employees.
 In 1997 and 1998 civil servants were provided with the right to organize and bar-
 gain collectively with the Ministry of Public Administration. The civil servants con-
 federation is to conduct official negotiations with the Ministry for the first time in
 1999.
 In response to union complaints that most labor disputes ended in compulsory ar-
 bitration, legislative remedies were enacted in 1989 that provided for mediation pro-
 cedures, with compulsory arbitration as a last resort. Legislation in 1992 estab-
 lished a National Mediation, Reconciliation, and Arbitration Organization and ap-
 plies to the private sector and public corporations (the military and civil service ex-
 cluded).
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. The Labor Inspectorate or a court inves-
 tigates complaints of discrimination against union members or organizers. Court
 rulings have mandated the reinstatement of improperly fired union organizers.
 Three free trade zones operate according to European Union regulations. The
 labor laws apply equally in these zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits all
 forced or compulsory labor, including that performed by children, and the Ministry
 of Justice enforces this prohibition. However, the government may declare the "civil
 mobilization" of workers in the event of danger to national security, life, property,
 or the social and economic life of the country. The International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Committee of Experts has criticized this power as violating the standards of
 ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. In December, for the first time in 8 years, the
 Government invoked the Civil Mobilization Act to end a strike by customs officials.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution contains a blanket prohibition of compulsory labor. Although no specific
 legislation explicitly prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, such practices
 are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). The minimum age for employment in the
 industrial sector is 15 years, with higher limits for certain activities. The minimum
 age is 12 years in family businesses, theaters, and the cinema. These age limits are
 enforced by occasional Labor Inspectorate spot checks and generally are respected.
 However, families engaged in agriculture, food service, and merchandising often
 have younger family members assisting them, at least part time.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Collective bargaining between the GSEE and
 the Employers' Association determines a nationwide minimum wage. The Ministry
 of Labor routinely ratifies this minimum wage, which has the force of law and ap-
 plies to all workers. The minimum wage of $21.60 (Dr 6,492) daily and $483 (Dr
 133,962) monthly, effective July 1, is sufficient for a decent standard of living for
 a worker and family. The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the private sec-
 tor and 37Y2 hours in the public sector. The law provides for at least one 24-hour
 rest period per week, mandates paid vacation of 1 month per year, and sets limits
 on overtime.
 Legislation provides for minimum standards of occupational health and safety. Al-
 though the GSEE has characterized health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it
 has charged that enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, was in-
 adequate. The Government passed       legislation  in  June putting  the Labor
 Inspectorate under a central authority in compliance with ILO Convention 81.
 Workers do not have the legal right to remove themselves from situations they be-
 lieve endanger their health. However, they have the right to lodge a confidential
 complaint with the Labor Inspectorate. Inspectors have the right to close down ma-
 
 
 1298
 chinery or' a process for a period of up to 5 days if they see safety or health hazards
 that they believe represent an imminent danger to the workers.
