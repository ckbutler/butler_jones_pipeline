 KENYA
 Kenya is in practice a one-party state, although no legal
 barriers exist against the formation of other political
 parties. The range of tolerated political activities is
 fairly broad. In the November 1979 parliamentary elections
 the typical constituency had between three and six persons
 vying for election, and 60 percent of the incumbents were
 defeated. Of 32 candidates for parliament who challenged
 the election results in their districts, seven were success-
 ful. National elections have occurred in an orderly
 fashion (1963, 1966, 1969, 1974, 1979) in Kenya's 18 years
 of independence, and the results have been respected by the
 government. Nevertheless, in 1979 ten individuals were
 barred from running for parliament for political reasons.
 Kenya is a constitutional polity. President Daniel arap
 Moi came to power constitutionally in August 1978 upon the
 death of President Kenyatta. In November 1979 President Moi
 was elected to a five-year term as president. In December
 1978 he released all 16 political prisoners who had been
 detained by the Kenyatta government. President Noi did,
 however, renew the Public Security Act under which political
 prisoners can be detained. The constitution enunciates
 substantial protection for fundamental rights and liberties.
 Kenya's judiciary-is independent and largely impartial.
 There is some constraint on the exercise of freedom of the
 press and assembly.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture-is not sanctioned in Kenya. It is specifically
 forbidden under the Kenyan constitution and no government
 violations of this prohibition have been reported.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions are often poor and treatment of prisoners
 and suspects can be harsh. Legal safeguards, including
 constitutional provisions, however, exist against cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. No summary
 executions have taken place in independent Kenya. Capital
 punishment can be and is employed for convicted murderers
 and thieves.
 Persons detained under the Public Security Act under
 the Kenyatta government were frequently denied both
 written and face-to-face contact with family members.
 In many instances, they were denied reading material
 except the Bible, denied adequate lighting and exercise
 opportunities, and were held in solitary confinement.
 In other cases, detainees were denied adequate cloth-
 ing, required to sleep on cold cement floors, and
 needed extensive medical treatment upon release.
 Discriminatory treatment of non-political prisoners
 has not been reported;

 The murder of six Kenyan civil servants in the North
 Eastern province in November 1980 provoked a sharp
 reaction by Kenyan authorities, including burning of homes
 and reprisals against local inhabitants. A curfew was
 imposed on the entire province, but was lifted in two of
 the three districts in January. The curfew in the third,
 Garissa, remained in effect until June 1981.
 c. Disappearances
 No evidence exists that President Moils government sanc-
 tions secret arrests, abductions, or other types of offi-
 cially inspired disappearances, or that these abuses have
 occurred.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The 1978 Public Security Act is an omnibus bill that
 includes subsidiary legislation and regulations which
 apply to five broad categories:
 1. Northeast Province and contiguous districts;
 2. Armed forces;
 3. Control of movements;
 4. Neru district; and
 5. Detained and restricted persons.
 The act states that its provisions and subsidiary legislation
 supersede "any such law' with which it may be inconsistent,
 but it also provides that regulations promulgated under the
 act shall not be inconsistent with or in contravention of
 the constitution which protects the right of personal
 liberty and provides protection from discrimination.
 In practice the act supersedes constitutional safeguards
 because it empowers the state to undertake, without reference
 or recourse to the judiciary or other authority, actions in
 a wide range of circumstances to control the activities of
 individuals and groups that would otherwise be regarded as
 lawful.
 Although the Public Security Act permits political detention,
 the act does contain certain procedural protections.
 Detainees must be informed of the reasons for their deten-
 tion within five days of arrest, and they have the right to
 have their cases reviewed every six months by a special tri-
 bunal appointed by the President. The tribunal meets in
 camera, however, and the government is not bound to comply
 with its findings. The incidence of politically motivated
 detentions under the provisions of the act. has been low.
 No such detentions have occurred under President Mois
 government.
 Habeas corpus exists in practice. Aside from the Public
 Security Act, Kenyan law does not provide for preventive
 detention. If the police suspect that an individual may
 pose a danger to public safety, they may request from a
 
 
 127
 magistrate a writ to arrest and detain the individual,
 describing the reason and proposed period of detention.
 Nevertheless, occasional instances of "extra legal" arrest
 do occur. In May 1981, in the midst of the Kenyan doctors'
 strike, police arrested the wives of certain doctors who
 had disappeared to avoid arrest in an effort to force
 the doctors to surface and return to work. In October
 1981 a former MP and maverick critic of the regime was
 arrested without charges; two days later his wife was able
 to obtain a habeas corpus writ from the high court.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is respected in Kenya,
 aside from detention cases filed under the Public Security
 Act. In security cases the authority of the regular courts
 is limited to ensuring compliance with the procedural
 provisions of the act. Under Kenyan law, the defendant has
 a right to choose his own counsel, but only in capital cases
 is the government obliged to provide counsel for defendants
 who cannot afford it. Civilians are tried in civil courts,
 and defendants may appeal these verdicts to the high court.
 Military courts adjudicate solely cases under military law
 affecting armed forces personnel.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home and other guarantees of English
 common law are respected in Kenya. Police and other
 governmental officials are ordinarily required to obtain a
 magistrate's warrant before entering a private residence.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly and
 association are enunciated in the constitution. Freedom of
 expression and communication in Kenya, however, can be and
 has been restricted under various sections of the penal
 code. The existence and past use of the Public Security Act
 clearly inhibits public exchange of views on sensitive
 political subjects. Debates in the national assembly tend
 to be non-controversial because of violations of members'
 immunity during the Kenyatta era and government pressure on
 and harassment of dissident MP's. In June 1981 a member of
 parliament was sentenced to a three-month term for *conduct
 likely to create a breach of the peace" for having predicted
 in public that one day Kenyan Vice President Kibaki was
 likely to become Kenya's president.
 The government actively discourages both students and
 faculty from political activism. In May 1981 students at
 the University of Nairobi conducted several demonstrationt
 to protest both the government's political acts and the
 administration of the university. In response, the
 government closed the university, required male students
 to return home and report twice weekly to local authori-
 ties, and seized the passports of some faculty members.
 While the university has subsequently reopened, some
 faculty are still without their passports.
 
 
 128
 While Kenya has no formal censorship of the press,
 informal government guidelines are issued on politically
 sensitive issues and perceived deviations are dealt with
 swiftly. In May 1981 the chief editor, managing editor,
 and four journalists from Kenya's leading newspaper were
 detained by the criminal investigation department and
 interrogated about their coverage of the doctors' strike
 and a controversial Kenyan politician who had been pro-
 hibited from running for parliament. The editor-in-chief
 subsequently resigned.
 In September 1981 President Moi publicly chastised Kenya's
 Muslim community for having gone to the press in opposition
 to pending Kenyan legislation on inheritance practices.
 Their case, said the president, should be made to the
 attorney general in private, not to the press.
 There is no formal a priori censorship of published
 material in Kenya. Even in cases where published works
 have sparked political controversy, the publications have
 remained available to the public.
 A thirty-member film censorship board operates out of
 the attorney general's office and must approve all films
 to be shown in Kenya, but a wide variety of foreign
 films is regularly available. A ten-member television
 censorship board based in the office of the president
 has established precepts incorporating national and
 developmental goals which govern what can be shown
 on television.
 Freedom of assembly and association is limited by the Public
 Order and Police Act which gives local administrative
 authorities and police wide powers to control public meetings.
 It is an offense to convene'an unlicensed meeting. The
 government can and has on occasion prevented political
 meetings under the Societies Act. The government can refuse
 to register any society that it believes may pursue activi-
 ties harmful to public security. The Public Order, Police,
 and Societies Acts can effectively prevent an organization
 from functioning. A former opposition political party, the
 now defunct Kenya People's Union (KPU), remains proscribed
 under the Societies Act. The government used the same
 powers to ban the Jehovah's Witnesses in 1973, but it later
 rescinded the ban when threatened with a court test of the
 constitutionality of the Societies Act. The Church of Jesus
 Christ of Latter-Day Saints and several other religious
 groups have recently encountered serious difficulty obtaining
 registration under the Societies Act.
 Kenya has a relatively free trade union movement, but
 the effect of Kenya's complex labor legislation is to render
 almost all strikes illegal. Strikes are permitted only
 if the Ministry of Labor has not taken action within 21
 days of the declaration of a dispute to have it resolved.
 Although the minister of labor has threatened on occa-
 sion to punish strike leaders under provisions of the Trade
 Disputes Act, no union leaders were brought to court
 
 
 129
 under the act in 1981. In 1980, however, some workers were
 dismissed for striking, and in May 1981 many non-union
 doctors were arrested for striking on the grounds that their
 action deprived the country of an essential service.
 In August 1980 the government formally deregistered the
 Kenyan civil servants' union, the country's largest union,
 because of its alleged political activities. The Organiza-
 tion of AfricanTrade Union Unity has continued to complain
 publicly about the Kenyan government's unwillingness to
 permit a genuine labor union organization for its civil
 servants despite the fact that Kenya is a signatory of
 various International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions
 including such a right on the part of civil servants.
 All permanent workers in enterprises employing at least
 seven persons may be organized into trade unions. Approxi-
 mately three-quarters of all such enterprise employees
 in Kenya work in such facilities, and of these about
 half (300,000) pay voluntary dues. Unions, however,
 actually represent a greater number in collective bargain-
 ing, for workers not belonging to the unions are covered by
 the collective agreements negotiated for their enterprises.
 Agreements are almost invariably of two years' duration.
 Freedom of religion exists in Kenya. However, several
 religious affiliations have encountered difficulty in
 obtaining official registration from Kenyan authorities.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The president's detention power includes the ability
 to restrict movement within Kenya, but this power has
 not been used recently. However, following the May 1981
 demonstration at the University of Nairobi, some faculty
 members had to surrender their passports for foreign travel.
 Women and other groups are not subjected to separate
 rules in matters of internal or foreign travel, emigration,
 or repatriation. The right of voluntary repatriation is
 respected.
 While Kenya suffers from a high rate of urban unemployment,
 it has nonetheless accepted refugees. There are now
 approximately 3,900 persons in Kenya who hold official
 refugee status. Of these, about 1,800 are ethiopian,
 1,000 Rwandan, and 500 Ugandan. In addition, it is esti-
 mated that between two and ten thousand persons from neigh-
 boring countries have taken refuge in Kenya but are not
 legally classified as, refugees by Kenyan authorities. Most
 refugees in Kenya have status as 'accepted asylum seekers,"
 which means that they report periodically to the immigration
 department. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees
 maintains a four-person office in Nairobi which works
 through a variety of Kenyan agencies to aid refugees with
 financial assistance, medical care, education, training, and
 counseling.
 
 
 130
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since the banning of the Kenya Peoples Union (KPU) in 1969,
 Kenya has had only one political party, the Kenya African
 National Union (KANU), which represents a very wide spectrum
 of political views. To become a member of parliament a
 candidate must become a life member of the party; on occa-
 sion life membership has been refused to individuals whose
 political views varied from those of government. Although
 no law exists banning the formation of other political
 parties, the government retains substantial powers to
 restrict and inhibit competing political activities.
 Ten persons, including five ex-KPU leaders and a political
 detainee released in December 1978, were prohibited from
 running in Kenya's last parliamentary elections in 1979,
 but two other detainees released in December 1978 were
 allowed to stand for parliament and have remained politi-
 cally active. A well known Luo politician and activist
 and former Kenyatta opponent has continued to be banned
 from occupying a parliamentary seat, most recently in
 April 1981.
 Political activity within KANU, however, is vigorous
 and diverse. About 750 candidates representing a wide
 range of political views openly contested the 158 elective
 seats in the National Assembly. Parliamentary elections
 in 1969, 1974, and 1979 saw the defeat of over 50 percent
 of the incumbents.
 Kenyan society is patriarchal. Attitudes toward the
 role of women reflect traditional, strongly male-
 dominated values; however, sexual discrimination is not
 government policy, and a few members of the national
 assembly are women. The Kenyan government is currently
 contemplating the implementation of a new law on inher-
 itance, the Succession Act, which would be a major step
 toward equal status for women in Kenyan society in that
 it would formally recognize a wife's claim on the estate
 of her spouse, thereby assuring her a measure of finan-
 cial independence. The enunciated policy of the govern-
 ment of Kenya is equality of opportunity for all without
 regard to race, religion, ethnic origin, creed, or
 political opinion.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Kenyatta government barred entry into
 Kenya of journalists who were critical of President Kenyatta
 and his family. A member of his cabinet criticized non-
 governmental organizations, like Amnesty International, and
 questioned their right to pass judgment on the internal
 policy of sovereign states. The Moi government has, however,
 encouraged efforts to draft an African human rights
 charter.
 
 
 131
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Although the Kenyan Government is strongly committed
 to improving health care, education and the general
 standard of living, recent economic performance has lagged.
 Real per capita growth of gross domestic product has
 averaged less than 0.5 percent over the last six years,
 and a population growth rate of approximately four percent
 - the highest reported in the world - Etrains the ability
 of the economy to provide even small increases in per
 capita income, much less significant increases in health
 care and education for those now being born.
 Kenyan law attempts to ensure just conditions and remuner-
 ation for work. All wage and salary earners are covered by
 the minimum wage provisions of the Employment Act.
 Separate minimum wages exist for agriculture, the two
 major cities (Nairobi and Mombasa), other urban areas, and
 all other areas of employment. The four rates were
 revised in Nay 1980 to offset partially the local rate of
 inflation. Of the 972,000 permanent wage and salary
 earners in 1979, about 30 percent were in Nairobi and
 Mombasa, and,they received the highest wages. About a
 quarter of Kenya's workers toil in agriculture, which pays
 the lowest wages. Estimates of casual labor, found
 primarily in agriculture and construction, range between
 ten ad 25 percent of the total work force.
 All wage earners are subject to Ministry of Finance
 guidelines, the latest of which were issued in February
 1979, and stipulate that wage increases cannot exceed
 one half of the increase in the cost of living since 'the
 signing of the previous agreement for the past two
 years., The increase must be apportioned annually over
 the life of the agreement. Despite this handicap, some
 unions have had notable success in the industrial court
 in obtaining salary adjustments for both public and
 private employees. These adjustments have measurably
 increased worker take-home pay. Unions have also met
 with some success in obtaining non-salary benefits such
 as housing allowances. All workers in the central
 government (about 260,000 employees including teachers)
 received sixeable wage and housing allowance increases
 effective October 1, 1980. These increases ranged from
 about 40 percent for the lowest paid employees to about
 12 percent in the highest category. All collective
 agreements must be approved by the industrial court
 before they become effective.
 Approximately 66 percent of. Kenya's 16.4 million persons
 live in the rural areas, and 55 percent of them live below
 the-poverty level. Western and Nyanza provinces have the
 largest numbers of rural poor. The rural poor include
 some small farmers, pastoralists, the landless, and
 large-farm squatters. Urban poor include the unemployed
 and casual labor.
 Small farmers number about nine million, and 45 percent
 of them have only about 20 percent of the total small-
 holder income. The typical small farmer has about 2
 hectares, but 45 percent hold less than a single hectare.
 
 
 132
 Moreover, small-holders are not ordinarily self-sufficient
 in food production, for only about 40 percent of the food
 they consume is home grown.
 The typical small-holding is managed either by the
 wife or jointly by the wife and husband, with women
 providing about three-quarters of the farm labor. Women
 have been increasingly brought into the agricultural
 cash economy, but they are still burdened with tradi-
 tional responsibilities. The most recent development in
 the life of women in rural areas has been an extensive
 out-flow of males. This phenomenon is particularly
 apparent in western Kenya and in the arid and semi-arid
 lands to the north and east. With males taking urban
 employment, women are left with virtually the entire
 responsibility for farm production. Incremental increases
 in agricultural production, particularly that on small
 farms, is tied to the government's ability both to
 provide production incentives and services to female
 farmers and to keep a greater proportion of males
 in agriculture.
 Following independence Kenya made steady progress in
 health care. Recently, however, some positive trends
 have peaked and started to decline marginally. Life
 expectancy rose from 42.5 years in 1960 to 55.7 in 1978.
 The most recent data, however, indicate that by 1980 life
 expectancy had dropped to 54.6 years. A similar pattern
 has emerged with respect to infant mortality rates which
 declined from 159 per thousand in 1960 to 83 in 1977. The
 most recent data (for 1978) indicate that infant mortality
 has risen to 91. The government has in the past concen-
 trated health expenditures on high-cost facilities such as
 hospitals, health centers and dispensaries. In rural areas,
 however, these facilities often serve only 25 to 30 percent
 of the population, drawing people from no more than eight
 kilometers away. The health budget is already heavily
 committed to the recurrent cost of these static facilities.
 Community-based health systems that would integrate health,
 nutrition, maternal and child care, and family planning are
 only in the first stages of implementation.
 Kenya has a strong commitment to education, and the Kenyan
 Government is currently in the process of expanding its
 basic curriculum from eight to nine years. The literacy
 rate in Kenya has doubled since independence, rising from 20
 to 40 percent of the adult population.
 The following data are illustrative of the educational
 situation in Kenya: total school enrollment as a per-
 centage of the population in a particular age group --
 primary (ages 5-14, 1976):  male:  82 percent, femalet 72
 percent, total: 77 percent; secondary (ages 15-19; 1976):
 male: 25 percent, female: 15 percent, total: 20 percent;
 post-secondary: (ages 20-24, 1973): male: two percent,
 female: one-tenth of a percent, total: one percent.
 The percentage of females entering primary school in-
 creased from 33 percent of total such enrollments in 1961
 to 47 percent in 1978. Secondary school female enrollment
 remained essentially static since 1961, however, rising
 from 33 percent to only 36 percent by 1978. At the
 university level only about two percent of the student
 body is female.
