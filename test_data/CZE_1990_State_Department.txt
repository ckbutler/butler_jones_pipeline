 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Czechoslovakia is ruled by a democratically elected Government
 formed after free parliamentary elections held in June. This
 Government replaced the so-called Government of NatiQnal
 Understanding which was installed in December 1989 after
 massive street demonstrations and round table talks between
 the Communists and the opposition had led to the fall of the
 totalitarian Communist regime that had ruled Czechoslovakia
 since 1948. Under the prevailing federal structure, which is
 emphasized in the country's official title, the Czech a:nd
 Slovak Federal Republic, free elections were also held for
 parliaments in the two constituent republics resulting in
 democratic governments.
 Under Communist rule, the Ministry of Interior, including both
 regular uniformed police and an internal security apparatus
 known as State Security, was used as an instrument to control
 the population. In 1990.alI units of State Security were--
 abolished, and the Ministry's illegal practices and abuses of
 human rights were brought to an end. Legitimate security
 functions previously performed by State Security were
 transferred to sev'eral new organizations, most notably the
 Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Democracy.
 In addition, employees of State Security were screened, and
 those found to have violated the law or abused their office
 were dismissed.
 The Government in February concluded an agreement with the
 Soviet Government for the withdrawal by June 30, 1991, of all
 Soviet forces stationed in Czechoslovakia since 1968, and a
 majority of Soviet units were withdrawn during 1990.-
 The new Government, having inherited a centrally planned
 economy characterized by excessive bureaucratic control,
 obsolete equipment ahd infrastructure, and few incentives for
 innovation and initiative, is determined to transform
 Czechoslovakia into a market economy: Foreign trade and
 investment were liberalized, and restrictions on private
 enterprise were removed in April 1990. In the meantime, much
 of the economic regulatory authority has devolved upon the
 authorities at the republic level. An economic reform program
 approved by the Federal Assembly in September calls for price
 liberalization and partial convertibility of the currency in
 1991.
 Czechoslovakia made impressive progress in restoring human
 rights in 1990. Under President Vaclav Havel, a renowned
 human rights advocate, the'protection of human rights became
 paramount in the development of both Czechoslovak internal and
 foreign policies. Legislation providing for the rights of
 free speech, assembly, association, and press was adopted, and
 the citizenry embraced these rights to create an active,
 pluralistic political life. Political offenses were
 eliminated from the'criminal code, and legal provisions
 strengthening the right of due process for criminal defendants
 were approved. A sweeping presidential amnesty freed over
 20,000 persons, including all known political prisoners.
 Arbitrary arrests, searches, and interrogations, which had
 been commonplace during the Communist regime, were eliminated
 in practice, and safeguards were adopted to prevent arbitrary
 interference with privacy, home, family, and coriespondence.
 State control of and interference with the practice of
 religion ceased, and the Government resumed, full diplomatic
 relations with the Vatican.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no evidence that such killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 No instances of torture during 1990 were reported. Citizens
 have the legal right to bring complaints against the police.
 A 1989 Helsinki Watch report strongly criticized prison
 conditions in Czechoslovakia. The presidential amnesty in
 January 1990 relieved the severe overcrowding that had existed
 in prison facilities, and prison administrators appointed by
 the new Government eliminated the systematic mistreatment of
 prisoners. Despite significantly improved prison conditions,
 some inmates remained dissatisfied with prison conditions and
 engaged in peaceful protests or violent disturbances during
 1990. Special government commissions in both the Slovak and
 Czech Republics, whose membership includes former prison
 inmates and human rights activists, were formed to investigate
 prison conditions and to recommend improvements.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The former Communist regime used arbitrary arrests and
 detentions to harass and control human rights activists and
 common citizens alike. A practice known as "protective
 supervision," which combined features of internal exile and
 house arrest, was also practiced. The new Government
 abolished these practices and repealed criminal code
 provisions that permitted them.
 Czechoslovak law requires arrest warrants except in cases such
 as hot pursuit. Legislation has reduced the period during
 which persons may be held without being charged from 48 to 24
 hours. A person charged with a crime has the right, observed
 in practice, to appear before a judge for arraignment. If
 charges are formalized at the arraignment, the judge then
 determines whether the person charged should be kept in
 custody or released pending trial. Czechoslovak law permits a
 person committed to pretrial detention to be held for a period
 not to exceed 1 year. Any person so held appears before a
 judge monthly for a determination of the necessity for
 continued detention.
 There is no exile either in law or in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Prior to the democratic changes in Czechoslovakia, the
 judiciary was not independent of the Communist regime. Judges
 were subject to direct control and supervision by the
 Communist Party, to which most judges belonged. Most judges
 who served during the period of Communist rule have been
 replaced. Members of the judiciary are no longer subject to
 
 
 1125
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 manipulation and control by any political force, and they may
 execute their judicial duties independently.
 Persons charged with'criminal offenses are entitled to fair
 and open public trials. They have a right to be informed of
 the charges against them, to retain and consult with counsel
 of their own choosing or court-appointed counsel, to present a
 defense, and to appeal any judgment against them. These
 rights are honored in practice.
 The Communist regime used vague provisions of the criminal
 code, such as "incitement" and "damaging the interests of the
 republic abroad," to prosecute its adversaries. These and
 other political provisions of the criminal code were repealed
 in 1990. In addition to changes concerning political
 offenses, significant amendments to the criminal code, adopted
 during 1990, codified a defendant's right to remain silent
 during criminal proceedings, expanded rights for consultation
 with legal counsel, and abolished capital punishment.
 There are no political prisoners. The amnesty issued by
 President Havel in January provided for the release of some
 20,000 persons, including all known political prisoners.
 Legislation was adopted to assist in the rehabilitation of
 former political prisoners, provide a means for removing
 criminal convictions for political crimes from a person's
 record, and to compensate financially all who were imprisoned
 for political offenses. The Government also undertook a
 case-by-case review of persons imprisoned for espionage.
 Human rights observers indicated that most reviews were
 completed and that the reviews found most espionage
 convictions imposed during the period of Communist rule to
 have been unwarranted. Persons found to have been unfairly
 convicted were released.
 The trial of a significant political figure occurred during
 1990. Miroslav Stepan, the former head of the Prague
 Communist Party, was tried and convicted of abuse of office
 for ordering police actions against anti-Communist
 demonstrators in October 1988 and January 1989. Stepa's
 trial was open to the public, and his conviction was based
 upon violations of substantive, nonpolitical provisions of the.
 criminal code. Stepan subsequently appealed but was again
 found guilty, although his sentence'was reduced.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The new Government has abandoned extralegal electronic
 surveillance, home searches, tapping of telephones, and
 ,interception of mail to monitor the activities of citizens and
 abolished the State Security section of the Ministry of
 Interior which engaged in such practices.
 Police may now conduct searches of homes only with court
 approval, or in instances of hot pursuit, or when there is a
 reasonable fear that evidence may be destroyed. Wiretaps and
 the opening of correspondence are permitted only in cases
 involving organized crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism,
 and only with prior judicial approval.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by law and
 respected in practice. Persons are free to speak out on
 political and other issues and to criticize the Government and
 public officials without fear of the harassment and
 persecution prevalent during the period of Communist control.
 The Government of National Understanding abolished the Federal
 Press and Information Office, the Communist Party's principal
 agent for controlling all publications. During 1990 a free,
 independent, and multifaceted press developed in
 Czechoslovakia, with hundreds of newspaper and magazines
 beginning publication. In addition, some previously political
 organs, such as Mlada Fronta of the Communist youth movement
 and Svobodne Slovo of the Socialist Party, were converted into
 independent publications.
 All domestic television broadcasting facilities are government
 owned. A federal channel broadcasts throughout the country,
 while Slovak and Czech channels focus their programming on
 their respective Republics. During 1990 a government-
 sponsored channel, known as OK-3, began broadcasting
 Western-sourced programs, including news reports of the Cable
 News Network, to replace Soviet programs. Editorial control
 over programming is determined by the management of each
 channel. The directors of Czechoslovak television and
 Czechoslovak radio stations are appointed by the Federal
 Government. The directors in turn have authority over the
 personnel that work for television and radio. There is no
 evidence that the Federal Government has attempted to use
 pressure to influence the content of news reporting or general
 programming. Domestic channels during 1990 featured a wide
 range of opinion, including opinion opposing government
 policies.
 The Government also supports radio broadcasting facilities
 whose program content, like that of television, is determined
 by the management of each station. During 1990 the government
 monopoly of radio stations was broken when a station owned by
 private French interests began regular broadcasting. Radio
 Free Europe now broadcasts on local frequencies as well.
 A government commission on information policy is drafting
 legislation to legalize independent radio and television
 broadcasting, but the number of available frequencies is
 limited.
 Substantial numbers of university administrators and faculty
 resigned or were removed from their positions during 1990 as
 the Government made efforts to replace administrators and
 professors who occupied their positions on the basis of
 Communist credentials rather than professional qualifications.
 Legislation was adopted granting universities the authority to
 decide their own internal affairs, including academic and
 pedagogic orientation and internal structure. The new law
 also provides for academic freedom for university faculty.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 A law protecting the right of persons to assemble peacefully
 was approved in 1990. Permits for public demonstrations are
 required by law but are routinely granted. In addition,
 
 
 1127
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 police have not interfered with spontaneous demonstrations for
 which organizers lacked a permit.
 Legislation declaring the right of persons to associate was
 also approved. In addition, a law permitting groups of
 persons to form political parties and movements was adopted.
 Certain organizations, such as political parties, are required
 to register, but registration is essentially a formality.
 Organizations previously harassed by the Communist regime are
 allowed to operate openly without government interference.
 For example, the Society of Friends of the United States,
 regarded by the Communists as an anti-State organization, was
 granted official recognition, and the human rights group
 Charter 77 held its first public meeting.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Czechoslovakia enjoys religious freedom. The means employed
 by the former Communist authorities to control religious
 activity, including the required registration of religious
 organizations, the licensing of clergy, restrictions on the
 publication andimportation of religious materials,
 restrictions on religious education and the training of
 clergy, and discrimination in employment against believers,
 have been abandoned. "Pacem in Terris," the state-sponsored
 "peace association" of Catholic clergy under the Communist
 regime, disbanded in 1990.
 Pope John Paul II, at the invitation of the new Government,
 visited Czechoslovakia in April. The Roman Catholic Church,
 with the approval of the new Government, filled bishoprics
 left vacant during the period of Communist rule. The Church
 is now free to appbint-bishops without government approval,
 and did so in 1990. Several questions in church-state
 relations have not been resolved, including which church
 property confiscated by the Communist authorities will be
 returned to church control and the extent of government
 financial support for religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does'not impede domestic or foreign travel.
 Passports, which previously were often denied to those
 considered politically unreliable,.are now freely available to
 all wishing to travel abroad. There are no restrictions on
 emigration. Czechoslovak citizens who emigrated during the
 period of Communist rule are now free to return to visit or
 live in Czechoslovakia.
 A law addressing the questions of refugees and political
 asylum was adopted in late 1990. The law provides a mechanism
 by which persons present in Czechoslovakia may be granted
 refugee status if they can demonstrate a reasonable fear of
 persecution in their homeland because of their race, religion,
 nationality, social group, or political ideas. A person
 granted refugee status is granted permission to reside in
 Czechoslovakia for a 5-year period. A refugee generally enjoys
 the same rights and responsibilities as a Czechoslovak
 citizen, although a refugee may not vote, is not subject to
 compulsory military service, and is subject to the same
 restrictions in employment and ownership of real estate as any
 foreigner. After completion of the 5-year.period, another
 review of the refugee's status is made, at which time the
 
 
 1128
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 person may be granted Czechoslovak citizenship or his refugee
 status continued.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Czechoslovakia now have the right and ability
 to change their government peacefully. All Czechoslovak
 citizens 18 years of age and older may vote in national and
 local elections. Opposition groups, including political
 parties, function openly and freely. The first free elections
 in over 40 years were held in June. Over 96 percent of the
 electorate participated in these multiparty elections by secret
 ballot. A Federal coalition Government including the Civic
 Forum, Public Against Violence, and the Christian Democratic
 Movement of Slovakia was formed after the elections. New
 democratic parliamentary governments were formed at the
 republic level following the elections. The next parliamentary
 elections are expected to be held in 1992. The first free
 elections for local government officials in over 50 years were
 held in November.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups which became active during Communist
 rule, such as Charter 77, the Committee for the Defense of the
 Unjustly Persecuted (VONS), and the Czechoslovak Helsinki
 Committee, continue to monitor the human rights situation in
 the country. Other groups concerned with human rights have
 appeared since the fall of the Communist regime and also
 actively observe and comment upon human rights developments.
 Czechoslovakia cooperates with international and domestic
 investigations of human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Health care, education, retirement, and other social services
 are provided without regard to race, sex, religion, language,
 or social status. Women are equal under the law and receive
 pay equal to that of male colleagues for the same job.
 However, only relatively small numbers of women are found in
 the higher levels of professional and government employment.
 Reliable statistics concerning the level of violence against
 women, including wife beating, are not available. Observers
 believe that many cases go unreported and that police on
 occasion are reluctant to intervene in cases of spouse abuse.
 Prosecutorial authorities are thought generally to accept and
 conscientiously prosecute charges involving cases of violence
 against women brought to their attention.
 Czechoslovakia has two major nationalities--Czechs and
 Slovaks--and two sizable minorities--Hungarians and Gypsies.
 Differences between Czechs and Slovaks arose in 1990 over a
 number of issues, including the name of the country,
 officially changed to the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic,
 and the appropriate distribution of governmental power between
 the Federal Government and the governments of the two
 Republics. A separatist movement also appeared in Slovakia,
 but polls indicated that perhaps only 10 percent of the
 population of Slovakia favored formation of an independent
 Slovak state.
 
 
 1129
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Hungarians, who are concentrated in southern Slovakia, form
 the country's largest minority (600,000, according to official
 statistics). The State provides some primary and secondary
 education in Hungarian and allows ethnic Hungarians to pursue
 higher education in Hungary. These students generally pay
 their own way in Hungary, though perhaps a dozen participate
 in a modest exchange program at government expense. Ethnic
 Hungarians complain, however, that Hungarian-language
 instruction at the elementary and secondary levels is
 inadequate, and that the lack of opportunities for higher
 education in Hungarian contributes to a shortage of qualified
 Hungarian-language teachers.
 The Slovak Republic in October adopted a law designating
 Slovak as its official language. The law also provides that,
 in communities in which a non-Slovak-speaking ethnic group
 constitutes 20 percent of the population, official business
 may also be transacted in the language of the ethnic group.
 Gypsies, who number about 300,000, are the only other sizable
 minority. They tend to suffer disproportionately from high
 rates of poverty, crime, and disease. Their problems appear
 for the most part to result more from traditional and popular
 prejudice than from government policies, although Gypsies are
 not officialiy recognized as an ethnic minority and thus are
 not accorded those rights enjoyed by other minorities.
 Charter 77 has charged that official criteria concerning when
 sterilization may be performed are often ignored in cases
 involving Gypsy women, and that Gypsy women are actively and
 systematically persuaded to accept sterilizations. Both the
 Slovak and the Czech governments have taken steps, including
 the elimination of financial incentives to promote
 sterilizations, to eliminate any discrimination that might
 have existed,
 Some 30,000 Vietnamese workers were temporarily working and
 residing- in Czechoslovakia at the beginning of 1990. Because
 the current Government has decided not to renew the contracts
 of such workers as they expire, the numbers of Vietnamese in
 Czechoslovakia are expected to decline substantially over the
 next several years.
 The year 1990 witnessed a new form of discrimination: attacks
 against Gypsies and Vietnamese by gangs of youth known as
 skinheads. Government authorities-spoke out against these
 attacks and prosecuted persons responsible for them.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in Czechoslovakia have the right to form or join
 unions of. their own choosing without prior authorization.
 Over 90 percent of workers are members of labor organizations.
 These unions, which are democratic and independent of
 government control, grew out of strike committees formed to
 support a 1989 general strike against the former Communist
 regime. The Communist-controlled labor organization known as
 the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement (ROH) disbanded, and
 its assets were taken over by the new democratic unions.
 Trade unions may affiliate internationally without restriction,
 and the new umbrella organization, the Czech and Slovak
 Confederation of Trade Unions,-has been accepted as an
 affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions.
 
 
 1130
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 A law adopted in 1990 required labor organizations to register
 with the Interior Ministry in the republic where they
 operate. Union officials protested the requirement as
 violating International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 87.
 The offending provision was repealed after the protest.
 The Government does not maintain statistics on strikes, but
 occasional strikes occurred throughout Czechoslovakia during
 1990. Current Czechoslovak law does not prohibit, authorize,
 or attempt to regulate strike activity. Generally, strikes
 were resolved by informal discussions between worker and
 enterprise representatives, often attended by local or
 national government officials.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Current Czechoslovak law does not expressly prohibit antiunion
 discrimination by employers against union members and trade
 union organizers. Nor does current law provide a realistic
 legal framework under which collective bargaining might take
 place. The Ministry of Labor, in consultation with labor
 union representatives, is developing a draft labor code. With
 the assistance of the ILO, the Government plans to revise some
 200 laws within the next 2 years and introduce new legislation
 .on collective bargaining and tripartitism. A package of new
 labor laws was passed in early December, effective January 1,
 1991. The ILO's Conference Committee on the Application of
 Standards in its 1990 report judged Czechoslovakia as a "case
 of progress" for making changes in its laws and practice.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor in Czechoslovakia. Forced labor is
 not explicitly prohibited by law but is implicitly prohibited
 by legal provisions concerning the deprivation of personal
 liberty. The Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs
 confirms that the parasitism provision has been removed from
 the criminal code.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 16, although
 younger persons may accept part-time employment. The law is
 effectively enforced by the Slovak and Czech Offices of Labor
 Safety.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Ministry of Labor establishes mandatory minimum wage rates
 based upon general occupational categories. Workers appear to
 be able to secure minimally acceptable standards of living for
 themselves and their families based on these wage scales. The
 lowest established wage is about $65 per month, but virtually
 all workers earn considerably more.
 Working conditions appear generally acceptable. A maximum
 standard legal workweek of 43 hours is provided by law, and
 overtime is limited to 150 hours per calendar year, although
 various exceptions to this standard exist. Workers are
 legally entitled to a minimum of 3 weeks of vacation.
 Under the Communist regime, less attention was paid to
 occupational safety and health than in most advanced
 industrial economies. Industrial equipment that is obsolete
 
 
 1131
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 by Western standards complicates the efforts of the new
 Government to improve occupational safety and health
 conditions. The present Labor Code contains provisions
 concerning occupational health and safety which are enforced
 by the Slovak and Czech Offices of Labor Safety and by the
 Federal Office of Standards and Measurement. They are
 attempting to update health and safety standards and to
 correct past enforcement and other deficiencies.
