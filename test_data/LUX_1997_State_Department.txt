 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary form
 of government. The role of the Grand Duke is mainly ceremonial and administra-
 tive. The Prime Minister is the leader of the dominant party in the popularly elected
 Parliament. The Council of State, whose members are appointed by the Grand
 Duke, serves as an advisory body to the Parliament. The judiciary is independent.
 The Government effectively controls the security apparatus, which consists of po-
 lice and gendarmerie.
 Luxenbourg has a prosperous market economy with active industrial and service
 sectors. The standard of living and level of social benefits are high.
 The Constitution and laws provide for the full range of human rights, and the
 Government respects these rights in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 
 
 1180
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. The Government per-
 mits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 Judicial warrants are required by law for arrests except in cases of hot pursuit.
 Within 24 hours of arrest the police must lodge charges and bring suspects before
 a judge. Suspects are not held incommunicado. They are given immediate access to
 an attorney, at government expense for indigents. The presiding judge may order
 release on bail.
 Exile is never imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The independent judiciary is headed by the Supreme Court, whose members are
 appointed by the Grand Duke. Defendants are presumed innocent. They have the
 right to public trial and are free to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence.
 Either the defendant or the prosecutor can appeal a ruling; appeal results in a com-
 pletely new judicial procedure, with the possibility that a sentence may be increased
 or decreased.
 In response to a 1995 decision by the European Court of Human Rights, the Gov-
 ernment established on January 1 an administrative court system to review citizen
 challenges to legislation.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and of
 the -press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Print media are
 privately owned. Television broadcasting rights, previously held exclusively by the
 privately owned national radio and television company, were extended in 1997 to
 a regional cable television company. The Government issues licenses to private radio
 stations. Radio and television broadcasts from neighboring countries are freely
 .available.
 Academic freedom is fully respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is no state religion, but the State
 pays the salaries of Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish clergy, and several
 local governments maintain sectarian religious facilities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 Inpractice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government
 provides first asylum and granted it to three persons in 1996. The Government has
 granted permanent resident status to 1,374 persons from the former Yugoslavia who
 enjoyed temporary protected status and expects to process 100 more applications.
 A total of 37 persons -returned to the former Yugoslavia voluntarily, and 4 were or-
 dered to leave after criminal convictions. The Government does not expel those hav-
 ing a valid claim to refugee status; there were no reports of the forced return of
 persons to countries where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Luxembourg is a multiparty democracy. Suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years
 of age and above, and balloting is secret. National parliamentary elections are held
 every 5 years.
 Women are active in political life. Of 60 Members of Parliament, 11 are women,
 as are 3 members of the Cabinet. The mayors of several major municipalities, in-
 cluding the capital, are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction. Government offi-
 cials are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 
 
 1181
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits racial, sexual, or social discrimination, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions. Blatant societal discrimination occurs only rarely.
 Women.-Neither society nor the Government is tolerant of violence against
 women, and the Government prosecutes persons accused of such. The Government
 funds organizations providing shelter, counseling, and hot lines. The main women's
 shelter in 1996 providd refuge to 189 women, many with their children, and re-
 sponded to over 3,000 telephone calls. Of the sheltered women, 67 reported sexual
 abuse. It is estimated that about 150 to 200 cases of sexual abuse occur per year.
 Women enjoy the same property rights as men. In the absence of a prenuptial
 agreement, property is divided equally upon dissolution of a marriage.
 The law mandates equal pay for equal work. To date there have been no work-
 related discrimination suits. Women constitute 36.8 percent of the work force (1996
 data). The Ministry for the Promotion of Women has a mandate to encourage a cli-
 mate of equal treatment and opportunity in fact as well as in law.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care, which are available equally to girls and boys. The law mandates school attend-
 ance from the ages of 4 to 16. Schooling is free through the secondary level, and
 the Government provides some financial assistance for postsecondary education.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children. Child abuse does
 not appear to be widespread, and laws against it are enforced. In 1996 the main
 pediatric hospital dealt with approximately 260 cases of suspected child abuse, not
 all of which were substantiated. A hot line maintained by a nonprofit organization
 received 923 telephone calls in 1996 from children and youths in distress. The police
 established a new hot line for reporting child abuse and commenced a child abuse
 awareness campaign for children. A shelter for girls who are victims of sexual abuse
 opened in January.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 emploent, education, or in the prvision of other state services. The law does not
 directly mandate accessibility for the disabled, but the Government pays subsidies
 to builders to construct "disabled-friendly" structures. Despite government incen-
 tives, only a modest proportion of buildings and public transportation have been
 modified to accommodate people with disabilities.
 The Government helps disabled persons obtain employment and professional edu-
 cation. By law, businesses ad enterprises with at least 25 employees must fill a
 quota for hiring disabled workers an must pay them prevailing wages. The quota
 is fixed according to the total number of employees, and employers who do not fulfill
 them are subject to sizable monthly fines. There have been no known complaints
 of noncompliance.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although foreigners constitute over 30 per-
 cent of the total population, antiforeigner incidents remain infrequent. The Govern-
 ment granted to citizens of European Union countries who reside in Luxembourg
 the right to vote and run in municipal elections. Minimum residency requirements
 are 6 years for voters and 12 years, including 6 months residence in the commune,
 for candidates to run for town councils. The Government-supported nonprofit
 "League Against Racism" organized community education and awareness projects in
 conjunction with the 1997 European Year Against Racism.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the right to associate freelyand
 choose their representatives. About 65 percent of the labor force is unionized. Mem-
 bership is not mandatory. Unions operate free of governmental interference. The
 two lareat labor federations are linked to, but organized independently of, major
 political parties. The law prohibits discrimination against strike leaders, and a labor
 tribunal deals with complaints.
 The Constitution provides all workers with the right to strike, except for govern-
 ment workers such as police, armed forces, and hospital personnel providing essen-
 tial services. Legal strikes may occur only after a lengthy conciliation procedure be-
 tween the parties; the Government's National Conciliation Office must certify that
 conciliation efforts have ended for a strike to be legal. There were no legal strikes
 during the year, and there have been no illegal strikes since 1979.
 Unions maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for and pro-
 tects collective bargaining, which is conducted in periodic negotiations between cen-
 tralized organizations of unions and employers. Enterprises having 15 or more em-
 ployees must have worker representatives to conduct collective bargaining. Enter-
 
 
 1182
 prises with over 150 employees must form joint works councils composed of equal
 numbers of management and employee representatives. In enterprises with more
 than 1,000 employees, one-third of the membership of the supervisory boards of di-
 rectors must be employee representatives.
 The law provides for adjudication of employment-related complaints and author-
 izes labor tribunals to deal with them. A tribunal can impose a fine on an employer
 found guilty of antiunion discrimination, but it cannot require the employer to rein-
 state a worker fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor by children and adults, and it is not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces thisprohibition effec-
 tively. The law prohibits employment of children under the age of 16 and requires
 all children to remain in school until the age of 16. Aprentices who are 16 years
 old must attend school in addition to their job training. Public education is free and
 universal through the secondary level.
 Adolescent workers under the age of 18 have additional legal protection, including
 limits on overtime and the number of hours that can be worked continuously. The
 Ministries of Labor and Education effectively monitor the enforcement of child labor
 and education laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law provides for minimum wage rates at
 levels that vary according to the worker's age and number of dependents. The mini-
 mum wage for a single worker over the age of 18 is approximately $7.05 (Lux F
 259) e    our. upporting a family is difficult on the minmum wage, but most em-
 ployees earn more than the minimum.
 The law mandates a workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required for overtime
 or unusual hours. Employment on Sunday is permitted in continuous-process indus-
 tries (steel, glass, and chemicals), and for certain maintenance and securityperson-
 nel; other industries have requested permission for Sunday work, which the Govern-
 ment has granted on a case-by-case basis. Work on Sunday, allowed for some retail
 employees, must be entirely voluntary and compensated at double the normal wage;
 and employees must be given compensatory time off on another day, equal to the
 number of hours worked on Sunday. The law requires rest breaks for shift workers
 and limits all workers to a maximum of 10 hours per day including overtime. All
 workers receive at least 5 weeks of paid vacation yearly, in addition to paid holi-
 e law mandates a safe working environment. An inspection system provides se-
 vere penalties for infractions. The Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor, and
 the Accident Insurance Agency of the Social Security Ministry, carry out their in-
 spections effectively.
 No laws or regulations specifically guarantee workers the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment,
 but every worker has the right to ask the Labor Inspectorate to make a determina-
 tion, and the Inspectorate usually does so expeditiously.
 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
 The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which became independent following
 the breakup of Yugoslavia, is a parliamentary democracy led by a coalition govern-
 ment. It has a popularly elected president. International monitors judged its second
 multiparty elections in 1994 to be generally free and fair despite numerous proce-
 dural irregularities. The judiciary is generally independent.
 The Ministry of Interior oversees a security apparatus that includes uniformed po-
 lice, criminal police, border police, and the state intelligence service. Municipal po-
 lice chiefs are responsible to the Ministry of Interior, not to municipal leaders. The
 Ministry is under the control of a civilian minister; a parliamentary commission
 oversees operations. The Ministry of Defense shares with the border police respon-
 sibility for border security. Some members of the police on occasion were responsible
 for human rights abuses.
 Historically, Macedonia was the least prosperous of the Yugoslav republics. Its
 economy was closely tied to the other repubilics, especially Serbia. Conflict in the re-
 gion and sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, along with the problems of
 transition to a market economy, led to severe economic difficulties. A Greek trade
 embargo imposed in 1994, in a dispute over the country's name, flag, and Constitu-
 tion was lifted in 1995 following the signing of an interim accord between the two
 
 
 1183
 countries. Trade sanctions against Serbia were suspended following conclusion of
 the Dayton Accords also in 1995. In the circumstances of these two border closures,
 gross domestic product fell an estimated 50 percent. Growth resumed during 1996
 with a slight increase in industrial production, according to government figures.
 Growth in 1997 was approximately 2 to 3 percent. Official unemployment, which
 has been very high for several years, is 32 percent, although the gray economy is
 large. Some workers routinely receive their salaries several months late.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. Three people were-killed in a clash between po-
 lice and ethnic Albanian demonstrators in July. Over 200 persons were injured in
 the demonstration; a parliamentary commission is investigating charges that secu-
 rity forces used excessive force. The Government took no judicial or disciplinary ac-
 tion against the police. There were credible reports of occasional police abuse of pris-
 oners and police harassment of political opponents of the Government. A police prac-
 tice of compelling citizens to appear for questioning at police stations continued, de-
 spite government claims that the practice had ended pursuant to a new law. Vio-
 lence and discrimination against women remain problems.
 Minorities, including ethnic Albanians, ethnic Turks, and ethnic Serbs, raised var-
 ious allegations of human rights infringements and discrimination. Ethnic minori-
 ties made progress in securing more representation in state institutions, although
 ethnic Macedonians continue to hold a disproportionate number of positions. Ethnic
 Albanian representation in several government ministries has risen from less than
 2 percent in 1990 to levels in the 7 to 12 percent range. Ethnic minorities are still
 poorly represented in the police and the civilian component of the Ministry of De-
 fense.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Three people were killed in a clash
 between police and demonstrators in July. The demonstrators, most of whom were
 members of the ethnic Albanian minority, were protesting the Government's re-
 moval in the early dawn hours of July 9 of Albanian and Turkish national flags
 from municipal buildings in the towns of Gostivar and Tetovo. The Constitutional
 Court had previously ordered the Government to remove the flags because they dis-
 regarded state sovereignty. The Government responded to the court order with a
 new law that permitted the flying of foreign flags at municipal buildings on national
 holidays. The new law protected the private display of foreign flags at all times.
 When police enforced the Constitutional Court order and removed the Albanian and
 Turkish flags from the municipal building in Gostivar, crowds gathered during the
 morning of July 9. Throughout the day, tension mounted between the police and
 demonstrators, until violence erupted in the afternoon. Demonstrators reportedly
 broke through police lines. Police, reinforced by armored personnel carriers, pushed
 the crowd back using tear gas. Shooting between the police and demonstrators broke
 out, and demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones at the police. Three eth-
 nic Albanians were killed and just over 200 were injured. Seven police officers were
 injUred.
 The Government has not yet held anyone responsible for the three deaths nor for
 apparently indiscriminate police beatings, some documented by journalists' videos
 that may identify the offending police officers. A report on the incident drafted by
 the Ministry of Interior focused on the provocative acts that led to the violence, not
 on possible police misconduct. A parliamentary commission was convened in October
 to investigate the Gostivar events. Its mandate is to determine whether or not police
 used excessive force. The commission is expected to report to the full Parliament,
 which could then recommend disciplinary action for officials it finds responsible. The
 Ministry of Interior has taken no action in the meantime to discipline any police
 officers.
 The investigation into the 1995 car bomb attack on President Gligorov continued
 but produced no results.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment and pumshment. However, during the
 demonstration in Gostivar on July 9, police used excessive force in attacking and
 beating demonstrators, including some who offered no resistance (see Section L.a.).
 International observers witnessed the police beating children.
 Police also occasionally used excessive force following the arrest of criminal sus-
 pects. Police allegedly beat a number of ethnic Albanians early in the year (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 
 
 1184
 
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards and the government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution states that a person
 must be arraigned in court within 24 hours of arrest and sets the maximum dura-
 tion of detention pending trial at 90 days. The accused is entitled to contact a law-
 yer at the time of arrest and to have a lawyer present during police and court pro-
 ceedings. According to human rights observers and criminal defense attorneys, po-
 lice sometimes violate the 24-hour requirement and deny immediate access to an at-
 torney. Although the law requires warrants for arrests, this prvision is sometimes
 ignored, and the warrant issued only some time after the arrest. Incommunicado de-
 tention is not practiced.
 There were no confirmed reports of arbitrary arrest, but there were credible re-
 ports that the Government continued the practice of compelling citizens to appear
 at police stations through an "invitation" for so-called "informative talks." Although
 a law on criminal procedures was passed in March stating that police cannot force
 citizens to appear for these sessions without presentation of a court order, there
 were credible reports that the practice continued.
 Ethnic Albanian political leaders reported early in the year that their supporters
 were picked up by police on the streets or at their places of work, held for up to
 24 hours, and interrogated about their political activities and those of their parties.
 A number of those detained were allegedly beaten by police and deprived of sleep,
 food, and water.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice, although the court
 system is still developing and is sometimes inefficient and slow. The outcomes of
 a small number of cases were suspected of being influenced from outside the judici-
 The court system is three tiered, comprising municipal courts, district courts, and
 a Supreme Court. A Constitutional Court deals with matters of constitutional inter-
 pretation.
 Human rights activists are beginning to use the judicial system to further their
 aims. The Constitutional Court has a mandate to protect the human rights of citi-
 zens but has not taken action in any case in this area. In February Parliament
 passed a law establishing the Office of a People's Ombudsman to defend citizen's
 constitutional and legal rights. An Ombudsman was appointed in July, and the of-
 fice began operating late in the year.
 Trials are presided over by judes a pointed by the Republican Judicial Council
 (an independent agency) and confirmedby Parliament. The judges are assisted by
 two members of the community who serve essentially as consulting jurors, although
 the judge has the final word. Court hearings and the rendering of verdicts are open
 to the public except in some cases, such as those involving minors and those in
 which the persnal safety of the defendant is concerned. Trials cannot be televised,
 pursuant to the criminal procedure code, although the court can in certain cases au-
 thorize the presence of television and film cameras. In several high-profile cases this
 year, trials were easily accessible to international observers.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. The two persons jailed in 1996 in con-
 nection with the Tetovo University riots were released during the year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Several daily newspapers are published in Skopje, as well as numerous weekly
 or periodical political and other publications. Most towns and municipalities have
 local papers. Government-subsidized newspapers in the Albanian and Turkish lan-
 guages are published and distributed nationally by the leading news publishing
 house. Some other newspapers and magazines are subsidized by the Government.
 Several privately-owned publications have a wide distribution throughout the coun-
 try; some are considered to be oriented towards opposition political parties. The
 media that remain partially state owned are government oriented but do report op-
 position press conferences and statements and in general provide coverage of the
 major opposition parties.
 After privatization, the leading newspaper publisher is still partially government
 owned and controls one of only two modern, high-speed printing facilities in the
 country, as well as most newspaper kiosks. Opposition parties allege that govern-
 
 
 1185
 ment control and manipulation of the media prevent them from getting their mes-
 sage across. The introduction of competition in the print media resulted in increased
 investigative reporting in the country and a livelier tone, particularly in regard to
 several financial and investment scandals during the year. Competition also re-
 sulted in price reduction and increased circulation.
 Distributors of foreign newspapers and magazines must obtain permission of the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1997 all such requests were approved. Foreign news-
 papers, including those from neighboring countries, are available throughout the
 country.
 There were several incidents in which journalists were threatened or attacked by
 the targets of their criticism. In one incident, four individuals were charged with
 misdemeanor offenses after they confronted and threatened the manager of a pri-
 vate television station.
 There are dozens of small commercial radio and television broadcasters through-
 out the country. A new law on broadcasting was passed in April, creating a Broad-
 casting Council to issue licenses and bring some order to the currently crowded air-
 waves. The broadcast law directs that broadcast fees collected through individual
 electric bills subsidize both state-run Macedonian radio and television and the main-
 tenance of infrastructure for other public and commercial broadcasting. There is
 concern that new broadcast license fees may price small and medium sized stations
 out of the market. Individual satellite dishes are unregulated and plentiful through-
 out the country. Cable television is growing.
 Individuals and opposition political groups may criticize the Government publicly
 without reprisal. The media do not appear to practice self-censorship due to fear of
 government reprisal. The Government does not censor books and other publications,
 nor does it censor films.
 The Government respects academic freedom. Because higher education is not
 available in the Albanian language except for teacher training, some ethnic Alba-
 nians claim that they do not have complete academic freedom. They want to see the
 unauthorized Tetovo university gain legal status so that they can study in their
 mother tongue (see Section 5).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 Advance notification of large meetings is optional, and opposition rallies occur regu-
 larly without major incident. A July protest demonstration by ethnic Albanians in
 Gostivar turned violent, and 3 persons were killed and some 200 injured (see Sec-
 tions L.a. and 1.c.).
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. Political parties and organizations are required to reg-
 ister. More than 40 political parties are registered, including ethnically based par-
 ties of Albanians, Turks, Serbs, and Roma. However, A new Albanian party was not
 able to register due to an ongoing judicial proceeding.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution specifically provides for freedom of reli-
 gion for the Macedonian Orthodox Church and other religious communities and
 groups and the Government generally does not interfere with the practice of reli-
 gion. While only the Macedonian Orthodox Church is mentioned by name in the
 Constitution, it does not enjoy official status.
 The Parliament adopted a new law on religious communities and groups in July.
 The law designates the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Islamic community, and
 the Roman Catholic Church as "religious groups" while all other religions are des-
 ignated "religious communities." Some religious leaders voiced concerns about the
 impact of the new law, although its effects were not fully apparent by the end of
 the year. The law requires, for example, that anyone carrying out religious work
 and religious rites be registered with the Commission on Interreligious Relations.
 By year's end, over 20 religious groups and communities were registered. The law
 also stipulates that religious instruction can only be carried out in public spaces
 where religious services are held and that foreigners who wish to conduct religious
 services must obtain a permit from the Commission before they enter the country.
 Protestant groups continued to complain that they could not register their church-
 es and obtain regular employment status for employees and that on several occa-
 sions they have been prevented from holding religious meetings in venues outside
 churches.
 The refusal of the Serbian Orthodox Church to recognize the independence of the
 Macedonian Orthodox Church has led to difficulties for ethnic Serbs who wish to
 worship in their own church. On a number of occasions the Government refused
 Serbian Orthodox priests permission to enter the country and apparently plans to
 continue doing so until the Serbian Church recognizes the Macedonian Church.
 
 
 1186
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are permitted free movement within the country as well as the
 right to leave and return. These rights may be restricted for security, public health,
 and safety reasons but are fully respected in practice.
 The law on citizenship is highly restrictive, requiring, for example, 15 years of
 residence for citizenship. This has left some people who were living legally in the
 country at the time of independence without citizenship. The law particularly affects
 ethnic Albanians who had moved to the country from other parts of Yugoslavia be-
 fore independence. As citizens of the predecessor state living legally in the territory
 of the country at the time of independence, they believe that they have a right to
 citizenship.
 Some Albanian political leaders also charge that Ministry of Interior officials re-
 sponsible for making citizenship determinations discriminate against Albanian ap-
 plicants. The officials are said to make more demanding documentary requirements
 and to act on applications slowly. There were also plausible charges that officials
 demanded bribes in return for a favorable decision. There is some truth to these
 charges, but citizenship problems also have affected many ethnic Macedonians and
 others.
 Ethnic Albanians comprise a disproportionately high number of emigrants, due to
 stronger familial ties outside the country and longstanding economic relationships
 in other countries.
 The Government cooperated with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. It
 continued to provide protective status to several thousand refugees from Bosnia and
 Herzegovina but ceased admitting new claimants, except for those with close family
 ties to the country, as of mid-1993. The Government granted admission to several
 hundred ethnic Macedonians from Albania in March and April, when domestic order
 in Albania broke down.
 There were no reports of persons seeking first asylum or of the forced return of
 persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 The Government is extremely concerned about the flow of economic migrants and
 other illegal migrants from neighboring Albania. Illegal migration flows increased
 following the domestic upheaval in Albania, including persons thought to be traffick-
 ing in illegal goods. If illegal migrants were caught, they were deported. Over 60
 armed incidents occurred during the year on the border, several of which were vio-
 lent confrontations between police and armed illegal migrants. Several incidents re-
 sulted in the deaths of the Albanian migrants, and one resulted in the death of a
 police captain.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens elected a President by popular vote for the first time in 1994 and at the
 same time chose a new Parliament in the second multiparty elections in the coun-
 trys postwar history, the first since independence. Opposition grou ps charged the
 Government with massive fraud, but international monitors found the elections to
 be generally free and fair despite widespread irregularities attributed largely to poor
 organization. Local elections in November 1996 were found by foreign monitors to
 be a considerable improvement over 1994; the governing party won a plurality of
 the vote. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for 1998.
 The unicameral Parliament governs the country. The Prime Minister, as head of
 government, is selected by the party or coalition that can produce a majority in the
 Parliament. He and the other ministers may not be Members of Parliament. The
 Prime Minister is formally appointed by the President, who is head of state, Chair-
 man of the Security Council, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
 Although no formal restrictions exist on the participation of women in politics and
 government, they are severely underrepresented in these areas. Only 1 of 20 cabinet
 ministers is a woman, and only 4 of 120 Members of Parliament are women.
 Minorities, including ethnic Albanians, ethnic Turks, ethnic Serbs, and Roma,
 have political parties to represent their interests. Minorities nevertheless com-
 plained that the political structures were biased against them. Some ethnic Alba-
 nians claim that Albanian-majority districts had far more voters than ethnic Mac-
 edonian ones, thus violating the "one-person, one-vote" principle. There is some
 merit to this complaint, but the coalition partner ethnic Albanian party was closely
 consulted by the Government during a redistricting of the country's municipalities
 in 1996 and obtained changes in the law that it sought. Some ethnic Albanians also
 complain that alleged discrimination against them in citizenship decisions effec-
 tively disenfranchises a large portion of their community (see Section 2.d.).
 
 
 1187
 Ethnic minority Members of Parliament include 19 Albanians, 2 Roma, 1 Serb,
 and 1 Turk. There are five cabinet ministers from ethnic minorities, all ethnic Alba-
 nians.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups and ethnic community representatives meet freely with for-
 eign representatives without government interference. A forum for human rights ex-
 ists and operates freely. The Government allows independent missions by foreign
 observers but objects to being included in the mandates of human rights observers
 for the former Yugoslavia, particularly the Special Rapporteur from the United Na-
 tion's Human Rights Commission. In October the Special Rapporteur recommended
 that the Commission remove the country from her mandate, although she asked
 that she retain the right to comment on developments until the commission's next
 session. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe maintains a mon-
 itoring mission in the country with the support and cooperation of the Government.
 The Government is generally responsive to the concerns of human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens regardless of their sex,
 race, color of skin, national or social origin, political or religious beliefs, property,
 or social status. However, societal discrimination against ethnic minorities and the
 protection of women's rights are problems.
 Women.-Violence against women, especially in the family setting, is common.
 Criminal procedures are available for victims of rape, but no legal recourse exists
 in the case of spousal rape. Cultural norms discourage the reporting of such vio-
 lence, and criminal charges on grounds of domestic violence are very rare. Public
 concern about violence against women is not evident in the media, although some
 women's groups are working to raise awareness of the issue. Shelters for victims
 of spusal abuse are operated by nongovernmental organizations. A hot line remains
 open, but its hours are limited.
 The trafficking of women and girls for prostitution and pornography is becoming
 a problem.
 The sexual harassment of women in the workplace is a problem. Maternity bene-
 fits are good, with 9-months paid maternity leave. Women also retain for 2 years
 the right to return to their jobs.
 The Constitution provides that women possess the same legal rights as men. Mac-
 edonian society, in both the Muslim and Christian communities, is patriarchal, and
 the advancement of women into nontraditional roles is limited. Women are severely
 underrepresented in the higher levels of the private sector, although some profes-
 sional women are prominent. Women from some parts of the ethnic Albanian com-
 munity do not have equal opportunities for employment and education, primarily
 due to traditional and religious constraints on their full participation in society. Eth-
 nic Albanian girls are underrepresented in primary and secondary school.
 Women's advocacy groups include the Humanitarian Association for the Emanci-
 p ation, Solidarity, and Equality of Women, the Union of Associations of Macedonian
 omen, and the League of Albanian Women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the rights and welfare of children but
 in some areas is limited by resource constraints. Education is compulsory through
 the eighth grade, or to the ages of 15 or 16. At both the primary and secondary lev-
 els, girls in some ethnic Albanian communities are underrepresented in schools. The
 Government encouraged ethnic minority students, particularly girls, to enroll in sec-
 ondary schools. Medical care for children is adequate but hampered by the general
 difficult economic circumstances of the country and the weak medical system.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.--Social programs to meet the needs of the disabled exist
 to the extent that government resources allow. Discrimination on the basis of dis-
 ability is forbidden by law. There are no laws or regulations mandating accessibility
 for disabled persons.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of 2.2 million is composed of
 a variety of national and ethnic groups, mainly Macedonians, Albanians, Turks,
 Roma, Serbs, and Vlachs. All citizens are equal under the law. The Constitution pro-
 vides for the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identity of
 minorities, including state support for education in minority languages through sec-
 ondary school and the official use of ethnic minority languages in areas where eth-
 nic minorities make up a majority of the population.

 Ethnic tensions and prejudices are present in society. The Government is commit-
 ted to a policy of peaceful integration of all ethnic groups into society but faces polit-
 ical resistance and the persistence of popular prejudices.
 Parts of the political opposition object to even modest steps to meet the needs of
 ethnic minorities. The principal example of opposition attitudes came in February,
 with protest demonstrations following the Government's approval of teacher train-
 ing classes in the Albanian language.
 Representatives of the ethnic Albanian community, by far the largest minority
 group with 22.9 percent of the population according to government statistics, are the
 most vocal in charging discrimination. Underrepresentation of Albanians in the
 military and police is a major grievance of the community. Even in areas dominated
 by ethnic Albanians, the police force remains overwhelmingly ethnic Macedonian.
 The Ministiy of Interior says that the police force as a whole is only 4 percent Alba-
 mian. To raise this figure, the Ministry introduced in 1992-93 a quota of enrolling
 apercent minorities at the police secondary school, although attrition has meant
 Sraduating classes are not proportionately represented. Albanian leaders allege
 that tere is continued discrimination against those who do apply.
 The military has achieved some success in its efforts to recruit and retain minor-
 ity officers and cadets. Military service is a universal male obligation, and most
 -young men, whatever their ethnic origin, answer their conscription notices. The pro-
 portion of Albanians in the ranks is now estimated at 25 percent. There are fewer
 Albanians in the officer corps, but some progress is being made in this area as well.
 Eight percent of junior officers are from ethnic minorities, while 14 percent of new
 cadets at the military academy are from ethnic minorities. Just over 8 percent of
 the civilian employees are from ethnic minorities; ethnic Albanians constitute only
 2.9 percent of Ministry of Defense civilians. The deputy minister of defense and one
 of eight general officers are ethnic Albanians.
 The Constitution provides for primary and secondary education in the languages
 of the ethnic minorities. Primary education is available in Macedonian, Albanian,
 Turkish, and Serbian. Albanian-language education is a crucial issue for the ethnic
 Albanian community; it is seen as vita for preserving Albanian heritage and cul-
 ture. Almost all ethnic Albanian children receive 8 years of education in Albanian-
 language schools. The number of ethnic minority students who receive secondary
 education in their mother tongues is increasing, and was 13 percent during the
 year, up from 10 percent in the previous school year. Still, less than 40 percent of
 primary students go on to high school, partly because of the lack of available classes
 h Albanian at the secondary level anpartly because the traditional nature of Al-
 banian society leads many families in rural areas to see no need to educate their
 children, especially girls, b~eyond the eighth gade.
 The Government's response to ethnic Abanian demands for greater access to
 higher education has been to ease admission requirements for minorities at the uni-
 versities in Skopje and Bitola for up to 10 percent of entering places, a quota that
 increased to 23 percent in the 1996-97 school year. The percentage of ethnic Alba-
 nian students at Skopje university rose from 4 pei'cent in 1992 to 7.25 percent dur-
 ing the year. In January Parliament passed a government-drafted law ta rovides
 for Albanian lan yae university education for students at Skopje University's
 teacher training faculty who study to teach in Albanian-language primary and sec-
 ondary schools. An obstacle to increasing university attendance of ethnic Albanians
 is their low but increasing enrollment in secondary schools, especially among girls.
 Demands for the legalization of an unofficial Albanian-language university in
 Tetovo during 1995 led to a violent clash between demonstrators and police in which
 one ethnic Albanian died and about 30 people were injured. Since then the Govern-
 ment has tacitly allowed the university-which it still considers to be illegal-to
 function without giving it any official recognition.
 The Government has not sup       ed three other demands of some ethnic Albanian
 leaders that would require pariamentary approval: use of the Albanian language
 in dealings with the central government and Parliament, relaxing citizenship laws
 that now require 15 years of legal residence (see Section 2.d.), and official use of
 the Albanian flag.
 Ethnic Turks, who comprise about 4 percent of the population, also complain of
 governmental, societal, and cultural discrimination. Their main complaints center
 on Turkish-languag education and media. One continuing dispute has been over
 the desire of parents who consider themselves Turkish to educate their children in
 Turkish despite the fact that they do not speak Turkish at home. The Education
 Ministry reuses to provide Turkish-language education for them, noting that the
 Constitution provides for education in the mother tonges, not a foreign language.
 The parents have banded together to hire teachers of their own, but this kind of
 private education is not legally authorized.

 Ethnic Serbs, who comprise about 2 percent of the population, also complained
 about discrimination, alleged censorship of the Serbian press, and their inability to
 worship freely in the Serbian Orthodox Church.
 Little tension is evident between the Roma and other citizens of the country, al-
 though Roma tend to occupy the lowest economic rung of society. In 1996 optional
 education in the Romani language started at four elementary schools, although
 there has been no call for a full curriculum. There are two Roma Members of Par-
 liament. There is some Romani-language broadcasting.
 There are also a number of Macedonian Muslims and Bosnian Muslims in the
 country. Some Macedonian Muslims contend that they are identified too closely with
 ethnic Albanians, most of whom are also Muslim, with whose policies the Macedo-
 nian Muslims disagree.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to
 form trade unions. There are restrictions on this right for military members, police,
 and civil servants.
 Independent trade unions have been allowed to organize since 1992, when an As-
 sociation of Independent and Autonomous Unions was formed. There is still a na-
 tional trade union, however. The Confederation of Trade Unions of Macedonia is the
 successor organization to the old Communist labor confederation. It maintains the
 assets of the old unions and is the Government's main negotiating partner, along
 with the Chamber of Economy, on labor issues. While its officers may tend to oppose
 strikes because of the legacy of the past, they appear to be genuinely independent
 of the Government and committed to the interests of the workers they represent.
 Independent unions held a number of brief strikes in 1997, including a strike of
 railway workers and strikes by factory workers. These were undertaken mainly by
 employees of state-owned companies, some of which were shedding workers in the
 process of privatization and delaying their pay by up to several months. Strikes
 were also organized by the teachers' union and a doctors' union, primarily to protest
 low wages and poor working conditions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution implicitly
 recognizes employees' right to bargain collectively, a concept nevertheless still in its
 infancy. Legislation in this area has yet to be passed by Parliament.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Legal prohibitions against forced
 labor, including that performed by children, are observed in practice.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The con-
 stitutional minimum age for employment of children is 15 years. The law prohibits
 forced or bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively (see Section 6.c.). Children may not legally work nights and are permitted
 to work 42-hour weeks. Education is compulsory through grade eight, or to the ages
 of 15 or 16. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is responsible for enforcing
 laws regulating the employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The average monthly wage in September was
 about $170 (9,088 Denars). The minimum wage is, by law, two-thirds of the average
 wage. By comparison, an average basket of food for a family of four cost $174 (9,287
 Denars). This economic situation meant that few workers could support a family on
 their wages alone and had to take on additional work in the gray market or draw
 on savings.
 Yugoslavia had extensive laws concerning acceptable conditions of work, including
 an official 42-hour workweek with a minimum 24-hour rest period and generous va-
 cation and sick leave benefits. The country adopted many of these provisions, includ-
 ing the workweek and rest period. Proposals to reform the welfare system in order
 to reduce government expenditures were severely criticized by the public and with-
 drawn. The Constitution provides for safe working conditions, temporary disability
 compensation, and leave benefits. Although there are laws and regulations on work-
 er safety remaining from the Yugoslav era, credible reports suggest that they are
 not strictly enforced. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is responsible for en-
 forcing regulations pertaining to working conditions.
 If workers have safety concerns, employers are supposed to address dangerous sit-
 uations. Should they fail to do so, employees may leave the dangerous situation
 without losing their jobs.
