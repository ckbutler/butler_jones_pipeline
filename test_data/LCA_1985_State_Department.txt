 ST. LUCIA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, St. Lucia has a
 multiparty parliamentary democracy. The current Prime
 Minister, John Compton, was democratically elected in May 1982.
 Although political disruption marked the two years following
 independence from the United Kingdom, constitutional processes
 prevailed. Political stability has been enhanced by 4 years
 of economic growth, but high unemployment and a fragile
 economy remain sources of potential instability.
 The police are the only security force in St. Lucia. Its
 small Special Service Unit has received some paramilitary
 training, and participated in military manuevers with other
 nations of the region which are members of the Regional
 Security System. St. Lucia is also developing a coast guard.
 The nation's security forces are small but are imbued with
 traditions of integrity, professionalism, and respect for
 human rights.
 St. Lucia continues to have an excellent human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killing for political motives in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In December 1984, a murder suspect, Alphonsus Fontenard, died
 under questionable circumstances while in police custody. A
 government inquest concluded that the suspect was shot by
 police officers acting in self-defense.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution, which prohibits arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment, provides that persons arrested be brought before
 a court within 72 hours. The Government honors these
 provisions in practice. There were no reports of arbitrary
 arrests or other forms of detention or forced exile in 1985.
 The "Women and Young Persons Acts" prohibit forced or
 compulsory labor; the law is respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution mandates public trials before an independent
 and impartial court and guarantees the provision of legal
 counsel to indigents. Accused persons are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty. The regional West Indies Court of
 Appeal, long known for its impartiality, serves as St. Lucia's
 court of appeals.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional prohibitions against arbitrary search, seizure,
 and entry are observed by the authorities. There were no
 reports of arbitrary intrusion of the State into the private
 lives of individual citizens in 1985.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees of free speech and press are
 respected in practice. St. Lucia has two newspapers
 reflecting contrasting opinions. A television station:is
 privately owned and controlled. The Government owns and
 operates Radio St. Lucia, and a religious organization
 operates another radio station. The Government does not
 censor the news or communications media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no legal or practical restrictions on public
 meetings in St. Lucia. Political opposition groups organize
 and conduct activities freely.
 Workers have the right to form trade unions, to elect their
 officers, to conduct union activities free of government
 intervention, and to engage in collective bargaining. The
 right to strike exists in the private sector if
 government-sponsored efforts to resolve disputes fail. Trade
 unions represent the majority of wage and salary earners and
 play a prominent role in the nation's economic and political
 life.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination in St. Lucia. The
 majority of the population is Roman Catholic.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees these rights and they are
 generally honored in practice. The Government did not permit
 16 St. Lucian citizens to travel to Libya in 1983, on national
 security grounds. Alleging that the group was to receive
 terrorist training, the Government revoked their passports.
 It still holds the passports of several of the original
 sixteen, thus restricting their travel outside St. Lucia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Lucia has a parliamentary system of government under which
 citizens have a genuine choice of parties, policies, and
 officials. The nation's political life continues to be
 vigorous. Opposition parties play an active role in and out
 of Parliament, where they hold 3 of 17 seats. Parliamentary
 elections were last held in 1982 and by law must be held again
 before May 1987.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 International human rights bodies filed no reports or requests
 for investigations into human rights violations in 1985. The
 multidenominational St. Lucia Christian Council is the major
 domestic organization following human rights issues. Amnesty
 International did not mention St. Lucia in its 1985 report.
 Freedom House rates St. Lucia as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Half of St. Lucia's population of 122,000 is under 25 years of
 age. The 1985 population growth rate was 1.1 percent.
 Emigration elsewhere in the Caribbean, to the U.S., Canada,
 and the United Kingdom is high.
 The economy relies heavily on banana exports and subsistence
 agriculture. Bananas account for about 60 percent of the
 country's export earnings. The per capita gross national
 product (GNP) was estimated at US $962 per year in 1982.
 In an effort to expand secondary schooling, St. Lucia has
 channeled more than 20 percent of its total recurrent budget
 expenditures into education over the past 6 years. Education
 is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 15. The nation's
 elementary schools enroll 95 percent of those eligible, but
 shortages of facilities and classroom space limit secondary
 school enrollment. The literacy rate is estimated to be over
 75 percent.
 The national insurance scheme pays for most medical care;
 in-patient care at the general hospital is free of charge and
 97 percent of the population has access to health care centers
 within 3 miles of home.
 St. Lucia's infant mortality rate is 19.9 per 1,000 live
 births. Life expectancy at birth is approximately 69.8
 years. One-hundred percent of the population has access to
 safe water.
 The minimum legal working age in St. Lucia is 14. The
 workweek is 40 hours in 5 days and workers are guaranteed a
 minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks. Some of the provisions of
 an occupational safety law passed in 1985 are being disputed
 by labor unions. Although no minimum wage is established by
 law, a government-established Wage Council reviews wage rates
 in different sectors and makes recommendations which are
 generally accepted as having the force of law. The wages set
 by this procedure are arguably less than that on which a
 person can be reasonably expected to live.
 There are no legal restrictions on the role of women in St.
 Lucia. Although the more traditional household role is the
 predominant one for St. Lucian women, they are
 well-represented in government and the professions. As more
 women take advantage of public schooling and other government
 programs, the particpation of women in other sectors of
 society is expected to increase.
