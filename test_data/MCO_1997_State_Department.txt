 MONACO
 Monaco is a constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign Prince plays a lead-
 ing role in governing the country. The Prince appoints the four-member Govern-
 ment, headed by a Minister of State chosen by the Prince from a list of candidates
 proposed by France. The other three members are Counselors for the Interior (who
 is usually French), for Public Works and Social Affairs, and for Finance and the
 Economy. Each is responsible to the Prince. Legislative power is shared between the
 Prince and the popularly elected 18-member National Council. There are in addition
 three consultative bodies, whose members are appointed by the Prince: The 7-mem-
 ber Crown Council; the 12-member Counci      ap ; and the 30-member Economic
 Council, which includes representatives of employers and trade unions.
 In addition to the national police foce, the gCarabiniers du Prince" carry out se-
 curity functions. Both forces are controlled by government officials.
 The principal economic activities are services and banking, light manufacturing,
 and tourism.

 Individual human rights are provided for in the Constitution and respected in
 practice. The Constitution distinguishes between those rights that are provided for
 all residents and those that apply only to the approximately 5,000 who hold
 Monegasque nationality. The latter enjoy free education, financial assistance in case
 of unemployment or illness and the right to vote and hold elective office. Women
 traditionally have played a fess active role than men in public life, but this is chang-
 ing; women currently hold both elective and appointive offices.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the authorities respect this prohibi-
 tion. There were no reports of violations.
 Prison conditions meet or exceed minimum international standards, and the Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution bars arbitrary arrest.
 Arrest warrants are required, except when a suspect is arrested while committing
 an offense. The police must bringdetainees before a judge within 24 hours to be
 informed of the charges against them and of their rights under the law. Most de-
 tainees are released without bail, but the investigating magistrate may order deten-
 tion on grounds that the suspect might either flee or interfere with the investigation
 of the case. The magistrate may extend the initial 2-month detention for additional
 2-month periods indefinitely. Detainees have the right to counsel, at public expense
 if necessary. The magstrate may permit family members to see detainees.
 The Government does not forcibly exile its own nationals. However, it does some-
 times expel non-Monegasque nationals who are in violation of residency laws or who
 have committed minor offenses, such as disorderly conduct.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the 1962 Constitution, the Prince delegated
 his judicial powers to an independent judiciary. The law provides for a fair, public
 trial, and the authorities respect these provisions. The defendant has the right to
 be present and the right to counsel, at public expense if necessary. As under French
 law, a three-judge tribunal considers the evidence collected by the investigating
 magistrate and hears the arguments made by the prosecuting and defense attor-
 neys. The defendant enjoys a presumption of innocence and the right of appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the individual's right of privacy in personal and family life,
 at home, and in correspondence, and the Government respects these rights in prac-
 tice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including;
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of expression is provided for by the
 Constitution, and the authorities respect this right in practice. The Monegasque
 Penal Code, however, prohibits public denunciations of the ruling family, a regula-
 tion the media respect in practice. Several periodicals are published. Foreign news-
 papers and magazines circulate freely, including French journals that specifically
 cover news in the Principality. Foreign radio and television are received without re-
 striction. Stations that broadcast from the Principality operate in accordance with
 French and Italian regulations.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides citi-
 zens with the rights of peaceful assembly and association. Outdoor meetings require
 police authorization, which is not withheld for political or arbitrary reasons. Formal
 associations must be registered and authorized by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism is the state religion. The law pro-
 vides for the free practice of all religions, and the Government respects this right
 in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Residents move freely within the country and across its open borders
 with France. Monegasque nationals enjoy the rights of emigration and repatriation.
 They can be deprived of their nationality only for specified acts, including natu-
 ralization in a foreign state. Only the Prince can grant or restore Monegasque na-
 tionality, but he is obliged by the Constitution to consult the Crown Council on each
 case before deciding.
 
 
 1202
 The Government implements the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees. In light of its bilateral arrangements with France, the Govern-
 ment does not grant political asylum or refugee status unless the request also meets
 French criteria for such cases. The number of cases is very small. There were no
 reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Authority to change the Government and to initiate laws rests with the Prince.
 The 1962 Constitution cannot be suspended, but it can be revised by common agree-
 ment between the Prince and the elected National Council. The Prince plays an ac-
 tive role in government. He names the Minister of State (in effect, the Prime Min-
 ister) from a list of names proposed by the French Government. He names as well
 the three Counselors of Government (of whom the one responsible for the interior
 is usually a French national). Together the four constitute the government. Each is
 responsible to the Prince.
 Only the Prince may initiate legislation, but the 18-member National Council may
 propose legislation to the government. All legislation and the adoption of the budget
 require the Council's assent. Elections for National Council members, which are
 held every 5 years, are based on universal adult suffrage and secret balloting. Both
 political parties are currently represented on the Council. There is one independent
 member.
 The Constitution provides for three consultative bodies. The seven-member Crown
 Council (composed exclusively of Monegasque nationals) must be consulted by the
 Prince on certain questions of national importance. He may choose to consult it on
 other matters as well. The 12-member Council of State advises the Prince on pro-
 posed legislation and regulations. The 30-member Economic Council advises the gov-
 ernment on social, financial, and economic questions. One-third of its members come
 from the trade union movement, and one-third from the employers' federation.
 Women are active in public service. The Mayor of Monaco, one member of the
 Crown Council, a member of the National Council, and three members of the Eco-
 nomic Council are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While the Government imposes no impediments to the establishment or operation
 of local groups devoted to monitoring human rights, there is none. There have been
 no requests from outside groups to investigate human rights conditions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that all Monegasque nationals are equal before the law.
 It differentiates between rights that are accorded nationals (including preference in
 employment, free education, and assistance to the ill or unemployed) and those ac-
 corded all residents (e.g., freedom of religion, inviolability of the home).
 Women.-Reported instances of violence against women are rare. Marital violence
 is strictly prohibited, and any woman who is a victim of it may bring criminal
 charges against her husband. Women are fairly well represented in the professions.
 Women are less well represented in the business world. The law governing trans-
 mission of citizenship provides for equality of treatment between men and women
 who are Monegasque by birth. However, women who acquire Monegasque citizen-
 ship by naturalization cannot transmit it to their children, whereas naturalized
 male citizens can.
 Children.-The Government is fully committed to the protection of children's
 rights and welfare and has well-funded public education and health care programs.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has mandated that public buildings
 provide access for the disabled, and this has been largely accomplished.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers are free to form unions, but fewer than 10
 percent of workers are unionized, and relatively few of these reside in the Principal-
 ity. Unions are independent of both the government and the Monegasque political
 parties. The Monegasque Confederation of Unions is not affiliated with any larger
 a    organization but is free to join international bodies.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike in conformity with relevant legis-
 lation. Government workers, however, may not strike. Strikes are rare. The first
 strike in several years occurred in 1996, when the Monegasque Confederation of
 
 
 1203
 
 Unions organized a 1-day work stoppage by bank, transportation, and factory em-
 ployees.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the free
 exercise of union activity. Agreements on working conditions are negotiated between
 organizations representing employers in a given sector of the economy and the re-
 spective union. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. Union representatives can be
 fired only with the agreement of a commission that includes two members from the
 employers' association and two from the labor movement. Allegations that an em-
 ployee has been fired for union activity may be brought before the Labor Court,
 which can order redress, such as the payment of damages with interest.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Such practices, involving either
 adults or children, are prohibited by the Constitution, and they are not known to
 occur among adults or children.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment is 16 years; those employing children under that age can
 be punished under criminal law. Special restrictions apply to the hiring, worktimes,
 and other conditions of workers 16 to 18 years old. The Constitution prohibits forced
 and bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively
 (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for full-time work is
 the French minimum wage plus 5 percent, i.e., currently approximately $7.00 (Fr
 41.80) per hour. The 5 percent adjustment is intended to compensate for the travel
 costs of the three-quarters of the workforce who commute daily from France into the
 Principality. The minimum wage is adequate to provide a decent living for a worker
 and family. Most workers receive more than the minimum. The legal workweek is
 39 hours. Health and safety standards are fixed by law and government decree.
 These standards are enforced by health and safety committees in the workplace and
 by the government Labor Inspector.
