 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE), formed in 1971 when the
 longstanding British protective relationship with the
 so-called "Trucial States" ended, is a federation of
 seven small sheikhdoms along the coast of the Persian
 Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The UAE's highest executive
 and legislative body is the Supreme Council of Rulers,
 whose Chairman, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, is also Presi-
 dent of the UAE. The country's outlook on human rights
 reflects both the Islamic and bedouin traditions of the
 region and the concepts of the rule of law associated
 with the long British protective role.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No instances of torture have come to our attention. The.
 constitution provides clear safeguards against such
 practices.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The criminal law in the UAE is still in a developing
 stage. Some Emirates, notably Abu Dhabi, have been
 moving toward restoring Islamic legal procedures and
 penalties in the place of practices introduced by the
 British. In part, this trend is a reaction to the still
 modest but rising crime rate popularly associated with
 the presence in the Emiratesof. large numbers of foreign
 workers. Crimes such as rape are now punished by public
 flogging as well as by imprisonment. Prison conditions
 are adequate. Recently a judge in Abu Dhabi sentenced
 a thief to amputation of a hand, but this punishment
 is being appealed. The Chief of State, Sheikh Zayid,
 has generally used his powers to commute capital punish-
 ment to lesser penalties. The November 1977 execution
 of the political assassin of a Minister of State follow-
 ing the trial and conviction by an Islamic court was an
 exception.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The law does not prohibit summary arrest or imprison-
 
 (419)
 
 
 420
 ment, which has occurred in cases involving the secu-
 rity of the state. There is no evidence of anyone
 having been imprisoned for his political beliefs.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE has courts with experienced judges, mainly
 drawn from other Arab countries, which provide fair
 and public trials. Crimes and punishments are defined
 by law, and an accused is presumed innocent until
 proven guilty by a court of law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 While the constitution guarantees freedom from arbi-
 trary search, such searches occasionally occur in
 extraordinary circumstances (such as a perceived threat
 to the security of the state).
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The UAE has made a major effort to fulfill the basic
 needs of its citizens for food, shelter, health care,
 and education. Expert health care in modern facilities
 is free to all citizens, as well as non-citizens.
 The government subsidizes academically-eligible stu-
 dents from kindergarten through university. Modern
 schools, through the university level, exist or are in
 the final stages of construction throughout the UAE.
 The level of women's education is virtually on a par
 with that of men, though classes are conducted separate-
 ly. The UAE Government has provided land, and in some
 cases, financial help for the establishment of schools
 for the expatriate community.
 While the rapid pace of economic development has led to
 some disorganization in public administration, as well
 as some malfeasance and profiteering, much of the gov-
 ernment's energies have been expended on finding new
 ways to channel oil revenues to the people. The UAE
 has the highest per capita income in the world and a
 
 
 strong public welfare policy; therefore, corruption has
 not significantly diverted resources from the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Citizens of the UAE are guaranteed freedom of thought
 and religion, in law and practice. The UAE media are
 free to criticize government leaders and have dissemi-
 nated information embarrassing to the government with-
 out suffering retribution. The constitution guarantees
 religious freedom and permits churches of various
 faiths. The government has made land available to
 Protestant and Catholic churches, some of which operate
 their own schools. The constitution guarantees freedom
 of assembly "within the limits of the law." In prac-
 tice, the authorities prohibit gatherings they consider
 to be threats to public order; large political meet-
 ings are virtually unknown in the UAE.
 There is no org&nized labor movement in the UAE. Vir-
 tually the entire labor force in the country is foreign.
 Labor organizations are not encouraged by the govern-
 ment.
 The status of women, for the most part, is still gov-
 erned by conservative tribal and Islamic values.
 Increasingly, young women are availing themselves of
 opportunities for modern education and are adopting more
 liberal customs. Family and societal pressures, how-
 ever, still tend to confine most UAE women to the home.
 Liberal government policies with respect to women's
 education are contributing to their advancement.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is no restraint on freedom of movement within the
 country. Foreign travel and emigration for all citizens
 are unrestricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 
 
 422
 In the UAE Federal Assembly the appointed representa-
 tives of the seven small sheikhdoms speak out with
 impunity on political issues, but there is no democrat-
 ic process for selecting representatives or executive
 leaders. Permanent government structures and practices
 have not yet been shaped because the central authority
 is still in the process of attempting to achieve federal
 unity and arrive at a permanent constitution.
 In the tribal tradition of the sheikhdoms that comprise
 the UAE, citizens are encouraged to express their views
 to leaders, and government decisions in the individual
 states are normally made on the basis of consultation
 with leading members of the society. Expatriates are
 expected to desist from political activity which in any
 way would directly affect or involve the UAE.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 No violations of human rights have been alleged, and no
 international investigations have been proposed.
