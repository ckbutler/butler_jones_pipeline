 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda i's a small two-island state with a
 parliamentary democracy'modeled after that of the United
 Kingdom.- It ii governed "by a priie minister, a cabinet, and a
 bicameral legislative assembly. The Governor General, with
 largely ceremonial duties, is the titulr Head of State and
 serves as representative of the British monarch. The
 Constitution requiies general elections at least every 5
 years.- Prime Minister V. C. Bird and his Antigua Labour Party
 (ALP) once again won a convincing victory in the March 1989
 general elections, capturing 15 of the 17 seats in the'House
 of Representatives. One seat went to United National
 Democratic Party (UNDP) candidate Baldwin Spencer, who was
 named leader of the opposition in Parliament. The other
 nongovernment seat 'represented the Barbuda constituency and
 was won by Hilbourne Frank, a political independent who leads
 the Barbuda faction advocating secession from the union with
 Antigua. The Governor General appoints the 17-member Senate
 with the advice of the Prime Minister and opposition leader.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the Antigua and
 Barbuda Defense Force, a 120-man infantry unit. The police
 are organized, trained, and supervised according to British
 law enforcement practices. The security forces have a good
 reputation 'for respecting individual rights in the performance
 of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy, with a strong private
 sector. Tourism is the major industry. In 1989 the econbmy
 registered a 6.8 percent increase in gross domestic product,
 the fifth straight year of high growth. However, a large and
 growing external debt continued to concern the Government.
 The Constitution provides for observance of political and
 civil rights, which are generally respected in practice, with
 the exception that opposition political parties have little or
 no access to the government-dominated electronic media.
 Antigua and Barbuda's generally good human rights record
 remained largely unchanged in 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HU.AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or politically
 motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or inhuman
 treatment of prisoners or detainees, and these prohibitions
 are respected in practice.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention,
 which do not occur in practice. Criminal defendants are
 guaranteed the right of judicial determination of the legality
 of their detention. Detainees must be brought before a court
 within 48 hours of arrest or detention. There were no reports
 of involuntary exile.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is modeled on that of the United Kingdom
 and is part of the Eastern Caribbean legal system. Final
 appeal may be made to the Queen's Privy Council in the United
 Kingdom and is invariably made in the case of death
 sentences. There are no military or political courts.
 Criminal defendants are assured a fair, open, and public
 trial. In capital cases the Government provides legal
 assistance at public expense to persons without means to
 retain a private attorney. There are no political prisoners
 in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary intereference with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence in 1989. The police must
 obtain a warrant before searching private premises.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, the press,
 and other forms of communication; these provisions are
 generally respected. However, the Government dominates the
 electronic media, the only daily source of news. The
 Government owns one of the two radio stations and the single
 television station, and the Prime Minister's family owns the
 second radio station. Opposition politicians have not been
 able to obtain adequate air time to present their positions.
 ABS radio and television report regularly on the Government's
 activities but rarely on those of the opposition political
 parties.
 In September, for example, members of the opposition UNDP
 wanted to join a live broadcast on ABS radio in which
 participants were discussing disaster relief efforts in
 Antigua following Hurricane Hugo. They were told that,
 although they could not be part of the live transmission, ABS
 would prerecord an interview with them on the subject for
 later broadcast. When the half-hour tape later was broadcast,
 it was taken off the air before the opposition spokeman
 completed his answer to the first of a series of questions
 asked by the interviewer.
 The opposition UNDP has also charged that, prior to the call
 for general elections this year, they unsuccessfully attempted
 to purchase time from the electronic media. Once elections
 were called, use of radio and television for political
 campaigning was prohibited by law under the People Act of 1975
 (which was enacted when the current-ly ruling party was out of
 office). The Act provides that: "Pending an election, it
 
 
 450
 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 shall not be lawful for any television or wireless
 transmitting station to broadcast any item for the purpose of
 promoting or procuring the election of any-candidate or of any
 political party," but exempts bond fide scheduled news
 broadqasts which give fair and equitable coverage of all
 election meetings, as well as any announcement, not exceeding
 2 minutes, concerning~the time, date, and venue of a political
 meeting.
 Weekly newspapers representing the opposition publish a
 variety of opinions. They are free to criticize the
 Government and do so regularly. Religious organizations also
 publish their own newspapers.
 b. FreedOm of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly.
 Public meetings and organized demonstrations are held without
 police interference. Required permits for public meetings are
 issued by the police, and they normally grant them. Permits
 for political rallies were routinely granted upon request
 during the period leading up to-the general elections in 1989.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is unrestricted exercise of religious freedom. The
 population is overwhelmingly Protestant, but adherents of
 other religious denominations practice and proselytize openly
 without government interference. All groups are free to
 maintain links with coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither law nor practice restricts the right of citizens of
 Antigua and Barbuda to move about within the country, to
 travel abroad, or to emigrate.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system
 accommodating a wide spectrum of political viewpoints. All
 citizens 18 years of age and older may register and vote by
 secret ballot. The Constitution requires general elections at
 least every 5 years. The Government is obligated by law to
 hold voter registration during a fixed period each year, and
 parties conduct their own registration drives free from
 government interference. General elections were held in
 Antigua and Barbuda on March 9. The incumbent ALP led by
 Prime Minister Vere Cornwall Bird, Sr., easily won reelection,
 taking 15 jof the 17 parliamentary constituencies, a net loss
 of one seat from the 1984 elections. The ALP has been in
 power since 1951, except for a period in opposition from 1971
 to 1976. The opposition charged that the ALP's longstanding
 monopoly on patronage and its influence over the economic life
 of the country made it extremely difficult for opposition
 parties to attract membership and financial support.
 Following the general elections, the opposition charged that
 serious polling irregularities had occurred on election day in
 seven of the constituencies and that election results in those
 
 
 451
 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 districts were invalid. Absence of ballots or insufficient
 numbers of ballots prevented polling stations in these
 districts from adhering to the prescribed voting period of
 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on March 9. The matter was taken to the
 elections court for rulings on a district-by-district basis.
 When the justice declarqd the election invalid in the initial
 case to be heard, the ALP asked incumbents of the six
 remaining seats to resign and planned to hold by-elections in
 all seven constituencies in August. The opposition parties,
 however, failed to renominate candidates to stand for
 election. As a result, a by-election was unnecessary, and the
 seven ALP candidates were declared automatic victors. They
 were sworn back into office on August 8.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 expressed concern about Antigua and Barbuda. There were no
 requests for human rights investigations or inquiries during
 1989.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Law and practice prohibit discrimination based on race, sex,
 creed, language, or social status. The role of women in
 society is not restricted by law, but tradition tends to limit
 women to home and family, particularly in rural areas.
 However, these traditional roles are changing. The Government
 has begun programs to provide enhanced educational
 opportunities for both sexes as well as family planning
 services. Under the energetic prodding of the Government's
 Directorate of Women's Affairs, which was upgraded in 1989,
 women are moving up in government and the professions, but
 progress is slower in the private sector. The Women's Desk
 began almost 10 years ago with one director and a secretary
 and now employs, in addition to the executive director, three
 professionals and clerical and support staff. In 1989 the
 Directorate continued educational programs for women in such
 areas as health, crafts, and improving business skills. It
 also produced a magazine on women in Antigua and carried out
 research ihto laws affecting women.
 Most violence against women in Antigua probably goes
 unreported. Gauging the extent of the problem is difficult,
 due to the lack of accurate data, and is compounded by the
 reluctance of women in many cases to testify against their
 abusers...Police may be reluctant to interfere in cases of
 domestic violence, and some women charge that the courts do
 not take the problem seriously enough and that sentences are
 too lenient. The Directorate of Women's Affairs has scheduled
 an educational campaign through the media to increase
 awareness of the problem, and has also planned a workshop on
 women and abuse, including child abuse, for 1990.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to form labor
 unions. Although fewer than 50 percent of Antigua and
 Barbuda's workers belong to unions, the important hotel
 industry is heavily unionized. Unions are free to affiliate
 
 
 452
 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 with interhational labor organizations and do so in practice.
 Antigua and Barbuda has two major trade unions: the Antigua
 Trade and Labour Union (ATLU) and'the Antigua Workers' Union
 (AWU). The ATLU is associated with the ruling ALP, while the
 AWU is allied with the opposition UNDP. During 1989 the ATLU
 did not hesitate to criticize government policies and
 practides with which it disagreed.
 The right to strike isrecognized by the labor code. This
 right can be limited in a given dispute by the Court of
 Industrial Relations. Once either party to the dispute
 requests the Court to mediate, there can be no strike.
 Because of the delays associated with this process, in
 practi6 labbr disputes are often resolved before a strike is
 called. There were no strikes in 1989.
 In its 1989 report, the International Labor Organization's
 Committee of Experts cited legislation which allows either
 party or the Minister of Labour effectively to restrict the
 right to strike, and asked the Government to reexamine its
 legislation and take measures to ensure that provisions for
 the settlement of disputes through conciliation do not
 restrict the right to strike.
 b. The Right To Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor~organizations are free to organize ahd bargain
 collectively. There have been no allegations of antiunion
 discrimination, which is prohibited by law. There are no
 areas of the country, such as export processing or free trade
 zones, where union organization or collective bargaining is
 discouraged or impeded.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids slavery and forced labor, which do
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law provides a minimum working age of 13, which is
 respected in practice. Responsibility for enforcement rests
 with the Ministry of Labour, which by law conducts periodic
 inspections of workplaces.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The law permits a maximum 48-hour, 6-day workweek, but in
 practice the workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are
 guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks' annual leave and up to 13
 weeks of maternity leave. There are no occupational health
 and safety laws or regulations. Different minimum wages for
 different work categories were established by law in 1981.
 Some representative minimum hourly wages at the present are:
 household domestics $0.50, unskilled laborers $0.61,
 construction workers $0.93, and skilled workers $1.30. Most
 such minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of
 living for workers and their families, but the great majority
 of workers earn substantially more than the minimum wage. A
 committee completed its review of these minimum wages and
 submitted a report to the Ministry of Labour for action.
 The report recommended increases in the minimum wage levels
 for various categories of workers.
