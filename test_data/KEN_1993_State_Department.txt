 KENYA
 Kenya reintroduced multiparty democracy in 1991, but President Daniel Arap Moi
 continued to control a governing system in which power is centered in the office of
 the President and the President s party, the former single party, the Kenya African
 National Union (KANU). Under the 1963 Constitution the President has extensive
 powers over the legislature and the judiciary. Nevertheless, while KANU holds a
 majority in the unicameral National Assembly, it no longer has the two-thirds ma-
 jority required to pass constitutional amendments. In 1993 the ruling party applied
 extensive pressures to entice or coerce opposition Members of Parliament (M.P.'s)
 to defect to KANU.
 After 2 years of inaction, the Government finally took some action to curb the eth-
 nic violence centered in the Rift Valley. On September 3, the Government an-
 nounced the establishment of security zones in the hardest hit areas. Citing the
 Preservation of Public Security Act, the Government outlawed the possession of
 
 
 129
 weapons, movement of livestock at night, and the publication of any information on
 the areas of violence without government consent. The Government prevented oppo-
 sition M.P.'s, domestic and international human rights figures, and journalists from
 entering the areas. The Government made little effort to investigate credible allega-
 tions of the involvement of government officials in instigating the clashes or in
 shielding fighters from prosecution.
 Kenya has a large internal security apparatus that includes the police Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID), the paramilitary General Services Unit (GSU), and
 the Directorate of Security and Intelligence (DSI or Special Branch). The CID and
 Special Branch investigate criminal activity and also monitor persons the State con.
 siders subversive. The internal security apparatus has been used to intimidate and
 harass politicians, opponents of the Government, and dissidents, sometimes employ-
 ing torture or other mistreatment. The Government gave security forces specialdis-
 pensation from prosecution for actions in the security zones, though human rights
 groups received no evidence of abuses in the zones.
 Kenya's economy, despite the dominance of public and state-owned enterprises, in-
 cludes a well-developed private sector for trade and light manufacturing as well as
 an agricultural sector that provides food for local consumption and substantial ex-
 ports of coffee, tea, and other commodities. The tourism industry leads coffee and
 tea exports as the top foreign exchange earner but suffered reduced growth in 1993,
 due in part to the worldwide recession. The economy plummeted in 1993 as excess
 growth of the money supply fueled inflation, shortages of goods, and labor unrest.
 Although it has dereased over the last several years, the high population growth
 rate continued to contribute to a serious and growing problem of unemployment.
 Although the controversial December 1992 general elections brought about a mod-
 est strengthening of democratic institutions, the KANU-led Government has yet to
 reconcile itself to a new era of multiparty politics. The year witnessed serious set-
 backs in the Government's commitment to human rights, ethnic and political toler-
 ance, and the rule of law. The Government failed adequately to respond to the con-
 tinuing ethnic violence which has claimed over one thousand lives, or to stop many
 of its officials from inflaming this violence in other areas through war-like state-
 ments. In 1993 the Government used the security forces to intimidate its political
 critics, arresting 36 of the 85 opposition M.P.'s and many journalists and labor lead-
 ers. Security forces also broke up peaceful demonstrations and political meetings
 and disabled two privately owned printing presses. The Government abridged work-
 er rights in facilitating a coup" to replace the top union leadership with party loyal-
 ists. Societal discrimination and domestic violence against women, especially rape
 and female genital mutilation, remained serious and widespread problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reported instances of
 specifically targeted political killings by government forces, but there was one clear
 example of an extrajudicial killing. In mid-September three truckloads of plain-
 clothes security police forced their way into the compound of Central Organization
 of Trade Unions Secretary General Joseph Mugalla in Kakamega. Mugalla was ab-
 sent, but the police harassed his wife and beat up his nephew, who had attempted
 to question the police. He died the following day from the beating. As of the end
 of 1993, the Government had taken no action to prosecute those responsible.
 Substantial evidence exists of the complicity of high-level government officials in-
 stigating and promoting the ethnic clashes, which have so far claimed over 1,000
 lives and displaced 250,000 people (see Section 1.g.).
 While most of the many deat s in prison resulted from disease and lack of medi-
 cal care (see Section 1.c.), some mayhave resulted from beatings or other use of ex-
 cessive force by police or prison guards. On the night of November 2, police shot
 Jackson Mutonye Ndegwa in the leg and arrested him following a raid on Ndeiya
 Chiefs Camp, an arsenal near Nairobi. Police reported he died of his injuries the
 next morning, although he was reportedly interrogated the previous night.
 Mob violence also continued to be a major problem. As of year's end, 508 people
 had been murdered in such violence, an increase from 1992. Most victims were ei-
 ther suspected thieves or were accused of being sorcerers. While blame for public
 executions by civilians cannot directly be ascribed to the Government, Kenyan secu-
 rity forces have not made suppression of mob violence a priority-this in spite of
 the public statements by President Moi that mob violence must stop. The conduct
 of security forces was mixed, as some police officers braved violence themselves to
 rescue would-be victims, while in other incidents there were reports of police turn-
 ing a blind eye to such activity.
 
 
 130
 The trial of Jonah Anguka for the February 1990 murder of former Foreign Min-
 ister Robert Ouko continued in 1993. The Government produced no more than cir-
 cumstantial evidence to tie Anguka to the murder, and human rights advocates con-
 tinued to claim that Anguka was a scapegoat for powerful government officials. As
 the final arguments in the case were being prepared, the presiding judge, Justice
 Fidahussein Abdulla, died of apparently natural causes. The Chief Justice ruled
 that Anguka would have to undergo a second full trial.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is proscribed under the Constitution, but credible allegations of torture, po-
 lice brutality, and abuse of prisoners, often to coerce confessions, continued. Police
 also used brutal methods to break up unregistered political meetings and even some
 registered ones (see Section 2.b.).
 The police subjected prisoners arrested for "political" offenses, including sitting
 M.P.'s, to particularly brutal and degrading treatment. The day before the May 20
 Bonchari parliamentary by-election, opposition M.P. Ferdinand Obure went to the
 local police station in Kisii town to demand information about supporters of one of
 the principal opposition parties, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy/Kenya
 (FORD/K), arrested the previous day. After an altercation with a police superintend-
 ent, the police arrested and jailed Obure. The M.P. was brought into court on a
 stretcher later that day, with bruises on the back, chest, and legs, consistent with
 his testimony that he had been beaten in custody. In court the prosecutor stated
 that Obure had been injured when he fell to the floor while assaulting the officer.
 The authorities charged Obure with causing a disruption in a police station and re-
 leased him on bond. His case had not come up for trial by year's end, and it was-
 expected that the charges would be dropped.
 There were other instances of prisoners being brutalized by police, including credi-
 ble allegations of torture. For example, Stephen Kariuki Muigai, arrested along with
 Koigi wa Wamwere in November, suffered torture to his knee and ankle joints and
 under the toenails. Credible medical evidence of the torture was provided to police
 and the courts. At the end of the year, the Government had taken no action to re-
 spond to the allegations. Also, defense council in the Ndeiya Chiefs Camp case
 charged that a private physician could confirm that several of the prisoners had
 been tortured.
 In early January, the authorities prevented the personal physician for the "Trea-
 son Four" (including former M.P. Koigi Wa Wamwere) from visiting his patients in
 detention, although at least one was very ill and allegations of food poisoning had
 been reported in local newspapers. The physician initiated action in the High Court
 to gain access to the prisoners as stipulated by Kenyan law. The prisoners were re-
 leased before the case was decided.
 Conditions in prison are life threatening, due in part to inadequate resources and
 in part to the Government's unwillingness to address deficiencies in the penal sys-
 tem. Standards of food and health care continue to fall short of the basic provisions
 in the Prisons Act, especially for nursing mothers, who have their infants with
 them. A lack of quality food and bedding materials and flooded or unheated cells
 are common. Sexual abuse is also common in Kenyan prisons and rarely punished.
 Women prisoners are subject to the same harsh prison conditions as men but are
 subject to even greater sexual abuse.
 In April an assistant government minister reported in Parliament that 977 in-
 mates had died in prison in the previous 3 years. (There are approximately 34,000
 prisoners in Kenya, of whom approximately 3,000 are women.) Those deaths were
 attributed chiefly to disease; the assistant minister admitted that Kenyan prisons
 did not have resident doctors, and only one prison had a doctor permanently as-
 signed to it.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that most ar-
 rested or detained persons (other than those detained under the Preservation of
 Public Security Act or PPSA) shall be brought before a court "as soon as is reason-
 ably practicable," which would be within 24 hours of the arrest or from the start
 of detention.
 The Constitution was amended in 1988 to allow the police to hold persons sus-
 pected of capital offenses for 14 days prior to being brought before a court. Capital
 offenses include such crimes as murder and treason. A legislative amendment
 passed at the end of the 1993 parliamentary session would exclude weekends and
 holidays from this 14-day period, potentially a significant increase in the time pris-
 oners can be held without trial. In practice, suspects of all types are often held in-
 communicado for 2 to 3 weeks before being brought before a court. Often, family
 members bring law suits to compel authorities to produce "missing" prisoners.
 
 
 131
 The PPSA allows the State to detain a person indefinitely without charges or trial
 pn a determination that it is necessary for the "preservation of public security."
 This includes "prevention and suppression of rebellion, mutiny, violence, intimida-
 tion, disorder and crime, unlawful attempts and conspiracies to overthrew the Gov-
 ernment or the Constitution," and several other grounds. No persons were detained
 under the PPSA in 1993, though a number were arrested under the Rift Valley "Se-
 curity Zones" Regulations announced under the authority of the PPSA (Section 1.g.).
 Furthermore, the courts evidenced an increased willingness to grant bail in political
 cases.
 On April 28, KANU lawmakers defeated a parliamentary motion which would
 have suspended detention without trial. In the debate over the bill, the Attorney
 General said he appreciated the need for a comprehensive review of the Constitution
 but that the motion was premature. The Vice President promised that the Law Re-
 form Commission would produce a paper on constitutional reform by the end of the
 year. At the end of July, the Attorney General announced the formation of 11 task
 forces to examine the Penal Code and some of the more controversial sections of the
 Constitution. At the end of the year, only two of the commissions had met.
 The police continued to arrest and question government critics without provo-
 cation, and often without warrant. For example, Central Organization of Trade
 Unions (COTU) Secretary General Joseph Mugalla gave a Labor Day speech May
 1, saying that COTU would proceed with a national general strike if labor demands
 for a 100-percent wage increase and dismissal of Vice President George Saitoti were
 not met. The Minister of Labor walked out without giving his speech, and the cere-
 monies ended abruptly. Security police, without any warrant, tried but were thwart-
 ed from picking up Mugalla at a Labor Day luncheon. Later the same day, they ar-
 rested him, his deputy Boniface Munyao, and Shoe and Leather Workers Secretary
 General Joseph Boo, purportedly for having called a strike. Mugalla was released
 May7 the others earlier but the charges were still pending at year's end.
 On May 31, police broke up a licensed Forum for the Restoration of Democracy/
 Asili (FORD/A)political meeting in Kiambu, after M.P. Martin Shikuku made com-
 ments critical of the Government. The police arrested FORD/A M.P. Kamau Icharia
 and Shikuku the following day, held them overnight, and released them the day
 after without charges. The arrest of opposition M.P.'a was a frequent occurrence
 after the Augat recess, so that in September, more than hal f of FORD/A's 30 M.P.'s
 were out on bond at the same time.
 On June 9, police attempted to arrest FORD/A M.P. Njenga Mungai inside Par-
 liament, in connection with statements he made earlier on the need fr Kikuyus to
 defend themselves in the Rif Valley. Under Kenyan law, M.P.'s are protected from
 arrest while "going to, attending at, or returning from a sitting of the Assembly."
 Assistant Mies ter of State in Che of Internal Security Jackson Kalweo issued
 a statement in Parliament expressing regret over the incident and announced that
 the Government would investigate fully the police officers involved. No disciplinary
 or any other action had been announced by year's end.
 A number of Kenyans were arrested for incitement, sedition, and other offenses
 related to their alleged involvement in tribal clashes. On September 22, former de-
 tainee Koigi Wa Wamwere was arrested along with six others for possession of sedi-
 tious literature within one of the announced security zones. Wamwere was found
 with copies of a bradsheet called The Wailing Moo, which accused the Government
 of responsibility for the ethnic clashes, and a flyer from the National Democratic
 and Human Rights Organization (NDEHURIO), an organization which Wamwere
 founded earlier in the year. On September 24, the presiding judge refused the de-
 fendants' appeal to the High Court, holding that there were no substantive constitu-
 tional issues at stake, and denied bal pen ding a hearing on October 6.
 At the end of the year, while there were no detainees held under the PPSA, a
 number of prisoners were held without bail and denied opportunity within a reason-
 able time to answer government charges, including Koig3 wa Wamwere and more
 than a dozen others held for the attacks on the Bahati and Ndeiya police arsenals.
 The Government arrested them on criminal charges, though it has yet to present
 any evidence of their guilt in court. There is reason to believe that some of these
 prisoners are being held for their political beliefs, associations, or expressions.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The legal system, as defined in the Judicature Act
 of 1967, is based on the Constitution, laws passed by Parliament, and common law
 or court precedent. Customary law is used as a guide in civil matters affecting per-
 sons of the same ethnic group so long as it does not conflict with statutory law.
 Kenya does not have a jury system. The court system consists of a Court of Appeals,
 a High Court, and two levels of magistrates' courts where most criminal and civil
 cases originate. In 1989 High Court Justice Norbury Dugdale ruled that the courts
 have no power to enforcete e"Bill of Rights,n which is a part of the Constitution.
 
 
 132
 In spite of numerous legal challenges that the ruling effectively subsumes the judi-
 cial branch of government under the executive, his decision has not been overruled.
 Civilians are tried in civilian courts; verdicts may be appealed to the Kenyan High
 Court and ultimately to the Court of Appeals. Kenyans do not have a right to gov-
 ernment-provided legal counsel except in certain capital cases. Most persons tried
 for capital offenses are provided counsel free of charge if they cannot afford it. For
 noncapital charges, however, free legal aid is not generally available outside of
 Nairobi. In the absence of legal advice from Kituo Cha Sheria ("the law center" in
 Swahili), poor people sometimes plead guilty to a variety of offenses, including polit-
 ical offenses. Military personnel are tried by courts-martial, and verdicts may be ap-
 pealed. Attorneys for military personnel are appointed on a case-by-case basis by the
 Chief Justice. The Chiefs Authority Act gives low-level administration officials,
 called chiefs, wide-ranging powers, including the power to arrest and hold individ-
 uals and to restrict a person'a movement without trial. Although the Kenya Law Re-
 form Commission has recommended that the law be abolished, no progress has been
 made in this direction.
 The President has extensive powers over the judiciary. He appoints the Chief Jus-
 tice and the Attorney General and appoints High Court judges with the advice of
 the Judicial Service Commission. While it has not been tested, he has authority to
 dismiss judges, the Attorney General, and certain other officials upon the rec-
 ommendation of a special presidentially appointed tribunal.
 The Government's actions often result in the denial of a fair trial. For example,
 the arrests and prosecutions of journalists accused of sedition have been marked by
 unwarranted delays and undue harassment of defendants. On May 19, in the face
 of domestic criticism and international pressure by human rights groups, the Gov-
 ernment dropped sedition charges against six editors and employees of Society mag-
 azine. Although there had been no action on the charges for a whole year, the edi-
 tors were still forced to travel to Mombasa every month for court hearings (also see
 Section 2.a.).
 The Government's use of the legal system to prevent its critics from using the
 courts to stop government harassment was evident in the Fotoform case. Fotoform
 Limited had been the printer of a number of independent publications. In April the
 police forced their way into the Fotoform plant and dismantled and confiscated the
 printing press. Fotoform immediately filed an injunction to compel the Government
 to return the printing press parts, since the police had not obtained a warrant be-
 fore seizing them andbecause Fotoform had not yet been charged with sedition. The
 Government defended its use of prior restraint with regard to seditious publications.
 Three months later (despite Government assurances that the case would be expe-
 dited), on July 21, the High Court denied Fotoform the injunction, saying it did not
 want to prejudice the sedition cases filed after the seizure against the Fotoform
 manager and the editor of Finance magazine. The Government filed the sedition
 cases ex post facto to meet the legal requirements of the seizure but did not receive
 the Attorney General's permission to prosecute. On September 24, the Government
 withdrew all charges against Fotoform but did not issue an order to return the press
 parts. In the meantime, the Government's various actions had put Fotoform out of
 business.
 The Government has also switched the venue for several controversial cases in
 order to ensure a hearing before a progovernment magistrate or in a progovernment
 area. In particular, several of the cases related to the ethnic clashes and the demoli-
 tion of kiosks in Nakuru were transferred from Kikuyu-dominated Nakuru to
 Kericho or other towns in the Kalenjin heartland.
 Notwithstanding the Government's influence on the judiciary and its use of the
 legal system to harass its critics, the courts have occasionally acted independently
 of the executive. The courts rendered several judgments against the Government.
 For example, in mid-March an appellate tribunal found that the Government un-
 justly detained and tortured plaintiff Wanyiri Kihoro in 1986. Calling the police ac-
 tion "repugnant," the court awarded Kihoro damages although it was powerless to
 punish the offending officers absent action by the Government. The court's finding
 was deemed to be a precedent. A number of other former detainees have filed suit
 against the Government for unlawful detention or are contemplating doing so.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-
 Searches without warrants are allowed under the Constitution in certain instances
 "to promote the public benefit," including in security cases. Although judicially is-
 sued search warrants are generally obtained, security officials often conduct
 searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or to seize property
 suspected of having been stolen. The authorities continue to search homes of sus-
 pected dissidents without warrants, and evidence so obtained has been admitted to
 support convictions. Security forces employ a variety of surveillance techniques, in-
 
 
 133
 cluding electronic surveillance and a network of informers. In particular, police sur-
 veillance of political opponents and some of their visitors is :vutine. Opposition lead-
 ers and human rights monitors also charge the Government with staging or promot-
 ingphysical attacks on those critical of the Government (see Section 2.b.).
 On February 26 a hooded police squad tore apart a pharmacy in Nairobi's Hilton
 Hotel and arrested proprietor John Makanga, for alleged "incitement" due to his ac-
 tivities on behalf of victims of ethnic clashes. The police had no warrant for his ar-
 rest and never filed charges against him. Human rights groups criticized the Gov-
 ernment for the brutality of the arrest and the wanton damage inflicted on his place
 of business. The Kenyan press described the brutal, unlawful arrest perpetrated by
 hooded police officers, in a very public place, as a politically motivated warning
 rather than an exercise of criminal justice.
 On May 8, police officers and youths alleged to be KANU thugs demolished small,
 fully stocked market stalls in Nakuru town. Government officials first denied any
 knowledge of the operation (which involved uniformed administrative police and a
 municipal bulldozer), then refused permission for the shopowners to rebuild, citing
 an unexplained "security threat." Human rights groups charged that the demolitions
 targeted ethnic groups thought to be generally supportive of the opposition. Since
 that time, market stalls have been demolished in other major cities, including
 Nairobi and Kisumu. In most cases, no warning was given, and the legal authority
 to demolish the structures was dubious.
 Although Kenyans are, in theory, free to choose their political affiliation, govern-
 rnent employees were routinely told to support the ruling party or be fired. At a
 public rally on February 14, President Moi warned civil servants to be loyal to
 KANU or face dismissal, since KANU had won the December general election.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-T~e so-called ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley, which have largely targeted
 ethnic groups not supportive of the ruling party, continued to cause numerous
 deaths and displacements. Substantial evidence exists of the complicity of high-
 ranking government officials in financing, arming, and then shielding the attackers
 from prosecution. Only one clash-related case has resulted in a conviction, and that
 was overturned. According to separate reports by a parliamentary special commit-
 tee, the Catholic Bishops of Kenya, the National Council of Churches of Kenya
 (NCCK) (a Protestant umbrella group), the National Elections Monitoring Group
 (NEMU), the Kenya Human Rights Commission, the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial
 Center, and Africa Watch, the Government bears primary res onsibility for the de-
 struction and loss of lives. Nearly 1,000 people have died and between 150,000 to
 300,000 have been displaced since the clashes be an in 1991.
 On September 3, the Government announced ihe establishment of security zones
 in the hardest hit areas around Molo, Londiani, Elburgon, and Burnt Forest. Citing
 the Preservation of Public Security Act, the Government outlawed the possession of
 weapons, movement of livestock at night, and the publication of any information on
 the areas of violence without government consent. Opposition M.P.'s and domestic
 and international human rights figures were prevented from entering the areas, as
 were journalists. Human rights groups complained about the security forces' monop-
 oly on information, and the draconian nature of the legislation establishing the
 zones.
 Security personnel were given shoot-to-kill authorization on the mere suspicion
 that a crime might be committed. Unauthorized entry into or movement within the
 zones was sufficient to constitute a crime. Security personnel were empowered to
 requisition private vehicles, prohibit the movement of residents, and demand forced
 labor, as well as given expanded powers of search and arrest. The regulations also
 absolve the Government and security forces of any responsibility for death and de-
 struction, specifically prehibiting suits for compensation. At year's end, there were
 no reports that this new authority had been grossly abused.
 Government critics, press and church sources, and human rights groups blame the
 Government for the violence and claim that it initially sponsored the clashes to
 prove its oft-repeated assertion that multiparty politics are incompatible with Ken-
 ya's multiethnic society. The resulting deaths and destruction have aggravated tra-
 ditional tribal rivalries, and the clashes now proceed even without active encourage-
 ment from the Government. The NEMU report on the clashes stated, "initially, it
 appeared as if the aim was to curtail the multiparty crusade. However, it has more
 recently taken the form of ethnic cleansing-the removal of all ethnic groups except
 the Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana, and Samburu from the Rift Valley."
 High-level government officials continue to make inflammatory statements with-
 out government response, and Kenya's security forces seem unable or unwilling to
 contain the violence. During the eruption of ethnic fighting in Mombasa on Novem-
 ber 28, armed police at the scene did not intervene. The Government sought to frus-
 
 
 trate the hopes of the displaced wishing to return to their homes; it harassed groups
 offering them legal or financial assistance allowed insecurity to persist in troubled
 regions, rejected seemingly legitimate land claims, and allowed members of
 progovernment ethnic groups to take over farms and property left behind. The pro-
 motion of a district commissioner, alleged to be involved in the clashes, to his cur-
 rent post of Rift Valley provincial commissioner was a further disquieting sign.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press and outlaws discrimination on the grounds of political opinion. However,
 there are numerous de jure and de facto restrictions and inhibitions on the exercise
 of free speech. Freedom of speech is often breached by security forces acting without
 warrant and often undercut by overly broad judicial interpretations of antiquated
 sedition and libel laws. For example, on January 19, police arrested FORD/K M.P.
 Paul Muite under Section 66 of the Penal Code, which prohibits "any false state-
 ment, rumor, or report which is likely to cause fear and alarm to the public or to
 disturb the public peace." He had earlier accused the Government of perpetuating
 a climate of insecurity in Northeast Province in order to exercise greater political
 control over the Province. In spite of government harassment, however, opposition
 political and human rights groups continue topresent their views to the public.
 Radio is the medium through which most Kenyans get their news. The Govern-
 ment controls the single radio station and its affiliate television station, the Kenya
 Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), which produces both televison and radio news.
 They typicay avoid stories critical of the Government, give a large share of news
 time to government or ruling party functions, and have consistently failed to ive
 equal and accurate coverage to opposition activities. A second television station,
 Kenya Television Network (KTN), adheres to self-imposed guidelines. Government
 influence on its editorial ontent, both directly and through the chairman of the
 board, increased markedly, until March, when KTN stopped broadcasting its popu-
 lar local news program under government pressure. In December KANU, acting on
 the President's orders, replacedthe legal officers of KTN. KANU Secretary General
 Joseph Kamotho claimed that, in spite of frequent denials during the year, the party
 was KTNs legal owner.
 To protect its radio and television monopoly, the Government has refused to issue
 any license for a private radio station, though there have been a number of expres-
 sions of interest. On September 27, the Government announced a restriction "for se-
 curity reasons" on receive-only television dishes "until licensing procedures can be
 worked out."
 The print media includes three daily newspapers providing national coverage. The
 printed press is vibrant and independent, though under government pressure to
 self-censor. The two independent daily newspapers, the Nation and the Standard,
 give extensive coverage to political events and often print editorials critical of gov-
 ernment policies. The weekly newspapers and magazines, many of which take a
 more strident tone in their criticism of the Government, also have substantial audi-
 ences, though they have borne the brunt of government harassment.
 During 1993 the Government used the police force and antiquated colonial sedi-
 tion laws to arrest editors, dismantle printing presses, harass vendors, and impound
 magazines (see also Section i.e.). Among the many instances of government censor-
 ship of the press were the following:
 -On February 3, the editor of Finance magazine Njehu Gatabaki was charged
 with three counts of sedition in connection with an issue of Finance which described
 President Moi's large holdings in British banking institutions. Gatabaki was held
 several days in jail, then released on bond. On June 14, he was rearrested at the
 High Court (where he had gone to file a petition for the Government to return his
 passport (see Section 2.d.), charged with sedition for the sixth time, and jailed for
 approximately 48 hours. He was then released on bond and surety of approximately
 $4,400. Gatabaki has never had one of his sedition cases come to trial, and by the
 end of October all of the charges pending had been dropped.
 -On May 30, police impounded 6,000 copies of the Presbyterian Church of East
 Africa magazine Jitegemea (Kiswahili for self-reliance). The issue accused the Gov-
 ernment of genocide for fomenting the ethnic clashes in Rift Valley and for targeting
 Kikuyu shopowners by demolishing kiosks across the country. The Government
 charged editor Jamlick Miano with sedition, his third arrest for sedition since the
 July 1992 inauguration of the magazine. On June 26, the Government withdrew six
 charges of sedition against Miano originally filed in July 1992, though the latest
 charges had not been withdrawn by the end of 1993. While M(ano remained free
 on bail, the repeated impoundments of Jitegemea and arrests of Miano have prob-
 ably resulted in the paper's demise.
 
 
 135
 -On August 2, plainclothes police raided Colourprint, printer for Finance maga-
 zine among others. The police seized negatives and plates along with 10,000 copies
 of Finance magazine, the sixth time in 14 months that Finance was impounded.
 Earlier on February 10, police acting without a warrant confiscated plates and other
 printing materials from Lengo Press, a Christian printing house. Earlier that day,
 Lengo had distributed a copy of The Watchman, a purportedly religious magazine
 which is sharply critical of the Government.
 The Government does not specifically restrict the activities or reporting of
 Nairobi's extensive international press corps, though in covering the Rift Valley vio.
 lence, international reporters are bound by the same security restrictions as Kenyan
 journalists. A number of books remain banned, including a Kiswahili play based on
 George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and a number of works by emigre Kenyan author
 Ngugi wa Thiong'o.
 The public universities have become further politicized since the return of
 multiparty politics. Government, KANU, and university officials attempted to pres-
 sure facult and staf to support the ruling party. Opposition leaders were success-
 fully barred from college campuses, professors thought supportive of the opposition
 were sidelined, and senior academics who publicly support KANU were rewarded
 by an entrenched patronage system. A network of police informants continued to
 monitor both students and professors at the universities, although some observers
 claim the number of informers may have declined in recent years. The Government
 maintained its refusal to allow the operation of the Student Organization of Nairobi
 University (SONU), although that body is called for in the university constitution.
 Likewise, the Government refused registration to a nationwide union of university
 professors in late 1993. When the dons went on strike, the universities fired the
 leaders and halted the paychecks of hundreds more in early January.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associatn.-Freedom of assembly, while
 provided for in the Constitution, is seriously limited by the Public Order Act, which
 gives authorities power to control public gatherings. The Act makes it illegal to hold
 an unlicensed meeting of 10 or more persons without approval from the district com-
 missioner, but it does not in theory apply to persons meeting for "social, cultural,
 charitable, recreational, religious, professional, commercial, or industrial purposes."
 In practice, meetings under all those categories fall under the jurisdiction of the
 Public Order Act.
 The Government continued to restrict the right of peaceful assembly by refusing
 n rgtr meetings and by breaking up both unlicensed and licensed meetings.
 In March police prevented human rights advocate Wangari Maathai from holding
 a seminar on the ethnic clashes in Nakuru town. Cordoning off the Catholic cathe-
 dral, which was to be the site of the seminar, armed police with dogs forcibly pre-
 vented anyone from entering the compound. After the initial meeting was canceled
 on March 2, Maathai tried and failed twice more to hold the meeting. The provincial
 commissioner said that the proposed meeting was a threat to pub ic security and
 accused Maathai of incitement.
 On March 23, a group of opposition supporters stood peacefully outside Par-
 liament demonstrating against the President and KANU parliamentarians attend-
 ing the state opening of Parliament. They were attacked by youths dressed in tradi-
 tional Maasai clothing and carrying metal-studded clubs, whips, and machetes. The
 ample number of security police present took no action to halt the violence. Observ-
 ers reported that the "Maasai" had military-type haircuts, wore military watches,
 and in other ways did not resemble Maasai. After widespread accusations that the
 attack was carried out by members of Kenya's security forces, the Daily Nation re-
 ported that Minister of Education and KANU General Secretary Joseph Kamotho
 admitted at a public function that the "Maasai Moran" were really KANU
 youthwingers and had been provoked by chants of "Moi must go" into violence.
 Though an embarrassed Kamotho later retracted the statements, the Nation ex-
 ained that a senior editor had confirmed the story that same evening with
 amotho and pledged to stand by it.
 The authorities routinely denied opposition parliamentarians permission to meet
 their constituents. For example, on August 18 M.P. Kenneth Matiba was conducting
 a meet-the-people tour of Murang'a and Embu districts when truckloads of police
 broke up a short meeting in Murang'a and prevented him from addressing any
 meetings in Embu.
 The Societies Act governs freedom of association; it states that every association
 must be registered or exempted from registration by the Registrar of Societies. Non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's) protested requirements that they register every
 5 years as an attempt by the Government to control human rights andcharitable
 activities. Nevertheless, after heavy government pressure, most local NGO's had to
 
 
 136
 ap   lfor registration in 1993. Koigi wa Wamwere's human rights group,
 NDEHURIO, was denied registration in 1993.
 Since the repeal of Section 2(a) of the Constitution in November 1991, Kenyans
 have in theory been free to join the political party of their choice, and 10 parties
 have been registered. Nine registered parties participated in the December 1992
 elections: KANU, FORD/Kenya, FORD/Asili, the Democratic Party, the Social Demo-
 cratic Party, the Kenya National Democratic Party, the Kenya National Congress,
 the Labor Party Democracy, the Kenya Social Congress, and the Party of Independ-
 ent Candidates of Kenya. The Government refused to register at least three, includ-
 ing the Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK), the Democratic Movement, and the Socialist
 Alliance of Peasants and the Proletariats of Kenya. At least 14 other parties applied
 but did not receive a response from the Government. These included at least 2 envi-
 ronmental parties, which were refused registration by the Attorney General as
 threats "to the security of the State."
 IPK followers on Kenya's coast continued to protest their exclusion and the party
 designated a chairman and other officers to press their case. Though the Societies
 Act nowhere prohibits religion-based political parties, the Attorney General main-
 tained his position that registering sectarian parties would contradict the spirit of
 the law, which 'proscribes organizations "incompatible with peace, welfare, or good
 order in Kenya.
 On July 2, uniformed police surrounded the headquarters of the Central Organi-
 zation of Trade Unions (COTU) to prevent a meeting of the COTU governing coun-
 cil, which had been scheduled in May and announced publicly. The authorities cited
 "security" reasons for their actions, but the purpose was to install new
 progovernment labor leadership (see Section 6.a.).
 University faculty went on strike at the end of 1993 to protest the lack of action,
 after 18 months, on their request to register the University Academic Staff Union
 (UASU). The university management responded in early 1994 by firing more than
 24 professors and withholding the salaries of more than 200 others.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Kenya has no state religion. Freedom of worship is ac-
 knowledged in the Constitution and generally allowed, but churches new to Kenya
 must obtain government approval to be registered. Many Kenyan Muslims charge
 that the Government's antipathy towards the IPK is proof of an anti-Muslim bias,
 though Government officials deny this.
 On July 17, President Moi hd a KANU political rally in Kapsabet. As is often
 the case, local authorities instructed students to attend. At the nearby Kapsabet
 girls' high school, the school's headmistress interrupted a group of Seventh Day Ad-
 ventist students who were conducting a religious service, an ordered them to at-
 tend the rally. When a number refused (the Government claims there were 12,
 though area parents claimed 84 students), the school authorities expelled them from
 school. After an outcry by the press and the National Teachers Union, the local dis-
 trict commissioner instructed the headmistress to readmit the students and stop
 interfering with their religious freedom. By the end of July, the students had been
 readmitted to school but were assigned manual labor as punishment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-By law citizens may travel freely within the country. However, ethnic
 clashes and the establishment of security zones resticted the ability of many
 Kenyans to travel, particularly to those parts of the Rift Valley most affected by the
 violence.
 The Government does not generally prohibit emigration of its citizens but in 1993,
 as in past years, prevented travel abroad by some of its critics. The Government
 does not regard provision of passports to its citizens as a right and reserves the au-
 thority to issue or deny pass ports at its discretion.
 In June the Government denied Finance magazine editor Njehu Gatabaki permis-
 sion to depart Kenya in order to attend the World Conference on Human Rights in
 Vienna. Gatabaki had been appointed by the newly formed Association for a Free
 and Independent Press to deliver a speech on press freedom in Kenya at the Con-
 ference. In court, the Attorney General's office argued that Gatabaki's passport
 could not be released due to pending sedition charges against him and since
 Gatabaki had not applied 14 days in advance. The chief magistrate accepted that
 argument, and Gatabaki was prevented from attending the Vienna Conference.
 The Government also prevented a former "sedition" detainee, Augustine
 Kathangu, who is suing the Government for unlawful confinement, from traveling
 outside the country. Mr. Kathangu continued to petition the principal immigration
 officer to return his passport seized in 1991 or to issue a new one.
 In October security officers boarded a loaded commercial airliner, seized the pass-
 port of KTN Director Jared Kangwana, and prevented him from departing on a
 business trip. Kangwana maintains that the act was part of a government intimida-
 
 
 137
 tion campaign to force him to relinquish control of KTN to the ruling party. Since
 the Government took no action to institute criminal proceedings against Kangwana
 and ultimately succeeded in forcing Kangwana to cede the company to KANU, his
 allegations appear credible.
 The Government has been quick to use its deportation powers against selected
 foreign citizens it viewed as overly critical. In February it deported Anders Breidlid,
 a Norwegian citizen, immediately after he landed at Kenyatta airport in Nairobi,
 apparently in retaliation for his work on behalf of Kenyan political prisoners. In
 May the Government deported Father Oliver Ryan, an Irish priest living in the Rift
 Valley, in response to comments he made blaming government officials for
 condoning tribal conflict in the Rift Valley. Father Ryan was the third expatriate
 priest to be deported for such comments since the ethnic clashes began.
 In 1991 Kenya was inundated by Somali, Ethiopian, and Sudanese refugees, flee-
 ing chaos and conflict in their home countries. Kenya has accepted most asylum
 seekers, though sometimes entry is delayed, resulting in hardship and denial of as-
 sistance. None of these refugees has been granted legal status other than that of
 asylum seeker. In 1990 there were 14,000 refugees- at the end of 1993 there were
 about 375,000 refugees residing in camps, and the Government estimated that
 100,000 refugees were living outside the camps in cities and rural areas. The United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) puts the latter figure at about
 20 000. Somalis account for about 75 percent of the total.
 In July 1,300 refugees being assisted by an Islamic aid organization in Mandera
 were forcibly expelled ostensibly for what the Government believed was fundamen-
 talist activity. UNHCR maintained the refugees were not politically active and pro-
 tested their refoulement.
 Africa Watch reported that hundreds of Somali women in the camps in the north-
 east were victims of rape or violent attack by armed bandits and, to a lesser extent,
 by Kenyan police officers. The report blamed the Government for failing to recognize
 the seriousness and urgency of the problem. The UNHCR launched a project at the
 end of 1993 to assist these women and to improve security in the camps.
 Refugees outside the camps are extremely vulnerable to arrest, and those who
 purchase false identification documents andvisas put themselves even further at
 risk. There is increasing violence in the northeast, where most of the camps are sit-
 uated and cross-border incursions by armed Somalis occur.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right and ability of Kenyan citizens to change their government through free
 and fair elections has yet to be demonstrated. The general elections on December
 29, 1992, for the Presidency, Members of Parliament, and local government officials,
 and the preceding campaign period, were marked by violence, intimidation, fraud,
 and other irregularities. ThePresident, backed by the former single party, KANU,
 continues to dominate the political system.
 However, as a result of the 1992 legislative elections, six opposition parties won
 seats in the National Assembly and their M.P.'s were able, in Parliamentary de-
 bates, to point out instances of government mismanagement and malfeasance.
 KANUJ holds 114 seats in the 200-seat Assembly; the six opposition parties hold the
 remainder.
 Nonetheless, the power of the Assembly is limited. The President under the Con-
 stitution has the power to open and dissolve Parliament, and the law prohibits the
 discussion in Parliament of all matters before the courts. This law and its interpre-
 tation by the Speaker of the Assembly severely limit the scope of parliamentary de-
 bate on most controversial political issues. The Speaker and his deputy consistently
 ruled in favor of KANU on parliamentary procedure. Speaker Ole Kaparo also ruled
 that the conduct of the President is not a subject appropriate for debate in Par-
 liament, cutting off opposition allegations of high-level government corruption and
 malfeasance.
 KANU used a variety of pressure tactics to entice opposition M.P.'s to defect to
 KANU and by year's end, four had done so, and its attempts to attract opposition
 officials had much greater success among lower level national or branch officials.
 Opposition figres charged that the defections were the result of a KANU campaign
 o bribery and blackmail.
 By law, the defection of a sitting M.P. requires a by-election in that constituency.
 On May 20, by-elections were held in Migri and Bonchari constituencies. They were
 observed bythe U.S. International Republican Institute and a number of Kenyan
 groups, incuding the National Elections Monitoring Unit. In an election which the
 observer groups said was relatively fair, though with instances of bribery and in-
 timidation by government officials, an opposition candidate won in Migori. In
 
 
 138
 Bonchari, the defecting M.P. won on a KANU ticket in an election that observers
 said was marred by wide-scale intimidation, vote-buying, and polling irregularities.
 The Government and KANU harassed opposition parties in two other by-elections
 on October 12, in Hamisi and Makuyu constituencies. For example, the authorities
 arrested the FORD/A candidate in Makuyu on September 11, for possession of sedi-
 tious documents. Although no charges had been filed, the district commissioner can-
 celed all FORD/A political meetings and police barred the candidate from attending
 even church services in the area. Shortly before the election (which he won), the
 Ford/A candidate was allowed to hold several public rallies. The Attorney General
 had not given his permission to prosecute the case by the end of 1993, and Ford/
 A did not expect formal charges to be brought against their now-sitting par-
 liamentarians.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics, and there
 have been some limited improvements in the exercise of women s political rights.
 Nonetheless, their role is restricted by traditional attitudes, and the December elec-
 tion resulted in the election of only 6 women M.P.'s-which was still the highest
 number ever elected. No women were appointed to the new Cabinet, although one
 woman serves as an Assistant Minister. In intraparty elections, the Democratic
 Party elected a woman to the number-three party position, and 25 percent of the
 party's national office holders are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Kenya has a vibrant, vocal, and thriving human rights community. A number of
 domestic human rights organizations exist and often issue statements critical of gov-
 ernment officials and policies. The Kenya Human Rights Commission produces a
 regular series of often critical reports on human rights in Kenya and reacts to spe-
 cic abuses, without government harassment. The Institute for Democracy, formerly
 the National Elections Monitoring Unit (NEMU), continues to monitor parliamen-
 tary by-elections with generally good cooperation from the Elections Commission.
 Legal organizations such as the Kenya chapters of the International Commission of
 Jurists and the Kenya Law Society continue to cover human rights issues as a
 major priority. A large pool of Kenyan human rights lawyers conduct pro bono rep-
 resentation of defendants and serve as an accurate if informal source of human
 rights information.
 "President Moi and his officials do not accept the international community's right
 to comment on Kenya's internal affairs. They routinely criticize international human
 rights groups and diplomats resident in Nairobi for "meddling." On August 5, Presi-
 dent Moi accused diplomats resident in Nairobi of supporting opposition parties and
 "subversive activities" by the media. Also in August, the Government criticized visi-
 tors Kerry Kennedy Cuomo from the U.S.-based Robert F. Kennedy Center for
 Human Rights and Lord David Ennals from Britain's House of Lords for their com-
 ments on Kenya's human rights scene.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Kenya is an ethnically diverse country; the Constitution and laws prohibit dis-
 crimination on the bases of race, sex, religion, language, or social status. Nonethe-
 less, beth legal and societal discrimination persists against women and some ethnic
 minorities and religious groups.
 Women.-Women's rights are protected by the Constitution and the Government
 continues verbally to support fulr equality for women. Nevertheless, women continue
 to be discriminated against in many legal matters, including inheritance and di-
 vorce. The role of women in business, legal, and political life is further limited by
 cultural prejudices. According to Kenyan human rights monitors, many other prob-
 lems stem from a lack of awareness of the judicial system and legal rights. Both
 the Kenya chapter of the International Commission of Jurists and the Kenya chap-
 ter of the Federation of Women Lawyers conduct outreach paralegal programs to in-
 form women, especially in rural or poor urban areas, of their rights. Although
 women are increasingly active in the modern economy-they constitute about 60
 percent of the industrial and agricultural work force, the number of women in pro-
 fessional roles is still limited. Female unemployment is double that of men, women
 sometimes receive lower rates of pay than men performing the same job, and dis-
 parities in fringe benefits occur, e.g., some businesses give housing allowances to
 men but not to married women.
 Societal discrimination is most apparent in rural areas, where women account for
 75 percent of the agricultural work force. Rural families are more reluctant to invest
 in educating girls than in educating boys, especially at the higher levels. The num-
 
 
 139
 ber of girls and boys in school are roughly equal at the primary and secondary lev-
 els, but men outnumber women almost two to one in higher education. According
 to 1990 estimates, only 58 percent of women over 15 can read and write, while 80
 percent of the men are literate.
 Polygyny is not legal for people married under the Christian Marriage Act, but
 it is permitted for those who marry under African customary law. Kenya's law of
 succession, which governs inheritance rights, provides for equal treatment of male
 and female children, though in practice most inheritance issues do not come before
 the courts. Women are often excluded from extralegal inheritance settlements, have
 appointed "guardians," or are given smaller shares than male claimants.
 Domestic violence against women is a serious and widespread problem. Wife beat-
 ing is common, and rape is widespread. The press reported major incidents of do-
 mestic violence, especially rape. On January 14, a gang of armed men broke into
 a school in Siaya and raped 15 girls. The Government and women's groups condemn
 such violence, and the law carries penalties up to life imprisonment for rape, but
 the traditional culture permits a man to discipline his wife by physical means and
 is ambivalent about the seriousness of rape. The police rarely intervene in domestic
 disputes, and the judicial system has not been an effective means of redress for do-
 mestic violence. Most accused are acquitted because courts will not convict without
 medical evidence and witnesses.
 Cultural attitudes toward women were exemplified by the threat of KANU M.P.
 Paul Chepkok who in February warned environmentalist and human rights advo-
 cate Wan~ari Maathai that he would circumcise her according to Kalenjin (his tribe)
 tradition if she ever set foot in Rift Valley Province again. Maathai's alleged offense,
 according to Chepkok, was "tribal incitement" for her efforts to raise money to reset-
 tie displaced clash victims. No disciplinary action wa taken against Chepkok, and
 no KANU leader condemned his threat. In rural areas, and often in urban areas
 as well, many women who are victims of rape, domestic violence, and incest are re-
 luctant to provide information about the crime to police authorities or women's orga-
 nizations. Cultural prohibitions against goingoutside clan or ethnic groups with
 such charges is a major cause of what is probably a significant underreporting of
 the number of such attacks. Fear of retaliation is another. While antirape organiza-
 tions and the press now bring a greater number of cases to light, the rate of pros-
 ecution remains very low.
 Children.-In late 1993, the Attorney General announced the formation of a task
 force to draft laws related to children's rights, decrying the absence of protective leg-
 islation. The commission is expected to announce its findings and the Attorney Gen-
 eral is expected to table a draft bill in Parliament in the first half of 1994. Edu-
 cation is the single biggest expenditure in the government budget.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) remains widespread, especially among
 Kenya's nomadic peoples, despite the Government's stated opposition. It is usually
 performed at an early age andhas been condemned by international health experts
 as damaging to both physical and mental health. Neither the Government nor wom-
 en's groups have reliable information about the extent of the problem, but, according
 to an independent expert, the percentage of females who have undergone this proce-
 dure may be as high as 50 percent. In practice, the Government leaves opposition
 to such practices to women's groups, and prosecutions are not made. In September,
 after press reports of a forced genital mutilation of a middle-aged woman in Meru,
 a government minister denounced the act but no further action was taken.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minoriies.-Kenya is an immigrant country. All of its
 major ethnic groups arrived within the last thousand years, conquering or assimilat-
 ing those who were there before. The history of postindependence has been marked
 by ethnic competition and some conflict, but nowhere near the dimensions of the
 clashes which began in 1991 following alarmist statements made by government fig-
 ures. The Kikuyu are the largest ethnic community, comprising approximately 21
 percent of the population. The Luhya, Luo, Kamba, and Kalenjin are the next larg-
 est communities, each making up over 10 percent of the population.
 High level government officials continued to voice strong anti-Kikuyu sentiments,
 aggravating tribal animosities and sparking anti-Kikuyu violence. For example,
 KANU M.P. Shariff Nassir warned Kikuyus against extending their business activi-
 ties to Mombasa.
 Though the Government often accuses opposition political groups of preaching
 "tribalism," government officials are the most vigorous proponents of ethnically
 based attacks. Minister Ntimama made a point of explaining to reporters the dif-
 ference between indigenous and native Kenyans-"indigenous" tribes being those
 like his own Maasai who had a right to live in the Rift Valley, and "native" peoples,
 including the Kikuyu, Luhya, Kisfi, and Luo, who could only live in such areas by
 the sufferance of the indigenous tribes. A number of KANU Rift Valley politicians
 
 
 continued verbal attacks on immigrants to those areas, variously demanding obedi-
 ence to KANU or the Rift Valley's indigenous peoples.
 The Government has singled out ethnic Somalis as the only ethnic group in Kenya
 required to carry an additional form of identification stating that they are Kenyan
 citizens. Ethnic Somalis must still produce upon demand their Kenyan identification
 card and a second identification card verifying "screening." Both cards are also re-
 quired in order to apply for a passport.
 People with Disabilities.-Government policy does not discriminate against people
 with disabilities in employment, education, or other state services. There is no man-
 dated provision of accessibility for the disabled, however. In late 1993, the Attorney
 General appointed a task force to investigate claims of discrimination and to pro-
 pose new legislation protecting the rights of the disabled. The commission is ex-
 pected to complete its work early in 1994.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for central government civil servants and
 academic staff, all workers are free to join unions of their own choosing. As few as
 seven workers may establish a union, provided that objectives of the union do not
 contravene Kenyan law and another union is not already representative of the em-
 ployees in question. The Government may deregister a union, but the Registrar of
 Trade Unions must give the union 60 days to challenge the deregistration notice;
 an appeal of the Registrar's final decision may be brought before the High Court.
 The Kenya Civil Servants Union was deregistered in 1980 by President Moi. The
 Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) has sought since 1989 to reverse this
 decision. The ban was lifted theoretically in 1991, but no action ensued while a gov-
 ernment committee reviewed options. In August a number of Members of ar-
 liament said the union must be reinstated by October, and on September 13, 16 offi-
 cials announced formation of their union and demanded registration by the Govern-
 ment. No further action ensued on the civil servants union.
 There are at least 33 unions in Kenya representing approximately 350,0000 work-
 ers, or about 20 percent of the country's industrialize awork force. Except for the
 150,000 teachers who belong to the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) and
 four other smaller unions, which the Government has registered, all other unions
 are affiliated with one central body, the COTU.
 The Government created COTU in 1965 as the successor to both the Kenya Fed-
 eration of Labor and the Kenya African Workers Congress. This amalgamation was
 effected allegedly to eliminate instability and rivalries within the nation's trade
 union movement.
 The 1965 decree establishing COTU gives the President power to remove from of-
 fice the central body's three senior leaders, and Rule 5 of the COTU constitution
 accords nonvoting membership on COTU's managing body, the executive board, to
 a representative of the Labor Ministry as well as of KANU. Until the COTU "coup"
 of July 2 (see below), however, all secretaries general of unions within COTU, in-
 cluding those who staged the coup, maintained that the COTU-KANU connection
 was obsolete in the multiparty era.
 Early in 1993, COTU Secretary General Joseph Mugalla, a strong supporter of
 KANU and President Moi, responded to a challenge by some union secretaries gen-
 eral and many shop stewards to address the deterioration in socioeconomic condi-
 tions, as the value of the Kenyan shilling had plummeted by some 50 percent. He
 called for an across-the-board 100 percent wage increase and dismissal of Kenyan
 Vice President George Saitoti. The call culminated in a walkout by Minister of
 Labor Masinde during Labor Day ceremonies, the arrest of Mugalla and senior asso-
 ciates on Labor Day, and a 2-day national strike, which was observed in key sectors
 nationwide, even atr the Minister declared it illegal (see also Section 1.d.).
 On July 2, security police blocked off a meeting of the COTU governing council
 at COTU headquarters. Delegates from all over enya returned instead to their
 hotel in the industrial suburb of Ruiru for a briefing and then returned home. A
 splinter group consisting of a small  u  of voting members, however, met at
 U headquarters in Nairobi, with te Minister of Labor and other senior min-
 istry officials present, and claimed to elect new COTU leaders, although the next
 elections were scheduled for 1995. The group was led by KANU stalwarts Johnson
 Ogendo (textiles) and Ali Mohamed (postal workers). Mohamed later justified the ac-
 tion in a letter to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),
 claiming that the Government could not have interfered in COTU because there was
 no distinction between the two.
 Without waiting the normal 7-day period to verify the elections, and disregarding
 a legal challenge by the legitimate COTU leadership, the registrar immediately reg-
 istered the new group. On August 2, a judge lifted a temporary injunction against
 
 
 141
 the new group on grounds that the registrar is an officer of the Government and
 that his action could not be challenged through an injunction. On December 27, the
 High Court ruled that the new group had hijacked a COTU governing body meeting
 to hold elections and ordered the registrar to delete the new entries from the reg-
 ister. This had the effect of reinstating the old leadership, but the Government
 claimed instead that all COTU offices were now vacant. An appeal of the High
 Court ruling by the new group was to be heard in January 1994.
 No international group recognized the new COTU leadership. The ICFTU ordered
 its affiliates to break off contact, and all international bodies ceased giving aid to
 COTU, canceling conferences and seminars scheduled to take place in Kenya.
 Mugalla, a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) governing body,
 attended its meeting in Geneva in September and remained the internationally rec-
 ognized Secretary General of COTU. Government harassment of Mugalla and his
 family as well as those who did not support the July 2 labor "coup" continued (see
 also Section 1.f.).
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike provided that 21 days have
 elapsed following the submission to the Minister of Labor of a written report detail-
 ing the nature of the dispute. During this 21-day period, the Minister may either
 mediate the dispute himself, nominate a person to investigate and propose a solu-
 tion, or refer the matter to the Industrial Court, a body of 5 judges appointed by
 the Preaident for binding arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to mediation, fact
 finding, or arbitration, any subsequent strike is illegal. In 1993 Minister Masinde
 declared illegal several strikes, including a threatened teachers' strike, even when
 the required 21-day notice had been given, on grounds that all other means of re-
 solving the dispute had not yet been exhausted. Kenyan labor legislation is silent
 on the issue of national strikes.
 The military, police, prison guards, and members of the National Youth Service
 are precluded by law from striking. Other civil servants, like their private sector
 counterparts, may strike following the 21-day notice period (28 days if it is an essen-
 tial service, e.g., water, health, education, air traffic control). However, the Labor
 Minister may at any time preempt a strike involving civil servants by referring the
 dispute to the Industrial Court for resolution. The 2-day national strike of May was
 the most important strike action of the year. The Islamic Party of Kenya also held
 a 1-day strike in Mombasa in September, but for political, not socioeconomic, rea-
 sons. A strike by 200,000 teachers set for July 15 was narrowly averted when
 KNUT Secretary General Adongo allowed the issue to go to court, but many teach-
 ers stayed home, angry at the KNUT for having acquiesced to the Government.
 Internationally, COTU is affiliated to both the continentwide Organization of Afri-
 can Trade Union Unity and the ICFTU. Its affiliates are free to establish linkages
 to international trade secretariats of their choosing.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While not having the force
 of law, the 1962 Industrial Relations Charter, executed by the Government, COTU,
 and the Federation of Kenya Employers, gives workers the right to engage in legiti-
 mate trade union organizational activities.
 Both the Trade Disputes Act and the Charter authorize collective bargaining be-
 tween unions and employers. Wages and conditions of employment are established
 in the context of negotiations between unions and management. The Government
 has promulgated wage policy guidelines limiting wage increases to 75 percent of the
 annual rate of inflation. In 1993 COTU called for the removal of wage guidelines.
 Collective bargaining agreements must be registered with the Industrial Court for
 the purpose of guaranteeing adherence to these guidelines. In 1993, 1,875 agree-
 ments were registered with the Court, of which 250 were newly signed in 1993.
 Some 1 million workers (union and nonunion) were covered by these accords.
 The Trade Disputes Act makes it illegal for employers to intimidate workers. Em-
 ployees wrongfully dismissed for union activities are generally awarded damages in
 the form of lost wages by the Industrial Court; reinstatement is not a common rem-
 edy, but in 1993, aer the national strike of May 3-4, most workers won reinstate-
 ment. More often, aggrieved workers have found alternative employment in the
 lengthyperiod prior to the hearing of their cases.
 The ILO's Committee of Experts (COE) observed in its 1993 report that the Gov-
 ernment, in accordance with Article 10 of Convention 143, should promote equality
 of opportunity and treatment for migrant workers, including trade union rights.
 Legislation authorizing the creation of export processing zones (EPZ's) was passed
 in November 1990. The EPZ Authority has taken a gradualist approach to their de-
 velopment and has decided that local labor laws will apply generally in the zones,
 including the right to organize and bargain collectively. In practice, the EPZ Author-
 ity grants many exemptions. For example, the Government is waiving aspects of the
 
 
 law that prevent women from working at night because women prevail in a number
 of industries in the zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, servitude, and forced labor. Under the Chiefs' Authority Act, a local authority
 can require people to perform community services in an emergency, but there were
 no known instances of this practice in 1993. People so employed must be paid the
 prevailing wage for such employment. The COE has found these and other provi-
 sions of Kenyan law to contravene ILO Conventions 29 and 105 concerning forced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment Act of 1976 pro-
 scribes the employment in any industrial undertaking of children under the age of
 16. This enactment applies neither to agricultural sector, where about 70 percent
 of the labor force is employed, nor to children serving as apprentices under the
 terms of the Industrial Training Act. Ministry of Labor officers nominally enforce
 the minimum age statute. Children often Work as domestics in private homes, in
 the informal sector, and in family businesses and farms. Given the high levels of
 adult unemployment and underemployment, the employment of children in the for-
 mal wage sector in violation of the Employment Act is not a significant problem.
 Education is not compulsory in Kenya.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for blue collar work-
 ers in the wage sector varies by location, age and skills, .iith 12 separate scales.
 After a May increase, the lowest minimum monthly wages were $12.25 (833 shil-
 lings) in rural areas and $21.70 (1,476 shillings) in urban areas. Violations of the
 minimum wage guidelines are not a recurring problem in the modern wage sector.
 Despite nominal wage increases, inflation on the order of 25 or 30 percent and a
 decline in the value of the shilling helped erode workers' living standards during
 1993. Most workers continued to lead a marginal existence andhad to rely on sec-
 ond jobs, subsistence farming, or the extended family.
 The Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits the normal
 workweek to 52 hours. Nighttime employees, however, can be employed for up to
 60 hours a week. As is the case with respect to minimum age limitations, the Act
 specificially excludes agricultural workers from its purview. An employee in the non-
 agricultural sector is entitled to 1 day of rest in a week. There are also provisions
 for 1 month of annual leave and sick leave. Kenyan law provides that the total
 hours worked (i.e., regular time plus overtime) in any 2-week period for night work-
 ers may not exceed 144 hours; the limit is 120 hours for other workers. The Min-
 istry of Labor is tasked with enforcing these regulations, and reports of violations
 are few.
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and safety standards; the Act
 was amended in 1990 to encompass the agriculture, service, and government sec-
 tors. The 65 health and safety inspectors attached to the Ministry of Labor's Direc-
 torate of Occupational Health and Safety Services have the authority to inspect fac-
 tories and worksites if they have reason to believe that a violation of the Act has
 occurred, or u on receipt of a complaint from a worker. As a result of the 1990
 amendments, the Directorate's inspectors may now issue notices enjoining employ-
 ers from practices or activities that involve a risk of serious personal injuries. Pre-
 viously, only magistrates were vested with this authority.
 Such notices can be appealed to the Factories Appeals Court, a body of four mem-
 bers, one of whom must be a High Court judge. Factory inspections increased from
 3,000 in 1992 to 16,132 in 1993, due to an ILO-funded project. This altered the pre-
 vious practice of responding only to worker complaints. 'Vhistle blowers" are not
 protected by the Factories Act. Kenya's workmen s compensation regulations do not
 yet comply with provisions of ILO Convention 17.
