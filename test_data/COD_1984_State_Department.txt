 ZAIRE
 Zaire is a centralized one-party state. President Mobutu Sese
 Seko, who seized power in 1965, heads both the Government
 (appointing the Prime Minister and his Cabinet) and the party
 (appointing the members of its highest organ, the central
 committee). The President has the constitutional power to
 promulgate laws by decree. In theory, authority is shared with
 the popularly elected Legislative Council. In practice,
 however, the Parliament rarely disagrees with presidential
 decisions, although decrees are usually preceded by
 consultations with party leaders and legislators.
 The single party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution,
 automatically includes all adult citizens as members. The
 Executive Council (Prime Minister and Council of Ministers),
 the Legislative Council (unicameral Parliament), the judiciary,
 and the only labor union (National Union of Zairian workers)
 are organs of the party. The party-state derives its ideology
 from the ideas and policies of its President-founder, Mobutu
 Sese Seko. A complex of security organizations, notably the
 civilian National Documentation Agency, the gendarmerie, and
 the armed forces (particularly the intelligence branch and the
 Special Presidential Brigade) share responsibilities for
 identifying and controlling potential internal and external
 threats to Zaire and the Mobutu Government. These
 organizations wield broad powers and influence, which allow
 harassment and detention of ordinary citizens as well as
 political opponents of the Government.
 Zaire borders on nine other states, some of which have served
 as bases of operation for secessionist movements and political
 opponents against Zaire. During the transition from the
 colonial era to independent statehood, civil war and anarchy
 overwhelmed the impotent central government. Mobutu's takeover
 in 1965, with the support of the armed forces, enabled the
 central government to consolidate power. The country was
 invaded in 1977 and again in 1978 by rebels based in Angola
 seeking secession of the southern region of Shaba (formerly
 Katanga). Of a lesser magnitude, there was renewed instability
 in 1984, with bombings at the airport, post office, and
 television station in Kinshasa, and the seizure of the town of
 Moba in eastern Zaire for two days by a rebel force in November.
 Zaire has a mixed economy. Though most mining and
 transportation activities are state-owned, private enterprise
 is the rule in the other sectors, with the state often holding
 a minority equity position in larger firms. Individuals are
 permitted to pursue business interests in almost all sectors of
 the economy and are allowed to hold property. Zaire shares the
 economic problems of most sub-Saharan African countries,
 including low income levels and inadequate infrastructure and
 health care. The global recession, compounding more than 10
 years of low-base metal prices, has had a severe effect in
 Zaire. After several unsuccessful attempts, Zaire launched a
 serious, extensive economic reform program in January 1983.
 The human rights situation in 1984 was mixed. Practical limits
 on political expression and dissent continue. Harassment of
 citizens by law enforcement personnel and inordinate delays in
 processing detainees remained serious problems. Still, several
 positive developments occurred which indicate greater
 governmental sensitivity to shortcomings in the human rights

 area. In June, five members of the "Group of 13," former
 parliamentarians who advocated formation of a second political
 party, held a press conference with President Mobutu to
 announce their reintegration into the official party after
 having been arrested in 1982, then banished to their home
 villages in 1983. Nonetheless, several members of the Group of
 13 continue to be confined to their villages. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) resumed its
 program of prison visits in mid-1984, both in Kinshasa and the
 interior, with full cooperation from the Government. Justice.
 ministry officials expanded recent efforts to improve the
 administration of justice at the local level, including a
 series of seminars for magistrates and lawyers on arraignment
 procedures and the rights of detainees. Zaire also continues
 to provide sanctuary to some 300,000 refugees and displaced
 persons from neighboring countries, notably Uganda and Angola.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1984, as in the previous two years, there were no confirmed
 cases of killing for political motives, although reports
 persist that the authorities have carried out such killings.
 The Government denies that it has killed political opponents of
 the regime.
 b. Disappearance
 While rumors of the disappearance of detainees surface from
 time to time, there were no reliable reports that such
 disappearances have, in fact, taken place.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Reports persist of physical abuse in jails and harassment of
 the populace by law enforcement officers. Amnesty
 International, in its report Torture in the Eighties, claimed
 that torture and physical mistreatment of detainees is routine
 in Zairian prisons. Other sources tend to confirm that
 mistreatment of prisoners, particularly beatings at the time of
 arrest and during preliminary interrogation, remains a serious
 problem. The Government does not condone torture and denies
 allegations that torture is administered during interrogation.
 Criminal penalties do not include physical punishment or
 mutilation. However, abuses of all kinds are endemic in
 Zaire's jails and prisons, with reports of unsanitary and
 crowded facilities, malnutrition, and starvation among
 prisoners. The reasons for this situation include lack of
 concern at senior levels, incompetence, corruption, and budget
 reductions imposed as a result of the economic reform program.
 However, there are people working within the Government to
 improve the treatment of prisoners and conditions within penal
 institutions. The Minister of Justice has made highly
 publicized visits to prisons, and administrators charged with
 corruption have been arrested or transferred.
 Discipline among police and soldiers, particularly in remote
 areas of the country, is poor. Underpaid or unpaid police
 
 
 373
 ZAIRE
 abuse their authority by harassing and extorting money from
 civilians. In spite of the popular discontent these practices
 create, security personnel are rarely punished for misconduct.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention remain common
 occurrences, affecting most people who come into contact with
 the criminal justice system. Although habeas corpus and bail
 do not exist, by law those arrested should be brought before a
 magistrate to hear charges within 48 hours of arrest. In
 practice, however, people arrested for whatever reason are
 often held for months without a hearing. Defendants with the
 means are known to buy their way out of detention without ever
 having charges formally filed. Reliable sources estimate that
 from 50 to 70 percent of the prisoners in Zairian jails have
 not been formally processed, much less tried.
 The Government asserts that it holds no political prisoners.
 However, advocacy of a multi-party system or opposition to the
 party-state is unconstitutional. If formally arraigned, most
 political detainees would be charged with subversion or
 .attempts against the security of the state.* Most such
 detainees are not formally charged or tried and remain in
 detention until the President decides to release them. They
 are generally arrested openly, and their whereabouts is
 usually, at least unofficially, known. There are no reports of
 incommunicado detention. Non-judicial sanctions against
 persons whom officials suspect of threatening state security
 are authorized by law and range from administrative detention
 and house arrest to internal exile to native villages and
 restriction of movement and travel. There were no known cases
 of exile or expulsion from the country in 1984.
 Estimates of people detained or sentenced for essentially
 nonviolent expression of political beliefs range from 20 to
 more than 100. As of September 1984, the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had visited 48 individuals
 during the year whom it qualified as security detainees. Six
 of the remaining members of the 'Group of 13' and several
 prominent allies are still in internal exile at their villages
 of origin. Most family members originally restricted to the
 village with them have been free to move since July, although a
 number of them may still be in those villages. Perhaps as many
 as 40 people were arrested in the wake of 2 bombing incidents
 in Kinshasa in March and continue to be held without benefit of
 trial. The Government maintains that these individuals are
 terrorists, but those allegations have not been submitted to a
 court. The best estimate of the number of political prisoners
 is approximately 50.
 Both the Justice Ministry and the bar association have launched
 efforts to improve the system of administering justice, with
 emphasis on reducing the number of detainees and the length of
 detention. The first compilation of judicial codes and rules
 of civil, criminal, and military procedures ever prepared in
 Zaire is now being published, joining the penal code which was
 first published in 1983. Training teams composed of jurists
 and law professors visited all regions in 1984 to educate local
 magistrates and lawyers on proper procedures and the rights of
 an accused to a prompt hearing. The bar association has opened
 a public office in Kinshasa, in an effort to reach and educate
 people on their legal rights, and is trying to expand this
 
 
 374
 ZAIRE
 activity to other regions. However, it will take time and
 improved economic conditions before such steps make major
 inroads on the abuses caused by those magistrates and police
 officials who are poorly trained, unmotivated, and corrupt.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants are guaranteed by the Constitution the right to a
 public trial and defense counsel. In practice, however, most
 citizens are not aware of those rights, and there are
 insufficient lawyers in Zaire to provide adequate counsel to
 more than a minority of defendants. When available, defense
 counsel generally function freely and without coercion from the
 Government.
 The fairness of trials is uneven. Poorly paid magistrates are
 known to accept bribes, and it is essentially those unable to
 pay who are subject to the full rigor of the judicial system.
 Most defendants who are aware of their rights avail themselves
 of the right to appeal. Decisions of the court of state
 security (i.e., those involving national security, armed
 robbery, and smuggling) are not subject to appeal, although all
 other procedural protections of the criminal code do apply.
 Military court procedures also do not provide for appeal.
 Although normally military courts try only cases involving
 military personnel, in time of emergency or during military
 operations the President can suspend civilian courts and
 transfer jurisdiction over all cases to military courts. There
 is no indication that any civilian courts were so suspended in
 1984.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The party and state security organizations extend down to
 neighborhood level, and both maintain liaison offices in all
 government agencies (including military units, universities,
 legislative council, ministries, etc.). All Zairians 18 years
 or older are automatically members of the party. Party
 officials, civil servants, armed forces personnel,
 parliamentarians, and employees of state enterprises pay an
 obligatory tax to support the activities of the party's major
 organs (cadre training, mobilization, propaganda, and youth).
 These party cadres are also required to attend the party's
 training institute. Non-attendance can result in reprimands
 and suspensions. Government employees, market women, and
 blue-collar workers are often required to participate in public
 events--parades, official arrival and departure ceremonies,
 etc.--or risk being suspended from work.
 Mail is opened sporadically by security services, some
 telephone conversations are tapped, and government informers
 monitor places of residence as well as work. In line with the
 party-state's ideology of 'Zairian authenticity,' Zairian men
 are forbidden to wear ties and women to wear pants or wigs.
 Zairians are also forbidden to use non-African names.
 Judicial warrants are required by law before the police are
 permitted to search a home, except in cases of threats to
 national security. In practice, however, police and security
 authorities enter and search without such warrants. In civil
 cases where defendants have been found guilty of fraud or
 
 
 375
 ZAIRE
 embezzlement from the Government, their property and homes can
 be seized and confiscated without reimbursement.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees the right of every citizen to
 express freely his opinions and feelings, whether orally or in
 writing, but qualifies that and all other rights by the need to
 ensure *public order and good conduct."
 Radio and television are owned and operated by the state. The
 two major newspapers are privately owned but depend upon
 significant government subsidies to survive. Publishers and
 editors are members of the party. The media are expected to
 promote party ideals and principles. Commentary on politically
 sensitive internal issues as well as on foreign policy options
 is discouraged, and direct criticism of the President is
 forbidden. While journalists are circumspect in their
 criticism of other high officials as well, criticism of certain
 government practices, inadequate services, and corrupt
 officials frequently appears in print.
 Media censorship tends to be self-imposed. Journalists must be
 members of the press union in order to practice their
 profession, and the threat of ouster from the union and
 consequent loss of livelihood reinforces self-censorship.
 Journalists whose writings are considered offensive have been
 promptly punished, although no such disciplinary actions
 occurred in 1984. There are several clandestine presses which
 operate sporadically, printing flyers and handbills critical of
 the Government and ruling elite. Theater, songs, and organized
 street gossip are important forms of communicating popular
 opinions and news.
 Artistic and academic freedom of expression are subject to the
 same restrictions and self-censorship as the press. Mandatory
 membership in professional organizations and well-developed
 informer networks serve to discourage dissent. From time to
 time, books, records, films, and certain issues of magazines
 are banned. Imported publications, including books and
 periodicals, are subject to censorship if they are critical of
 Zaire or its Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only the party and its affiliates may hold public meetings.
 The Government permits the existence of non-political
 associations, although these have had meetings disrupted on
 occasion by government agents because of suspected political
 activities. The Government also requires that civic
 organizations notify authorities when they plan meetings or
 activities involving more than five people. It can also
 prohibit meetings which continue after 9:00 p.m.
 The labor movement in Zaire is confined to one confederation,
 the National Union of Zairian Workers, which is a
 semiautonomous unit of the party. The Secretary General is a
 member of the party's central committee and union officials at
 the regional level serve on regional party committees. The
 union provides significant social and educational services to
 members and their families, and it works with the Government to
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 25
 
 
 376
 ZAIRE
 improve workers' benefits. It is very limited in its ability
 to promote worker interests which differ from those of the
 Government and party. The right to strike is embodied in the
 labor law, but in practice sanctioned strikes have not
 occurred. The law establishes lengthy arbitration and appeal
 procedures, during the course of which most labor disputes are
 resolved. There were short strikes in several sectors of the
 economy during 1984 which succeeded in focusing government and
 management attention on union concerns.
 At its 1983 session, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 in Geneva cited the Government of Zaire for not being in
 conformity with ILO Convention 29 pertaining to forced labor.
 This citation stemmed from Zairian legislation providing for
 compulsory civilian service for graduates from pedagogical and
 technical institutes, as well as for a government ordinance
 providing for imprisonment with compulsory labor for tax
 defaultors.
 The over 800,000 workers employed in the public and private
 sectors are members of the confederation and pay dues to it.
 However, about 55 percent of Zairian workers are employed in
 unregulated small commerce and agriculture and are not covered
 by the union. The leaders of the confederation, who are also
 party members, ensure that relations with international labor
 organizations are kept consistent with general Zairian foreign
 policy. The union participates actively in the International
 Labor Organization and the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity, and maintains relations with various foreign trade union
 confederations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Zairians enjoy freedom of religion, and there were no reports
 in 1984 of government interference, in contrast to past years
 when the Government banned or harassed religious groups or
 activities considered to present a political challenge. The
 Government officially sanctions most of the major world
 religions, and established procedures exist for new churches to
 obtain legal recognition. Traditional religious groups are
 tolerated but not officially recognized. The major religions
 in Zaire are: Catholicism--50 percent, Protestantism
 (including Kimbanguism)--36 percent, and Islam--5 percent.
 Recognized religions are free to establish places of worship
 and to train clergy. Expatriate missionaries are allowed to
 proselytize and to serve both Zairian and expatriate
 congregations. Most churches maintain active links with
 coreligionists outside the country. Religious affiliation
 confers neither advantage nor disadvantage in secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Zaire is unrestricted, although the Government
 does impose the non-judicial sanction of restriction to
 villages of origin against some dissidents. All citizens,
 refugees, and permanent residents must carry government-issued
 identity cards, and police and military personnel often set up
 checkpoints along major roads to inspect papers. Those whose
 papers are not in order pay a fine or spend time in jail. In
 principle, any Zairian citizen may obtain a passport and exit
 visa, although on occasion government and security officials
 have impeded issuance in order to prevent or disrupt travel of
 
 
 377
 ZAIRE
 those suspected of political opposition. A married woman must
 have her husband's authorization before obtaining a passport,
 but she need not have his approval to travel.
 In May 1984 there were approximately 50,000 Zairians living as
 refugees in neighboring countries. Refugees-have returned
 under amnesties declared in 1978 and 1983, and negotiations
 occur sporadically with Angola (20,000), Zambia (9,000), and
 Tanzania (15,000) for the repatriation of additional refugees.
 It is likely that many of these refugees could return to Zaire
 if they wished. A number of prominent opponents of the
 Government live in self-imposed exile in Europe.
 In May 1984, Zaire was providing safehaven to some 300,000
 refugees from neighboring countries. Generally, refugees pass
 freely into Zaire and are allowed to seek employment or settle
 on farms. They tend to become self-sufficient and integrated
 into the Zairian economic system within a few years of
 arrival. The Government considers them to be resettled until
 such time as they may decide to return to their country of
 origin. The Zairian Government does not have the resources to
 provide assistance to refugees, and they depend on the
 international community for what help they receive. Refugees
 sometimes suffer, as do Zairian citizens, from harassment by
 ill-disciplined military personnel. At times, political
 refugees from neighboring countries (particularly Angola) have
 been detained for long periods on suspicion of subversion.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The key instruments of power in Zaire are highly centralized
 and controlled by the President. The government party (The
 Popular Movement of the Revolution) is the sole political party
 permitted under the Constitution. The state functions
 essentially as a basic organ of the party. Party congresses
 meet every five years under the guidance of the President to
 set national political guidelines which are then supplemented
 by resolutions of the party's central committee. These
 policies are executed by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who
 are appointed by the President.
 Efforts by a group of ex-parliamentarians to establish a second
 political party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress,
 have been dealt with harshly. Thirteen leaders of the group
 were arrested in 1982, released from prison in the 1983
 amnesty, but relegated to internal exile in November 1983. In
 1984, 5 of the 13 made their peace with President Mobutu and
 were freed. Six of the remaining eight are still in internal
 exile, with one out of the country and the other apparently at
 liberty.
 Suffrage is universal over age 18 and voting is mandatory,
 enforced by threat of arrest and fine. In 1982, direct popular
 elections were held for the first time for municipal councils,
 rural zone councils, and urban zone councils. The Legislative
 Council is elected every five years, with the most recent
 election in 1982. All candidates are screened by the party's
 central committee, but voters had a choice of an average of
 five approved candidates per district in the last parliamentary
 elections. The President serves for 7 years, and President
 Mobutu, as the only candidate, was reelected in 1984 to a third
 term with 99.64 percent of the vote.
 
 
 378
 ZAIRE
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains that Zaire has nothing to hide in
 terms of human rights policies, and it denies charges of
 systematic or serious violations. Its attitude toward external
 investigation of alleged human rights violations has been
 mixed. The International Committee of the Red Cros (ICRC) has
 worked in Zaire for several years, although at times its access
 has been restricted. In early 1984 there was a period when the
 ICRC was not permitted to visit all prisons, but this was
 resolved in a July meeting between President Mobutu and ICRC
 officials. Since then, the ICRC delegation in Zaire has
 visited civilian and military prisons in Kinshasa and the
 interior.
 The Amnesty International 1984 Report expresses concern over
 reports of detention without trial of suspected opponents of
 the regime, of torture or beating of political detainees, and
 the deliberate killing or starvation of criminal suspects.
 Amnesty International alleges that at the end of 1983 over 100
 people were imprisoned or restricted for political reasons.
 The Government contends that the Amnesty International reports
 are inaccurate and based on misinformation from Zairian
 dissidents in Europe, and it has not allowed the organization's
 representatives to visit the country since July 1982. Freedom
 House rates Zaire *not free."
 In May 1984 the Government agreed to allow the Paris-based
 League of Human Rights to visit the country. However, when it
 became clear that the purpose was to visit those dissidents who
 had been relegated to their villages of origin, the visit was
 not allowed.
 Although Zaire has been a member of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission (until 1983) and other international forums for
 dealing with human rights issues, it has not played a leading
 role. The Government has hewed to a consistent position that
 international action in the field of human rights should be
 strictly circumscribed by the principle of non-interference in
 the internal affairs of sovereign states. Zaire has not been
 singled out for particular attention in inter-governmental
 human rights forums.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Zaire is sub-Saharan Africa's second largest country in area
 and third largest in population (32 million). The annual
 population growth rate is approximately 2.9 percent, and the
 per capita gross domestic product was estimated at $187 in
 1982, although this figure does not take into account the
 subsistence economy for which no figures are available.
 Because of low capital investment and poor maintenance, Zaire's
 basic infrastructure, particularly transportation, marketing,
 and communications, has deteriorated steadily since
 independence.
 At the end of 1982 the Government instituted a stringent
 economic and financial recovery program developed with the
 assistance of the IMF. Zaire has adhered to that program for
 two years, implementing measures to liberalize its economy and
 instituting management reforms. Price liberalization has
 
 
 379
 ZAIRE
 encouraged greater food production. Limiting public
 expenditures and employment is another reform measure. While
 there are now signs the economy is beginning to recover after
 more than a decade of decline, the short-term social and
 economic effects of the measures have aggravated the already
 precarious economic circumstances of many people. The ability
 of any reform program to have an immediate and marked positive
 effect in Zaire is limited by the country's structural
 shortcomings: transportation, public health, and education are
 key sectors where change will happen only over time, although
 some improvement in the rural standard of living appears
 already under way.
 Unemployment and underemployment are serious problems. Since
 independence the percentage of rural population engaged in
 subsistence agriculture has increased to the present 75
 percent. During the past several years industry has operated
 at only 30 to 40 percent of capacity. Since remuneration in
 the public service sector is inadequate and sporadic, many
 civil servants must supplement their incomes through commercial
 activities. Low salaries and job insecurity have also
 contributed to corruption in the government and military. Low
 wage levels will remain a problem, although government reforms
 include a new minimum agricultural wage, a higher minimum
 industrial wage, and revision of the government's personnel
 system to provide comparable pay for comparable work throughout
 the military and civil service.
 Reflecting malnutrition and other health problems, the infant
 mortality rate in 1984 was 107.6 per 1,000, and the life
 expectancy at birth 50.5 years. Health care is curative rather
 than preventive and is extremely limited in quality and
 availability in both urban and rural areas. On average, in
 1976 only 16 percent of the population had access to safe
 water, with the figure for rural areas as low as 5 percent.
 The literacy rate in Zaire for persons over 15 varies
 regionally, but was estimated at 55 percent in 1980.
 Approximately 37 percent of women are literate. Four times as
 many boys as girls are enrolled in primary schools. Lack of
 books and supplies, high dropout rates at all levels, teacher
 strikes, poor teacher quality and, most recently, serious
 reductions in teaching and research staff have contributed to a
 declining quality of education at all levels throughout the
 country. Unofficial regional and ethnic quotas designed to
 protect various ethnic groups from exclusion are implemented in
 the university system.
 The role of women in Zairian society is given great emphasis in
 party doctrine. Women's rights to own property and participate
 in the political and economic sectors are protected by law, and
 a growing number of women work in the professions, government
 service, and the universities. Nevertheless, custom,
 tradition, and existing law continue to constrain women from
 attaining a position of complete equality in society. Women
 generally earn less than their male counterparts in the same
 jobs. In addition, married women must obtain their husband's
 authorization before opening a bank account, accepting a job,
 or renting or selling real estate.
