 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is a centralized Communist
 state in which the party leadership decides all important
 political, economic, and social questions and limits the scope
 of individual human rights. Although the Constitution
 guarantees freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and religion,
 these rights do not generally exist in practice. Independent
 associations are not permitted in Czechoslovakia; all labor
 unions, professional associations, and even amateur groups are
 controlled by the Communist Party and subordinated to it.
 There has been virtually no change in the state and party
 leadership during the last 16 years.
 Czechoslovakia has a large, well-funded security establishment,
 directed by the Ministry of the Interior and the party
 hierarchy. It includes uniformed police (public security) who
 are similar to Western police forces, and the secret police
 (State Security), who deal with people they judge to be past,
 present, or futuro opponents of the regime. This powerful
 internal securi-ty force--backed by the Czechoslovak Army and
 the 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in the country since
 1968--is-the main pillar of the Government's control.
 Czechoslovakia's centrally planned economy allows little or no
 private enterprise or ownership in manufacturing, retail
 operations, agriculture, or services. In recent years, the
 economy has stagnated, burdened by excessive central planning,
 obsolete equipment and infrastructure, and a lack of
 incentives for innovation and initiative.
 The human rights situation in Czechoslovakia changed little in
 1986. In September police arrested the entire leadership of
 the Jazz Section of the Prague branch of the Union of
 Musicians. Since the late 1970's, the Jazz Section,
 originally a legally constituted association of jazz fans, has
 had to engage in a struggle with state authorities over its
 continued existence. At this time, five of the seven members
 of the leadership (two in ill health were released in
 December) remain in jail, charged with "unauthorized
 enterprising," but no trial date has been set.
 In their dealings with the population, the authorities
 continue to make free use of various forms of repression,
 ,including: frequent house searches, detentions, and
 interrogations; suspended prison sentences and "protective
 supervision"; intrusive surveillance and other forms of
 psychological pressure; discrimination in employment; and
 denial of educational opportunities to the children of persons
 deemed opponents of the regime. As in previous years, the
 harshest repression has been directed at religious activists
 and at those individuals and groups who monitor human rights
 abuses in Czechoslovakia.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Every year, Czechoslovak and other East European citizens are
 fired upon and sometimes killed by Czechoslovak border guards
 while trying to cross the frontier without official
 permission. These incidents often do not come to public
 attention unless the victims reach the West or the shootings
 
 
 889
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 occur on Western soil, so it is impossible to estimate the
 number of fatalities that result.
 Two separate occurrences during late September demonstrate
 Czechoslovak harshness in preventing even potential
 unauthorized border crossings. In one instance, border guards
 reportedly pursuing Polish citizens trying to cross into the
 West shot and killed a citizen of the Federal Republic of
 Germany on West German territory and held his body for 4 days,
 returning it without organs and tissues that might have
 revealed the circumstances of the killing. In a second
 incident, Czechoslovak guards seized an Austrian pensioner on
 Austrian territory and held him for 7 hours before forcing him
 to sign a false and incriminating protocol.
 There were no reports of other political killings by the
 police in 1986. However, political activists continue to
 report occasional intimidating police warnings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of systematic torture in
 Czechoslovak prisons since the early 1960's. Many former
 prisoners credit this to the influence of President Husak, who
 himself suffered long years of imprisonment and mistreatment
 in the 1950's. There have been, however, reports of beatings,
 threats, and intimidation during interrogation. Reports of
 mistreatment have been most frequent in political cases.
 Prison conditions are poor and sometimes approach the level of
 cruel and inhuman treatment. This is especially true under
 the "third category" of imprisonment (the harshest regime).
 In general, cells are small and unheated, family visits are
 strictly limited, and prisoners report such punishments as
 reduction in pay and limitations on free time, bathing, and
 exercise periods if they fail to meet unrealistically high
 work standards. Informed sources report that prisoners are
 assigned unpleasant and hazardous work which normal workers
 refuse to perform. Inmates are occasionally given such
 health-threatening assignments as polishing crystal and
 costume jewelry in environments lacking sufficient ventilation
 to prevent glass fragments and chemicals from being inhaled.
 Sanitary facilities, diet, and medical facilities are reliably
 reported to be deficient. Former prisoners have reported that
 prison guards sometimes encourage hardened criminals to prey
 on persons serving sentences for political offenses.
 Prisoners or former prisoners who complain publicly of
 mistreatment have been severely punished, sometimes being tried
 and sentenced anew for "offenses" deriving from this activity.
 Several cases of misuse of psychiatry for political purposes
 have been alleged in recent years, including that of religious
 activist Augustine Navratil. Navratil was detained in
 November 1985 for distributing Catholic samizdat
 (self-published) literature. In December 1985, he was
 remanded to the closed section of a psychiatric facility in
 Prague and in March 1986 was transferred to a psychiatric
 institution in Kromeriz. In September a court rejected
 Navratil's request for termination of psychiatric treatment
 but decreed that he might be treated on an out-patient basis.
 
 
 890
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The state prosecutor objected to that decision, and Navratil
 was not released into ambulatory treatment until late
 October. The decision to release Navratil may be reversed at
 any time, however. Helsinki Watch reported that Stefan
 Javorsky, a Catholic priest charged in 1986 with conducting
 unauthorized church activities, was ordered by security police
 to undergo psychiatric examination and was to report to a
 psychiatric facility. In its July 1983 meeting, the World
 Psychiatric Association accused Czechoslovakia of misusing
 psychiatry for political purposes. Czechoslovakia thereupon
 resigned its membership in the organization.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Czechoslovak citizens are frequently arrested, detained, or
 subjected to searches and interrogations for expression of
 views contrary to those of the regime. Judicial and police
 authorities often explain such actions in legal terms and
 perform them with warrants. They have also, however, been
 carried out without warrants. Under the law, a person may be
 detained for up to 48 hours without being charged, although in
 practice this limit is not strictly observed. It is normal
 for political activists to be detained repeatedly and then
 released without the filing of charges. Searches, detentions,
 and frequent interrogations are among the tactics used by the
 regime when it has decided to harass rather than to prosecute.
 According to law, a detainee may be held in investigative
 detention for 60 days if the authorities decide tu press
 charges. A detainee lacks the right to have visits by family
 members until after his or her trial is over. Investigative
 detention may be and often is extended at the request of the
 prosecution, and detainees are occasionally held for long
 periods without being brought to trial. For example, Jan Dus,
 an Evangelical minister without state license and a Charter 77
 signatory, was arrested on May 20, 1986, and has been held
 awaiting trial since then.
 People arrested for expressing views opposed by the regime are
 generally charged with "subversion," "incitement," "defamation
 of the Republic," or "damaging the interests of the Republic
 abroad." Czechoslovak citizens who have unauthorized contacts
 with foreign diplomats or who frequent embassies and their
 libraries have on occasion been charged with "espionage."
 Those arrested for religious activities are usually charged
 with "obstructing state supervision over churches and religious
 societies." Many of these articles of the criminal code are
 sufficiently elastic to encompass almost any activity. In
 certain instances, the authorities have also resorted to
 trumped-up criminal charges (e.g., "hooliganism" or "stealing
 Socialist property") to punish those whose real offense was to
 engage in unauthorized political or cultural activity.
 The Czechoslovak authorities have not formally imposed
 internal exile or house arrest in Czechoslovakia since the
 1950's. In 1984, though, for the first time, the Government
 introduced a regime of "protective supervision," which
 combines features of both. Former political prisoners
 currently subjected to this regime include Ladislav Lis, Jiri
 Gruntorad, Petr Cibulka, and Ivan Jirous. Protective
 supervision brings to bear travel restrictions, curfews,
 frequent searches of persons, homes, and guests, and the
 obligation to report regularly to the police. Ladislav Lis,
 for example, has had to report to the police as frequently as
 10 times a week. He has suffered lengthy house searches
 
 
 891
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 occurring 3 to 5 times a week, and he has had many of his
 visitors detained, taken away for questioning, and otherwise
 harassed. The imposition of such a regime, intended for
 habitually violent offenders, against persons who have never
 committed or advocated an act of violence is clearly aimed at
 isolating them from contact with the outside world.
 The Government has also turned to forced exile in order to rid
 itself of critics. In numerous cases, people who had been
 working or visiting abroad with official permission have been
 stripped of citizenship and refused the right to return. The
 authorities have had recourse to something approaching forced
 exile in cases involving people who have already served a jail
 sentence. Upon their release, or while they are still in
 prison, such persons are pressured to emigrate. If they
 refuse, they and their families suffer harassment, denial of
 jobs and schooling, and the threat of rearrest. Frequently,
 after a year or more of this treatment, these ex-prisoners
 apply for emigration passports.
 Forced labor does not exist in Czechoslovakia, but "work
 education" is required of prisoners. Former prisoners report
 that convicts face higher norms, lower pay, and poorer working
 conditions than do ordinary workers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 According to Czechoslovak law, people charged with criminal
 offenses are entitled to fair and open public trials. The law
 provides that accused persons have a right to be informed
 concerning the charges against them, to retain counsel, and to
 present a defense. Actual practice is quite different,
 however, especially where political offenses are concerned.
 Defendants may choose their lawyers, and court-appointed
 lawyers are available if required. However, lawyers, like
 judges, are subject to direct and indirect pressures from
 political authorities, and they do not always vigorously
 represent their clients. Defense attorneys who have defended
 their clients with vigor have in some cases been disbarred and
 occasionally prosecuted. Defendants do exercise their right
 to defend themselves in court and occasionally get charges
 dismissed or reduced at the original trial. Thereafter, an
 appeal filed by the prosecution may, however, result in an
 increase in the sentence or in additional charges.
 In contrast to previous years, 1986 saw friends of defendants,
 representatives of the press, and diplomats gain access to a
 number of trials with political content.
 The judiciary is not independent of the regime and the
 Communist Party. In theory, judges can be removed only by the
 Federal Assembly (parliament) or by the Czech or Slovak
 National Council. In practice, they are subject to direct
 control and supervision by the party, to which most judges and
 ambitious lawyers must belong.
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 difficult to estimate. The Czechoslovak Government does not
 recognize political prisoners as a separate category and does
 not release figures on its prison population. The only
 figures available are those from the Committee for the Defense
 of the Unjustly Persecuted (VONS), which to the best of its
 ability documents individual cases. By VONS's own count, at
 least 36 prisoners whose cases it had been following were in
 
 
 892
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 prison in December 1986. However, VONS does not monitor
 certain categories of political prisoners, such as those
 sentenced for attempts to leave Czechoslovakia without
 official permission. The number of such prisoners--most of
 whom serve terms of 1 to 2 years--has been variously estimated
 at between 200 and 800.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government accords itself the right to monitor and control
 the leisure-time activities of its citizens. Consequently, it
 also interferes with privacy of communications.
 Those who are considered opponents of the regime bear the
 brunt of heavily intrusive surveillance. They, their
 families, and their friends are routinely subjected to such
 measures as electronic surveillance, tapping of telephones,
 and interception and destruction of mail. Discrimination in
 education and employment is a regular aspect of the harassment
 and persecution of families of dissidents and religious
 activities. Fear that their children will be denied higher
 education is a major factor in preventing open dissent among
 intellectuals and white-collar workers.
 A special problem exists for religious believers who wish to
 raise their children in their faith. Organization of
 religious instruction or of ceremonies in private homes is
 forbidden. Parents must obtain the permission of local
 authorities if their children are to receive religious
 education at school. School authorities warn parents that
 participation in religious classes could be damaging to a
 child's education and career prospects.
 Contacts with persons and organizations in the West and
 receipt of information from the West are discouraged.
 Czechoslovaks in many professions are required to file a
 report each time they have a conversation with a Westerner.
 Broadcasts of Radio Free Europe in Czech and Slovak are jammed
 in Prague and in other major cities, although they often can
 be heard in rural areas. Other Western radio broadcasts are
 not jammed. Many people who live near the country's western
 or southern borders can receive West German or Austrian
 television broadcasts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 of the press, it also states that these freedoms must be
 exercised "in accordance with the interests of the working
 class." In effect, individuals may not publicly voice
 opinions that differ from party policy or that question the
 legitimacy of party rule, the fundamental principles of the
 "Socialist" State, or the regime's relationship with the
 Soviet Union. Likewise, political directives severely limit
 academic freedom.
 All newspapers and magazines are published and controlled by
 political parties or mass organizations of the National Front
 (e.g., the Youth League, Revolutionary Trade Union Movement,
 or Sports Federation). These in turn are controlled by the
 Communist Party. Legal religious literature and periodicals
 are subject to strict censorship and are published only in
 
 
 893
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 limited editions. Publishing houses and the news media, all
 state-owned, employ self-censorship under Communist Party
 guidelines. Editors who are insufficiently vigilant suffer
 fines or dismissal. Writers who wish to publish must belong
 to the state-controlled Union of Writers.
 Only a limited number of Western non-Communist periodicals
 penetrate into the country, and these are beyond the reach of
 ordinary citizens. Since the early 1970's, libraries have
 restricted access to Western publications of a political
 character to those individuals who have obtained special
 permission from their employers or their universities,
 documenting their need for the material for official purposes.
 Periodicals such as Time and Newsweek are locked in cabinets
 controlled by special personnel. Books and periodicals
 published during the 1968-69 period or other publications
 considered ideologically "harmful" are subject to similar
 controls.
 Printing and photocopying equipment, except typewriters, is
 under the control of the Interior Ministry and cannot be
 legally obtained by private citizens. Despite these
 restrictions, a lively underground samizdat (self-published)
 press publishes a variety of fiction and nonfiction, usually
 in very small editions. Some of it is sent abroad, where it
 is reprinted in 6migr6 publishing houses and then brought back
 to Czechoslovakia in larger editions. Those arrested for
 literary activities in 1986 included, but were not limited to,
 Jaroslav Svestka, who was sentenced to 1 year in prison for
 subversion in connection with his attempt to forward excerpts
 of the book "Orwell's Year" to a friend in the West; Herman
 Chromy, who was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment for
 subversion because of his own writing as well as the
 discussion of his political views and distribution of printed
 materials at his workplace; and Jan Dus, the Evangelical
 minister mentioned earlier, who is awaiting trial on charges
 related to aspects of Chromy's case.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution theoretically grants freedom of
 assembly, that freedom does not exist in practice. Public
 meetings may be held only with the permission of the police,
 and this permission is given only when the meeting supports
 state objectives. When the authorities wish to have a large
 rally (May Day or "peace" demonstrations), people are often
 pressured to attend.
 Lectures and film showings in private homes may also be
 subject to dispersal or other police controls--such as denial
 of access to invited guests--if the authorities object to
 their subject matter or participants. In July 1986, the
 authorities prevented U.S. Senator Larry Pressler from meeting
 with Czechoslovak citizens active in monitoring the human
 rights situation in Czechoslovakia. In September police
 allowed dramatist and Charter 77 figure Vaclav Havel to host
 an event dedicated to his selection as the 1986 Erasmus Prize
 honoree, but refused entry to many invited guests.
 Spontaneous independent associations are not permitted in
 Czechoslovakia. The Government's unwillingness to tolerate
 independent initiatives on the part of these organizations is
 to be seen in its treatment of the Jazz Section of the
 Musicians Union. This once legally constituted association of
 7,000 jazz fans throughout Czechoslovakia formerly organized
 
 
 894
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 jazz festivals and sponsored publications on music and the
 arts for its members. In March 1985, the Jazz Section was
 dissolved under a 1968 statute banning "counterrevolutionary
 activity." Leaders of the Section protested and addressed a
 series of letters and petitions to the authorities. Their
 actions brought down upon them surveillance, interrogations,
 loss of employment, and other forms of harassment. Because of
 its international status as a member of the UNESCO-affiliated
 International Jazz Federation and because of growing Western
 public attention to its struggle, the Jazz Section was able to
 continue operating for a time.
 In September 1986, Jazz Section offices and its leaders'
 apartments and places of employment were raided by police, who
 confiscated approximately 800 books, several hundred
 magazines, and the Section's records. Seven members of the
 Jazz Section, including its leadership, were arrested and
 charged with "unauthorized enterprising." Although two of the
 Section's leaders in ill health were released in December,
 five colleagues remain in detention, awaiting the State's
 decision as to whether or not to prosecute,
 In another example, on May 26, 1986, the preparatory committee
 of a proposed organization to be named "Young Art for Peace"
 submitted a request for approval of its bylaws to the Ministry
 of Interior. The organization was intended, within the
 framework of the National Front, to bring together young
 people in the "quest for peace" and at the same time to assist
 in "the development of moral values." Reportedly through
 indirect pressures, the security forces convinced the
 preparatory committee to withdraw its request on June 5.
 Czechoslovak workers do not-have the right to establish and
 join organizations of-their own choosing without previous
 authorization. An attempt to establish an independent trade
 union in the early 1980's was suppressed. Membership in
 official trade unions or professional associations is
 virtually obligatory for workers and for those seeking to
 practice a profession. Communist Party membership is an
 unwritten, but commonly acknowledged, prerequisite for nearly
 all higher-level jobs.
 The Czechoslovak labor union umbrella organization, the
 Revolutionary Workers' Movement (ROH), is a mass
 organization strictly controlled by the Communist Party.
 Strikes, independent organizing efforts, and collective
 bargaining are not permitted under the Czechoslovak system.
 The ROH is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade
 Unions, whose headquarters are in Prague.
 The Constitution guarantees the right and duty to work. In
 practice, persons who are considered politically unreliable
 are barred from professional positions and forced into menial,
 low-paid jobs such as coal stokers and nightwatchmen. This
 practice has been condemned by the International Labor
 Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion, guaranteed in the Constitution, is
 strictly limited in practice. "Scientific atheism" is part of
 the official ideology, and the regime actively discourages all
 religious activity, especially among the young. Teachers,
 policemen, Communist Party officials, and members of certain
 other professions encounter problems in their careers if they
 
 
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 are seen in church. Higher education is often denied to
 active believers and to their children. For many years, no
 new Catholic church buildings have been approved for
 construction. However, some Protestant congregations--
 including Baptists--have been allowed to build new churches.
 The Government exercises strict control over all religious
 activity. A church must be officially registered in order to
 function legally in Czechoslovakia. Groups which proselytize,
 such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, are banned outright,
 and their members suffer frequent harassment and arrest.
 Jehovah's Witnesses have been reported in several prisons, but
 there is no reliable estimate of their number.
 In 1986 Helsinki Watch reported several instances of official
 harassment of religious figures. Stefan Javorsky, a Catholic
 priest, was sentenced to 12 months in prison for "obstructing
 state supervision of churches and religious societies" by
 celebrating private masses and hearing confessions without a
 state permit. Catholic priest Bystrik Janik was sentenced to
 28 months in prison for religious activities without state
 authorization. Milos Reichert, an Evangelical Protestant
 minister and human rights activist, complained to the
 Government of police harassment, including confiscation of
 copies of a religious book.
 Organized religious practice is hampered by both written and
 unwritten restrictions. Clergymen are paid by the State and
 must receive a state license in order to practice. Such
 licenses can be--and are--withdrawn without explanation.
 Estimates of the number of clergymen who have lost their
 licenses vary, but they are known to include several bishops.
 Those who continue to practice despite revocation of their
 licenses are liable to criminal prosecution.
 The Czechoslovak record in facilitating travel by religious
 officials to and from Czechoslovakia is spotty. When the
 proposed visit serves the purpose of the State and takes place
 between an officially recognized institution in Czechoslovakia
 and its counterpart elsewhere, visas are often granted. In
 the case of the Catholic Church, however, the Government has
 followed an extremely restrictive policy. Pope John Paul II
 has not been permitted to visit Czechoslovakia, despite an
 invitation from Cardinal Tomasek and petitions signed by
 thousands of Czech and Slovak Catholics. Similarly, Catholic
 priests and other religious leaders who manifest too great
 independence are frequently denied permission to travel
 outside the country.
 Unofficial or unsanctioned travel by religious groups for
 purposes the Government considers illegal--e.g., importing
 religious literature or objects, conducting religious training,
 and similar activities--is severely punished.
 The Roman Catholic Church is the largest of Czechoslovakia's
 18 officially registered religious bodies. There are an
 estimated 8 to 11 million Roman Catholics in the country, and
 up to 450,000 members of the affiliated Greek Catholic
 (Uniate) Church. The Greek Catholic Church was reestablished
 in 1968 after having been forcibly united with the much
 smaller Orthodox Church in 1950. However, the Greek Catholics
 have been unable to reclaim their property, which remains in
 the possession of the Orthodox Church.
 
 
 896
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Students in Czechoslovakia's two remaining Catholic seminaries
 (out of a prewar total of 13) need state approval to be
 admitted and ordained. In addition, the State must approve
 each priest's assignment to a parish or higher office. As a
 result of these restrictions, many priests have to cover more
 than one parish, and only 3 of 13 dioceses have resident
 bishops.
 In 1950 all male religious orders were dissolved. A few
 female religious orders were allowed to continue functioning,
 but they were prevented from accepting new members, except
 during a brief interlude in 1968. Despite these limitations,
 some Catholic monastic orders have continued to operate
 clandestinely, with members making occasional public
 appearances.
 "Pacem in Terris," the state-sponsored "peace association" of
 clergy, has been a major instrument of state control over the
 Catholic Church since it was founded in 1970. The association
 has been losing ground since 1982 when the Vatican banned
 clerical participation in political organizations worldwide.
 Although Cardinal Tomasek and the overwhelming majority of the
 clergy in Czechoslovakia have disassociated themselves from
 "Pacem in Terris," priests associated with the organization
 have retained control of Katolike Noviny (Catholic News), the
 only legally published Catholic newspaper.
 The printing of religious literature is severely restricted,
 and Bibles are in short supply. The demand for religious
 literature exceeds the supply, and Bibles and other pieces of
 religious literature are smuggled in from abroad and produced
 by underground samizdat (self-published) methods. Samizdat
 and other unofficial efforts to increase the supply of
 religious material are illegal, and the State deals harshly
 with persons it determines to have been involved in these
 activities. Persons caught engaging in them may be charged
 with obstruction of state supervision over churches and
 religious societies or even with subversion. Maria Kotrisova
 was sentenced to 10 months in prison for such activities in
 1986. Michal Mrtvy is facing trial for similar activities.
 Protestant denominations registered by the Government operate
 under similar constraints as does the Catholic Church.
 Proselytizing is forbidden; religious education is strictly
 regulated and may not be organized in private homes; religious
 ceremonies are restricted for the most part to church
 premises, and education of clergymen is closely controlled.
 Clergymen who become popular with young people or associated
 with Charter 77 soon find themselves barred from preaching.
 Two Jewish community councils, one in the Czech lands and the
 other in Slovakia, serve the Jewish community of several
 thousand. These councils are central religious organizations
 financially supported and controlled by the Government. There
 are synagogues and prayer houses open for worship and two
 rabbis, one in Prague and one in Kosice. In Prague, there is
 a Jewish Museum operated by the State. There are no Jewish
 schools or rabbinical seminaries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 For most Czechoslovaks, freedom of movement within the country
 is not restricted, except near military installations and
 along the borders with Austria and the Federal Republic of
 
 
 897
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Germany. However, the Government has increasingly restricted
 the movements of Charter 77 activists and other "suspect"
 persons by preventing them from leaving their homes. In 1986
 the authorities prevented several Charter activists from
 attending the Fourth of July celebration at the U.S.
 Ambassador's residence. Additionally, authorities often
 restrict the travel of such persons on politically significant
 anniversaries, such as that of the August 20-21 Soviet
 invasion in 1968, or while Western officials and other
 visitors are present.
 Travel to Western countries is difficult as travelers must
 obtain permission and, unless they are visiting close
 relatives, a hard currency authorization. The number of such
 authorizations issued each year is far below demand.
 Travelers to the West must usually leave some member of their
 immediate families at home to ensure their return. These
 restrictions are often relaxed for retired persons.
 Travel by citizens of Czechoslovakia to other East European
 countries has become more difficult in recent years. A
 special passport is now required for trips to Yugoslavia, and
 travel to Poland has been restricted since 1981. Travel to
 Hungary has been made more difficult by limiting the amount of
 currency which may be exchanged and the number of trips which
 may be made in 1 year. Citizens deemed politically
 "unreliable" may find that they are denied permission to
 travel to either Eastern or Western Europe. Jan Stern, one of
 the Charter spokespersons for 1986, has had his passport
 confiscated and was offered the explanation that his travel
 was not in the interest of the State.
 The right to emigrate is extremely limited. It is generally
 enjoyed only by those wishing to join a foreign citizen
 spouse, or, in the case of retired persons, foreign citizen
 children abroad. Those caught while seeking to leave
 Czechoslovakia without official permission may be sentenced to
 between 6 months and 5 years in prison.
 Czechoslovakia occasionally denies the right of repatriation
 by stripping the citizenship of those citizens it wishes to
 keep out. Emigration passports are not valid for return
 without special endorsement, and in some cases permanent exile
 is a condition for emigration or study abroad. During 1986
 Jan Hajek, the son of former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister and
 Charter 77 spokesman Jiri Hajek, was granted permission to
 study in Norway. He apparently gained this privilege at the
 cost of his Czechoslovak citizenship and right of return.
 Many former Czechoslovak citizens who wish to visit their
 former homeland are denied visas.
 There is a moderate outflow of persons from Czechoslovakia,
 primarily persons who leave the country legally on vacation to
 non-Warsaw Pact countries and do not return. This may amount
 to about 10,000 persons annually, but precise statistics are
 unavailable.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All significant decisions regarding the Government, the
 economy, and society are made exclusively by the leadership of
 the Communist Party. Through its apparatus, the party
 leadership determines who will be placed in decisionmaking
 positions not only within its own ranks but also throughout
 
 
 898
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA.
 the Government, the economy, the media, and mass
 organizations. Real power is enjoyed by only a few top-level
 officials in the party Presidium and Secretariat.
 Ordinary citizens, especially those who are not party members,
 have no role in selecting their leaders or in making important
 political or economic decisions. Four minor political parties
 are permitted to organize and publish their own newspapers but
 must conform to Communist Party directives. All parties and
 mass organizations are incorporated in the National Front,
 which is completely controlled by the Communist Party. Among
 its tasks is the nomination of a single slate of candidates to
 stand unopposed at all elections.
 Czechoslovak citizen Pavel Wonka is currently in jail facing a
 possible 3-year sentence for the distribution of an
 independent election ballot for the May 1986 election program
 to the Federal Assembly. Wonka had hoped to present himself
 as an independent candidate in the elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Atttitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Czechoslovak Government reacts negatively to expressions
 of concern about human rights violations in Czechoslovakia
 either by other governments or by nongovernmental
 institutions. Czechoslovak officials have, however, spoken
 candidly with U.S. officials about the Czechoslovak
 Government's interpretation of human rights and of the limits
 which it contends must exist to provide adequate protection
 for society. There have been reports in the past that the
 Government had delayed or denied visas to members of
 international human rights organizations such as the Helsinki
 Watch Committee and Amnesty International.
 Two groups within Czechoslovakia concern themselves with human
 rights. One is Charter 77, a group of individuals who signed
 a document, first made public in January 1977, calling on the
 Government to honor its commitments to international
 agreements on human rights, including the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as
 human rights guarantees in the Czechoslovak Constitution. The
 second group, the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly
 Persecuted (known by its Czech initials VONS), uses public
 records and reports from friends and relatives of the accused
 to issue communiques in cases where it believes the police,
 the courts, or the prisons have abused citizens' civil
 rights. These communiques are distributed to the Czechoslovak
 authorities. Members of both these groups are targets for
 harassment by the regime.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Health care, educational, retirement, and other services are
 provided without regard to race or sex. Membership in the
 Communist Party confers special access to goods and services
 (including education, medical services, and consumer items),
 and party officials enjoy particularly favorable treatment.
 The retirement age is 57 years for women and 60 years for
 men. The average pension is 55 percent of the average wage,
 and'many retirees supplement their pension payments by working.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Czechoslovakia has two major nationalities--Czechs and Slovaks
 --and two substantial minorities--Hungarians and Gypsies.
 Interethnic relations are still colored by historic
 animosities, but Czechoslovakia provides certain guarantees
 for minorities. Hungarians, who are concentrated in southern
 Slovakia, form the country's largest minority (555,000,
 according to official statistics). They are represented
 proportionately in federal and local legislative bodies but
 are underrepresented in high-level jobs in industry,
 government, and the party apparatus. The State provides some
 primary and secondary education in Hungarian and permits a
 limited number of ethnic Hungarians to pursue higher education
 in Hungary. Ethnic Hungarians complain, however, that
 Hungarian-language instruction at the elementary and secondary
 levels is being reduced, and that the lack of opportunities
 for higher education in Hungarian is creating a growing
 shortage of qualified Hungarian-language teachers.
 Gypsies, who number about 250,000, are the only other sizable
 minority in Czechoslovakia. As elsewhere in Europe, they tend
 to suffer from disproportionately high rates of poverty,
 crime, and disease. However, their problems appear to result
 as much from tradition and popular prejudice as from
 government policies.
 Approximately 30,000 Vietnamese laborers are temporarily
 residing in Czechoslovakia. Reportedly, they are allowed to
 retain two-thirds of their salary. The remainder is shared by
 the Czechoslovak and Vietnamese Governments.
 Women comprise 46.5 percent of the work force, but they tend
 to be concentrated in lower-paying, less-skilled jobs. They
 do, however, receive pay equal to their male colleagues if
 they hold the same job. There are inconsistencies in the
 responsibilities women are asked to assume: they are
 encouraged to join the work force, but they are also offered
 incentives to have children. Women are equal under the law,
 and there are small numbers of women in the professions.
 Female representation is very slight in higher-ranking party,
 government, and managerial positions. There is only one woman
 in the party Secretariat, and she holds her position by virtue
 of being chairman of the Woman's League. There are no female
 ministers or ambassadors.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 16, although
 younger persons may accept part-time employment. The average
 workweek is 42.5 hours. Beyond 45 hours, workers are paid
 overtime, and there are additional bonuses for some shift and
 weekend work. There is a nominal labor shortage induced by
 low productivity and the underutilization of resources. The
 need for unskilled and semiskilled labor is filled in part by
 workers from other Communist countries. Working conditions
 appear generally adequate, although less attention is paid to
 occupational safety and the problem of environmental pollution
 than in the West. When employee-management problems arise,
 workers have little recourse since strikes and independent
 labor organizations are prohibited, and the major
 preoccupation of the state-controlled labor union is to ensure
 that production plans are fulfilled.
