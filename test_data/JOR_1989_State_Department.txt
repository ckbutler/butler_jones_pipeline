 JORDAN
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy with a constitution granting
 the King broad powers. The King forms and dissolves
 governments and is the ultimate arbiter of policy. The Prime
 Minister and the Council of Ministers (Cabinet) exercise
 considerable responsibility for many issues. The Constitution
 also provides for a bicameral parliament and an independent
 judiciary. New elections for theParliament, which was
 dissolved in 1988, were held on November 8, 1989.
 Martial law has been in effect since the 1967 war against
 Israel, which ended with Israel's occupation of the West
 Bank. Under martial law, the General Intelligence Directorate
 (GID) and Public Security Department (PSD) have broad powers
 to monitor s~gments of the population that they believe might
 pose a threat to the security of the regime. Certificates of
 good conduct from the GID are needed for all public sector
 jobs, and for many private sector jobs as well. The GID must
 also approve any public gatherings or activities sponsored by
 private clubs and organizations. Under martial law, some
 detained persons have been denied the opportunity to
 communicate with their families or attorneys for varying
 periods, sometimes for several months.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with government participation in
 certain sectors, largely in communications, transportation,
 and heavy industry. Jordan has limited natural resources but
 in the past has received up to $2.5 billion annually in
 workers' remittances and financial grants from its Gulf
 neighbors. It now faces severe budgetary constraints as these
 revenues have fallen off sharply along with the price of oil,
 Currency depreciation and steep increases in the cost of
 living combined to create a public furor which culminated in
 disturbances in April 1989. As one result of the unrest,
 Prime Minister Rifa'i resigned and a new Cabinet was named,
 headed by Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker.
 The new Government is committed to economic restructuring and
 export-led growth and development, and moved quickly to
 implement an International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic
 adjustment program that aims at reducing government spending
 and stimulating the development of Jordan's private sector in
 order to offset the decline in fdreign assistance and
 remittances.
 After the November elections, the new Government took several
 significant steps toward political liberalization, including
 the release of 48 political detainees, the transfer of
 jurisdiction over several categories of crimes from military
 to civilian courts, easing of press restrictions, and
 elimination of travel and work restrictions imposed under
 security provisions for political beliefs. However, the
 absence of political parties, government intervention in the
 press, the continuance of martial law, and the wide scope of
 powers exercised by the police remain as important human
 rights concerns.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government does not sanction political killing. While
 there have been political killings by nongovernmental groups
 in the past, there were none in 1989. Summary executions do
 not occur in Jordan.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Jordanian law provides for the decent treatment of prisoners,
 and judicial authorities have been known to dismiss cases
 based on apparent mistreatment of prisoners. However, there
 are occasional reports of ill-treatment of detainees by the
 security authorities. The Director of Public Security
 maintains a special office to handle any public complaints of
 abuse by security officers.
 Prison conditions are Spartan by Western standards, but not
 intentionally degrading. Jordanian authorities hosted a penal
 foundations conference in August 1989, in part to exhibit
 their new rehabilitation center at Al Swaqa. The center is
 the focus of a 3-year effort to upgrade prison facilities,
 manifesting the reorientation of incarceration in Jordan from
 simple removal from society to actual rehabilitation. All
 prisoners are accessible to the International Committee of the
 Red Cross, which regularly inspects all detention facilities.
 Amnesty International (AI) published reports of ill-treatment
 of errestees by security forces following the disturbances in
 April. AI said some prisoners were beaten and one woman was
 beaten, insulted, and held with those incarcerated for
 criminal offenses. In its 1989 report covering 1988, Al noted
 that it had received new reports of the torture of political
 prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Jordan has been under martial law since 1967, most
 persons are placed in custody by Jordanian authorities in
 accordance with the criminal code, which requires imposition
 of charges within 4a hours. Persons may then be detained
 pending trial for 15 days, or longer if a court approves the
 prosecution's request for an extension. The criminal code is
 generally applied to persons arrested. for designated martial
 law crimes, which include espionage, bribery of public
 officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons, black-
 marketing, and security offenses. In the past, security
 forces have apparently detained incommunicado (or with limited
 outside access) some persons suspected of cross-border
 infiltration and security crimes.
 The GID can detain a person without trial for varying
 periods. However, under martial law provisions, such arrests
 should be confirmed within a maximum of 15 days by the Prime
 Minister or by local administrators.serving as military
 governors. Security detainees can be held without charge for
 
 
 1448
 JORDAN
 indeterminate periods or can be formally charged and brought
 before the martial court for trial.
 In 1989 up to 70 persons were in detention for 4 months after
 the disturbances in April. None was charged. In early
 September, all but four were released. In December the
 Government released 48 political detainees.
 A petition for judicial review of the legality of the arrest
 of any detained person may be brought before the High Court of
 Justice but is unlikely to be granted in security cases.
 Exile is forbidden by the Constitution aznd is not practiced in
 Jordan. For a discussion of forced or compulsory labor, see
 Sectiol 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All criminal cases, except martial law crimes and crimes
 committed by military personnel, are tried in civilian
 courts. The legal code and the independent selection of
 judges help to assure a fair trial. Trials are held in open
 court, except in a few cases such as those involving sexual
 offenses. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty and have the right to be represented by counsel, to
 prepare a defense, to cross*examine witnesses, and to refrain
 from giving self-incriminating testimony. The court appoints
 a lawyer for those who cannot afford one if the potential
 sentence is execution or life imprisonment. An effective
 appeals process.may be utilized by either the defendant or the
 prosecution, except in those cases tried before the Martial
 Law Court, which has no provision for appeal.
 Civilian judges must demonstrate legal competence in written
 and oral examinations before selection by a board composed of
 three judges, the Chief Attorney General, and the Under
 Secretary of the Justice Ministry. A procedure exists for
 disciplining judges accused of serious transgressions of the
 law, i.e., "bad conduct." Penalties for those found guilty
 range from payment of fines to removal from office.
 Martial law crimes are adjudicated in a military court before
 a panel of three military officers trained in the law. In
 practice, the military court observes the law of criminal
 procedure and defendants are given the same rights as in a
 civilian court. However, AI has expressed concern that trials
 by the Martial Law Court "fell below international standards
 for fair trial." No right of appeal exists from decisions of
 the military court; however, sentences of the court for
 martial law offenses must be ratified by the Prime Minister in
 his capacity as Military Governor. He has authority to
 increase, reduce, or annul the sentences. The cases are
 reviewed for fairness by a legal advisor or the Justice
 Minister before the Prime Minister makes a decision. The
 military court also adjudicates all crimes committed by
 military personnel. In these cases, the commander-in-chief of
 the armed forces must ratify the sentences.
 In 1989 the Government established a special committee to
 review the convictions of persons convicted for political
 offenses. In December it transferred authority over several
 crimes from military to civil courts; military courts will no
 longer have jurisdiction over the following issues:
 violations of the Combating Communism Law; affiliation with,
 or membership in, an unlicensed or banned political party
 
 
 1449
 JORDAN
 attacks on government or military officials; violations of
 orders issued by the military governor; murder for revenge;
 weapons violations; forgery; and passport fraud.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over most family matters,
 such as marriage, divorce, child custody, or guardianship.
 The Sharila (Muslim religious law) applies to Muslims in these
 areas, and a Shari'a court system handles disputes.
 Ecclesiastical courts handle similar matters for members of
 the main Christian sects. The civil courts administer the
 cases of other religious groups. Shari'a law, however, must
 be applied to questions of inheritance for all communities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Jordanian authorities respect the inviolability of the home.
 Police searches of homes require warrants, except in rare
 cases involving security or the hot pursuit of fleeing
 suspects. There are allegations that security personnel
 sometimes monitor telephones and correspondence, but the
 practice is evidently not widespread.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the freedoms of speech and press
 but permits censorship under martial law. Such censorship has
 become institutionalized over the years, and journalists do
 not feel free openly to criticize the Government. Jordanians
 freely express wide-ranging opinions, including criticism of
 the Government, in informal settings. Public debate is muted
 in the state-owned radio and television networks. Government
 ownership of newspapers was raised to over 50 percent during
 the tenure of Zaid Rifali's Government in early 1989. As a
 result of self-censorship, editorial opinion generally
 reflects the Government's views. However, reporting of the
 current economic and financial developments has been
 exceptionally frank. The media have also begun to address
 politically sensitive issues, such as the lifting of martial
 law and the ban on political parties.
 The Government frequently provides editors with guidance on
 key foreign policy and security matters. On other issues,
 government interference is sporadic and critical commentary,
 though occasionally tolerated, is limited. Currently, all
 journalists must register with the Information Ministry and
 join the Journalists' Association. Foreign newspapers and
 magazines are widely available, although they are subject to
 censorship.
 On December 11 the Government returned the management of the
 four major newspaper establishments to their original
 directors, who had been dismissed in 1988 and replaced by
 government-appointed management following disagreements
 between the Government and the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public demonstrations require a permit, rarely granted, from
 the Interior Minister. All organizations require government
 approval and may not have political objectives. Government
 surveillance of public meetings, university activities, and
 organization gatherings is pervasive. Professional
 
 
 1450
 JORDAN
 associations for doctors, engineers, lawyers, pharmacists, and
 similar professional groups exist. Professionals must join
 these associations in order to practice. The associations
 maintain influence with the Government in their respective
 fields and defend the interests of their members. However,
 until recently, they have tended to follow the government
 line. Officers are elected by the membership. Executive
 committees of clubs are vetted by the GID.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Well oger 90 percent of Jordanians practice Islam, the state
 religion. The Government adheres to the constitutional
 guarantee of freedom of worship. The approximately 5 to 10
 percent Christian minority is indigenous, and holds senior
 government positions in numbers far exceeding their proportion
 of the population. There appears to be little discrimination
 against most religious minorities, who are well represented at
 all levels in the government, military, and business
 community. Laws making harassment of religious minorities a
 crime are enforced. A variety of Christian groups--including
 Catholic, Orthodox, Armenian, and Protestant--maintain
 churches, schools, hospitals, and other institutions. A small
 Baha'i community also exists. A few foreign clergymen reside
 in Jordan. Although proselytizing among Muslims is forbidden,
 conversion by Muslims is not a criminal offense.
 All religious groups must register with the authorities in
 order to bbta-in offici'al permission to operate in Jordan.
 However, there are instances wherein denominations have failed
 to register but are nonetheless permitted to meet without
 harassment.
 The only religious group restricted by the Government is the
 Jehovah's Witnesses. The Government states that it has no
 objection to the Witnesses' doctrine, but it is illegal for
 them to organize or assemble in Jordan. The Witnesses'
 religion prohibits them from taking oaths of allegiance,
 saluting flags, or serving in the armed forces. These
 religious restrictions are perceived as evidence that
 Witnesses are unreliable and disloyal.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within Jordan is unrestricted, except in certain
 military zones. With a few exceptions (primarily military
 personnel and reservists who need permission for foreign
 travel), the Government does not restrict emigration or
 foreign travel. However, a woman must present the written
 consent of her husband, father, closest male relative, or male
 guardian to obtain a passport and may be required to present
 the same type of permission when she wishes to travel abroad
 without her husband.
 Children may have to present proof of their father's consent
 to leave Jordan. Citizens who have left Jordan have the right
 to return. There are no reported cases of revocation of
 citizenship for political reasons. Some citizens returning to
 Jordan, particularly those who have traveled to Communist
 countries, are questioned by the GID. Jordanians may possess
 dual nationality.
 
 
 1451
 JRDANI
 In December the Government eliminated travel and work
 restrictions imposed by security provisions respecting
 political beliefs, and indicated that passports previously
 held by security authorities would be released.
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem from the influx
 of Palestinians made homeless by the 1948 and 1967
 Arab-Israeli wars. According to the most recent statistics,
 Palestinian refugees and their-descendants registered with the
 United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) on the East
 Bank total 870,490. UNRWA estimates that another 200,000
 refugees have failed to register for one reason or another.
 While these refugees are free to live anywhere, almost 216,000
 of them still live in 10 refugee camps scattered across
 Jordan. The total includes refugees from the 1943
 Arab-Israeli war and does not include a large but undetermined
 number of other persons from the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel
 who have settled on the East Bank since 1948. All Palestinian
 refugees residing in Jordan prior to August 1988 can obtain
 fully valid Jordanian passports. They have the unrestricted
 right to live, work, and own property in Jordan. Palestinians
 residing on the West Bank may obtain passports valid for 2
 years. The Government also issues temporary Jordanian
 passports to between 26,000 and 27,000 Gazans resident on the
 East Bank who can prove they were displaced prior to 1971.
 Jordan is unique among Arab states in having granted full
 citizenship to all Palestinians on the East Bank, i.e., to a
 refugee population exceeding its own indigenous population at
 the time. The Interior Ministry routinely grants permits for
 travel between the East Bank and Israeli-occupied
 territories. Jordan has granted asylum even in cases which
 have strained relations with neighboring states.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Executive and legislative powers are constitutionally vested
 in the King, who rules with the assistance of an appointed
 Council of Ministers. The Constitution may not be amended
 without the approval of the King. Thus, Jordanian citizens,
 although constitutionally entitled to elect members of the
 lower house of Parliament, are not ultimately in a position to
 change their system of government.
 The Parliament was dissolved in 1988 as part of a policy to
 sever Jordan's ties to the West Bank, but new elections were
 held in November 1989. Parliament is composed of an appointed
 Senate and an elected lower house. The Parliament is
 overshadowed by the executive branch but has the right to
 propose laws and approve (or reject) treaties and laws
 proposed by the Council of Ministers. The Parliament also has
 the right to pass a vote of no-confidence in the Council of
 Ministers, thus obliging the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to
 resign. The Constitution also gives the King broad scope to
 postpone the election of a new lower house or the recall of
 the previous house. The Government has Allowed considerable
 political activity by "political groups" in preparation for
 the parliamentary elections. Most municipal and town councils
 are elected by popular vote. The person receiving the highest
 number of votes is traditionally confirmed as mayor by the
 Minister for Municipal Affairs and then by the Prime
 Minister.
 Women were enfranchised in 1973 and.may also run for public
 office. King Hussein appointed female cabinet ministers in
 
 
 1452
 1979 and in 1984 and has encouraged the participation of women
 in the political process.
 Article 16 of the Constitution allows Jordanians to establish
 political parties, but such parties are currently outlawed.
 However, several informal political groups operate openly.
 All persons seek elected office as independents. Article 18
 of the election law amended in 1989 states that candidates may
 not belong to an unlawful organization, and that "an unlawful
 organization is one whose principles, goals, and objectives
 are incompatible with the provisions of the Constitution."
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights    -
 The Government is generally responsive to inquiries on
 individual human rights cases. Representatives of foreign
 embassies and international humanitarian organizations are
 allowed access to prisoners and detainees. The Government has
 often responded positively to recommendations from such
 representatives. In its Report covering 1988, AI reported
 several instances in which it had communicated its concern to
 the Government about alleged human rights violations and noted
 that the Government had "responded to Amnesty International's
 appeals and inquiries on a number of occasions."
 The Jordanian Lawyers' Professional Association, which has a
 human rights -pmmittee, dramatically increased its advocacy on
 behalf of political prisoners in 1989. Other local
 organizations and ad hoc groups also occasionally issue
 statements and petitions on such human rights concerns 4s
 Palestinian rights and the ban on political parties. The
 Jordan Federation for Business and Professional Women hosted
 an Arab conference on human rights in Amman in April. Jordan
 has played an active role in the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission, and the Crown Prince is a cofounder of the
 Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross maintains an
 office in Amman and h~s access to detainees.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In general, there is no official discrimination based on
 ethnicity or religion.  Equality between men and women is the
 legal norm. In practice, however, certain traditions
 constrain women's freedoms, and entry of women into
 professional and academic realms, traditionally the preserve
 of men, can spark resentment and opposition.
 Nevertheless, the role of women in society has been changing
 in recent years. Women now account for half the student body
 at the elite University of Jordan. Women today comprise
 roughly 12 to 20 percent of the labor force, compared to 4
 percent in'1975. In 1989 the military, for the first time,
 set up a special basic training course for women, who serve in
 both the officer and enlisted ranks. An increasing number of
 women operate businesses and work in such professions as
 medicine, engineering, banking, and architecture. In 1990 the
 number of women lawyers in the Bar Association is expected to
 double, from 90 to 180. However, professional women and
 women's associations believe that more remains to be done to
 increase female participation in these areas. There are
 female police officers, and two Jordanian women fly for Royal
 
 
 1453
 JORDAN
 Jordanian Airlines, which qualified its first female airline
 captain before any scheduled U.S. airline.
 Gauging the extent of physical abuse of women is difficult as
 it is almost never discussed publicly. The Koran allows a
 husband to discipline his wife, which could be interpreted, in
 extreme cases, as a license to discipline with force. Because
 of this Koranic principle, the issue is considered a personal
 one, and this view is reflected in the attitude of the police
 and the judiciary. Sources in the medical field say that
 while they know wife beating takes place, the victim is
 constrained by familial and sociocultural norms from seeking
 outside recourse to assistance, both medical and legal. No
 statistics are available.
 Consular cases involving U.S. citizen wives of Jordanian men
 confirm that the problem exists and at most levels of
 society. Technically, wife beating is illegal and grounds for
 divorce. However, familial and tribal relationships serve to
 inhibit pressing charges; those same cultural constraints make
 gathering evidence of abuse next to impossible. Legal sources
 report that the filing of divorce cases or assault cases by a
 wife against her husband based on the grounds of wife beating
 is very rare.
 In matters of inheritance and divorce, women are treated
 differently. Under Islamic law, sons inherit twice as much as
 daughters. However, the son is required to use his
 inheritance for the maintenance of his mother and sisters,
 while a female is free to retain her inheritance for herself.
 Likewise, a man may obtain a divorce more easily than a woman,
 but he may be required to pay considerable compensation based
 on the marriage contract. Women may also gain and retain
 custody of children until the children obtain their legal
 majority, but they may lose custody if they remarry or choose
 to live outside the country.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right'of Association
 Jordanians are free to join labor unions. About 10 percent of
 the Jordanian work force is unionized. Nineteen unions
 comprise the Jordan Federation of Trade Unions (JFTU).
 Several other unions do not belong to the JFTU. Unions have
 almost no political role and confine themselves to
 representing their membership in such areas as wages, working
 conditions, and workers' layoffs. Their effectiveness varies
 widely. The JFTU actively participates in international
 organizations such as the International Labor Organization.
 Strikes are only permitted if the Ministry of Labor fails to
 act to arbitrate a labor dispute within 2 weeks after
 receiving a complaint from a union. In fact,, strikes almost
 never occur. Strikes are not legal for government employees,
 who comprise about half of the labor force. United Nations
 Relief Works Agency employees staged a 1-day strike in August
 1989 over pay scales.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in Jordan have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The unions comprising the JFTU function freely
 and without government interference or antiunion
 discrimination, in accordance with Article 23 of the
 Constitution. In 1988 the JFTU rejoined the International
 
 
 1454
 Association of Arab Trade Unions (IAATU). The officers of
 each union, as well as the JFTU executive committee, are
 elected annually by secret ballot. JFTU member unions
 regularly engage in collective bangaining with employers.
 Negotiations cover a wide range of issues, including salaries,
 safety standards, working conditions, and health and life
 insurance for workers and their families. If a union is
 unable to reach agreement with an employer, the issue is
 referred to the Ministry of Labor for arbitration.
 Union-employer-government relations are generally tranquil, so
 arbitration is rarely necessary.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is forbidden by the Constitution and not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under age 16 are not permitted to work except in the
 case of professional apprentices, who are allowed to leave the
 standard educational track and-begin-part-time (6 hours a day,
 no night shifts) training at age 13.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Jordan's workers are protected by a comprehensive labor code
 enforced by a staff of 30 full-time inspectors of the Ministry
 of Labor. Other Ministry of Labor employees augment the
 inspection staff on a part-time basis. Duty-free trade zones
 are in operation at Aqaba and Zarqa, and are governed by the
 same labor provisions that apply countrywide. The Government
 prepares and adjusts periodically a minimum wage schedule for
 various trades, based on recommendations of an advisory panel
 composed of representatives of workers, employers, and the
 Government. Maximum working hours are 48 hours per week, with
 the exception of hotel, bar, restaurant, and movie theater
 employees, who can work up to 54 hours. Workers are entitled
 to a weekly day of rest, rest intervals during the workday, 2
 weeks' annual paid leave, 2 weeks' annual sick leave, and
 severance pay. The law specifies a number of health and
 safety requirements for workers, including bathrooms, drinking
 water, safety equipment, and first aid equipment. Jordan also
 has a workers' compensation law. The Government appears to
 administer and enforce its labor laws fairly.
 As part of a campaign to improve occupational and public
 safety, the Government has created a committee to recommend
 standards and regulations. The committee conducts public
 awareness campaigns and is studying international safety
 practices. Jordan's social security laws cover all companies
 with more than five employees.
