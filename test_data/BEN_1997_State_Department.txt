 BENJN
 The Republic of Benin is a constitutional democracy headed by President Mathieu
 Kerekoeu, who was inaugurated on April 4, 1996, after elections generally viewed as
 free and fair. President Kerekou, who ruled Benin as a Socialist military dictator
 from 1972-1989, succeeded his democratically elected predecessor and continued the
 civilian, democratic rule begun in the 1990-1991 constitutional process that ended
 his previous reign. There are 18 political parties represented in the unicameral, 82-
 member National Assembly; no party or political grouping commands a majority of
 seats. The Government respects the constitutional provision for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the judiciary is inefficient and susceptible to corruption.
 The civilian-controlled security forces consist of the armed forces, headed by a
 Minister Delegate for Defense Matters in the office oft he President, and the police
 force under the Interior Minister. The two Ministers also share authority over the
 gendarmerie, which exercises police functions in rural areas. The armed forces con-
 tinued to play an apolitical role in government affairs despite concerns about morale
 within its ranks and its ethnic imbalance.,
 An extremely poor country with average yearly per capita income below $450, the
 economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture, cotton product, regional
 trade (including transshipment of goods to neighboring countries), and small-scale
 offshore oil production. The port of Cotonoh serves as a major conduit for goods en-
 tering neighring Nigeria legally and illegally. The new Administration continued,
 and in some cases stepped up, the austerity program begun by its predecessor;
 privatized state-owned enterprises; reduced fiscal expenditures; and deregulated
 trade. In spite of its bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, high debt servicing costs,
 
 
 and widespread unemployment, Benin's economic recovery continues under liberal
 economic policies instituted since the return to democracy. Inflation in 1997 was less
 than 3 percent with real growth estimated at between 5 and 6 percent.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. The major
 human rights problems continued to be the failure by police forces to curtail acts
 of vigilantism and mob justice; serious administrative delays in processing ordinary
 criminal cases with attendant denial of timely, fair trials; judicial corruption; harsh
 and unhealthy prison conditions; societal discrimination and violence against
 women; and the trafficking in and abuse of children. The practice of- female genital
 mutilation (FGM) is also a problem. The Constitutional Court continued to dem-
 onstrate independence. In one high-profile case, it struck down-provisions of the new
 media law as unconstitutional.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials. However, a rising crime rate and
 a lack of police responsiveness led to more reports of mob justice. Vigilantism re-
 portedly resulted in several cases of suspected criminals being killed or severely in-
 jured, particularly thieves caught in the act. Although a number of these incidents
 took place in urban areas and were publicized in the press, the Government appar-
 ently made no concerted attempt to investigate or prosecute anyone involved, Some
 ,press accounts suggested that the-police.deliberately ignored vigilante attacks.
 b.JDisappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel,- Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices and there were no reports that officials
 employed them. The Government continued to make payments to victims of torture
 under the military regime which ruled from 1972 to 1989.
 Prison conditions continue to be extremely harsh. Extensive overcrowding and
 lack of proper sanitation and medical facilities pose a risk to prisoners' health. The
 prison diet is seriously inadequate -with malnutrition and disease common. Prisoners
 are allowed to meet with visitors such as-family members, lawyers, and others. In
 conjunction with nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), the, Government has set
 up a plan for prison renovation and rehabilitation.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention or exile, however, at times the authorities arbitrarily arrested and
 detained persons. The Constitution prohibits detention for more than 48 hours with-
 ,out a hearing by a magistrate whose order is required for continued detention. How-
 ever, there were- credible reports that authorities exceeded this 48-hour limit in
 many cases, sometimes by as long as a week, using the accepted practice of holding
 a person without specified time limit "at the disposition of" the public prosecutor's
 office before presenting the case to a magistrate. Approximately 75 percent of pris-
 oners are pretrial detainees. -Arbitrary arrest is not routine but does occur occasion-
 ie" National Assembly approved, and the President promulgated, a law on Sep-
 tember 3 to grant amnesty to some 50 individuals convicted of crimes against na-
 tional security during the previous administration. All amnestied individuals im-
 prisoned in Benin were released.
 The Constitution prohibits forced exile of citizens. Many citizens who went into
 exile prior to the establishment of democratic rule have returned.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 - the executive has important powers in regard to the judiciary.
 The President appoints career magistrates as judges in civil courts, and the Con-
 stitution gives the Ministry of Justice administrative authority over judges, includ-
 ing the power to transfer them. Inadequate facilities, poorly-trained staff, and over-
 crowded dockets result in slow administration of justice. The low salaries of mag-
 istrates and clerks have a demoralizing effect on their commitment to efficient and
 timely justice and makes them susceptible to corruption.
 The legal system is based on French civil law and local customary law. The Con-
 stitution provides for the right to a fair public trial. A defendant enjoys the pre-
 sumption of innocence and has the right to be present at trial and to representation
 by an attorney, at public expense if necessary. In practice the court provides indi-
 gent defendants with court-appointed counsel upon request. A defendant also has
 the right to confront witnesses and to have access to government-held evidence.
 
 
 12
 Trials are open to the public, but in exceptional circumstances the President of the
 court may decide to restrict access to preserve public order or to protect the parties.
 A civilian court system operates on the national and provincial levels. Military
 disciplinary councils deal with minor offenses by military members, but have no ju-
 risdiction over civilians. There is only one court of appeals. The Supreme Court is
 the court of last resort in all administrative and judicial matters. The Constitutional
 Court is charged with passing on the constitutionality of laws and disputes between
 the President and the National Assembly and with resolving disputes regarding
 presidential and National Assembly elections. Its rulings against both the executive
 and legislative branches indicated its independence from both these branches of
 Government. The Constitution also provides for a High Court of Justice to convene
 in the event of crimes committed by the President or government ministers against
 the State. Implementing legislation to create the High Court of Justice was passed
 in June 1996. Although the legislation was passed, the Constitutional Court later
 found some of its provisions tbe unconstitutional. As of year's end, the legislature
 had not passed revisions to bring the law into compliance with the Constitutional
 Court ruling.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions in practice. Police are required to obtain a judicial warrant before
 entering a private home, and they usually observed this requirement in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. The govern-
 ment entity with oversight responsibility for media operations is the High Authority
 for Audio-visual Media and Communications (HAAC), which requires broadcasters
 to submit weekly lists of planned programs and requires publishers to deposit copies
 of all publications with it. The requirement, however, is not observed by the media
 inpractice.
 There is a large and active privately owned press consisting of about a dozen
 newspapers. These publications criticize the Government freely and often, but their
 effect on public opinion is limited because of their urban concentration. The majority
 of Beninese are illiterate.ï¿½
 The National Assembly approved legislation on August 11 to privatize Benin's
 electronic news media. The law was submitted to the Constitutional Court for re-
 view and then promulgated by the President. The HAAC announced requirements
 to obtain commercial broadcasters licenses, and established October 10 as the dead-
 line for applications. Private radio and television stations began broadcasting in De-
 cember.
 The Government, however, continued to own and operate the media most influen-
 tial in reaching the public. Until December the only radio stations that transmitted
 locally were government owned: The Benin Office of Radio and Television (ORTB)
 transmits in' FM, AM, and short wave, in French and local languages. Radio France
 International (RFI) also transmits over a local FM band under an agreement with
 the Government. Five rural. radio stations governed by local committees broadcast
 several hours a day exclusively in local languages. These stations receive support
 from ORTB. Radio is probably the most important information medium.
 A similar arrangement is in place for television transmissions: ORTB broadcasts
 5 hours per day on a signal that is easily received in urban areas. Approximately
 80 percent of ORTB's television programming is in French. TV5, a commercial ven-
 ture with investments by television broadcasting organizations in France, Canada,
 Belgium, and Switzerland, broadcasts locally 24 hours a day entirely in French
 under an agreement with the Government. Although neither television station
 broadcasts partisan programs in support of or unduly critical of the Government,
 the vast majority of news programming centers on government officials' activities.
 The Government does not censor works by foreign journalists, authors, or artists.
 HAAC regulations govern satellite reception equipment and movie and video
 clubs. There is little enforcement of these regulations.
 In general academic freedom is respected. University professors are permitted to
 lecture freely, conduct research, and publish their work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. The Govern-
 ment requires permits for use of public places for demonstrations and requires asso-
 ciations to register. It routinely grants such permits and registrations. The Govern-
 ment did not take any actions against nonregistered organizations for failure or re-
 fusal to register.
 
 
 13
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 In August the legislature voted to -establish a national day to observe traditional
 religious practices,-thereby affording traditionalist beliefs a status similar to that
 of more established religions, such as Christianity and Islam and implicitly rec-
 -ognizing them as part of domestic culture. The designation does not convey special
 status to traditional beliefs. President Kerekou, an evangelical Christian, has been
 criticized inthe press for public statements against -certain -traditional religious
 practices and for expressing views that might violate the principle of separation of
 church and State.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriaton.-Thes Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. However, the presence of police, gendarmes, and
 illegal roadblocks impedes domestic movement. Although ostensibly meant to en-
 force automotive safety and customs regulations, many of these checkpoints serve
 as a means for-officials to exact bribes from travelers. The Government maintained
 previously implemented measures to combat such petty corruption at roadblocks.
 The Government's policy toward transhumance allows migratory Fulani herdsmen
 from other countries to enter freely; it, does not enforce designated entrypoints The
 localpress reported that a cattle dispute on March 14 resulted in the destruction
 of a -Fulani camp and the deaths of several herdsmen. Government authorities did
 not issue an official statement, nor have there been reports regarding official action
 to punish the guilty.
 The Government does- not restrict international travel for political reasons, and
 those who travel abroad may return without hindrance.
 Historically, the Government has cooperated closely with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees, including those in need of first asylum. The Government provided
 first asylum to up to 200,000 citizens of Togo during the 1993 political violence in
 that country. While most have returned to Togo, 1,653 (UNHCR estimate) remain.
 Despite severe economic pressures that limit its ability to provide education for its
 children, the Government has allowed these Togolese to enroll their children in local
 schools and to participate in some economic activities.
 In late spring, the Government informed the UNHCR that it could no longer guar-
 antee the safety of eight prominent Togolese dissidents and their families living in
 Benin under UNHCR auspices. The UNHCR found sponsors for the refugees in the
 Netherlands and Sweden, and they left Benin in June. UNHCR officials stated that
 the Government did everything reasonably possible to protect the eight Togolese dis-
 sidents; the UNHCR faults the dissidents for refusing to curtain their activities in
 Benin against the Togolese Government as the reason for their perceived insecurity
 and subsequent relocation.
 In contrast some 995 Ogoni refugees from Nigeria, handicapped because they do
 not speak French, cannot work in Benin, nor can their children attend Beninese
 schools. UNHCR officials have warned them to remain within the confines of the
 refugee camp.
 In addition there are refugees from Nigeria, Algeria, Burundi, Cameroon, the
 Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethi-
 opia, Niger, Liberia, Rwanda, Sudan, and Sierra Leone. Their treatment is com-
 parable to that accorded the Togolese and Ogonis.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of persons having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment      I I
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment. Citizens exercised this right in legislative elections in 1991 and 1995, and
 in presidential elections in 1991 and 1996, all considered free and fair. The Con-
 stitution provides for a 5-year term of office for the President (who is limited to two
 terms) and 4-year terms for National Assembly members (who may serve an unlim-
 ited number of terms).
 Women participate actively in the political parties, but are underrepresented in
 Government positions. There is now 1 woman in the 19-member Cabinet. The pre-
 vious Government had four female cabinet members. There are 6 female deputies,
 including the leader of the 6pposition, in the 82-member unicameral National As-
 sembly. The President of the Constitutional Court is a woman; the HAAC and the
 Economic and Social Council have female members.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups-both domestic and international-operate
 without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on
 human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive
 to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, and religion, but so-
 cietal discrimination against women continues.
 Women.-While no statistics are available, violence against women, including wife
 beating, occurs. The press sometimes reports incidents of abuse of women, but
 judges and police are reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes, considering such
 disputes a family matter.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality for women in the political, eco-
 nomic, and social spheres, women experience extensive societal discrimination, espe-
 cially in rural areas where they occupy a subordinate role and -are responsible for
 much of the hard labor on subsistence farms. In urban areas, women dominate the
 trading sector in the open-air markets. By law women have equal inheritance and
 property rights, but local custom in some areas prevents them from inheriting real
 property. Women do not enjoy the same educational opportunities as men, and fe-
 male literacy is about 16 percent (compared with 32 percent for males).
 There are active women's rights groups that have been effective in drafting a fam-
 ily code that would improve the status of women under the law. The draft code was
 scheduled for review by the National Assembly in late 1997, but by year's end it
 had not been passed. The code is designed to bring about significant enhancements
 to the human rights of women and children.
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for the protec-
 tion of children's rights, primarily in the areas of education and health. In particu-
 lar the Government is trying to boost primary school enrollment, which is only
 about 66 percent. In some parts of the country, girls receive no formal education.
 Some traditional practices inflict hardship and violence on children, including
 most prominently the custom of "vidomegon," whereby poor, often rural, families
 place a child, primarily girls, in the home of more wealthy families. A privately
 owned newspaper reported in February that the daughter-in-law of a prominent
 government official was in pretrial detention for beating to death her 12-year old
 maid in November 1996. A medical report certified that the child was severely
 abused before being admitted to the hospital. At year's end, there was no indication
 of government action against the assailant.
 Other traditional practices include the killing of deformed babies, breach babies,
 and one of two newborn twins (all of whom are thought to be sorcerers in some rural
 areas). There is also a tradition in which a groom abducts and rapes his prospective
 child (under 14 years of age) bride. Criminal courts mete out stiff sentences to crimi-
 nals convicted of crimes against children, but many such crimes never reach the
 courts.
 Trafficking in children, always a problem in Benin, was the subject of consider-
 able media coverage. Most victims are abducted or leave home with traffickers who
 promise educational opportunities or other incentives. They are taken to foreign
 countries (according to the press, principally Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon) and
 sold into servitude to work in agriculture, as domestics, or as prostitutes (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.). The police stated that between January 1 and February 28, they thwarted
 attempts to smuggle out of Benin 297 children ranging in age from 8 to 15 years.
 The Government in concert with NGO's, made serious efforts to combat child
 abuse and trafficking in children, including media campaigns, programs to assist
 street children, and greater border surveillance. Despite such efforts the abuse of
 children is a serious human rights problem.
 The Government has been less successful in combating female genital mutilation
 (FGM), which is not illegal. FGM is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. FGM, or excision, is
 practiced on females ranging from infancy through 30 years of age. Studies vary
 widely and suggest that as few as 5 percent or as many as 50 percent of women
 are affected by this practice, mostly in the northern provinces. The actual incidence
 probably falls somewhere between these estimates. A prominent NGO, the Benin
 chapter of the Inter-African Committee, has made progress in raising awareness of
 the dangers of the practice; the Government has cooperated with its efforts. Accord-
 ing to recent research, there is a strong profit motive in the continued practice of
 FGM by those who perform the operation, usually older women. In March the Gov-
 
 
 ernment in cooperation with the World Health Organization unveiled an action plan
 to eliminate FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution provides that the State look
 after the handicapped, the Government does not mandate accessibility for disabled
 persons. It operated a number of social centers for disabled persons to assist their
 social integration. Nonetheless, many are unable to find employment and must re-
 sort to beggngtosuppor themselves.
 NationaflRacial/Ethni Minorities.-There is a long history of regional rivalries.
 Although Southerners dominate the Government's senior ranks, Northerners domi-
 nate the military. The South has enjoyed more advanced economic development, a
 larger population, and has traditionally held favored status. In the 1996 elections,
 a Northerner was elected President.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides workers with the freedom
 to organize, join unions, meet, and strike, and the Government usually respects
 these rights in practice. The labor force of about 2 million is primarily engaged in
 subsistence agriculture and other primary sector activities, with less than 2 percent
 of the population engaged in the modern (wage) sector. Approximately 75 percent
 of the wage earners belong to labor unions. There are four union confederations, and
 unions are generally independent of government and political parties. The Economic
 and Social Council, a constitutionally mandated body established in 1994, includes
 four union representatives. Teachers in public, technical, and vocational institutions
 went on 48-hour strikes in April and May to back up demands for a revision of their
 employment status and for payment of arrears. Strikesdid not occur at all schools.
 In April port workers held a sit-in to privatize port operations. Speculation that a
 major fire in the port at the time of the protest actions had been set by labor agi-
 tators was subsequently disproved.
 There were no known instances of efforts by the Government to retaliate against
 union activity. Laws prohibit employer retaliation against strikers, and the Govern-
 ment enforces them effectively.
 Unions may freely form or join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining, and workers freely exercised these rights. Wages in the pri-
 vate sector are set in negotiations between unions and emloayers. A tripartite
 group, composed of unions, employers, and the Government, dscussed and agreed
 to revisions in the Labor Code in 1995, but the new code had. not been enacted into
 law by year's end: The Government sets wages in the public sector by law and regu-
 lation.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from taking union membership or activity
 into account regarding hiring, work distribution, professional or vocational training,
 or dismissal. The Government levies substantial penalties against employers who
 refuse to rehire workers dismissed for lawful union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Forced and bonded labor by children is specifically prohibited.
 However, some financially desperate parents indenture their children to "agents" re-
 cruiting farm hands or domestic workers, often on the understanding that money
 paid to the children would be sent to the parents. According to press reports, in
 some cases, unscrpulous individuals take the children to neigh oring countries.
 The Government has taken steps to educate parents and to prevent suc k  aing
 of children. Also many rural children are sent to cities to live with relatives or fam-
 ily friends, often on the understanding that in return for performing domestic
 chores, they will be given an education. Host families do not always honor their part
 of the bargain and abuse of child domestic servants occurs. The Government has
 taken steps to curb abuses.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.--The
 Labor Code prohibits the employment or apprenticeship of children under 14 years
 of age in any enterprise. However, the Ministry of Labor enforces the code in only
 a limited manner (and then only in the modern sector), due to the lack of inspectors.
 To help support their families, children continue to work on rural family farms, in
 small businesess, on construction sites in urban areas, and as domestic servants.
 Children also commonly work as street vendors.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but is unable to
 enforce these prohibitions except in the modern sector (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively sets mini-
 mum wage scales for a number of occupations. On April 10, the Government in-
 
 
 16
 creased the minimum wage by 8 percent from $35 (cfa francs 20,300) per month to
 $38 (cfa francs 21,924). The decision was made in consultation with trade unions.
 However, this increase is not sufficient to cover the costs for food and housing even
 of a single worker. Many workers must supplement their wages by subsistence
 farming or informal sector trade. Most workers in the wage sector, however, earn
 more than the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code establishes a workweek of from 40 to 46 hours, depending on the
 type of work, and provides for at least one 24-hour rest period per week. The au-
 thorities generally enforce legal limits on workweeks in the modern sector. The
 Labor Code establishes health and safety standards, but the Ministry of Labor does
 not enforce them effectively. The Labor Code does not provide workers with the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to con-
 tinued employment. The Ministry of Labor has the authority to require employers
 to remedy dangerous work conditions but does not do so effectively.
