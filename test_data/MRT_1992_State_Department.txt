 MAURITANIA
 The Islamic Republic of Mauritania continued to be governed by Colonel Maaouya
 Ould SidAhmed Taya, who had ruled since 1984 as chairman of a military junta,
 the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN). As a result of flawed elec-
 
 
 163
 tions held in January (the first in more than 14 years), Colonel Taya was elected
 President and continued to wield executive power, assisted by his Council of Min-
 isters and a group of close advisers. The principal change in the regime was the dis-
 mantling in April of the Military Committee, which had functioned since 1978 as
 the country's legislative body, and its replacement by a newly elected civilian Par-
 liament. A new Constitution, which delegates most powers to the executive, was
 adopted in 1991. The new regime's first Pime Minister was appointed by President
 Taya and serves at the latter's pleasure. This quasi-transformation of the Taya Gov-
 ernment from a miitary regime to one with a more civilian cast failed to satisfy
 te political opposition's demands for a truly democratic system. Although the new
 Constitution and attendant ordinances permitted political parties and an independ-
 ent press to operate, for example, both of these freedoms were limited. Taya's party
 totally dominated Parliament, the newspapers were subject to a strict libel law, and
 the Government continued to monopolize radio and television.
 Mauritanian security forces numbr between 16,000 and 18,000 and include the
 regular,armed forcs,, the .National Guard, the Gendarmerie (aspeia lied co.r s" of
 p     o car  la y  polce , an d  e  po ce .  Te  en arme e is  drec te  y  t e  M ms ry
 of Defense, while the National Guard and police come under the Ministry of Inte-
 rior. Total mitary expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the U. And
 Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $40 million.
 There is no indication that any efforts will be made to reduce these expenditures
 in the near future. As in previo s years, the security forces continued to be respon-
 sible for signficant human rights violatons. However, the incidence and severity of
 violations dropped significantly from the massive scale of abuses perpetrated by the
 security forces during 1989-1991.
 Most of Mauritana's 2.1 million inhabitants, either nomadic herders or settled
 farmers, lve within a market-oriented ubistence economy. Mauritania is burdened
 with numerous long-term economic and social prblems: drought, desrtification, in-
 sect infestation, extensive unemployment, rapid inflation, one of the highest per cap-
 ita foreign debts in Africa, minimal infrastructure, inadequate health and education
 systems, and growing urbanization. Low rainfall levels over the past years have
 forced large numbers of nomads into towns, with a consequent weaeing of tradi-
 tional Maur culture and a severe strain on government resources.
 .While human rights practices in Mauritania improved somewhat in 1992, serious
 abuses continued, and major problems from the unresolved abuses of previos years
 remained. More than 55,000 Afo-Mauritanians expelled in the 1989-1990 period re-
 mained in camps in Senegal waiting to be repatriated and reimbursed for their lost
 beonings and property. Ethnic tensions remained strained because of the Govern-
 ment a refusal to acknowledge publicly, to investigate, or otherwise to resolve prior
 documented human rights violations by the security forces particularly the bloody
 p urge conducted by the armed forces within their own rans from September 1990
 through March 1991. Approximately 500 persons, almst entirely from Mauritania's
 black African minority, are believed to have died in the purge, and many hundreds
 more were tortured and maimed. In 1992 restrictions on certain rights, such as free-
 dom of speech, press, and association, were reduced, although not eliminated. Other
 freedoms, such as worker rights, the right to a fair trial, and the right of citizens
 to change their government, remained sagnificantly restricted. Slavery continued to
 be practiced, and violence against women remained a problem. Furthermore, respect
 for the integrity of the person continued to be seriously abused, with extrajudicial
 killing, illegal detentions, and torture continuing.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section . Respect for the Integrity of the Person, In0uding Freedom from
 a. Politicl and Other Ertrjudicioal Killing-As in previous years, there were a
 number of extrajudicial killings; by year's end approximately a half-dzen such cases
 had been documented. Most such killings took place along the Senegal river where
 the majority of the country's non-Arabic-speaking black African population ives. It
 was not always clear whether security forces carrying out the killings were acting
 under orders or whether individual military elements were acting as armed vigilan-
 tes carrying out vendettas.
 As in previous years, there were no reports of government inquiries into the inci-
 dents, efforts to punish those responsible, or promulgation of guidelines to avoid se-
 curity forces' excesses. In February two brothers, Oumar and urahima Diop, report-
 edly were picked up by an army unit as they attempted to lad their bat at Boghe,
 in the Brakna region. Both men, though Mauin    in   birth had been living in
 Dakar since their expulsion to Senegal in 1989. According to Ibrahima Diop, who
 survived the episode, he and his brother were tied up and tortured, ten  therown
 
 
 164
 into the river. Oumar Diop drowned. The Government did not respond to press and
 opposition party demands for an investigation. Indeed, the Government's only re-
 sponse was publicly to challenge the brothers' citizenship.
 In January Djiby Diallo was killed while crossing the river to Senegal. A Senegal-
 ee autopsy indicated he had been shot in the month; Mauritanian authorities cer-
 tilled that the victim had drowned. Neither the victim's lawyer nor his family was
 permitted to see the body before burial. There were reports that a police brigadier
 stationed at Kndi may have been involved in the death, but no investigation was
 undertaken. In March the body of military orderly M'Diaye Oumar was pulled from
 the river. After first claiming that Oumar was not Mauritanian, government au-
 thorities later admitted his citizenship and said he had drowned. However, no au-
 topsy was performed and an alleged eyewitness claimed that Oumar was killed by
 members of the armed forces.
 In August in the Guidimaka region a     u  of five Peuhl (Halpulaar-speaking
 nomad) herders disappeared, reportedly after being taken into custody by persons
 in military uniforms. The body of one Peuhl was found soon after, and those of the
 four others were found later in a well near the Maur village of Tourroulla. All had
 been strangled. Several civilians and soldiers suspected in the case were arrested
 but were then freed by the regional governor. No charges have been brought in con-
 nection with these deaths, which may have been revenge killings. Only a few days
 earlier Peuhl cattle rustlers from Mali had attacked a Maur from Tourroulla.
 Furthermore, extrajudicial killings from past years remained uninvestigated and
 unresolved. The principal example of unresolved extrajudicial killing dates from
 1990-1991, when approximately 500 largely Halpulaar and Soninke military and ci-
 vilian personnel died while in military custody. Many of these persons were sum-
 marily executed after being tortured. No accounting has ever been made of those
 who died. They were part of a large group of as many as 3,000 who were rounded
 up, detained, and tortured, allegedy for coup plotting. The results of an internal
 military investigation into this matter have never been made public, and no one has
 been charged with or faced trial for the tortures and deaths. Several high-placed
 military officials who reportedly were involved remain in their posts and in some
 cases were promoted.
 b. Disappearance.-There were occasional credible reports of black Africans dis-
 appearing after bein taken into military custody. Also in 1992, black Africans liv-
 ing along the river discovered in the Brakna Region two common graves containing
 the remains of persons who had disappeared in early 1990. One of these graves,
 near the village of Sory Male, contained three bodes; the other, located near
 Wothie, contained five bodies. T1he Government appears to have made no effort to
 investigate these incidents, and there is evidence that the victims in some cases
 were last seen in the company of security forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Despite the Government's stated Opposition to torture and the legal prohibition
 against its use, the security forces routinely mistreated ersons in custody, particu-
 larly political dissidents and black Africans. Torture andfother degrading treatment
 continued to be regularly employed to extract self-incriminating statements of in-
 volvement in criminal or political activities. Many instances of such mistreatment
 were reported in 1992, although fewer than in previous years. Some members of the
 UFD (Union Des Forces Demcratiiues, the major opposition party) were tortured
 in Nouadhibu following street fighting on January 26 in protest of the election re-
 sults. Three persons were killed in that incident, which appears to have been insti-
 gated by the police.
 A roundup of Taya's political opponents followed on January 27, and the security
 forces apparently used confessions forced from ersons they initially detained to ar-
 rest still more. Although a majority of the ouadhibou detainees were released
 within a day or two, approximately 30 were held for a week, and some of them were
 badly mistreated while in detention. Ali Ould Vii, an auto mechanic, claimed to
 have been tortured at the jolice station in El Mouteverjirat at Nouadhibou. Two
 newspapers printed testimony by Vili in which he claimed that police officers forced
 him to disrobe and to lie on the ground. He was then kicked and beaten while his
 captors insisted that he sign a statement incriminating certain UFD leaders in the
 January 26 violence. When he refused, claiming thathe was not a LIED member
 and did not know the leadership, police forced hot peppers into his eyes and body
 openings. Vill signed a statement which later was used as a justification for a wave
 of arrests that took place the following day. Another post-election round-u p of UFD
 members took place in Kaedi, in the Gorol region. Some of those arrested claimed
 to have been tortured. The types of torture most frequently reported in 1992 in-
 cluded beatings, forced feeding of sand, electric shock, burning of genitals, denial of
 
 
 165
 Water and food, and the so-called jaguar, in which victims are bound and suspended
 upside down while the soles of their feet aie beaten.
 Degrading treatment was also common. Prisoners were often stripped of their
 clothes and-denied blankets, food, or access to toilets. Prison conditions in Mauri-
 tania are harsh and d not meet minimum sanitary or humanitarian standards.
 In late August, many residents of the village of Teykane, in the Trarza region,
 were taken into custody and confined in close quarters with no access to food, water,
 or toilet facilities for up to 24 hours. According to eyewitnesses, the mass roundup
 began after the police broke up a late-night sports competition. When angry villag-
 ers descended on the police station, the police commissioner called for assistance
 from a nearby Gendarme unit. Subsequently approximately 60 persons, including
 pregnant women and small children, were arrested and confined, both at police
 headquarters and in a schoolhouse. One woman reportedly was prevented from
 nursing her infant. The male detainees were forced to sit with their hands over
 their heads. Some persons apparently were severely beaten with rifle butts. No one
 died, but many persons fainted and suffered dehydration.
 In August residents of the village of Sory Male (where in March a common grave
 was discovered, see Section 1.b.) were subjected to harassment, degrading treat-
 ment, and possible torture by a elements of a navy infantry unit. The roundup and
 9uestioning of villagers occurred following the murder of Beydane shop owner. Dia
 Hamath Atoumane, an elderly man with a history of health problems, died in the
 course of the security forces' interrogation of witnesses. He reportedly was forced to
 stand outside in a thunderstorm all night, without access to his medication. There
 was no investigation despite the fact that the naval unit had no legal jurisdiction
 to act.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although Mauritanian law requires expe-
 ditious arraignment and trial, access to legal counsel, and the right of appeal, these
 rights frequently are not observed, particularly in cases of political dissidents or per-
 sons suspected on national security grounds. They are somewhat more often ob-
 served in ordinary criminal cases. Yet even ordinary crimes tend to be handled out-
 side the parameters of judicial process, as offenders make informal arrangements
 with the persons they have wronged. Traditional concepts of "Ghissas' (retributory
 justice i e.an eye or an eye) and "blood-money" compensation are applied more
 often than Western principles of due process.
 By law, the courts are required to review the legality of a person's detention no
 more than 72 hours after his or her arrest. There is no prvsion, in theory or in
 practice  for access to a lawyer during this detention period. Nor is there any guar-
 antee of access to family members. Only after the prosecutor submits the charges
 is the suspect permitted to contact an atorney. It is common practice to detain pris-
 oners incommunicado for prolonged periods without charging them with any crime
 and without judicial review. Sometimes prisoners who have been charged find them-
 selves released before trial without explanation. Such releases usually can be attrib-
 uted to the prisoner's familial, tribal, or political connections. There is no system
 of bail.
 Many of the UFD members arrested in Nouadhibou in January were held in in-
 communicado detention for 5 days or more. Although charges were brought against
 27 of the Nouadhibou detainees, the charges in the end were neither upheld nor
 dropped. Instead, the detainees were eventually released upon President Taya's di-
 rect intervention.
 In late June Nouakchott-based security forces began a roundup of about 40 Tua-
 reg and Maurs said to be linked to an internal rebellion in neighboring Mali. Some
 of the detainees were arrested in private homes, even though the Mauritanian au-
 thorities carried no search warrants. Many of the detainees spent up to a week in
 incommunicado detention, and were released only after foreign diplomats protested
 to a high-ranking Mauritanian official. With the exception of a handful who were
 indicted for stealing a vehicle, most of these persons were not charged with any
 crime.
 In 1992 there continued to be credible reports of arrests, intimidation, prolonged
 detention, and expulsion committed by security forces in communities alongthe
 Senegal River. In many cases, the homes and property of deportees were subse-
 quently expropriated by the Government.
 There is no evidence that anyone is presently being held for political reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Triae.-Mauritania has a three tier court system: the
 Shari'a courts, the Special Courts, and the State Security Court. The Government
 in June announced it was taking steps to abolish the Security Court, a chamber re-
 served for cases involving national security. This announcement came immediately
 after the widows of those killed in the 1990-1991 military purge filed a class-action
 suit charging 166 members of the armed services with engaging in torture and other
 
 
 166
 inhuman acts. The Attorney General refused to hear the case, saying that the plain-
 tiffs needed an order to prosecute signed by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces.
 At year's end, the Parliament was considering, as part of a full-scale reorganization
 of the udiciary, legislation that would eliminate the Security Court.
 Thelegal system continued to function primarily under Shari'a (Islamic Law). The
 Ministry of Justice administers Shari'a and, based on recommendations of the Chief
 Executive, selects judicial personnel. While the judiciary is nominally independent,
 judges often appear to take their cues from the Government when sentencing oppo-
 nents of the regime. Furthermore, as in other realms of Mauritanian life, tribal and
 familial relations play an important part in the trial process. The use by Islamic
 judges of extreme physical punishments, such as amputations, is no longer practiced
 in Mauritania. The Government today is slowly eliminating a number of unqualified
 Shari'a judges.
 Commercial and banking offenses, traffic violations that cause bodily harm, and
 offenses against the security of the State fall under the jurisdiction of the special
 courts, which supposedly render judgments on the basis of laws modeled aftr the
 French example. The effective implementation of justice in these courts is particu-
 larly problematic because the majority of Mauritanian judges have been trained nei-
 ther at the university level nor in the French juridical tradition.
 In theory, all defendants, regardless of the court or their ability to pay, have the
 right to be present with legal counsel during the proceedings. The law also states
 that defendants may confront witnesses, present evidence, and appeal their sen-
 tences. However, in practice these rights are regularly violated. The typical defend-
 ant, for example, has no access to the evidence against him, and meets his attorney
 for the irst time on the day of his trial. This situation is due in part to the lack
 of trained public defenders.
 Mauritanian law specifies that all persons, including foreigners, have the right to
 property and possessions and may be deprived of them only by a court decision. In
 1992, as in previous years, the practice of justice in Mauritania continued to differ
 substantially from its theory, particularly as a result of the wide discretionary pow-
 ers allowed to the security forces in rural jurisdictions. The right to a fair public
 trial was greatly circumscribed, particularly in the riverine area. Access to the
 courts for the purpose of resolving property disputes was practically nonexistent.
 In the context of the reestabis ment of relations with Senegal, approximately
 5,000 expellees had returned by late 1992. Some of them were able to reclaim lost
 land and property by making informal arrangements with the persons in possession
 of them. In September, at the instigation of the governor of the Trarza region, 63
 families who had been in Senegal since 1989 returned to their old village near
 Rosso. The families reoccupied their former homes, displacing Maurs who had
 moved in after the crisis. The governor offered compensation to the displaced Maur
 families.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 Mauritanian law, judicial warrants are required to perform home searches. This re-
 quirement is often ignored in practice, particularly in national security cases. De-
 spite the official policy of relaxation of previous strictures on the freedom of speech
 and assembly, there were in 1992 repeated reports of Government surveillance of
 suspected dissidents. The Government also continued to rely on a wide network of
 informants.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1991 Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and press, and by comparison with prior years, Mauritanians enjoyed some
 limited freedom in this area in 1992. Antigovernment tracts, newsletters, and peti-
 tions circulated freely in Nouakchott and other major cities. Several of the new po-
 litical parties held large rallies, primarily in association with the electoral cam-
 paign.
 Several new independent newspapers were launched, benefitting from the liberal-
 ized press law of nd-1991. Many of the papers criticized the Government, particu-
 larly for its perceived insensitivity to, andcondoning of, human rights abuses. Some
 of them undertook investigations of human rights violations, unresolved crimes, and
 government corruption. The papers were overseen by an independent press associa-
 tion, which was somewhat successful at defending the rights of journalists vis-a-vis
 the Government. However, both the press and the parties continued to operate with-
 in strict limits. The regime's definition of libel is particularly severe, and in the
 summer of 1992 two of three journalists facing libel charges were found guilty. They
 were given suspended sentences after human rights monitors and foreign observers
 complained to the Government about the severity of the libel law. All newspapers
 and political parties must register with the Ministry of Information, and newspapers
 
 
 167
 must submit their copy to the Ministry prior to publication. The Ministry of Infor-
 mation publishes and controls the only daily paper. The independent weeklies reach
 only a limited audience, not only due to financial constraints but also because the
 mority of Mauritanians cannot read. Radio, to which large numbers of the popu-
 lation have access, remains the unique preserve of the Ministry of Information, as
 does television.
 In practice, freedom of expression also continued to be restricted. Government offi-
 ciais found it necessary to be circumspect in criticizing official policies; military per-
 sonnel in particular were under tight surveillance, as views expressed to military
 colleagues in private which could be construed as even mildly critical of the Govern-
 ment often caused intense interrogation by security officers.
 The one university in Mauritania is government operated and the authorities re-
 portedly occasionally prevent professors from pursuing certain research and publica-
 tion interests. In 1992 a group of university professors attempting to organze a
 union separate from the National Teachers' Union were prevented from doing so
 through official pressure (see Section 6.a.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Until late 1991, all political
 movements and activities were prohibited, and such groups operated clandestinely
 or from outside the country. By comparison, 16 political parties were openly recog-
 nized and active to varying degrees in 1992. The lar est oppsition party, in con-
 junction with Mauritaman Human Rights League, held a human rights symposium
 and display in March.
 Although the new Constitution provides for the rights of assembly and associa-
 tion, political activity continued to be restricted in practice. The Government's treat-
 ment of political parties was inconsistent; some parties were allowed to call rallies
 freely while others were not. Furthermore, the law governing political parties re-
 quires that all groups register with the Minister of Interior and obtain permission
 for large meetings or assemblies. Such permits were occasionally denied, particu-
 larly in the latter half of 1992. In July an opposition rally was broken up violently
 by police. The Government continued to be criticized for witholdig a party permit
 from a group of self-proclaimed radical Islamists. The regime justified its action by
 citing the new Constitution, which forbids the establishment of parties based on re-
 ligion.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion does not exist. Islam is the official
 religion of Mauritania, and all citizens are by law Sunni Muslim. Apostasy is illegal
 and-punishable under Shari'a law. Mauritanian citizens also are prohibited from en-
 tering non-Islamic houses of worship and from possessing sacred texts of other reli-
 gions. Proselytizing by non-Muslims is prohibited, as is the construction by
 Mauritanian citizens of Christian churches or other non-Islamic houses of worship.
 The small Lebanese Shi'a community is not prohibited from privately practicing its
 religion. Likewise, the expatriate Christian community is al owed to hold worship
 services that are restricted to resident foreigners.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Histrically, there were few restrictions on movement within Mauri-
 tania, where nomadism has long been a way of life. However, following the rupture
 of relations with Senegal in 1989 and the attendant violence in the riverine area,
 local authorities imposed and enforced at their own initiative dusk-to-dawn curfews
 in some villages. Travelers also were regularly subjected to roadside and airport po-
 lice checks. These practices continued in 1992, though on a much-diminished level.
 The Government imposed curfews during two periods: in the aftermath of January's
 presidential election, and in October following a devaluation of the national cur-
 rency. During both periods opposition leaders reported being surveilled and har-
 assed by security forces. Unlike previous years, no cases were reported of persons
 being denied passports for political reasons.
 The approximately 200,000 Mauritanian Maurs expelled by the Governments of
 Senegal and Mai in 1989-1990 have now been largely absorbed into Mauritania
 through government and private means. Some of them have settled on land belong-
 ing to black Africans who were expelled from Mauritania during the crisis. Approxi-
 mately 55,000 expelled Mauritanians remain in camps in Senegal, awaiting repatri-
 ation and indemnification. Some who crossed legally into Mauritania have report-
 edly been re-expelled; the Government denies these charges. The 1989 crisis also led
 approximately 13,000 Mauritanian Peuhl to take refuge i Mai. Although the over-
 whelmin, majority apparently continue to remain there, some reportedly returned
 to Mauritania in 1992. During 1991 and 1992, Mauritania became the refuge of
 some 30,000 Tuareg and Maur refugees fleeing the ethnic strife in Mali's northern
 regions. Most of these refugees are in camps in southeastern Mauritania and are
 largely supported by an international effort led by the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Reguees.
 
 
 The Government also established a Consulate in Dakar, Senegal, for the purpose
 of documenting expellees who could prove their Mauritanian citizenship. This
 proved problemati however, as the Mauritanian security forces had destroyed or
 confiscated many of the deportees' identity documents during the 1989-1990 expul-
 sions. In 1992 the Government failed to set up transparent administrative, much
 less judicial: procedures for expellees who wished to obtain confirmation of their citi-
 zenship and the right to return to Mauritania. The Taya regime has always main-
 tained that many of the persons who fled or were expelled in the wake of the 1989
 crisis were in fact Senegalese nationals, and that their Mauritanian identity docu-
 ments were fraudulent.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1992 Mauritanians had this right only in theory. The first multiparty presi-
 dential election in Mauritanian.history was held in January with four persons com-
 peting and more than a dozen political parties participating in the campaign. How-
 ever, President Taya was returned to office based on results that were widely re-
 garded as fraudulent. As most political parties consequently boycotted the legisla-
 tive elections held in March, the new Parliament was a one-party body.
 Although the ruling Military Committee was subsequently dissolved and its pow-
 ers transferred to the Parliament many military personalities remained in positions
 of power. The President of the National Assembly, the Lower House of the Par-
 liament, was an army colonel, for example.
 Furthermore, the representation of black Maurs and black Africans remained
 minimal at the highest levels of Taya's Beydane-dominated Government. The new
 civilian regime in 1992 announced an end to the Structure for the Education of the
 Masses (SEM), a quasi-political organization that in recent years had increasingly
 become an instrument of Government for propaganda, patronage and election fraud.
 Indeed, Taya enjoyed an automatic advantage during the presidential campaign be-
 cause of his party's ability to manipulate the SEM machinery, from the prefect down
 to the neighborhood level. By the end of the year, the Government was no longer
 using the SEM for official purposes.
 Women may vote and indeed were active campaign managers during the 1992
 presidential and legislative election period. No women were elected to office, how-
 ever. In general, women are significantly underrepresented in leadership positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The only officially recognized human rights organization within the country is the
 Mauritaman Human Rights League. In 1992 the League, which had been practically
 moribund since 1989, began to show signs of rebirth. It openly criticized the Govern-
 ment, helped organize a public human rights forum and released occasional press
 declarations. Meanwhile, the Government continued to withhold recognition from
 another organization, the Mauritanian Human Rights Association, which had ap-
 p lied for an operating permit in 1991. As the President of the League is a white
 Maur, and the founder of the unrecognized association is a Halpulaar, some black
 Africans asserted that the Government's recognition of the former but not the latter
 was racially motivated.
 Two women's rights groups were active in 1992 despite a lack of official recogni-
 tion by the Government. They were the "Comite de Soutien," a support group for
 the wives and orphans of victims of the 1990-1991 military purge, and the Collec-
 tive of Families Separated by Deportation. The Collective represented the spouses
 (mainly female) and children of persons who were deported to Senegal during the
 1989 crisis. The two pups worked together to put pressure on the Taya regime
 and to educate the public about human rights abuses in Mauritania.
 In 1992 the regime permitted a visit by the International Labor Organization
 (ILO), whose agenda included human rights abuses, particularly the persistence of
 slavery (see Section 6.c.). Te Government also said that it would allow visits by
 Amnesty International and Africa Watch; these did not take place because of restric-
 tions placed by the Government on freedom of movement by the monitors.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Mauritania is situated geographically and culturally on the divide between tradi-
 tionally Nomadic Arabic (Hassaniya)-speaking Maurs of the north and sedentary
 black African cultivators who historically livedalong the Senegal River. Though cul-
 turally homogeneous, the Maurs can be racially distinguished as white (Beydane)
 or black (Haratine, literally 'one who has been freed"). The black Africans comprise
 three main ethnic groups: the Halpulaar, the Wolof, and the Soninke. The inter-
 action of these groups produces cultural diversity as well as complex ethnic tensions
 
 
 169
 in Mauritanian society. During the colonial period, the black Africans dominated the
 local economy and civil service. This situation dramatically shifted following ide-
 pendence, however, when successive regimes, both civil and military, vigorously pur-
 sued a policy of "Arabization" of the schools and the work force. The new politico-
 econonic reality is one of white Maur, or Beydane, domination. White Maurs hold
 the dominant positions in government, state enterprises, business, and religious in-
 stitutions, and many black Africans contend that this situation is a result of ethnic
 and linguistic discrimination. Taken together, the black Maurs and the black Afri-
 cans considerably outnumber the white Maur. This racial majority is by no means
 cohesive, however because many black Maurs identify more closely with the white
 Maurs, whose Arabic culture andtribal affiliations they share.
 The Government's longstanding poli  of romoting Arabic at the expense of
 French has led to a decline in the use of the latter. Although French is still widely
 spoken, particularly by black Mauritanians, the new Constitution adopted in July
 1991 eliminated French as an official language. Many black Africans charge that the
 Arabization policy is thus racially motivated.
 Black Africans also charge that the Government's 1983 Land Reform Law is in-
 creasingly being misused to allow Maurs to encroach on fertile land in the Senegal
 River valley that had been traditionally the preserve of black Africans. Mauritania's
 dry and inhospitable climate has contributed to the hostile feelings between live-
 stock-raising Maurs and farming blacks. Twenty years of drought have increased
 the traditional flow of nomads from the north into the more fertile southern regions,
 further exacerbating tensions.
 The longstanding ethnic divisions within Mauritanian society that exploded so
 violently in April 1989 have left bitter scars that will take many years to heal. The
 events of that period resulted more from an eruption of underlying ethnic hostilities
 than from officially sanctioned government policy. However, the subsequent
 extrajudicial expulsions and reprisals by the security forces were clearly based on
 ethnicity.
 Theoretically, women have legal rights to property, divorce, and child custody. In
 practice, both marriage and divorce can take place without the woman's consent. Po-
 lygyny exists and is sanctioned by the teachings of Islam; a woman does not have
 the right to refuse her husband's wish to be polygynous.
 Although a somewhat lower percentage of women than men are educated at the
 university level, there are no legal restrictions on education for women. Women are
 particularly active and influential in the informal sector of the economy. The Gov-
 ernment is encouraging the entry of women into the professions, government, and
 business, and a number of women have moved into senior or midlevel government
 positions in recent years. The Government has been instrumental in opening up new
 employment opportunities for women in areas traditionally reserved for men, such
 as hospital work. According to Mauritanian law, men and women must receive equal
 pay for equal work; Mauritania's two largest employers, the civil service and the
 state mining company, SNIM, respect this law.
 Violence against women occurs, but no data exist to indicate its extent. The police
 and judiciary occasionally intervene in domestic disputes, a fact which has become
 known only recently through the efforts of the independent press. The Government
 has taken no position nor issued any statements on violence against women or on
 female genital mutilation (circumcision), a tradition that is widely observed in Mau-
 ritania. Of the country's four ethnic groups, Maurs, Halpulaars, Soninkes and
 Wolofs, all except the Wolofs practice such female mutilation. Some practice
 infibulation, the most severe form. Some evidence indicates that the incidence of fe-
 male circumcision is diminishing in the modern, urbanized sector.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Notwithstanding the Government's liberalized policy
 of respect for freedom of association, that right was severely circumscribed in prac-
 tice for Mauritanian workers in 1992. Theoretically, all workers except members of
 the military and police are free to establish unions at the local and national levels.
 The country currently has 36 trade unions. All, however, are legally required to be
 affiliates of the Union of Mauritanian Workers (UTM), by law the country's only le-
 gally recognized central labor body. In 1992 the UTM's effectiveness in defending
 workers' interests was almost nil due to government interference.
 The current moribund state of the UTM can be traced to June 1991, when the
 Government intervened to stop a planned general strike. Through a combination of
 strong-arm tactics, coopting of in ividual union leaders, and successful backstage
 maneuvering, the Government unseated the union leadership, discredited the strik-
 ers, and installed a docile new replacement leadership team. In the course of 1992,
 the Nouakchott branch of the UTM continued attempting to defy the Government's
 
 
 170
 stranglehold on the union to no avail. In September local police forcefully broke up
 a group of Nouakchott workers who were attempting to hold a meeting at the UTM
 workers' training center, which had been closed by the Government following the
 failed 1991 strike. In November the International Labor Organization's Committee
 on Freedom of Association continued its investigation of a complaint by the Organi-
 zation of African Trade Union Unity against the Government of Mauritania for vio-
 lation of worker rights even though the new UTM leadership succeeded in getting
 the original complaint withdrawn. in theory, unions are free to form and join federa-
 tions and confederations and to affiliate with and participate in international bodies.
 This right was not exercised in 1992, however, as only the government-installed
 UTM leadership interacted with other labor organizations.
 Although Mauritanian law grants workers the right to strike, in practice strikes
 rarely occur because of government pressure. Furthermore, Mauritanian law stipu-
 lates that tripartite arbitration committees composed of union, business, and gov-
 ernment representatives may impose binding arbitration that automatically termi-
 nates any strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-By law, unions are free to or-
 anize workers without government or employer interference. According to the
 TM, close to 90 percent of industrial and commercial workers in Mauritania are
 union members. The laws providing protection against antiunion discrimination are
 regularly enforced. Genuine collective bargaining does not exist, however, because
 of the Government's heavy-handed role in shaping labor relations. Wages and other
 benefits are decided informally between individual unions, employers, the
 overnment, and the UTM. In addition, employees or employers may bring labor
 gr'evances and disputes to three-person labor courts that are overseen jointly by the
 Ministries of Justice and Labor.
 There are no export processing zones in Mauritania.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although slavery has been offi-
 cially abolished in Mauritania several times, most recently in 1980, it remains per-
 vasive, particularly in its economic and psychological manifestations. Several tens
 of thousands of persons whose ancestors were slaves still occupied positions of ser-
 vitude and near-servitude in 1992. Many of these persons were freed slaves who be-
 cause of economic necessity have either stayed with, or returned to, their former
 masters. Some of them, however, were held against their will and were forced to
 perform unpaid labor. Meanwhile, the Government has taken a passive role in en-
 orcing abolition. Reports indicate that some commerce in slaves continues, both
 through barter and inheritance of traditional slaveholder rights. Most enslaved
 Mauntanians live in nomadic communities in isolated areas where contact with out-
 siders is minimal. Their remote location makes their numbers difficult to quantify.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Mauritanian law specifies that no
 child may be employed before the age of 13 in the agricultural sector without the
 permission of the Minister of Labor, nor before the age of 15 in the nonagricultural
 sector. The law provides that employed children aged 14 to 16 should receive 70 per-
 cent of the minimum wage, and those from 17 to 18 should receive 90 percent of
 the minimum wage. In practice, the Labor Ministry's few inspectors can provide
 only limited enforcement of child labor laws, which are seen as irrelevant by a large
 majority of the country's tradition-bound society. Education is not compulsory in
 Mauritania, and only a small percentage of Mauritanian children regularly attend
 the government schools. Young children in the countryside commonly pursue
 herding, cultivation, fishing, and other significant labor in support of their families'
 activities. In keeping with longstanding tradition, many children serve apprentice-
 ships in small industries and in the informal sector. In Nouakchott and other large
 towns, youths in their early teens typically work as mechanics, blacksmiths, fur-
 niture makers, plumbers, and electricians. They can also be found in shops, gas sta-
 tions, and laundry establishments, in private homes as domestics, and on the streets
 as petty vendors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The guaranteed minimum wage for adults
 working in the private sectiir was last raised at the end of 1991. It barely enabled
 the average family to meet its minimum needs, particularly after a devaluation of
 the national currency in October 1992. The standard, legal nonagricultural work-
 week in Mauritania is set at 40 hours (or 6 days) after which workers are entitled
 to overtime compensation, which is paid at rates that are graduated according to
 the number of supplemental hours worked. Reliable data on actual wage levels ar
 scarce. Enforcement of the labor laws is the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate
 of the Ministry of Labor but in practice is limited by too few inspectors. Further-
 more it is not uncommon for employers to circumvent regulations by bribing the reg-
 ulators. Although the Government sets health and safety stvndards which are theo-
 retically enforced by the Ministry of Labor, in practice enforcement seldom occurs.
