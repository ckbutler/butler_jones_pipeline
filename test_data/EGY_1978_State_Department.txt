 EGYPT
 In 1970 President Sadat succeeded the extremely authori-
 tarian Nasser regime. Repudiating its excesses, he
 sharply curbed the activities of the secret police, has
 permitted greatly increased freedom of expression, and
 set a course of liberalization in the political, econo-
 mic, and social spheres of Egyptian life. While this
 trend continues, movement toward further liberalization
 was uneven in 1978.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is strictly forbidden under Egyptian law and
 to the best of the Department of State's knowledge has
 not recently been practiced. An individual who claims
 to have been tortured or mistreated after arrest has
 the right to redress in the courts. Police officials
 of the former Nasser Government accused of torturing
 prisoners have been tried, convicted and imprisoned.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 We do not know of any instances of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading punishment in Egypt during 1978. The death
 penalty is reserved for a limited number of crimes
 (e.g., treason and murder) and is rarely carried out
 in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, which are forbidden
 by law, no longer take place in Egypt. Government
 officials who violate the statutes are subject to
 criminal charges. While we cannot be certain that
 abuses of police power have been entirely stopped,
 (535)
 
 
 536
 such abuses would be in direct violation of law and
 government policy.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All Egyptians are guaranteed by law the right of due
 process and equal treatment, including a fair trial
 open to the public. Persons accused of espionage or
 violations of military security are tried by military
 courts which in most cases are closed to the public.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 A prior court order is required for search and seizure
 and telephone tapping. Government officials who vio-
 late this law are subject to criminal penalties.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Egyptian Government's policies and programs reflect
 a strong concern for the basic needs of the people.
 Such basic services as health care, education and
 social welfare are available both in urban areas and
 in remote villages.
 The Government has made a concerted effort over the
 past twenty years to spread the benefits of economic
 growth as widely as possible throughout the society.
 Through the use of guaranteed employment schemes and
 wage and price controls within the public sector,
 Egypt has sought to maintain egalitarian income dis-
 tribution standards.
 The "open door" policy initiated in 1974 is designed
 to encourage the development of the country's private
 sector. The revival of private economic initiative
 has helped to raise the general level of activity
 after long years of economic stagnation under the
 centrally-planned, Arab socialist system established
 by President Nasser. At the same time, the policy
 has benefitted primarily a relatively small economic
 elite of private entrepreneurs, and in addition almost
 
 
 537
 certainly exascerbated inc6me disparities. To help
 cope with the latter problem, President Sadat suc-
 ceeded in having the legislature adopt a tax reform
 measure which reduces the possibilities for corrup-
 tion, tax evasion and other abuses.
 Bribery is a fact of life in Egypt. Usually petty,
 it can sometimes be substantial. This pervasive
 practice has a debilitating effect on the Egyptian
 economy. Sensitive to the problem, the Government
 has sought to curb the practice. The Government is
 now reviewing charges that a former minister accepted
 a bribe from a major foreign firm and has announced
 its intention to prosecute the individual concerned
 if its investigation produces facts which merit such
 action.
 Given the very low living standards of poor and
 middle-class Egyptians, President Sadat has emphasized
 that food and housing are the Government's two highest
 domestic priorities. The Government currently spends
 about six percent of its Gross National Product to
 subsidize basic necessities (food, clothing, housing)
 to assure that they are affordable by the poor. While
 there remains much room for improvement of basic
 services, the Government spends some $400 million
 annually on free health and education services.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The press in Egypt is under the influence of the
 Government. Television and radio are state-controlled.
 Legally constituted political parties are permitted to
 publish their own journals, but editors are expected
 to exercise self-censorship. Journalists who oppose
 the Government's internal and foreign policies rarely
 see their articles in print. A law enacted on June 2,
 1978 gave the Government broad powers to ban publi-
 cation of newspapers and journals deemed to conflict
 with the national interest. Previously enacted
 
 
 538
 legislation empowered the Government to take action
 against attempts to incite public disorder. In its
 dealing with the press the Government has applied
 these laws sparingly. Issues of the leftist party
 weekly Al Ahali have frequently been confiscated, and
 it now appears that the Government may, at least tem-
 porarily, have refused permission for further publi-
 cation. Several issues of the right wing party weekly
 Al Ahrar have also failed to appear, but no formal
 legal action has been initiated against the journal
 or its writers. Five journalists were interrogated
 last summer for articles published abroad which were
 alleged to defame Egypt, but no further action on
 these cases has been taken.
 According to its Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic
 state which guarantees freedom of religious expres-
 sion. The provision of a June 1978 statute which bans
 from public office those advocating an ideology con-
 flicting with religion (aimed primarily at communists
 and atheists) has not been tested in the courts. It
 is unknown whether the persons who were listed by the
 Egyptian media as under interrogation in this connection
 have been banned from taking part in political activity.
 The large Coptic minority participates fully in the
 life of the country. There have been allegations that
 the Government discriminates against Coptic citizens.
 However, there is no evidence of officially inspired
 or sanctioned acts of religious discrimination. While
 the religious communities in Egypt generally respect
 each other, there have been perhaps half a dozen
 instances of communal violence over the past year. As
 a result of one of these incidents, unusual for its
 severity, there were three deaths and some serious
 injuries. When such incidents occur, they may tend to
 spark similar occurrences elsewhere in the country.
 Thus, details are usually not made public because the
 Government quashes publicity about them in an effort
 to prevent the spread of violence.
 President Sadat and other senior officials have
 publicly emphasized the need for religious tolerance.
 Last year the Coptic community expressed concern over
 proposed legislation designed to bring the Egyptian
 
 
 539
 legal code into strict conformity with Islamic
 religious law. This concern was eased by the
 "tabling" of the bills without formal presenta-
 tion to the People's Assembly and by the declara-
 tion in Sadat's new National Democratic Party
 platform that Egypt is both a Muslim and Christian
 nation.
 Since the establishment of the State of Israel, the
 Jewish population in Egypt has declined from about
 80,000 to about 500, most of whom are elderly. Rela-
 tions between the Jewish community and the Government
 are good.
 Women enjoy relatively high status in Egypt. The
 right to vote, to volunteer for non-combat duty in
 the Armed Forces, to engage in economic activity
 outside the home, and to exercise other rights of
 citizenship are assured.   Women are especially well
 represented in medicine and education. In 1962, the
 first woman was named to a cabinet position. At
 present, the Minister of Social Affairs and the
 Deputy Chairperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee
 of the People's Assembly are women. President Sadat
 has been a strong advocate of women's rights and
 various government ministries are weighing reforms
 of Egypt's personal status laws governing divorce,
 alimony, custody and polygamy. Despite these posi-
 tive indicators, women generally continue to be dis-
 advantaged. Particularly in rural areas and within
 the more traditional Muslim communities, women are
 still expected to accept a subordinate role and are
 largely restricted to the home.
 The organized trade union movement has about 7.5
 million members. Independence and freedom of action
 of labor unions has steadily increased in recent
 years. Most industry in Egypt is at least partially
 government-owned. Consequently, trade union influence
 in the Government has helped union leaders in
 negotiating with these industries and with regard to
 labor and economic legislation in the People's
 Assembly. Conversely, the Government has considerable
 say in identifying acceptable candidates for posi-
 tions of leadership in the labor movement, although
 
 
 540
 final selection among such candidates is determined
 by election. Workers do not enjoy the right to
 strike, but occasional wildcat strikes have occurred
 in recent years. To the best of our knowledge the
 Government took no action against these illegal
 strikes.
 Following the "Subsidy Riots" in January 1977, laws
 were enacted to limit the right of assembly and to
 penalize those who strike or demonstrate against the
 national interest. Numerous arrests were made at
 this time. Though most of those arrested have been
 released, an undetermined number of individual cases
 have yet to be completed in the courts. Legislation
 enacted on June 2, 1978 gave the Government broad
 powers to investigate and penalize certain categories
 of individuals whose activities were deemed "to
 conflict with the national interest and/or disturb
 social peace." No one, however, has been arrested
 under the provisions of this law. Individuals who
 were interrogated during the early summer, under the
 June 2 legislation, were represented by their
 attorneys. The Socialist Prosecutor has apparently
 halted investigations.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Individuals under criminal investigation may be banned
 from traveling abroad until the investigation is
 completed. Such bans are infrequently imposed.
 Otherwise, Egyptians are free to travel anywhere in
 their country (other than to certain military areas)
 and abroad except to Israel, with which Egypt techni-
 cally remains in a state of war pending the conclusion
 of a peace treaty. Since Sadat's peace initiative in
 November of 1977, the Government has authorized a
 limited number of delegations of Egyptians to travel
 to Israel. Egyptians, including Egyptian Jews, are
 free to emigrate. The Government permits Jews who
 are not Israeli citizens to travel freely in Egypt.
 Although President Sadat, following his trip to
 Jerusalem, invited Egyptian Jews who had left the
 country to return to Egypt, it is unlikely that there
 will be any large-scale return.
 
 
 541
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Egypt has universal suffrage. New political parties
 may be formed if 20 members of the People's Assembly
 are represented in the founding body and if the
 party's platform is both distinguishable from those
 of existing parties and consistent with the Egyptian
 Constitution. Political organizations based on
 religious or class lines are not permitted. Thirty-
 two independents hold seats in the present Assembly
 of 365 members. In recent years a wide range of
 opinion has been represented in Parliament.
 Egypt's transition from a single party to a multi-
 party state, originally scheduled for 1981, was
 rushed into effect in early 1977. By the spring of
 1978 four political parties were actively competing,
 and a vocal opposition press was established. This
 new-found freedom of expression gave rise to
 increasingly acerbic criticism of the Government.
 In accordance with the results of a national refer-
 endum on May 21, the Government moved to limit what
 it regarded as irresponsible criticism. Legislation
 enacted June 2 to carry out the results of the refer-
 endum gave the Government broad powers to ban from
 public office persons advocating any "ideology con-
 flicting with religion" and to prohibit atheists,
 communists, and certain other oppositionist groups
 from participating in political activity. Although
 two representatives were expelled from the Assembly,
 no one has been arrested under this law. The
 immediate result of the legislation was to dampen
 dissent, as was demonstrated when the new Wafd
 Party (finding three of its leaders banned from
 political activity) dissolved itself. However,
 the drift away from liberalization appears to be
 coming to an end.
 The detention camps of the Nasser era remain closed
 and the secret police apparatus remains effectively
 dismantled. Sadat has repeatedly stated that his
 intent is not to end the democratic experiment but
 to reform it. In speeches throughout the year, he
 has stated his commitment to developing democratic
 institutions, including two or more political
 
 
 542
 parties. To this end, the President formed his own
 political party, the National Democratic Party
 (NDP). Recently, members of the Socialist Liberal
 Party decided to join the majority NDP in coalition.
 Another political organization, the Socialist Labor
 Party, has been legalized in recent months, and now
 claims 22 members of the People's Assembly. A
 leftist opposition party, known as the National
 Progressive Group, is represented by two members in
 the Assembly.
 d. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government is willing to permit visits by inter-
 national groups wishing to investigate human rights
 concerns in Egypt. Most recently, a representative
 of Amnesty International observed the proceedings of
 a political trial in April, 1978.
