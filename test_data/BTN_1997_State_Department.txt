 BHUTAN
 Bhutan is a monarchy without a constitution or a bill of rights. The Wangchuk
 Dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled the country since 1907. King Jigme
 Singhye Wangchuk, on the throne since 1972, has continued efforts toward social
 
 
 1629
 and political modernization begun by his father. In recent years, there has been
 rapid progress in education, health, sanitation, and communications, and an in-
 crease in elected representatives and their role in decisionmaking. The judiciary is
 not independent of the King.
 Approximately two-thirds of the government-declared population of 600,000 is
 composed of Buddhists with cultural traditions akin to those of Tibet. The Buddhist
 majority comprises two principal ethnic and linguistic groups: the Ngalops of west-
 ern Bhutan and the Sharchops of eastern Bhutan. The remaining third of the popu-
 lation are mostly Hindus of Nepalese origin inhabiting the country's southern dis-
 tricts. Bhutanese dissident groups claim that the actual population is between
 650,000 and 700,000 and that the Government underreports the number of ethnic
 Nepalese living in the country. The rapid growth of this ethnic Nepalese segment
 of the population led the Buddhist majority to fear for the survival of their culture.
 Government efforts to tighten citizenship requirements and control illegal immigra-
 tion resulted in political protests and led to ethnic conflict and repression of ethnic
 Nepalese in southern districts during the late 1980's and early 1990's. Tens of thou-
 sands of ethnic Nepalese left Bhutan in 1991-92, many forcibly expelled. Approxi-
 mately 91,000 ethnic Nepalese remain in refugee camps in Nepal and upwards of
 15,000 reside outside the camps in the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal.
 The Government maintains that some of those in the camps were never residents
 of Bhutan, therefore, have no right to return.
 The Royal Bhutan Police, assisted by the Royal Bhutan Army, including those as-
 signed to the Royal Body Guard, and a national militia, maintain internal security.
 Some members of these forces committed human rights abuses against ethnic Nepa-
 lese.
 The economy is based on agriculture and forestr, which provide the main liveli-
 hood for 90 percent of the population and account for about half of the gross domes-
 tic product. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal hus-
 banTry. Cardamon, citrus fruit, and spices are the leading agricultural exports. Ce-
 ment and electricity are the other important exports. Strong trade and monetary
 links align the economy closely to that of India. Hydroelectric power production po-
 tential and tourism are key resources, although the Government limits foreign tour-
 ist arrivals by means of pricing policies. The gross national product per capita is
 estimated to be $470. Bhutan remains among the poorest and least developed coun-
 tries in the world.
 The Government significantly restricts the rights of the Kingdom's citizens. The
 King exercises strong, active, and direct power over the Government. Citizens do not
 have the right to change their government. The Government discouragespolitical
 parties, and none operates legafy. Judges serve at the King's pleasure. Criminal
 cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated inder a legal code established
 in the 17th century and revised in 1965. Programs to build a body of written law
 and train lawyers are progressing. For example, the Government has recently sent
 15 to 20 students to India and other countries for legal training. The Government
 restricts freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, and worker rights.
 There are significant limitations on the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, and
 citizens' privacy. Private television reception has been banned since 1989. The Gov-
 ernment has failed to reach agreement with the Government of Nepal on procedures
 for screening and repatriation of ethnic Nepalese in refugee camps. The Government
 claims that it has prosecuted government personnel for unspecified abuses commit-
 ted in the early 1990's; however, public indications are that it has done little to in-
 vestigate and prosecute security force officials responsible for torture and other
 abuses committed against ethnic Nepalese residents. A resolution adopted by the
 National Assembly in July prohibits the still-resident family members of ethnic
 Nepalese refugees from holding jobs with the Government or in the armed forces,
 although it was not enforced during the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disapbpearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 According to the Center for the Treatment of Victims of Torture, numerous ethnic
 Nepalese refugees attempting to return to Bhutan were captured by security forces,
 tortured, and sent back across the border. Instances of torture of ethnic Nepalese
 who attempted to return to Bhutan occurred in 1996. There have been no such cases
 in 1997.
 
 
 1630
 Refugee groups credibly claim that persons detained as suspected dissidents in
 the early 1990s were tortured by security forces, who alsa committed acts of rape.
 During those years, the Government's ethnic policies and the crackdown on ethnic
 Nepalese political agitation created a climate of impunity in which the Government
 tacitly condoned the physical abuse of ethnic Nepalese. The Government denies
 these abuses but also claims it has investigated and prosecuted three government
 personnel for unspecified abuses of authority during that period. Details of these
 cases have not been made public and there is little indication that the Government
 has adequately investigated or punished any security force officials involved in the
 widespread abuses of 1989-92. Human rights groups allege that Gomchen Karma,
 a Budhist monk arrested on October 23 during a peaceful demonstration in eastern
 Bhutan, was beaten to death by government officials subsequent to his arrest. Ac-
 cording to the Government, an investigation of the incident is underway and an ar-
 rest has been made.
 Prison conditions are reportedly adequate if austere. A program of visits to pris-
 ons in the capital, Thimphu, begun in 1993 by the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) and opening of a new prison in Cheingang in 1994 contributed
 to substantial improvement in conditions of detention over the primitive conditions
 that existed until a few years ago. The ICRC completed its most recent visits to the
 Cheingang central jail and the Thimphu 'detention center in October. Bhutanese
 human rights groups active outside the country maintain that prison conditions out-
 side of Thimphu remain oppressive.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Police Act of 1979, police may
 not arrest a person without a warrant and must produce an arrested person before
 a court within 24 hours of arrest, exclusive of travel time from place of arrest. Legal
 protections are incomplete, however, due to the lack of a fully elaborated criminal
 procedure code and deficiencies in police training and practice. Arbitrary arrest and
 detention remain a problem but are not routinely used as a form of harassment.
 There sometimes have been delays in informing family members of an arrest. In-
 communicado detention of suspected militants was a serious problem in 1991 and
 1992, but the initiation of ICRC prison visits and establishment of an ICRC mail
 service between detainees and family membe:-s has helped allay this problem. Of
 those detained in connection with political dissidence and violence in southern Bhu-
 tan in 1991-92, 1,685 were ultimately amnestied, 68 are serving sentences after
 conviction by the High Court, nine were acquitted by the High Court, and 71 were
 released after serving prison sentences.
 Four persons were arrested in February in Trashi and charged with involvement
 in seditious activities. They were convicted by the High Court and are currently
 serving prison sentences. Human rights groups allege that in July and August, the
 Royal Bhutan Police (RBP) in and around Samdrup Jongkar town in the east ar-
 rested some 50 suspected supporters of a Bhutanese dissident group active outside
 the country. The Government states that only 16 persons were arrested during this
 period and that they have been charged with involvement in seditious activities and
 are awaiting trial. Many were said to be supporters of United Front for Democracy
 in Bhutan (UFD) leader Rongthong Kuniley Doji, who was arrested in India on
 April 18 following the issuance of an extradition request by Bhutanese authorities.
 Doiji faces extradition proceedings in India and possible return to Bhutan to face
 charges of fraud and nonpayment of loans, and incitement to violence. The original
 Bhutanese extradition request included a third charge, "anti-national activities," but
 this was later dropped when it became clear that Indian law would preclude his ex-
 tradition to face political charges. Human rights groups say that the charges
 brought against Dorji are politically motivated and constitute an attempt by the
 government to suppress his pro-democracy activities.
 Amnesty International (At) reported that some of those arrested are feared to be
 at risk of torture. Bhutanese human rights groups outside the country claim that
 the arrests, including those of several Buddhist monks, are aimed at imposing
 Ngalop norms on the eastern, Sharchop community, which has a distinct ethnic and
 religious identity.
 Human rights activists allege that police arrested as many as 50 more persons
 participating in a peaceful demonstration in eastern Bhutan on October 23, bringing
 to approximately 100 the number of persons held on suspicion of involvement in se-
 ditious activities at year's end. Gomchen Karma, a Buddhist monk among those ar-
 rested on October 23, is alleged to have been beaten to death by a government offi-
 cial subsequent to his arrest. Another Buddhist monk arrested October 23, Thinley
 Oezor Khenpo, chief monk of eastern Bhutan, was still in custody at year's end.
 Although the Government does not formally use exile as a form  of punishment,
 many accused political dissidents freed under government amnesties say that they
 
 
 1631
 were released on the condition that they depart the country. Many of them subse-
 quently registered at refugee camps in Nepal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is no written constitution, and the judiciary
 is not independent of the King.
 The judicial system consists of district courts and a High Court in Thimphu.
 Judges are appointed by the King on the recommendation of the Chief Justice and
 may be removed by him. Minor offenses and administrative matters are adjudicated
 by village headmen.
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated under a legal code
 established in the 17th century and revised in 1965. For offenses against the State,
 state-appointed prosecutors file charges and prosecute cases. In other cases, the rel-
 evant organizations and departments of government file charges and conduct the
 prosecution. Defendants are supposed to be presented with written charges in lan-
 guages that they understand and given time to prepare their own defense. This
 practice is not always followed, however, according to some political dissidents. In
 cases where defendants cannot write their own deTense, courts assign judicial offi-
 cers to assist defendants. A legal education program is gradually building a body
 of prsons who have received formal training in the law abroad. Village headmen,
 who have the power to arbitrate disputes, make up the bottom rung of the judicial
 system. Their ecisions can be reviewed by magistrates, each with responsibility for
 a block of villages. Magistrates' decisions can be appealed to district judges, of which
 there is one for each of the country's 20 districts. The High Court in Thimphu is
 the country's supreme court. Its decisions can be appealed to the king.
 Defendants have the right to appeal to the High Court and may make a final ap-
 peal to the King, who traditionally delegates the decision to the Royal Advisory
 Council. Trials are supposed to be conducted in open hearings, however, political
 dissidents claim that this is not always the case in practice.
 Questions of family law, such as marriage, divorce, and adoption, are resolved ac-
 cording to a citizen's religion: Buddhist tradition for the majority of the population
 and Hindu tradition, which predominates in areas inhabited by ethnic Nepalese, for
 the minority.
 Some or all of the approximately 75 prisoners serving sentences for offenses relat-
 ed to political dissidence or violence, primarily by ethnic Nepalese during 1991-92,
 may be political prisoners.
 Tek-Nath Rizal, an ethnic Nepalese and internationally recognized political pris-
 oner, remained in prison following his 1993 conviction under the National Security
 Act for writing and distributing political pamphlets and attending political meet-
 ing. Nevertheless, a United Nations Human Rights Commission working group on
 arbitrary detention that visited Bhutan in 1994 at the Government's invitation de-
 termined that Rizal had received a fair trial and declared his detention "not to be
 arbitrary."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 are no laws providing for these rights. The Government requires all citizens, includ-
 ing minorities, to wear the traditional dress of the Buddhist majority when visiting
 Buddhist religious buildings, monasteries, government offices, and in schools and
 when attending official functions and public ceremonies. According to human rights
 groups police regularly conduct house to house searches for suspected dissidents
 without explanation or legal justification.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government restricts freedom of speech
 and the press.
 The country's only regular publication is Kuensel, a weekly newspaper with a cir-
 culation of 10,000, enjoys autonomous status, but is not privately owned. dhutanese
 human rights groups state that government ministries regularly review editorial
 material and have the power to, and regularly do, suppress or change content. They
 allege that the board of directors nominally responsible for editorial policy is ap-
 pointed by and can be removed by the Government. Kuensel, which publishes simul-
 taneous editions in the English, Dzongkha, and Nepali languages, supports the Gov-
 ernment but does occasionally report criticism of the King and government policies
 in the National Assembly, Indian and other foreign newspapers are available.
 The Government bans all private television reception in the country. Since 1989
 all television antennas and satellite receiving dishes have been ordered dismantled.
 The Government radio station broadcasts each day in the four major languages
 (Dzongkha, Nepali, English, and Sharchop).
 English is the medium   of instruction in schools and the national language,
 Dzongkha, is taught as second language. The teaching of Nepali as a second lan-
 guage was discontinued in 1990.
 
 
 1632
 b. Freedom of Peacefzd Assembly and Association.-The Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly and association. Citizens, may engage in peaceful assembly and as-
 sociation only for purposes approved by the Government. Although the Government
 allows civic and business organizations, there are no legal political parties. The Gov-
 ernment regards parties organized by ethnic Nepalese exiles-the Bhutan People's
 Party (BPP), the Bhutan Nationa Democratic Party (BNDP), and the Druk Na-
 tional Congress (DNC)-as "terrorist and anti-national" organizations and has de-
 clared them illegal. These parties do not conduct-activities inside the country. They
 seek the repatriation-of refugees and democratic reforn.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Buddhism is the state religion. The Government sub-
 sidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about a third of the kingdom's
 12,000 monks. That p art of the monastic establishment following the school of Bud-
 -dhism practiced by the western, Ngalop ethnic group enjoys statutory representa-
 tion- in- the National Assembly and Royal Advisory Council and is an influential
 voice on ublic policy. Citizens of other faiths, mostly Hindus, enjoy freedom of wor-
 ship but may not proselytize. Under the law, conversions are illegal.
 The King has declared major Hindu festivals to be national holidays, and the
 royal, familyt participates -in them. Foreign missionaries" are not permitted to pros-
 elytize, but international Christian relief organizations and Jesuit priests are active
 in education and humanitarian activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Counry, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizenstraveling- in .border regions are required to show their citizen-
 ship identity cards at immigration check oints, which -in some cases are located at
 a considerable distance from what is in effect an open border with India. By treaty,
 citizens may reside and work in India.
 See Section 5 regarding the ethnic Nepalese refugee situation.
 'Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 - Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Bhutan is a monarchy
 with soereign power vested, inthe King. There are, however, elected or .partially
 elected assemble s at the local, district, and national levels, and the Government
 _purports to encourage decentralization and citizen participation. Since 1969, the Na-
 tional Assembly has hadthe pwer to remove ministers, who are appointed by the
 King, _but has never done~s. Plitical- authority resides ultimately in the King and
 decisionmaking involves "only a small number of officials. However, major decisions
 are routinely made by officials subject to questioning by the National .Assembly, but
 it is- not known to have overturned any decisions reached by the King and govern-
 Political parties do not legally exist, and their formation is discouraged by the
 Government .as unnecessarily. divisive. The Government prohibits parties estab-
 lished abroad by ethnic Nepalse (see Section 2.b.).
 The National Assembly established in 1953, has 150 members. Of these, 105 are
 elected by the people, 10 are selected by a part of the Buddhist clergy, and the re-
 maining 35 are appointed by the King to represent the Government.
 The procedures for the nomination and election of National Assembly members
 are set .out in an amendment to the country's Basic Law proposed by the King and
 adopted by the-73rd session of the National Assembly in 1995. It provides that in
 order to be eligible for nomination as a candidate for election to the National Assem-
 bly, a person must be a citizen of Bhutan, be at least 25 years of age, not be married
 to a foreign national, not have been terminated or compulsorily retired for mis-
 conduct from government service, not have committed any act of treason against the
 King, the people, and country, have no criminal record or any criminal case pending
 against him, have respect for the nation's laws, and be able to read and write in
 Ddzongkha (the language, having different dialects in eastern and western Bhutan,
 spoken by Bhutanese Buddhists).
 Each National Assembly constituency consists of a number of villages. Each vil-
 lage is permitted to nominate one candidate but must do so by consensus. There
 is no provision for self-nomination and the law states that "no person. ., may cam-
 pagn for the candidacy or canvass through other means." If more than one village
 within a constituency puts forward a candidate, an election is conducted by the dis-
 trict development committee, and the candidate obtaining a simple majority of votes
 cast is declared the winner. The law does not make clear how a candidate is selected
 if none achieves a simple majority. It does state, however, that in case of a tie
 among the candidates in the election, drawing of lots shall be resorted to. The can-
 didate whose name is drawn shall be deemed to be elected.
 Bhutanse human rights activists state that the only time individual citizens have
 any involvement in choosing a National Assembly representative is when they are
 
 
 1633
 asked for their consensus approval of a village candidate by the village headman.
 The name put to villagers for consensus approval by the headman is suggested to
 him by district officials, who in turn take their direction from the central govern-
 ment. Consensus approval takes place at a public gathering. There is no secret bal-
 lot, according to human rights activists.
 The Assembly enacts laws, approves senior government appointments, and ad-
 vises the King on matters of national importance. Voting is by secret ballot, with
 a simple majority needed tpass a measure. The King may not formally veto legis-
 lation, but may return bills or further consideration. The Assembly occasionally re-
 jects the King's recommendations or delays implementing them, but in general, the
 King has enough influence to persuad  e Assembly to approve legislation that he
 considers essential or to withraw proposals he opposes. The Assembly may ques-
 tion government officials and force them to resign by a two-thirds vote of no con-
 fidence. However, the National Assembly has never compelled any government offi-
 cial to resign.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics, although they have
 made small but visible gains. Three women hold seats in the National Assembly.
 All major ethnic groups, including ethnic Nepalese, are represented in the Na-
 tional Assembly. There are 16 "southern Bhutanese" in the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igat ion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal human rgts nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) in Bhu-
 tan. The Government regards human rights groups established by ethnic Nepalese
 exiles--the Human Rights Organization of Bhutan, the People's Fom for Human
 Rights in Bhutan, and the Association of Human Rights Activists - Blutan-as po-
 litical organizations and does not permit them to operate in Bhutan. Amnesty Inter-
 national visited Bhutan in 1992 to investigate and report on the alleged abuse of
 ethnic Nepalese. It has not been permitted to return in the years since.
 ICRC representatives continue their periodic prison visits, and the Government
 has allowed them access to detention facilities, including those in southern districts
 inhabited by ethnic Nepalese. The chairman and members of the United Nations
 Human Rights Cormission Working Group on Arbitrary Detention made a second
 visit to Bhutan in May 1996 as a fonow-up to an October 1994 visit. In addition
 to meetings with government officials, members of the working group visited prisons
 and interviewed prisoners in Thimphu  huntsling, and Samtse.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Ongoing Government efforts to cultivate a national identity rooted in the lan
 euage, religion, and culture of the Ngalop ethnic group constrain cultural expression
 by other ethmncgroups. In the 1980's andearly 1990's, concern over rapid population
 growth and pitical agitation by ethnic Nepalese resulted in policies and abusive
 practices that led to the departure of tens of thousands of members of this group,
 many forcibly expelled.
 The Government claims that ethnic and gender discrimination in employment is
 not a problem. It claims that ethnic Nepaese fill 28 percent of Government jobs,
 which slightly exceeds their share of the current total population. Bhutanese human
 rights groups active outside the country claim that ethnic Nepaese actually make
 up about 35 percent of Bhutan's population and that the Government under-reports
 their number. Women are accorded respect in the traditions of most ethnc groups;
 however, persistence of traditional gender roles apparently accounts for the low pro-
 portion of women in Government employment. Exile groups claim that ethnic and
 gender discrimination is a problem.
 Women.-There is no evidence of extensive rape or spousal abuse. Kuensel re-
 poerted that charges of rape or attempted rape were brought in at least one case.
 However, a conviction and sentence was not reported.
 There are credible reports by refugs and human rights groups that security
 forces raped large numbers of ethnic Nepalese women in southernBhutan in 1991
 and 1992. According to Amnesty International, some women were said to have died
 as a result. In one independent survey of 1,779 refugee families, 26 percent of the
 respondents cited rape, fear of rape, or threat of rape as a prime reason for their
 departure from BhButan. The Government has denied these reports.
 Rape was made a criminal offense in 1953, but that law had weak penalties and
 was poorly enforced. In 1993 the National Assembly adopted a revised rape act with
 clear defimitions of criminal sexual assault and strongernalties. In cases of rape
 involving minors, sentences range from 5 to 17 years. In extreme cases, a rapist
 may be imprisoned for life.
 
 
 1634
 Women comprise 48 percent of the population and participate freely in the social
 and economic life of the country. Forty-three percent of enrollment in school is fe-
 male, and women account for 16 percent of civil service employment. Inheritance
 law provides for equal inheritance among all sons and daughters, but traditional in-
 heritance practices, which vary among ethnic groups, may be observed if the heirs
 choose to forego legal challenges. Dowry is not practiced, even among ethnic Nepa-
 lese Hindus. Inheritance practices favoring daughters among some groups are said
 to account for large numbers of women among owners of shops and businesses and
 an accompanying tendency of women to drop out of higher education to go into busi-
 ness. On the other hand, female school enrollment has been growing in response to
 government policies. Women are increasingly found among senior officials and pri-
 vate sector entrepreneurs, especially in the tourism industry. Women in unskilled
 jobs are generally paid slightly less than men.
 Polygyny is sanctioned provided the first wife gives her permission. Marriages
 may be arranged by partners themselves as well as-by their parents. Divorce is com-
 mon. Recent legislation requires that all marriages must be registered and favors
 women in matters of alimony.
 Children.-The Government has demonstrated its commitment to child welfare by
 its rapid expansion of primary schools, health-care facilities, and immunization pro-
 grams. The mortality rates. for both infants and children under 5-years have
 dropped dramatically since 1989, and primary school enrollment has increased at
 9 percent a year since 1991, with enrollment of girls increasing at a yet higher rate.
 In 1995 the participation rate for boys -and girls in primary schools was estimated
 at 72 percent, with the rate of completion of 7 years of schooling at 60 percent for
 girls and 59 percent for boys. Children enjoy a privileged position in society and
 benefit from international development programs focused on maternal and child
 welfare.
 A study by UNICEF found that boys and girls receive equal treatment regarding
 nutrition and health care and that there is little difference in child mortality rates
 between the -sexes., Government policies aimed at increasing enrollment of girls have
 increased the proportion of girls in primary schools from 39 percent in 1990 to 43
 percent in 1995.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence of official discrimination toward
 people with disabilities but the Government has not passed legislation mandating
 accessibility for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic Nepalese have lived in southern
 Bhutan for centuries, and the early phases of economic development at the turn of
 the century brought a large influx of additional ethnic Nepalese. In the late 1980's,
 concern over the increase of population and political agitation among ethnic Nepa-
 lese prompted aggressive government efforts to assert a national culture, tighten
 control over southern regions, control illegal-immigration, expel.ethnic Nepalese,
 and promote national integration. Early efforts at national integration focused on
 assimilation, including financial incentives for intermarriage, education for some
 students in regions other than their own, and an increase in development funds in
 the south.
 Beginning in 1989,-more -disriminatory measures were introduced, aimed at
 shaping a new national identity, known as Drukpa, based on the customs of the
 non-Nepalese Ngalong ethnic group predominant in western Bhutan. Measures in-
 cluded a requirement that national dress be worn for official occasions and as a
 school uniform, the teaching of Dzongkha as a second language in all schools, and
 an end to instruction in Nepali as a second language. (English .is the language of
 instruction in all schools). Also, beginning in 1988, the Government refused to
 renew the contracts of tens of thousands of Nepalese guest workers. Many of these
 workers had resided in Bhutan for years, in some cases with their families.
 Citizenship became a highly contentious issue. Requirements for citizenship were
 first formalized in the Citizenship Law of 1958, which granted citizenship to all
 adults who owned land and had lived in Bhutan for at least 10 years. In 1985, how-
 ever, a new citizenship law significantly tightened requirements for citizenship and
 -resulted in the denaturalization of many ethnic Nepalese. While previously citizen-
 ship was conferred upon children whose father was a citizen under the 1958 law,
 the 1985 law raised this standard by requiring that both parents be citizens to con-
 fer citizenship on offspring. The law permits residents who lost citizenship under
 the 1985 law to apply for naturalization if they can prove residence during the pre-
 vious 15 years. The Government declared as illegal immigrants all residents who
 could not meet the new requirements.
 The 1985 Citizenship Act also stipulates the revocation of citizenship of any natu-
 ralized citizen who "has shown by act or speech to be disloyal in any manner what-
 
 
 .1635
 soever to the King, country, and people of Bhutan.' The Home Ministry, in a cir-
 cular notification in 1990, advised that "any Bhutanese nationals leaving the coun-
 try to assist and help the anti-nationals shall no longer be considered as Bhutanese
 citizens . . . such people's family members livingin the same household will also
 be held fully responsible and forfeit their citizensi p." Human rights groups allege
 that these provisions were widely used to revoke the citizenship of ethnic Nepalese
 who were subsequently expelled or otherwise departed from Bhutan. Beginning in
 1988, the Government expelled numbers of ethnic Nepalese through enforcement of
 the citizenship laws.
 Outraged by what they saw as a campaign of repression, ethnic Nepalese mounted
 a series of demonstrations, sometimes violent, in September 1990. The protests were
 spearheaded by the newly-formed Bhutan People's Party (BPP) which demanded full
 citizenship rights for ethnic Nepalese, the reintroduction of Nepali as a medium of
 education in the south, and democratic reforms. Characterizing the BPP as a "ter-
 rorist" movement backed by Indian sympathizers, the authorities cracked down on
 its activities and ordered the closure of local Nepalese schools, clinics, and develop-
 ment programs after several were raided or bombed by dissidents. Many schools
 were reportedly turned into Army barracks. There were credible reports that many
 ethnic Nepalese activists were beaten and tortured while in custody, and that secu-
 rity forces committed acts of rape. There were also credible reports that militants,
 including BPP members, attacked and murdered census officers and other officials,
 and engaged in bombings. Local officials took advantage of the climate of repression
 to coerce ethnic Nepalese to sell their land below its fair value and emigrate.
 Beginning in 1991, ethnic Nepalese began to leave southern Bhutan in large num-
 bers and take refuge in Nepal. Many were forcibly expelled. According to Amnesty
 International, entire villages were sometimes evicted en masse in retaliation for an
 attack on a local government official. Many ethnic Nepalese were forced to sign "vol-
 untary migation forms" wherein they agreed to leave Bhutan, after local officials
 threatened to fine or imprison them for failing to comply. By August 1991, according
 to NGO reports, 2,500 refugees were already cam ped illegally in Nepal, with a
 steady stream still coming from Bhutan. The UMCR began providing food and
 shelter in September of that year, and by year's end, there were 6,000 refugees in
 Nepal. The number of registered refugees grew to approximately 62,000 by August
 1992, and to approximately 80,000 by June 1993, when the UNHCR began individ-
 ual screening of refugees. The flow slowed considerably thereafter and is now less
 than a dozen persons a month. At the close of 1997, there were approximately
 91,000 refugees registered in camps in Nepal, with much of the increase since 1993
 the result of natural increase. An additional 15,000 refugees, according to UNHCR
 estimates, are living outside the camps in Nepal and India.
 Ethnic Nepalese political groups in exile complain that the revision of Bhutan's
 citizenship laws in 1985 denaturalized tens of thousands of former residents of Bhu-
 tan. They also complain that the new laws have been selectively applied and make
 unfair demands for documentation on a largely illiterate people in a country that
 has only recently adopted basic administrative procedures. They claim that many
 ethnic Nepalese whose families have been in Bhutan for generations were expelled
 in the early 1990's because they were unable to document their claims to residence.
 The Government denies this and asserts that a three-member village committee-
 typically ethnic Nepalese in southern Bhutan--certifies in writing that a resident
 is a Bhutanese citizen in cases where documents cannot be produced.
 The Government maintains that many of those who departed Bhutan in 1991-92
 were Nepalese or Indian citizens who came to Bhutan after the enactment of the
 1958 Citizenship law but were not detected until a census in 1988. The Government
 also claims that many persons registered in the camps as refugees may never have
 resided in Bhutan. A royal decree in 1991 made forcible expulsion bf a citizen a
 criminal offense. In a January 1992 edict, the King noted reports that officials had
 been forcing Bhutanese nationals to leave the country but stressed that this was
 a serious and punishable violation of law. Nevertheless, only three officials were
 ever punished for abusing their authority during this period. According to the
 UNHCR, the overwhelming majority of refugees who have entered the camps since
 screening began in June 1993 have documentary proof of Bhutanese nationality.
 Random checs and surveys of camp residents-including both pre- and post-June
 1993 arrivals-bear this out.
 A Nepal-Bhutan ministerial committee met seven times in 1994-96, and a sec-
 retarial-level committee met twice in 1997 in efforts to resolve the Bhutanese refu-
 ee problem. These discussions have made little progress. In March 1996 refugees
 egan a series of "peace marches" from Nepal to Bhutan to assert their right to re-
 turn to Bhutan. The marchers who crossed into Bhutan in August, November, and
 December were immediately detained and deported by Bhutanese police. In the De-
 
 
 1636
 cember 1996 incident, police reportedly used force against the marchers. A resolu-
 tion adopted by the National Assembly in July prohibits the still-resident family
 members of ethnic Nepalese refugees from holding jobs with the Government or in
 the armed forces. Under the resolution, those now holding such jobs are to be invol-
 untarily retired. By year's end, the resolution mandating involuntary retirement
 from government service or the armed forces for family members of ethnic Nepalese
 refugees had not been enforced, i.e., no one had been forcibly retired for this reason.
 The Government made clear that for the purposes of this resolution, family member
 would be defined as a parent, child, sibling, or member of the same household.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unionism is not permitted, and there are no
 labor unions. Workers do not have the right to strike, and the Government is not
 a member of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no collective bargain-
 ing in industry, which accounts for about 25 percent of the gross domestic product,
 but it employs only a minute fraction of the total work force. The Government af-
 fects wages in the manufacturing sector through its control over wages in state-
 owned industries.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government abolished its sys-
 tem of compulsory labor taxes in December 1995. Laborers in rural development
 schemes previously paid through this system will now be paid regular wages. There
 is no evidence to suggest that domestics are subject to coerced or bonded labor. The
 law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such prac-
 tices are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 set the minimum age for employment at 18 years for citizens and 20 years for non-
 citizens. A UNICEF study suggested that children as young as 11 years are some-
 times employed with road-building teams. The law does not specifically prohibit
 forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur (see
 Section 6.c.). Primary school education is free and compulsory, and 72 percent of the
 school-aged population is enrolled. Children often do agricultural work and chores
 on family farms. While there is no law barring ethnic Nepalese children from at-
 tending school, the fact that most of the 75 primary schools in southern Bhutan that
 were closed in 1990 remain shut today acts as an effective barrier to this group at-
 taining primary education.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A circular effective February 1, 1994, estab-
 lished wage rates, rules and regulations for labor recruiting agencies, and regula-
 tions for payment of workmen's compensation. Wage rates are periodically revised,
 and range upward from a minimum of roughiy $1.50 (50 ngultrums) per day for un-
 skilled and skilled laborers, with various allowances paid in cash or kind in addi-
 tion. This minimum wage does provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family in the local context. The workday is defined as 8 hours with a 1 hour lunch
 break. Work in excess of this must be paid at one and a half times normal rates.
 Workers paid on a monthly basis are entitled to 1 day's paid leave for 6 days of
 work and 15 days of leave annually. The largest salaried work force is the govern-
 ment-service, which has an administered wage structure last revised in 1988 but
 supplemented by special allowances and increases since then, including a 25 percent
 increase on July 1. Only about 30 industrial plants employ more than 50 workers.
 Smaller industrial units include 69 plants of medium size, 197 small units, 692
 "mini" units, and 651 cottage industry units. Bhutan's rugged geography and land
 laws that prohibit a farmer from selling his last five acres result in a predominantly
 self-employed agricultural work force. Workers are entitled to free medical care
 within the country. They are eligible for compensation for partial or total disability,
 and in the event of death, their families are entitled to compensation. Existing labor
 regulations do not grant workers the right to remove themselves from work situa-
 tions which endanger health and safety without jeopardizing their continued em-
 ployment.
