 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa lies in the South Pacific Ocean approximately 5000
 miles southwest of the Continental United States and 1600 miles
 northeast of New Zealand. There are two main islands containing
 a population of approximately 158,000. After more than forty
 years of U.N. Trusteeship and League of Nations mandate rule by
 New Zealand, Western Samoa became independent on January 1,
 1962. It still maintains a formal treaty relationship with New
 Zealand. Apia, population 35,000, is the capital and commercial
 center and the only major city in the country. Samoans are the
 second largest Polynesian group, after the Maori of New Zealand,
 and speak a Polynesian dialect.
 Despite exposure to European influence for more than 150 years,
 Samoans have tended to retain their traditional ways.
 Increasing exposure to outside influences, however, is beginning
 to bring about change. Most Samoans still live within the
 traditional social system based upon the laiga,O or extended
 family group, headed by a 'matai," or chief. The title of
 Omatail is conferred by consensus of the 'aiga" upon any
 eligible member of the group, including women, with the common
 consent of the "aiga."  The "matai* is responsible for the
 general welfare of the laigal and directs the use of family
 lands and other assets, in addition to representing the 'aiga"
 in village and district Ifono,l or councils.
 The Western Samoan Constitution, adopted by a universal suffrage
 plebiscite in October 1960, is based upon the British pattern of
 parliamentary democracy, modified to take Samoan customs into
 account. The present head of state in Western Samoa, Malietoa
 Tanumafili II, will hold the position for life. Future heads of
 state will be elected by the Legislative Assembly for five-year
 terms. The head of state appoints as Prime Minister the elected
 member of the Legislative Assembly who commands majority support
 in the Assembly. The Prime Minister heads the Government, and
 with his advice, the head of state appoints the members of the
 cabinet. The Prime Minister and Cabinet hold office as long as
 they retain the confidence of the Legislative Assembly. The
 Assembly has 47 members elected for three-year terms.
 There were no major human rights issues in Western Samoa in
 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political killing
 Killing for political motives, whether by the Government or by
 opposition political organizations, does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no secret arrests, clandestine detention or abductions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 Torture and cruel or degrading treatment or punishment is
 prohibited by law and does not exist. The Constitution states
 that "no person shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment.'

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 There are-no political prisoners. Habeas corpus exists and is
 practiced. Preventive detention does not exist. Under
 Western Samoan law those arrested are charged promptly,
 normally within twenty-four hours. Persons awaiting
 sentencing are housed in the same detention facilities with
 those already convicted and serving time. Local custom is
 taken into account in sentencing. Most Samoans are arrested
 for relatively minor offenses, and their terms of sentence are
 short. Western Samoan law does, however, allow for the death
 sentence and several people have received it, but no one has
 actually been executed since independence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 Western Samoan law guarantees the right to a fair public
 trial, and this right is faithfully honored. Defendants are
 charged promptly after their arrest, and all charges are
 stated formally and clearly. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel, and assessors are provided to assist in cases
 involving traditional matters. There are no special courts to
 deal with political or security offenses. The judiciary is
 independent of government interference or influence. Trial by
 jury is unknown in Western Samoa due to the family linkages
 that would make most juries biased.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Government respects the privacy of its population and does
 not permit arbitrary interference with family, home, or
 correspondence. Both law and local custom provide for the
 protection from invasion of the home and seizure of property
 without due course of law, i.e., search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.
 Included as part of the fundamental rights in the Constitution
 are the freedoms of speech and expression. These rights are
 respected in practice. Western Samoa has a vigorous free
 press. The government-owned radio station regularly reports
 opposition views. The Government reserves the power to
 restrict these rights only as they may affect the public
 order, morals, or national security of the country. There
 have been no cases of infringement of these rights by the
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees as freedoms the right to assemble
 peacefully without arms and to form associations or unions.
 There is no real trade union movement within Western Samoa,
 although the public service has an employees' organization
 which exercises collective bargaining. The Government has
 freely permitted attempts to develop unions within the
 country, and the courts have upheld the rights to strike and
 enter into arbitration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.
 Guaranteed within the Constitution is the right of every

 person to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This
 includes the right to change one's religion or belief at will
 and, either alone or with others, in public or private, to
 manifest this religion in worship or teaching, practice and
 observance. These rights are respected. Nearly 100 percent
 of the population is Christian with about half of the
 population associated with the London Missionary Society.
 Approximately 40 percent is equally divided between the Roman
 Catholic and Methodist churches. There is no state or
 government-favored religion, nor is advantage given to any
 particular faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 The Constitution also guarantees to all citizens of Western
 Samoa the right to move freely throughout the country and to
 change residence. They are also free to travel abroad, and
 the rights of emigration and repatriation are respected.
 There are no refugees in Western Samoa other than a few
 Iranians of the Bahai faith.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Western Samoa's Government is based upon the Westminster
 parliamentary system with real power vested in the Prime
 Minister and the Legislative Assembly. Forty-five of the
 Assembly members are *matail elected by other Imatai' and two
 members are elected by universal suffrage among those citizens
 who are not Samoan by heritage. When a *matail seeks election
 to the Legislative Assembly, he or she campaigns throughout
 the constituency, knowing that the extended family will
 influence the voting of their 'matai.0 *Matail traditionally
 consult with the extended family they have been chosen to
 represent before making decisions for the group.
 The Imatai' system is a predominately conservative force, but
 is beginning to change. The number of "matail titles has
 increased from 12,000 to 15,000 in the last year. The one
 woman member of parliament has charged that this rapid
 increase is a result of corruptions of the "matail system and
 has urged a return to the more traditional methods of
 selecting "matais" in order to protect Samoan custom.
 Traditionally, Samoans elected the -matai- on the basis of
 leadership capabilities and not only on seniority within the
 extended family. Since the title brings with it certain
 privileges and the ability to direct the use of family assets,
 it has become a commodity of some value. It is not unknown to
 offer an unused title to someone outside the family or to
 share titles with people who would otherwise not be elected;
 thus the proliferation of titles. Also only Imatais' can vote
 in elections for members to the legislative assembly. This
 limited suffrage reflects the choice by the entire populace to
 adhere to Samoan custom through the instrument of the
 Constitution.
 In the past Samoa did not have organized political parties;
 members of the Legislative Assembly rallied around leading
 personalities, and the personality receiving the majority
 support of Assembly members became Prime Minister. In the
 1982 elections, several candidates formed the Human Rights
 Protection Party which now governs, headed by Prime Minister
 Tofilau Eti. Members of the Assembly who oppose the
 Government are not formally organized as a party.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests for human rights investigations have been made to
 the Western Samoan Government. Although the governing party
 calls itself the "Human Rights Protection Party,* there are no
 known internal human rights organizations. The Amnesty
 International 1984 Report has no entry for Western Samoa.
 Freedom House's 1984-85 report terms it 'partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Western Samoan economy is slowly improving after the
 adoption of austerity measures by the Government over the last
 two years. These measures have not deprived any sector of
 their economic and social needs on a discriminatory basis.
 Except in the capital, Western Samoan land is not individually
 owned. According to the 1981 census, the population of
 Western Samoa is approximately 156,349 with a growth rate, due
 to emigration, of only .6 percent. The birth rate is
 substantially higher than that figure. The mortality rate,
 according to 1982 World Health organization figures, is 35 per
 1000 live births. Samoans with access to safe water are about
 43 percent of the entire population, 100 percent in urban
 areas and 23 in rural areas. Ninety percent of the work force
 remains in agriculture, cultivating both subsistence and cash
 crops. Per capita income is estimated at $623 as of 1981
 (according to Asian Development Sank-ADB-estimates), but an
 adequate food supply is available to meet most of the
 populations's caloric intake requirements. Life expectancy at
 birth-is approximately 66 years. Health standards are good,
 and adequate medical care is available. Education is not
 compulsory or free but primary school enrollment is
 approximately 80 percent as of 1980 (ADB), and the adult
 literacy rate is 98 percent.
 Under the Constitution, women are afforded the same rights as
 men. While women have been active in the legislative
 assembly, other public offices and community affairs, they are
 generally underutilized in proportion to their share of the
 population.
