 MAURITANIA
 The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been governed since
 1978 by the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN).
 Colonel Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, President of the
 Committee and Chief of State, assumed power in 1984 after the
 bloodless ouster of the former president, Lt. Col. Mohamed
 Khouna Ould Haidalla. All 18 members of the Military
 Committee hold ministerial portfolios or occupy other key
 military or government positions. The Committee functions
 nominally as a legislative body under the direction of
 President Taya, and the President, assisted by his Council of
 Ministers and a few close advisers, wields executive power.
 Political and opposition parties are prohibited in Mauritania.
 Mauritanian security forces number about 16,000 and, in
 addition to the regular armed forces, include the National
 Guard, the Gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary
 police), and the police. The Gendarmerie is directed by the
 Ministry of Defense, while the National Guard and police come
 under the Ministry of Interior. The security forces continued
 to be responsible for widespread human rights abuse.
 Mauritania continues to face massive economic and social
 problems: drought, desertification, insect infestation, the
 Western Sahara conflict, extensive unemployment, rapid
 inflation, one of the highest per capita foreign debts in
 Africa, minimal infrastructure, inadequate health and
 education systems, and an exodus from rural areas. Although
 rainfall levels have improved during the past 3 years, the
 prior drought years forced large numbers of nomads into towns,
 with a consequent weakening of traditional Maur nomadic
 culture and a severe strain on government resources.
 The human rights situation in Mauritania continued to
 deteriorate in 1990. In the aftermath of the 1989 rioting,
 tens of thousands of Senegalese citizens as well as
 Pular-speaking Mauritanian citizens were extrajudicially
 expelled to Senegal. According to the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as many as 45,000 of these
 Mauritanian citizens remained encamped on the Senegalese side
 of the border during 1990 and were not allowed to return by
 the Mauritanian Government. During mid-October, however, the
 UNHCR began a little-publicized program of repatriating
 Mauritanians from Senegal for reunification with their
 families in Mauritania. There were recurring incidents of
 cross-border violence, as armed bands of expellees regularly
 crobsed the river from Senegal to carry out raids in
 Mauritania. The Government reacted swiftly and harshly, and
 security forces meted out severe punishment to anyone it
 suspected of being involved with, or even sympathetic to, the
 raiders. There were numerous credible reports of
 extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and further
 expulsions, particularly during the first 6 months of 1990.
 These extrajudicial actions by government security forces
 helped to create a climate of unbridled frontier justice in
 parts of southern Mauritania in early 1990. In an attempt to
 rein in the security forces, the Minister of Interior issued
 instructions prohibiting abuses and threatened to discipline
 violators. Some were transferred, but no other sanctions were
 reported. Credible reports of unlawful detention and torture
 surfaced during the year, and most other human rights,
 including denial of fair public trial, freedom of expression,
 association, and the right of citizens to change their
 government remained tightly circumscribed. President Taya
 
 
 23
 MAURITANIA
 released 11 Halpulaar prisoners from detention in
 mid-September. However, well over 1,000 Halpulaars and
 Soninkes were arrested in late 1990 on questionable charges of
 coup plotting.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Government security forces engaged in widespread extrajudicial
 killings of persons, particularly non-Hassaniya-speaking black
 Mauritanians, suspected of being sympathetic to Mauritanian
 refugees who crossed from Senegal into Mauritania tcL attack
 military installations and villages and to seize property they
 considered rightfully theirs. Although it is impossible to
 determine how many black Mauritanians were summarily executed,
 substantial numbers of victims were reported in almost every
 town and village along the Senegal river. In April and May,
 at least 15 civilians were extrajudicially killed by security
 forces for suspected sympathy to the raiders in the regions of
 Guidimaka and Brakna. Security forces also killed villagers
 who refused to submit to soldiers' demands for food and
 supplies. In May security forces killed two young boys who
 refused to surrender their cow near Diagnily and later killed
 a father and son near Maghama also for refusal to supply a cow
 to the soldiers. Security forces also engaged in
 indiscriminate shooting at unarmed villagers, such as the
 killing by National Guardsmen of a Muslim religious leader at
 Ngoral-Guidal as he emerged from bathing in a river. At
 year's end, there were no reports of Government inquiries into
 these incidents or any efforts to punish those responsible.
 White and black Maurs in southern Mauritania used firearms
 provided by the Government, ostensibly for self-defense
 against cross-border raids, to'attack unarmed non-Hassaniya-
 speaking blacks. On April 27, an armed group of black Maurs
 attacked non-Hassaniya-speaking families near Sedelme,
 Guidimaka, killing 14 persons. Also in April three 15-year-
 old Peuhl shepherds were beaten to death by black Maurs in
 Guidimaka. These bands reportedly acted with the tacit
 approval, and in some cases active encouragement, of local
 security forces (see also Section l.c.). There were no
 reports of government investigation into these incidents by
 the end of the year.
 b. Disappearances
 There were no confirmed incidents of disappearance in 1990.
 People believed to have disappeared were subsequently
 determined to have been extrajudicially killed or expelled.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Despite the Government's stated opposition to torture and
 legal prohibition against its use, the security forces often
 used harsh interrogation techniques against dissidents and
 black Mauritanians, particularly in the southern regions along
 the Senegal river. Many of the detainees arrested in November
 (see Section l.d.) were also subjected to harsh interrogation
 techniques. The forms of torture included beatings and denial
 of water and food. The Imam from Gourel Guida, detained after
 
 
 234
 MAURITANIA
 criticizing the Government for arbitrary arrests and
 extrajudicial punishment, died as a result of lengthy torture
 by the Gendarmerie. On July 21, a Halpulaar herd owner was
 taken into custody by the Gendarmerie near M'bout and
 subsequently beaten to death. He was suspected of having sold
 some of his livestock in Senegal. A Halpulaar shepherd died
 as a result of torture by security forces near Selibaby Founti
 in May. There were no known investigations into incidents of
 torture by the end of 1990.
 There were also reports of abuse and rape of women by security
 forces. In June the mayor of Wompou was severely beaten by
 six soldiers after he intervened to prevent the soldiers from
 absconding with young women from the village. The Government
 subsequently arrested the six soldiers and publicly promised
 to discipline them appropriately, although no announcement
 about punishment of the six had been made by year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Mauritanian law assures expeditious arraignment and
 trial, access to legal counsel, and the right of appeal, these
 rights are frequently not observed, particularly in cases of
 political dissidents or persons suspected on national security
 grounds. They are somewhat more often observed in ordinary
 criminal cases. The courts must review the legality of a
 person's detention no more than 72 hours after his or her
 arrest. Many people are detained without charge and held
 incommunicado such as Traore Ladji, a prominent Mauritanian
 economist, who was detained by the Government from October
 1989 to September 1990, He was held incommunicado, was never
 charged, brought to trial, or given access to legal counsel.
 On March 17, former Foreign Minister Hamdi Ould Mouknass was
 arrested by the police and held incommunicado for
 approximately 1 week, before being released. Mouknass was
 never charged, tried, or given access to legal counsel, and no
 reason for his detention was given. In March security
 officials detained at least 20 prominent Halpulaars in
 Nouakchott suspected of involvement with an illegal Halpulaar
 dissident organization. At least two were released 1 or 2
 days later. The fate of the others remained unknown at the
 end of the year. In late November, the Government began
 arresting non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians in the
 military as well as civilian sectors. By the end of the year,
 .between 1,000 and 2,000 persons had been arrested. All were
 held incommunicado. There were persistent reports that some
 persons had been tortured to death or were secretly executed
 without trial by government security forces. The Government
 alleges that those arrested had been involved in a plot to
 assassinate key officials and to commit acts of sabotage.
 Despite promises to respect due process, by year's end the
 Government had not pressed any charges or taken specific steps
 to bring those in detention to trial.
 There were also widespread arrests and lengthy extrajudicial
 detentions by the police in Rosso. Mamadou Fassa was taken
 into custody in early June and held for several weeks before
 being released. The Imam of the mosque of Medina Trois in
 Rosso was similarly held incommunicado for an extended period
 before being expelled to Senegal in July. Three Halpulaar
 were detained by Rosso police in mid-May and expelled to
 Senegal in mid-June. The police in Rosso released a number of
 political detainees--perhaps as many as 40--unconditionally in
 early September.
 
 
 235
 MAURITANIA
 There were multiple reports of arrests, intimidation,
 prolonged detention, and expulsion committed by security
 forces in several other river communities, including Boghe,
 Kaedi, Djeol, and Maghama. There were also several reports of
 a secret off-limits detention camp in a remote area some 20
 kilometers south of Aleg, in which suspected dissidents were
 held without trial for extended periods of time. The
 Government reportedly closed this camp and released all its
 detainees in early September.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three legal systems in Mauritania: the Shari'a, the
 special courts, and the State Security Court. While the
 judiciary is nominally independent, many observers believe
 that judges take their cue from the Government when sentencing
 opponents of the regime. The legal system functions primarily
 under the Shari'a (Islamic law) put in place during the
 Haidalla regime. The Ministry of Justice administers the
 Shari'a and selects judicial personnel. The Taya
 administration has halted the use by Islamic judges of extreme
 physical punishments, such as amputations, and is also slowly
 eliminating a number of unqualified Shari'a judges who were
 appointed during the Haidalla years. Judges now cannot be
 tenured before they have completed 7 years of service.
 Commercial and banking offenses, traffic violations that cause
 bodily harm, and offenses against the security of the State
 fall under the jurisdiction of the special courts, which
 render judgments on the basis of laws modeled after French
 law. While trials in the ordinary courts are public, the
 State Security Court, which tries offenses against state
 security, may conduct secret trials.
 All defendants, regardless of the court, have the legal right
 to be present with legal counsel during the proceedings. If
 necessary, the accused is provided counsel at public expense.
 Defendants may confront witnesses and present evidence. They
 may appeal the sentences of the ordinary courts but not those
 of the State Security Court.
 The right to a fair public trial continued to be severely
 abused. Severe reprisals by government security forces were
 carried out in southern Mauritania during the first 6 months
 of 1990 without any recourse to judicial proceedings.
 Security forces imposed extreme punishments on their own
 accord, without any legal authorization or restriction.
 Despite the Government's categorical denial that extrajudicial
 expulsions had resumed, during the first 6 months of the year
 as many as 3,000 non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks were expelled
 extrajudicially or fled out of fear of arbitrary action by the
 security forces or armed Maurs. Mauritanian law specifies
 that all persons, including foreigners, have the right to
 their property and possessions, and can be deprived of them
 only by a court decision. Nonetheless, in many instances
 security forces randomly apprehended people, took them to
 border crossings, and sent them across to Senegal without any
 official processing. Even those carrying appropriate
 Mauritanian identification were expelled; many were stripped
 of their belongings and documentation, and many were forced
 across the river at gunpoint. Those who fled or were expelled
 were primarily non-Hassaniya-speaking Mauritanians,
 particularly Halpulaars, and, to a much lesser degree, other
 black African ethnic groups.
 
 
 236
 MAURITANIA
 In at least two instances, entire villages crossed the river
 into Senegal. In May the villages of Gourel Mamodou and
 Mbone, each with roughly 400 residents, moved to Senegal.
 Their flight was prompted by disappearances, especially of
 young women and children, and by summary executions by
 authorities. Several thousand non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks
 reportedly fled to Mali during the year for similar reasons.
 The Government contended that many, if not all of the persons
 who fled or were expelled, were in fact Senagalese nationals,
 and that their Mauritanian identity documents were fradulent.
 By the end of the year, the Government had failed to set up
 procedures to permit access to the courts by expellees who
 wished to obtain confirmation of their citizenship and the
 right to return home. A small number of people were allowed
 to return, beginning in September apparently as a result of
 informal arrangements with security forces and the personal
 intervention of government officials. In addition, the UNHCR
 was given authorization in October to begin quietly
 repatriating Mauritanians from Senegal in order to reunite
 them with their families in Mauritania. This operation
 resulted in the repatriation of perhaps 100 to 200
 Mauritanians and, although intermittenly interrupted, was
 still continuing at year's end. The number of cross-border
 raids by expelled Mauritanians reportedly decreased toward the
 end of 1990. There was a corresponding decline in reprisals
 by government security forces.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Mauritanian law, judicial warrants are required to'
 perform home searches. This requirement is often ignored in
 practice in "national security" cases. There were also
 continuing reports of government surveillance of suspected
 dissidents, as well as intimidation and harassment of
 Pular-speaking black Mauritanians in the Senegal River Valley.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press:
 There are no legal guarantees of freedom of speech and press
 and both are severely restricted in practice. Mauritanians
 criticize government policies only in conversations with
 friends and relatives. Military personnel are under tight
 surveillance, and views expressed to military colleagues in
 private that could be construed as even mildly critical of the
 Government are likely to cause intense interrogation by
 military security officers. The Government reacts quickly to
 any public comments it thinks pose a threat to the security of
 the State, particularly, any expression of ethnic
 dissatisfaction, or criticism of the Government's ethnic
 policies.
 The Government owns and operates Mauritania's only daily
 newspaper and the radio and television stations. During the
 past 3 years the Government allowed limited criticism of its
 policies, within the context of interviews with government
 officials. In early 1988, the Government authorized the
 publication of two privately owned monthly magazines,
 Mauritanie Demain and L'Evenement. These publications
 periodically carried articles on mildly controversial social
 issues but refrained from any direct criticism of the
 Government. Both practiced self-censorship and, in part due
 
 
 MAURITANIA
 to financial constraints, reach a very limited audience. In
 February the Government disbanded a student law club at the
 University of Nouakchott and questioned its members after a
 heated and frank discussion of Government ethnic and human
 rights policies occurred at a meeting sponsored by the club.
 Some members of the panel, prominent attorneys and academics,
 were also called to discuss the incident with the Minister of
 the Interior.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although Mauritanian law guarantees the rights of assembly and
 association, since the 1978 coup the Government has banned all
 political movements and prohibited meetings of a political
 nature. All groups must be registered with the Minister of
 Interior. The Government does occasionally permit
 demonstrations by groups for purposes of which it approves,
 e.g., in August in Nouakchott it allowed a small demonstration
 of popular support for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania. Virtually all
 citizens are Muslim. Mauritanian Muslims are prohibited from
 entering non-Islamic houses of worship and from converting to
 another religion. Proselytizing by non-Muslims and the
 construction of Christian churches and other non-Islamic
 houses of worship are prohibited. The Roman Catholic
 community in Mauritania has five churches, which operate
 freely as long as they restrict their services to resident
 foreigners.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Traditionally, there have been few restrictions on movement
 within Mauritania, where nomadism has long been a way of
 life. Local authorities imposed and enforced at their own
 initiative dusk-to-dawn curfews in some villages along the
 Senegal river boundary.
 Since 1985 Mauritanians no longer need exit visas to travel
 abroad, although there were recurrent reports of some persons
 being denied passports for unexplained, and possibly
 political, reasons. The price of a new passport jumped to
 about $125 in 1990, effectively rendering a passport
 unaffordable for most Mauritanian citizens.
 As many as 105,000 displaced persons arrived in Mauritania
 from Senegal during April and May 1989. As many as an
 additional 15,000 refugees from Mali fleeing Halpulaar-related
 ethnic violence entered Mauritania during the early months of
 1990. Despite limited resources, the Mauritanian Government
 continued to assist all refugees from both Senegal and Mali.
 The Government also permitted the UNHCR and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to establish temporary
 offices in Nouakchott to provide aid to displaced persons.
 One ICRC delegate remained at-the beginning of 1990 to wind
 down the ICRC operation. The ICRC office in Nouakchott was
 subsequently closed. Mauritania continues to be covered by
 the ICRC Regional Delegation in Tunisia for periodic visits to
 prisons. There were no reports of the forceable return of
 refugees to Senegal or to Mali.
 As a result of the ongoing conflict in neighboring Western
 Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, a small number
 
 
 238
 MAURITANIA
 of refugees from the Western Sahara have settled in Nouadhibou
 and-other northern towns and have been successfully absorbed
 into Mauritanian society.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of-Mauritania do not have the means to change their
 government through democratic means. All political power
 rests in the hands of the military regime. The Military
 Committee for National Salvation (CMSN) remains the "custodian
 of the nation's sovereignty," and all executive and
 legislative functions reside with the Committee. Membership
 is limited to military officers, who occupy ministerial
 positions or important military and security posts. The CMSN
 is comprised predominantly of Maurs. Non-Maur membership on
 the CMSN and in other senior civilian and military positions
 has decreased in the wake of ethnic tensions.
 The Government uses a quasi-political organization, the
 Structure for the Education of the Masses (SEM), to mobilize
 people to carry out local improvement projects, to relay
 policy initiatives, and to serve as a channel to discuss
 grievances. SEM's are found at all governmental levels down
 to villages and neighborhoods. In practice, most significant
 grievances, including violence, are discussed at the family,
 clan, or tribal level first and passed along to influential
 governmental figures of the same family or tribe.
 As political parties are prohibited, opposition groups operate
 clandestinely or from outside the country. An unknown number
 of people were arrested in 1989 on suspicion of membership in
 the African Liberation Forces of Mauritania. They were still
 detained without charge at the end of 1990. Other opposition
 groups include the Resistance for Unity, Independence, and
 Democracy in Mauritania, established in 1989, and the United
 Front for Armed Resistance in Mauritania. Each of these
 groups reportedly conducts armed raids into Mauritania.
 The Government had planned to hold complete nationwide
 municipal elections in January 1990, but these elections were
 postponed in the aftermath of the April 1989 disruptions.
 These elections, which allowed for popular expression on local
 issues and candidates, were held in December and appeared to
 be generally free of government interference. While there
 were some allegations of fraud, the major complaint among the
 populace concerned the administration of the elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Taya Government has been generally responsive
 to human rights concerns. It allowed a UNHRC representative
 to investigate allegations of slavery and permitted visits by
 Amnesty International (AI), the International Commission of
 Jurists, and the African Jurists Association. A
 representative from the London Anti-Slavery Society visited
 Mauritania in 1990 to investigate vestiges of slavery. In
 1990 both AI and Africa Watch published reports on human
 rights abuses in Mauritania.
 The Mauritanian Human Rights League, affiliated with the
 Paris-based International Federation of Human Rights and the
 Inter-African Union for Human Rights, is staffed by volunteers
 
 
 MAURITANIA
 who address concerns such as eradicating vestiges of slavery,
 ensuring the uniform application of Shari'a law, promoting the
 status of women, and preventing abuses such as arbitrary
 arrest, detention, and torture. In the wake of the ethnic
 disturbances of 1989, the League experienced serious setbacks
 in its efforts to remain a viable and independent
 organization. It issued a statement in July 1989 critical of
 government expulsions of black Mauritanians, but since then,
 under government pressure, it has not publicly commented on or
 questioned the Government's human rights excesses.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mauritania is situated geographically and culturally on the
 divide between traditionally nomadic Arabic (Hassaniya)-
 speaking Maurs of the north and the sedentary black
 cultivators of the African south. The interaction of these
 two groups produces the complex cultural diversity as well as
 the ethnic tensions in Mauritanian society. Historically, the
 Hassaniya-speaking white Maurs have dominated the political
 and economic system. Taken together, the Hassaniya-speaking
 black Maurs and Mauritania's non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks
 outnumber the white Maurs by a considerable majority. This
 racial majority is by no means cohesive, however, since black
 Maurs identify in many ways more closely with the white Maur
 population. Many non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians
 have long contended that since independence, white Maur
 domination in government, state enterprises, business, and
 religious institutions is a result of ethnic and linguistic
 discrimination. It has been a longstanding policy of the
 Government to promote Arabization and the use of Arabic as the
 country's principal language, although French is still widely
 used as well. Non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians
 charge that the Government's new land reform law is a means to
 allow white and black Maurs to encroach upon the fertile land
 in the Senegal River Valley that had been traditionally their
 preserve. Recent movements of nomads into the Senegal River
 Valley as a result of the decade-long drought in the north
 further exacerbated tensions.
 The longstanding ethnic tensions within Mauritanian society
 came dramatically to the fore in April 1989. The events of
 that period resulted more from an eruption of underlying
 ethnic tensions rather than officially sanctioned government
 policy on either side of the river. This was not true,
 however, for the expulsions of non-Hassaniya-speaking black
 Mauritanians that followed which-were largely orchestrated by
 Mauritanian security forces. The expulsions and effective
 deprivation of citizenship were based only on ethnicity, since
 only non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians were affected.
 The regular cross-border raids were carried out by
 non-Hassaniya-speaking ethnic groups, and Government security
 force reprisals were therefore directed solely against these
 groups.
 In the wake of expulsions, repatriations, and unsettled
 security conditions, some white and black Maurs were resettled
 into deserted, previously Halpulaar-inhabited villages in the
 Senegal River Valley. For example, some 2,700 inhabitants of
 Nouakchott refugee camps were resettled in deserted Halpulaar
 villages in the Trarza region in the early months of 1990.
 While many of those resettled were themselves refugees from
 Senegal, others had moved from northern Mauritania in search
 of richer farmlands and were resented by the Halpulaar
 residents.
 
 
 240
 MAURITANIA
 Women have legal rights to property, divorce, and child
 custody. Although there is a somewhat lower percentage of
 women than men educated at the university level, there are no
 legal restrictions on education for women. Women do not wear
 the veil, may travel without restriction, and may own and
 manage their own businesses. The Government is encouraging
 the entry of women into the professions, government, and
 business, and a number of women have moved into senior or
 midlevel government positions in recent years. In late 1988,
 the Taya Government created a new Ministry of Women's Affairs,
 Arts, and Tourism, and appointed a woman as the first
 Minister. A female counselor in the presidency assumed
 responsibility for women's affairs following the death of this
 Minister.
 The Governmcnt has also been instrumental in opening up new
 opportunities for employment traditionally reserved for men,
 such as in hospital work. According to Mauritanian law, men
 and women must receive equal pay for equal work; Mauritania's
 two largest employers, the civil service and the state mining
 company SNIM, respect this law.
 Violence against women occurs, but no data exists to indicate
 its extent. The police and judiciary have been known to
 intervene in domestic disputes, but the Mauritanian media
 provides no coverage of this. The Government has taken no
 position nor issued any statements on violence against women
 or on female genital mutilation (circumcision) which is a
 traditional practice in some areas of southern Mauritania,
 where infibulation is practiced. This custom is seldom, if
 ever, practiced in the north, and some evidence indicates that
 the incidence of female circumcision is diminishing in the
 modern, urbanized sector.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to establish unions at the local and national
 level. There are currently 36 trade unions in the country.
 All, however, must be affiliates of the Union of Mauritanian
 Workers (UTM), by law the country's only central labor body.
 The trade unions and the UTM elect their leadership
 democratically and determine most of their programs and
 policies without government interference, provided these avoid
 political issues. The UTM is an active member of the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and represents
 Mauritanian workers in the International Labor Organization
 (ILO).
 Although Mauritanian law grants workers the right to strike,
 in practice strikes rarely occur, due to Government pressure.
 Under Mauritanian law, tripartite arbitration committees,
 composed of union, business, and government representatives,
 may impose binding arbitration that automatically terminates
 any strike. In October members of the bakers' union in
 Nouakchott staged a 1-day strike, and subsequently won some
 wage concessions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions are free to organize workers without government or
 employer interference. According to the UTM, close to 90
 percent of industrial and commercial workers in Mauritania are
 
 
 241
 MAURITANIA
 members of unions. The laws providing worker's protection
 against antiunion discrimination are regularly enforced.
 Collective bargaining, notably to set wages, occurs informally
 between individual unions, employers, the Government, and the
 UTM. In addition, employees or employers may bring labor
 disputes to three-person labor courts that are overseen
 jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor. Labor leaders
 regard these courts as unbiased and effective. There are no
 export processing zones in Mauritania, and labor- laws are
 applied uniformly throughout the country.
 In April 19R0, the Senegalese Confederation of Workers (CNTS)
 submitted a representation to the ILO, charging the Government
 of Mauritania with violating several ILO conventions. The
 CNTS detailed the Government's "deportation and banishment of
 its own black African citizens," and specified numerous
 sectors in which significant numbers of non-Hassaniya-speaking
 blacks were dismissed without cause and, in many cases,
 deprived of basic rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Slavery was officially abolished in Mauritania only in 1980,
 and many persons whose ancestors were slaves still occupied
 positions of servitude in 1990. This was due in part to the
 economic hardships they would have encountered if they had
 left. However, in some areas persons were sometimes held
 against their will and forced to perform unpaid labor. Africa
 Watch claims that slavery persists and charges that the
 Government has taken no significant practical steps to
 eradicate the practice. Several reports indicated that some
 instances of forced labor involved young children.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Education is not compulsory in Mauritania, but Mauritanian law
 specifies that no child may be employed before the age of 13
 in the agricultural sector without the permission of the
 Minister of Labor, nor before the age of 15 in the
 nonagricultural sector. The law provides that employed
 children aged 14 to 16 should receive 70 percent of the
 minimum wage, and those from 17 to 18 should receive 90
 percent of the minimum wage. There is limited enforcement of
 child labor laws by the few inspectors in the Ministry of
 Labor. In practice, much younger children in the countryside
 pursue herding, cultivation, and other significant labor in
 support of their families' traditional activities. In
 accordance with longstanding tradition, some children served
 apprenticeships in small industries, but overall, child labor
 in the nonagricultural sector does not appear to be widespread.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In 1990 the guaranteed minimum wage for adults was equivalent
 to roughly $75 per month. These wages barely enabled the
 average family to meet its minimum needs. The standard, legal
 nonagricultural workweek in Mauritania cannot exceed either 40
 hours or 6 days without overtime compensation, which is paid
 at rates that are graduated according to the number of
 supplemental hours worked. Reliable data on actual wage
 levels is scarce. Enforcement of the labor laws is the
 responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of
 Labor but in practice is limited by the shortage of qualified
 personnel.
