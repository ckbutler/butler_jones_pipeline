 ARGENTINA
 In 1983 there was a dramatic improvement in human rights as
 Argentina successfully made the transition from a military
 Government to an elected civilian Government. There was also a
 continuous expansion of free and democratic political activity.
 Political debate was free and open, and all parties had full
 access to the media. There was a high level of public
 participation in the primaries, the campaign, and the October
 30 elections. Dr. Raul Alfonsin of the Radical Civic Union was
 elected President on October 30 with 52 percent of the vote and
 was inaugurated on December 10. Over 14,000 national,
 provincial, and local officials were also chosen.
 During 1983 there was also considerable progress toward respect
 for civil rights. Press restrictions were significantly relaxed
 and controls on the electronic media, largely government-owned,
 were less restrictive than at any time since the 1976 military
 .coup. The judicial branch displayed increasing independence
 from the executive. For example, even prior to the transition
 to a civilian elected government the courts invalidated an
 executive decree and ordered arrests of a number of former
 military officers. Trade union freedom was greater than at any
 time in the recent past. Strikes occurred, including two
 national strikes, although they were technically illegal.
 There were also major improvements in respect for individual
 rights during the year. The state of siege provision, which
 had permitted the curtailment of many civil and political
 freedoms since 1976, was lifted in October and the remaining
 prisoners held without trial under the state of siege were
 released during 1983 or remanded to civilian courts. In his
 inaugural address on December 10, President Alfonsin called for
 "the dismantling of the state's repressive machinery."
 The main areas of continuing human rights concerns were
 associated with the terrorist and anti terrorist activities of
 previous years. For example, early in 1983 a federal judge and
 an editor left the country, claiming that their lives had been
 threatened because they had been investigating possible crimes
 committed by security forces. Three men who had been involved
 in the terrorism of the 1970s were killed, reportedly in gun
 fights with the police, although there were witnesses in two of
 the cases who stated they had been abducted, allegedly by
 security forces. The few cases where magazines or electronic
 media were censored were related to attempts to discuss the
 issue of the "disappeared" in a way that tended to discredit
 the armed forces.
 For the third year in a row, there were no confirmed permanent
 disappearances in 1983. Human rights groups continued to
 demand a complete accounting for past disappearances and
 punishment for those responsible. The military Government
 published its "final report" on April 28, which said that all
 so-called "disappeared" persons were dead, in hiding, or living
 in exile. It subsequently promulgated a law granting an
 amnesty to those who had committed crimes in connection with
 the so called "dirty war," against terrorism and a strict new
 anti-terrorism law. On December 27, President Alfonsin signed
 into law legislation approved earlier by both houses of
 congress repealing the amnesty law. In addition, President
 Alfonsin decreed in December the creation of a 16-member
 National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to help
 clarify the fate of people who disappeared. Alfonsin also
 (447)
 
 
 448
 ordered the Armed Forces Supreme Council to try all nine
 leaders of the military governments during the period 1976-1982
 for "homicide, illegal imprisonment, and torture of prisoners"
 and ordered that legal action be taken against seven terrorist
 leaders for their crimes during that same period.
 Argentina was beset by a number of severe economic problems in
 1983. The military Government altered its earlier economic
 policies by reducing its reliance on the free market in an
 attempt to deal with an annual rate of inflation of approxi-
 mately 400 percent and a large short-term foreign debt.
 Nevertheless, Argentina's population of 29.6 million had a per
 capita Gross National Product of over $4,000. Real wages
 increased by over 20 percent in 1983.
 In summary, Argentina made dramatic progress in human rights in
 1983. In little more than a year, the country went from a
 military government to a functioning democracy, complete with
 an independent judiciary, a free press, and a strong opposition.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Xhe increasing activity and independence of the courts and the
 active role of the press increased the constitutionally
 guaranteed protection of life and other rights in 1983.
 Nevertheless, between December 1982 and December 1983 there
 were at least four deaths that human rights groups claimed were
 politically motivated. In December 1982 a demonstrator was
 killed during an anti-Government rally in Buenos Aires.
 Although there was an investigation, no one was indicted.
 Three other persons died in two separate incidents in April and
 May in what the Government claimed were gun battles with the
 police. All three deaths were investigated by the courts.
 Three policemen were detained for five months in connection
 with one of the cases but were released in Octoberfor lack of
 sufficient evidence. There are allegations that individual
 members of the police or military were responsible for the
 deaths, and that the victims were killed because they had been
 Montonero terrorist leaders.
 b. Disappearance
 No one disappeared permanently in Argentina in 1983 for the
 third consecutive year, but some persons were abducted. They
 were eventually released within at most a few days but some
 reported that they had been interrogated and beaten. Although
 the Government disclaimed responsibility for the abductions and
 denounced them, it was widely believed that they had been the
 work of individuals with links to the police or military who
 were operating outside the control of the Government. The
 courts continued investigating such cases.
 Some persons.who disappeared temporarily were believed to have
 been abducted by their labor union or political enemies. In
 other cases, individuals who disappeared actually left
 Argentina for personal reasons, without informing their
 families or friends, later reappearing abroad. Among them was
 Ruben Alvarez, the Intransigent. Party candidate for provincial
 
 
 449
 deputy in Salta Province who subsequently appeared alive and ï¿½
 well in Sao Paulo, Brazil. His "disappearance" provoked large
 demonstrations and protests from leaders of the major political
 parties.
 Accounting for the large number of persons who disappeared
 between 1973 and 1980 continued to be a major issue in 1983.
 Considerable disagreement remains as to how many persons
 disappeared. The most carefully documented list, compiled by
 the Argentine Permanent Assembly for Human Rights in 1979,
 contains approximately 6,000 names, but other estimates are
 much higher. Human rights groups are using a computer to
 reconcile the information and prepare an updated list. The
 military Government on April 28 issued a "final report" which
 said that all "disappeared" persons should be presumed to be
 dead, in hiding, or living in exile.
 President Alfonsin on December 15 decreed the creation of a
 16-member National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons
 to help to clarify what happened to the people who disappeared.
 The decree invited each house of Congress to appoint three
 representatives to the commission. The 10 other members,
 appointed by the President, are well-known supporters of human
 rights. The Commission's tasks will include receiving charges
 and evidence concerning cases of people who disappeared, which
 the Commission will submit to the courts; investigating the
 whereabouts of missing persons; establishing the whereabouts of
 missing children; and denouncing in the courts any attempts to
 conceal, steal, or destroy evidence related to disappearances.
 The Commission is to produce a final report within 180 days.
 The Commission will have authority to request written
 information from any government, armed forces, or security
 personnel source, who will be obligated to provide reports,
 data, and documents.
 The military Government said that it had provided some
 information to family members in approximately 20 percent of
 the cases of persons whose disappearances were reported to it
 between 1974 and 1982. A human rights organization, however,
 commissioned a study in 1983 of 1,100 families of persons who
 had disappeared. Only 18 of the 607 families that responded to
 the questionnaires had received any information, and only two
 of them had been able to recover the remains of their relatives.
 None of the 18 families had been officially notified; they had
 obtained the information either unofficially or through the
 press. The Interior Ministry has explained the differences in
 figures by noting that, of those persons reported as
 disappeared to the Ministry, it had replied to 1,434 that the
 persons sought were in prison, in exile, or had returned home.
 The Ministry maintains that few of these basically closed cases
 were likely to be among the active group sampled by the human
 rights organization.
 Courts continued to investigate cases of unmarked graves, and
 some exhumed corpses were identified as individuals who had
 disappeared. In November, the military Government announced
 that it would compensate private citizens for damages caused in
 connection with crimes committed by subversives or terrorists
 or by security personnel fighting them. The Chamber of
 Deputies voted to repeal the amnesty law on December 16, and
 the Senate subsequently followed suit. President Alfonsin
 signed the legislation repealing the law December 27.
 
 
 450
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture. Nevertheless,
 some allegations were made of torture by police officials and
 prison guards in 1983. The most prevalent form of torture
 reported was beating, but the use of electric shock was also
 alleged.
 During 1983 the courts increased their efforts to curb the use
 of torture. One court both removed a judge from office and
 barred her from holding any office after finding her guilty in
 July of professional neglect, including failure to investigate
 complaints of torture. In March, 10 prison officials and
 guards of the Posadas Province Penitentiary Service, including
 the prison director, were sentenced to serve from 2 to 18 years
 in the prison where they had tortured an inmate to death in
 1979. In addition, there were court investigations of charges
 of torture by the Tucuman Provincial police and by prison
 guards in the Salta Province Penitentiary, with preventive
 detentions of nine Tucuman police and 20 Salta prison guards
 while the investigations were conducted. In December,
 President Alfonsin submitted a legislative proposal to Congress
 to make torture a crime liable to the same punishment as
 murder, i.e., life imprisonment.
 Throughout 1983 reforms initiated in 1980 were implemented
 which were designed to improve prison conditions for people
 detained on security grounds. All detainees who had not
 already been tried or were not in trial status were released
 during the year. Human rights organizations continued to
 maintain, however, that political detainees were consistently
 treated more harshly than other inmates. They said that
 stricter vigilance, fewer facilities for exercise and rest, and
 inadequate medical care reportedly led to greater psychological
 and physical strains on the political detainees than on common
 prisoners. These charges were supported by statements made to
 the press by detainees released in October, although most of
 them referred to conditions in earlier years.
 Bad prison conditions became more of a public issue in 1983,
 partly because the progress toward democracy allowed more
 criticism and partly because of protests, hunger strikes, and
 riots in some of the prisons. In February, about 300 inmates
 of the Salta Province Penitentiary protested against ill
 treatment and demanded that a judge investigate their claims.
 They repeated accusations of irregularities made by a social
 worker in November 1982 which had not led to an investication.
 The Salta Lawyers Association called for an investigation, and
 the penitentiary director resigned.
 Inmates in several prisons went on hunger strikes to protest
 poor food and medical treatment, lack of warm clothing, and
 excessively crowded conditions. Subsequently, at least two
 federal judges inspected some of the prisons where hunger
 strikes had occurred. In April, a Government communique
 rejected most of the charges that had been made public about
 the bad conditions in Caseros Prison in Buenos Aires. The
 communique said that for 1,317 prisoners there were 26 doctors
 in the prison hospital, which had modern and complete medical
 equipment, while the kitchen was the newest of the Argentine
 prison system.
 
 
 Riots broke out in three penitentiaries in November as inmates
 demanded a reduction in their sentences, faster processing of
 their cases in the courts, and general improvement in prison
 conditions. In the wake of the September promulgation of the
 amnesty law for subversives, common criminals evidently
 determined that they too should be freed or have their
 sentences reduced. At least three prisoners died, many others
 were wounded, and about 30 guards were injured when the prison
 guards and police stormed Olmos Prison to free hostages and
 restore order. President Alfonsin's December package of
 legislative proposals to Congress included suggestions for
 prison reform, for speeding up court procedures, and for
 reforming both the criminal and military codes of justice
 (e.g., restricting bail and the application of the most lenient
 law, allowing habeas corpus in cases of civilians tried by
 military courts, and allowing the right of appeal and
 civilian-type procedures for the defense in court martials).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Argentine penal code gives the police and courts authority
 to detain persons incommunicado for up to eight days. Even in
 the case of minor offenses, holding of suspects incommunicado
 for a few days is common. The Constitution also confers power
 on the executive branch to detain persons indefinitely under a
 state of siege, which was invoked in 1974 and not lifted until
 October 29, 1983.
 From 1974 to 1982, over 8,700 persons suspected of terrorism or
 subversion were detained under stage of siege powers, according
 to the Ministry of the Interior. During 1983, the remaining
 political prisoners being held without trial under state of
 siege powers were released. Those in the trial process or
 sentenced by a court continued to be held under civil laws.
 The Ministry of the Interior also said that another 291
 individuals, described by the Ministry as "subversives," were
 serving sentences at the end of November after having been
 tried under ordinary civilian or military penal codes rather
 than state of siege powers. Some courts began ordering the
 release of a few such prisoners under the amnesty law prior to
 its repeal. Under the Alfonsin Government the courts began
 ordering the release of civilians convicted by military courts,
 finding that such trials were illegal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The civilian judiciary displayed more independence in 1983.
 For example, federal judge Oscar Salvi ordered the arrest of
 retired Navy Commander-in-Chief and former Junta Member Admiral
 Emilio Massera in June for allegedly covering up a crime.-.
 Massera, an announced presidential candidate, was held without
 bail but was brought into court several times. Judge Salvi,
 who handled a number of sensitive cases, received death threats
 but obtained police bodyguards and continued working. His
 predecessor fled the country in January 1983 after receiving
 death threats. Other judges were also threatened during the
 year. Although some judges declared themselves not competent
 in certain cases, most continued serving and investigating such
 matters as the activities of the Argentine Anti-Communist
 Alliance, -a right-wing terrorist organization. The court
 investigation of the Alliance resulted in the arrest and
 indictment in November of the former Chief of State
 Intelligence, General Otto Paladino, and several other suspects
 for "illicit association" with the Alliance.
 
 
 452
 All rulings by lower courts, civilian and military, may be
 appealed to the Supreme Court, which in 1983 was more disposed
 to accept such appeals. In March, for example, the Supreme
 Court declared invalid a 1976 government decree under which a
 former senator had been arrested for ties to subversive
 elements and held as a political prisoner before being allowed
 to go into exile in 1977. The Supreme Court's decision allowed
 the senator to return to Argentina, which he did in June.
 The Supreme Court became more active in responding to requests
 for writs of habeas corpus on behalf of individuals held on
 security grounds. Lower civilian courts also stepped up their
 consideration of habeas corpus petitions for persons detained
 under the state of siege powers. A federal court decision in
 August 1982 that "citizens can no longer be deprived of their
 freedom for secret reasons" appeared increasingly to influence
 lower court rulings in 1983.
 Human rights organizations were, nevertheless, disappointed
 with some of the rulings of the Supreme Court. The Court, for
 instance, decided in June not to try to determine responsi-
 bility for the deaths of unidentified persons buried in a
 Buenos Aires cemetery who were believed to have been killed by
 government security forces during the war against subversion in
 previous years. Instead, the Court limited its investigation
 to the morgue procedures for autopsies and burials and
 concluded that the morgue personnel had "followed the regular
 procedures used throughout the years."
 The Buenos Aires Bar Association also issued a statement in
 August criticizing government magistrates as "de facto judges
 who have subordinated the national Constitution to the stan-
 dards and objectives of the national reorganization process,"
 i.e., to the program of the Government after the 1976 coup.
 A new antiterrorism law promulgated by the military Government
 in September authorized search and seizure by police to prevent
 and punish subversion, although judges had to be kept
 informed. Both this law and the amnesty law, which was
 subsequently repealed by the civilian government, were
 immediately challenged in the courts by human rights groups and
 others. Many politicians also denounced the laws and promised
 to either annul them or change them in the Congress.
 Persons accused of subversion or terrorism may be tried in
 either civilian or military courts, although there were
 apparently no military trials of civilians in 1983. The
 Argentine civilian penal code provides for open trials, but
 defendants can be denied access to evidence against them.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The stringent antiterrorist law decreed on September 27 allows
 police to search the homes of suspected terrorists or
 accomplices with no other limitation than the obligation to
 inform a judge within 24 hours of the action; to detain
 suspects for up to 48 hours, without informing anybody except a
 judge, and for up to 15 days with the judge's permission; to
 tap telephones; and to open mail with the written permission of
 a police chief. (A judge must be notified of such activities
 within 48 hours of their occurrence.) Politicians from nearly
 every major party criticized the antiterrorist law, however,
 
 
 453
 and its repeal or modification will likely be considered by the
 new Congress. One of President Alfonsin's December legislative
 proposals to Congress was for 'an antiterrorist program that
 would combine effective prevention with basic legal rights,
 including the right to quick oral hearings in pubic.
 There were also reports that, even before the anti-
 terrorist law was enacted, the military authorities engaged in
 both wiretapping and letter opening against small subversive
 groups. However, when four policemen broke into a private home
 in Cordoba Province without a warrant, they were tried,
 convicted, fired, and barred from holding any public office or
 public job.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The trend in 1983 was continuous liberalization, which is
 expected to continue under the democratic government. As the
 political competition leading to the elections intensified,
 government restraints on the media loosened considerably.
 Criticism of the military appeared regularly in the media, with
 human rights developments, and particularly the disappeared
 issue, receiving prominent treatment. Political figures highly
 critical of +he Government appeared regularly on the electronic
 media. There was also extensive television coverage of
 antigovernment general strikes in March and October. All
 political parties had access to the media to present their
 views for months leading up to the October 30 elections.
 Since retired military officers live under rules similar to
 those of the active duty forces, they must obtain prior
 clearance from their services before making public statements.
 Several officers who did not do so were punished for statements
 made to the press. Former President and retired General
 Leopoldo Galtieri was put in a military minimum-security prison
 for 45 days because of statements he made about some of his
 former peers and subordinates and their conduct of the
 Falkland/Malvinas Islands war of 1982.
 Even before the state of siege which permitted limitations on
 the press was lifted in October 1983, the liberalization was
 such that even human rights leaders were allowed to appear on
 radio and television.
 The Government issued periodic statements to radio and
 television stations on subjects it considered sensitive, such
 as human rights groups, journalistic commentary on human
 rights, and especially the "dirty war" against terrorism of the
 1970's. Print and news media also received such warnings in
 1983 but nevertheless provided extensive coverage of many of
 those sensitive issues. The Government banned and confiscated
 three issues of three different magazines containing articles
 about the "dirty war" that tended to discredit the armed
 forces. The Military Government also ordered the arrest of the
 editor of one of those magazines. Instead, he went into exile
 in Venezuela in March and returned to Argentina in October
 after the arrest order was rescinded.
 There was almost no censorship of Argentine and foreign
 literary and artistic works in 1983. The Spanish magazine
 Cambio 16, which had been banned by the Argentine Government,
 
 
 454
 was allowed to return uncensored. Censorship of foreign films
 for political and moral content was routine, but censors showed
 increasing leniency. Argentine films and dramas also dealt
 with sensitive political issues.
 Some restrictions on academic freedom continued in 1983. At
 the university level, there was an officially promulgated list
 of activities, topics, and texts that were banned from
 classrooms in some university departments, and policemen
 wearing civilian clothes attended some classes. Controversy
 was also sparked by the selection criteria imposed by the
 Government for the appointment of university professors.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Since August 1982, all groups and parties, except subversive
 organizations outlawed for espousing violence, have been free
 to organize and assemble. Major rallies were held by political
 parties, including the Communist Party, during the national
 electoral campaign.
 The labor movement once again became a major force in Argentine
 society. Approximately one-third of the work force are
 dues-paying members of the trade unions. During 1983, the
 Government restored the right to strike and permitted unions to
 organize, assemble, petition, and demonstrate. Following the
 1976 coup, many union officials had been replaced by military
 officers. These officers were removed in 1983, and once again
 nearly all unions were controlled by labor leaders without
 government interference. Either elections of new officers were
 held or they were delayed because the unions themselves
 declared that they were not ready for them. The Government
 yielded to the workers' demand for a single General Labor
 Confederation (CGT) and prepared to restore its financial
 assets which the Government had sequestered in 1976. One of
 President Alfonsin's legislative proposals to Congress in
 December called for the reorganization of trade unions and for
 general elections in all unions as soon as possible under the
 control of electoral courts.
 While collective bargaining was still officially suspended in
 1983, informal collective bargaining was again practiced in
 most industries. The Government often acted as a mediator or
 arbitrator.
 Labor agitation increased markedly in 1983 as workers attempted
 to raise real wages which had been depressed by recession
 during 1982 and earlier. The Government responded to union
 demands with tolerance and significant wage concessions. There
 was no attempt to restrict legal and peaceful strikes.
 Many unions maintained close ties to international labor bodies
 such as the International Labor Organization (ILO) and partici-
 pated in international conferences. In November, the governing
 body of the ILO expressed satisfaction to the Argentine
 Government about major improvements in trade union freedoms and
 dropped the outstanding complaints against Argentina for
 restrictions on freedom of association.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Argentina's Constitution states that all residents have the
 right freely to practice their religion. Recent governments
 
 
 455
 have publicly and vigorously condemned religious prejudice and
 all other forms of discrimination. By constitutional require-
 ment, however, the President and Vice President of Argentina
 must be members of the Catholic Church, to which an estimated
 90 percent of Argentines belong.
 Other religions must register with the Government to obtain the
 legal recognition required to operate freely in Argentina.
 Jehovah's Witnesses are the 6nly religious group whose petition
 for recognition, filed in 1981, has not been granted. Even so,
 Argentina's 46,000 Witnesses have been permitted to assemble
 without permits or police interference. Problems they pre-
 viously experienced with the authorities and in public schools
 eased considerably in 1983. But about 300 Witnesses, all
 Argentine nationals, are under arrest for refusal to accept
 compulsory military service. The usual penalty is three to
 four years of civilian service at various military installa-
 tions around the country. Conditions are not onerous, and they
 are given furloughs for as much as a month at a time.
 Argentina's Jewish community of 300,000 to 400,000 practices
 its religion without restraint, although occasional
 anti-semitic incidents occur. There is no evidence of an
 official policy of anti-Semitism. Since the-political opening,
 Jewish leaders have established ties with the principal
 parties, hosting several fora with national candidates during
 the electoral campaign. In May the first major act of violence
 against the Jewish community in three years occurred when the
 front of a Jewish restaurant in Buenos Aires was fired upon
 while about 30 people were dining. In October there were two
 more such incidents. No casualties resulted from these
 attacks. In the pre-electoral period there was also an
 increase in anti-Semitic graffiti and publications, in
 anonymous threats against Jewish leaders and schools, and in
 the defacement and vandalization of synagogues. There was also
 one well-publicized incident in which Jewish school children
 were verbally harassed by a school cleaning woman. The
 Government investigated the incident and the cleaning woman was
 disciplined.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel and emigration are basically
 unrestricted. Paroled political prisoners were usually
 restricted by judges to their municipality of residence for six
 to nine months, permission to travel had to be received from
 the police to whom the parolees had to report periodically. No
 prisoners held under the state of siege provisions left
 Argentina in 1983, partly because, according to the Ministry of
 the Interior, no countries issued visas to the few prisoners
 whose requests were approved by the Government and also because
 no prisoners were still held under the state of siege
 provisions by the end of the year.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Argentina was ruled from March 1976 to December 1983 by the
 military. During most of the time the Commanders-in-Chief of
 the Army, Navy, and Air Force operated as a junta, selecting a
 military officer, usually retired, to serve as president. The
 Bignone Government, appointed in June 1982, committed itself
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 30
 
 
 456
 soon after to holding elections and to restoring constitutional
 civilian government by March 1984. In October 1983 a
 president, vice president and two senators and 254 deputies in
 the bicameral Congress, plus provincial governors, legislators,
 mayors, and municipal councils were all popularly elected. The
 other 44 national senators were elected by provincial legis-
 latures in November.
 Thirteen political parties covering the political spectrum,
 including the Communist Party, qualified as national parties
 and presented candidates. Other parties qualified in
 individual provinces. Party organizing, primaries, conven-
 tions, and election campaigns were conducted openly and
 freely. The public demonstrated its interest as up to one
 million people attended campaign rallies, and there was a surge
 in sales of books on democracy, the Constitution, and the
 political ideas of the candidates. Radio and television news
 programs covered the campaign extensively, and equal free time
 on public radio and television was granted to the participating
 political parties. Party organizers also distributed campaign
 literature freely. The elections for about 14,000 officials at
 about 70,000 voting places were conducted fairly, with few
 accusations of fraud. Foreign human rights organizations,
 which sent a group to Argentina to observe the elections,
 praised them as being fair, open, and honest. The Radical
 Party won a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, with 129 seats
 out of 254; the Justicialista (Peronist) Party has ill seats.
 In the Senate, the Peronists have 21 seats out of 46t the
 Radicals 18. Minor parties occupy the other seats in both
 houses. There will be elections for half the National Deputies
 in 1985.
 Women participate freely in politics in Argentina, which had a
 female head of government, Maria Estela Martinez de Peron, from
 1974 to 1976. There were scores of women candidates for the
 National Congress (ten won -- three senators and seven
 deputies), several women candidates for Governor (none won),
 vice governor of provinces (one won), and three women
 candidates for Vice President (none won).
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Argentina cooperates with both the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC) and the Organization of American States
 (OAS) Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC), even
 though Argentina has not signed the Agreement of San Jose de
 Costa Rica, which gives the IAHRC the right to investigate in
 any signatory country. The newly elected civilian president
 announced in his party's campaign platform that Argentina would
 ratify international agreements on human rights, including
 those which recognize the competence of international organi-
 zations that receive and study requests from individuals who
 claim to be victims of human rights violations. As part of
 President Alfonsin's December legislative proposals to
 Congress, he called for the signature and ratification of the
 Agreement of San Jose, the United Nations Convention on Civil
 and Political Rights, and the United Nations Convention on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross continued to visit political
 prisoners during 1983.
 
 
 457
 There are eight private human rights organizations in Argentina:
 the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo; the Center for Legal and
 Social Studies; Families of the Disappeared/Detained for
 Political Reasons; the Argentine League for the Rights of Man;
 the Ecumenical Movement for Human Rights; the Peace and Justice
 Service for Latin America; and the Permanent Assembly for Human
 Rights.
 The Permanent Assembly was created in 1975 with Dr. Raul
 Alfonain, the new President, as one of the cofounders. With a
 membership drawn from all sectors of Argentine society, the
 Assembly collects and disseminates information and assists
 families of victims of the "dirty war."
 The group most widely known nationally and internationally is
 the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. The Mothers developed
 loosely at first as a group of people who in 1976 began
 gathering at Government House in the Plaza de Mayo to inquire
 into the fate of their family members who were detained or had
 disappeared. Their meetings have since been formalized in
 silent vigils every Thursday in the Plaza. Leaders of the
 group went to Europe in 1983 to solicit international support
 from foreign governments. The group also became more active
 politically in Argentina, seeking support from political
 parties during and after the electoral campaign.
 The Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS), founded in
 1978, is the newest human rights organization. As both a
 data-collecting and legal-assistance agency, it prepares court
 actions in cases of detentions and disappearances, promotes
 improvement in conditions for political prisoners, and
 maintains contact with foreign human rights organizations.
 Human rights organizations operated with increased effective-
 ness in 1983 despite harassment, surveillance, and at least one
 episode of physical-abuse. Some officers and members of the
 Mothers and Center also had graffiti sprayed on their homes.
 Other human rights activists reported receiving anonymous
 threatening telephone calls. With the general trend toward
 political liberalization, a number of prominent organizations
 and individuals began to take an interest in issues formerly
 espoused almost exclusively by human rights groups. Political
 parties, labor unions, professional organizations, and the
 hierarchy of the Catholic Church adopted some of the objectives
 pursued since the last decade by the Mothers, the Permanent
 Assembly for Human Rights, and similar organizations. Human
 rights groups also stepped up their activities and expanded
 their efforts in 1983. The Mothers' weekly vigils in the Plaza
 de Mayo were broadened into marches throughout Buenos Aires.
 Human rights groups also took an increasingly active role at
 political conventions and meetings. One well-known human
 rights leader, Augusto Conte, ran for Congress and won a seat
 as a Deputy, campaigning almost exclusively on human rights
 issues.
 Amnesty International's 1983 report, covering 1982, stated that
 its main concern in Argentina was the question of the
 disappeared, which remained unresolved despite persistent
 attempts by various human rights groups to determine their
 fate. It also mentioned seven cases of politically motivated
 abductions in 1982.

 The Freedom House report for November of 1983 classified
 Argentina as "partly free" before the establishment of the
 civilian government. A report by the Washington Office on
 Latin America stated that the challenges to democracy in
 Argentina were formidable but that the reformation of certain
 key institutions such as the army, secret police, and judiciary
 would be a major step in insuring the future stability of
 Argentine democracy.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL, SITUATION
 Notwithstanding a rate of inflation in 1983 of approximately
 400 percent, over two years of recession, and an 11 percent
 rate of unemployment and underemployment combined, Argentina's
 population of 29.6 million continued to enjoy a high standard
 of living. Per capita Gross National Product was $4,409 in
 1981. The population growth rate in 1983 was 1.6 percent,
 while life expectancy at birth was 70.4 years in 1980. The
 infant mortality rate was 35.6 per 1,000 live births in 1983,
 while 66 percent of the population had access to safe water in
 1975.
 Real wages increased by over 20 percent in 1983, despite
 inflation and the lengthy recession. The minimum wage, family
 allowances, retirement, and other fringe benefits were
 increased in 1983 generally by more than the rate of inflation..
 Outside of Buenos Aires and other major urban centers, women
 are often confined to a role defined by Argentine/Latin
 tradition. In urban areas, however, where educational and
 economic opportunities are superior to those in rural areas and
 society is more open to modern trends, women participate in
 most professions. Married women living in Argentina must have
 the permission of their husbands to travel abroad with their
 minor children if the husband is not accompanying them.
 In the largely middle-class society, 80 percent of the
 population lives in urban areas, and at least 65 percent own
 their homes. The average Argentine enjoys a healthy,
 high-protein diet which provided 124 percent of the daily
 caloric requirements in 1977. The adult literacy rate in 1970
 was 93 percent, and the adjusted primary school enrollment
 ratio was 110 percent in 1977. In the Province of Buenos
 Aires, where approximately one-third of the nation's population
 resides, 93.6 percent of the 12-year-old population was
 attending school at the time of the 1980 census, 1.7 percent
 had already graduated, and less than 1 percent had never
 attended.
