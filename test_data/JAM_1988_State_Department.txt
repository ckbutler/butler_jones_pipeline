 JAMAICA
 Jamaica, a member-of the British Commonwealth, is a
 constitutional parliamentary democracy. A Governor General,
 appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister,
 represents the Queen as head of state, while the elected Prime
 Minister, the leader of the majority party in Parliament, is
 the country's chief executive. The Parliament is comprised of
 an elected House of Representatives and a Senate appointed by
 the Governor General.
 Two major political parties have alternated in power since the
 first elections under universal suffrage in 1944. The Jamaica
 Labor Party (JLP) has held the majority in Parliament since
 1980. The maximum length of a parliament is 5 years, and the
 Constitution requires that a general election be held no more
 than 3 months after dissolution of parliament. The last
 election, held in December 1983, was boycotted by the People's
 National Party (PNP) because of a dispute with the JLP over
 timing. Consequently, the JLP won all 60 seats in the House
 of Representatives. The JLP has attempted to compensate for
 the absence of parliamentary opposition by appointing some
 independents to the Senate..
 The security'forces are directed by the Ministry of National
 Security and consist of the Jamaica Constabulary Force
 (JCF-police), the Jamaica Special Constabulary Force (JSCF),
 and the Jamaica Defense Force (JDF). The JDF includes
 infantry units, an air wing, and a coast guard and has regular
 and reserve elements. Since 1974 the JDF has been authorized
 to conduct joint operations with the JCF to maintain peace and
 order under the Suppression of Crime Act.
 Jamaica has a mixed economy emphasizing the private sector and
 based on tourism, bauxite and alumina production, light
 manufacturing, and agriculture. The Seaga Government, which
 took office in 1980, implemented sweeping economic reforms and
 promoted private investment, both domestic and foreign, to
 stimulate economic growth and modernization.
 In 1988 human rights were generally respected in Jamaica, but
 domestic and international human rights advocates, as well as
 Jamaican officials, such as the parliamentary Ombudsman and,
 on occasion, the police commissioner, have criticized the
 police for excessive use of lethal force. This continues to
 be the country's most persistent human rights problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does not
 occur in Jamaica. However, some violent crime has political
 overtones. Both major parties, as well as the Communist
 Workers Party of Jamaica, have some supporters who occasionally
 resort to violence to prevent supporters of rival parties from
 engaging in legitimate political activities, such as voting,
 and to punish those believed to have harmed their party's
 interests. The legal system has often been ineffective in
 dealing with cases of presumed political killing because of a
 code of silence adhered to by suspects, victims, and witnesses
 alike. Intimidation of witnesses also complicates efforts to
 orosecute offenders.

 JAMAICA
 Violence aimed at disrupting the political process is
 heightened during elections. A government-appointed
 independent commission to investigate electoral irregularities
 recommended in 1986 that the JDF, rather than the police,
 patrol areas historically prone to political violence. The
 JDF is perceived by Jamaicans as best equipped to take
 effective action in such areas.
 As a further step, the two major political parties engaged in
 1988 in talks aimed at defusing tensions between the parties
 and between the JLP and PNP partisans. As a result of these
 talks, the two party leaders on August 26, in the presence of
 the Governor General, signed a "political code of conduct"
 intended to reduce election-related violence. An ombudsman
 was appointed to monitor compliance with the agreement and to
 report violations.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances perpetrated by the security forces. However,
 using their power to take persons into custody without an
 arrest warrant, granted under the Suppression of Crime Act,
 the JCF has on occassion held persons suspected of criminal
 activities incommunicado for short periods. In nearly all
 these cases, once relatives or associates of the detainee
 protested, the person was released.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Government does not sanction or condone the use of
 torture. Nonetheless, suspected criminals are often beaten or
 mistreated by police while being held in local stations. In
 1988 there were several reports of beatings by warders and
 security personnel of inmates held in government prisons. In
 past years, some persons have brought suit successfully
 against the police for unlawful actions, and the Government
 has been required to pay damages.
 The incidence of violent crime is high in Jamaica. Police
 actions, particularly instances of excessive use of lethal
 force in dealing with suspected criminals, have occasionally
 caused local protests. In 1988 large-scale searches for
 escaped criminals led to some complaints of brutality. The
 parliamentary Ombudsman and the Commissioner of the JCF have
 commented publicly on the need for qualitative improvement in
 police performance, particularly more selective recruitment
 and better training. According to police statistics, officers
 killed 100 persons in "gun confrontations," 35 in "other
 incidents," and 6 by accident in 1988 through the end of
 September. Five police officers were killed in the line of
 duty during the same period.
 Armed commercial guard forces, which have prolifcrated in
 recent years, have also been the subject of complaints. Guard
 forces often hire less qualified applicants than the police
 and provide less training. The Government is now drafting
 legislation requiring licensing and standardized training for
 commercial guard forces.
 Lynching of individuals suspected of theft, stealing livestock
 or crops, housebreaking, or rape occurs with some frequency in
 Jamaica. Such incidents are reported in the media, but
 prosecutions of vigilantes are rare.

 JAMAICA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Suppression of Crime Act, which has been regularly
 extended at 6-month intervals since its adoption in 1974,
 security forces do not need a warrant to detain persons
 "reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime. Although
 the Act was conceived as an extraordinary measure, security
 forces have come to rely on it extensively. Detention of
 suspects without a warrant occurs regularly, particularly in
 poor neighborhoods.
 Police must record detentions and are responsible for ensuring
 that detainees appear before a member of the judiciary within
 24 hours of detention. However, there have been instances of
 detainees being held for 2 weeks or longer without being
 brought before a judicial officer. Many detainees are unaware
 of their right to timely judicial review of the grounds for
 their detention. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights
 indicates that 90 percent of its caseload involves assisting
 people attempting to locate and gain the release of detained
 family members. The Council reports that supervisory police
 officers have been more cooperative in recent years in
 providing information about detained persons.
 For suspects charged with a crime, there is a functioning bail
 system. Bail is set by the local police supervisor in minor
 cases; a judicial officer sets bail for those charged with'
 more serious crimes. Persons unable to make bail while
 waiting for a judicial hearing are often detained for long
 periods. Outsiders are permitted access to the accused.
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons who have been charged with criminal offenses have
 access to legal representation, and legal counsel is provided
 to indigents in criminal cases. The Court of Appeal and the
 Parliament may refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom. The judicial system,
 though independent, is overburdened and operates with
 inadequate resources. Some cases take years to come to trial,
 and others have had to be dismissed because case files could
 not be located.
 In addition to the regular courts, a Gun Court was established
 in 1974 as an extraordinary measure for dealing with violent
 crime. The Gun Court considers all cases involving the
 illegal use or possession of firearms and ammunition. There
 are restrictions on public attendance, and less stringent
 rules of evidence are used. In capital cases, hearings before
 the Gun Court serve as preliminaries to jury trials under the
 jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The 1983 Gun Court
 Amendment Act eliminated several of the special exceptions to
 normal judicial rules and procedures which had previously
 applied to the Gun Court.
 According to the Jamaica Council for Human Rights, one of the
 weakest areas of Jamaican justice is the inability of the
 police to provide witnesses with proper protection.
 Intimidation, even murder, of witnesses is a chronic problem
 hampering criminal prosecutions, and jurors are sometimes
 threatened by associates of criminal defendants. The
 parliamentary Ombudsman reported instances in which similar
 
 
 626
 JAMAICA
 threats and intimidation are directed against witnesses and
 jurors in criminal cases where the accused is a policeman.
 Some convictions have been obtained for such attempts to
 subvert the judicial system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private life of the individual. Under the
 Suppression of Crime Act, however, search warrants are not
 required to enter homes or businesses believed to be occupied
 by persons "reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime,
 and this authority is sometimes abused by the police,
 especially in poor neighborhoods. Regulations approved by
 Parliament in 1980 require that every effort be made by
 security forces to have the owner or occupant of the premises
 present during any search.
 In September, in the wake of Hurricane Gilbert, the Government
 declared a 1-month public emergency in Kingston and two
 adjacent parishes which were hard hit by the storm and
 subsequent looting. The regulations required stores to reopen
 and allowed the Government to requisition needed goods and
 services, restrict movement, impose a curfew, and prohibit
 assemblies judged likely to endanger public safety. The state
 of emergency was lifted on October 13, but a curfew remained
 in some urban areas until December 1.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are provided for in the
 Constitution and are observed in practice within the broad
 limits of libel laws and the State Secrets Act. Jamaica's
 largest privately owned newspaper, the Daily Gleaner, has been
 critical of Jamaican governments through the years. A new
 national daily, the Record, appeared in 1988 and has followed
 this tradition. Several smaller newspapers and magazines are
 also published, and foreign publications are widely
 available. The government-owned Jamaica Broadcasting Company
 (JBC) operates two radio stations and the island's only
 television channel. JBC typically has been accused of bias in
 favor of the government by whichever party is in opposition.
 The only other broadcasting company is the privately owned
 Radio Jamaica (RJR). Although the Government has an equity
 holding in RJR, the company is independent and its broadcasts
 are often critical of government policies.
 The Government granted three licenses to new regional radio
 stations in 1988, as part of a long-planned divestiture
 program. The Government's broadcast commission will retain
 the right to regulate programming during emergencies.
 Divestiture plans for television have not yet been finalized.
 Many Jamaicans receive U.S. television broadcasts via
 satellite, and the Government does not impede such reception.
 There is no censorship or interference in academic studies or
 expression.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Large numbers and varieties of professional,
 business, service, social ,and cultural associations function
 
 
 627
 JAMAICA
 freely. Public rallies are staged by all political parties.
 Such events require a police permit, which is normally
 granted. The opposition PNP and the ruling JLP held rallies
 and meetings throughout the island during 1988. For a
 discussion of freedom of association as it applies to labor
 unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for by the Constitution and is
 well established in Jamaica. More than 80 percent of the
 population belong to various Christian denominations, and
 religious groups of all kinds operate freely. Evangelical
 Christian movements have gained a significant following, and
 foreign evangelists regularly visit.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides Jamaican citizens freedom of
 movement and immunity from expulsion from the country. There
 are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 Jamaica does not have a declared general policy on refugees,
 in part because so few individuals apply for that status.
 Those who apply are handled on a case by case basis. The
 country does not often accept asylum seekers, primarily for
 domestic economic reasons. Jamaica is a party to the 1951
 United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status
 of Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Prime Minister and his Cabinet exercise executive power.
 The executive takes the initiative in legislative matters and
 is responsible to the House of Representatives. The
 Constitution requires that, except under defined emergency
 circumstances, an election be held not later than 5 years
 after the first sitting of the preceding Parliament, but the
 Prime Minister may call national elections anytime within that
 period. The last national elections were held in December
 1983; the next such balloting must be held no later than April
 1989, but may be held before that date.
 In 1986 nationwide local elections were held for parish
 councils. They were vigorously contested, and the campaigns
 focused on national issues. The PNP received 57 percent of
 the vote and gained control of 12 of 13 councils. The 1986
 elections were largely peaceful, in contrast to the previous
 contested election in 1980.
 In response to allegations of irregularities during the 1986
 local elections for parish councils, Prime Minister Seaga
 appointed an independent investigative commission. In its
 September 1987 report, the commission recommended that security
 forces be deployed during future elections in historically
 troubled areas. In the meantime, senior representatives of
 the JLP and PNP have met regularly with each other and with
 electoral officials to try to ensure peaceful elections.
 Prime Minister Seaga has also met with PNP President Manley,
 and one important outcome was the August 26, interparty peace
 agreement.
 
 
 628
 JAMAICA
 Both major parties conducted rallies and sent motorcades
 throughout the island in August and September in expectation
 of early general elections. A few violent incidents, mainly
 stone-throwing, took place as election preparations
 intensified, but both parties have sought to keep violence
 under control.
 Women have full political rights under the Constitutuion, are
 inceasingly active in politics, and hold influential positions
 in the civil service and the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in
 Jamaica. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights, the country's
 only human rights organization, has vigorously protested
 alleged abuses by the police and has called for reforms. The
 Council's work was hampered during the year by a lack of
 adequate resources, and the organization was forced to reduce
 its staff. An Americas Watch representative visited Jamaica
 in 1988 and traveled widely around the island.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Jamaican women are accorded full equality under the
 Constitution, and the 1975 Employment Act requires equal pay
 for equal work. Nevertheless, because of cultural and social
 traditions, women often suffer economic discrimination, which
 is frequently evidenced in hiring practices. Access to higher-
 paying jobs outside traditional "female" areas is limited,
 particularly in the private sector. The 1975 Act helped
 narrow the gap between men's and women's salaries, but
 disparities remain.
 The Government has several programs to help women and has
 created a National Advisory Committee for Women's Affairs.
 The opposition PNP has pledged to create a Ministry of Women's
 Affairs, if elected.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Article 23 of the Constitution specifically provides for the
 right to form or join a trade union, and other, more general
 articles obligate the Government to protect the person and
 property of trade unionists. In Jamaica, libor unions, as do
 professional groups and private associations, function
 freely. The Labor Relations and Industrial Disputes Act
 (LRIDA) codifies regulations of workers rights.
 Unions draft their own constitutions and rules, elect
 officers, determine objectives, affiliate with national or
 international groups, and select delegates to conferences.
 Some Jamaican unions have joined democratic international
 trade secretariats, the Caribbean Congress of Labor, and the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The third
 largest labor union affiliates with the Communist-dominated
 World Federation of Trade Unions, and the World Confederation
 of Labor has attracted one Jamaican adherent. Labor and
 management groups select their own delegates to tripartite
 meetings of the International Labor organization (ILO).
 
 
 629
 JAMAICA
 Jamaican law neither prohibits strikes nor provides a right to
 strike, but in practice unions and workers use the strike as a
 tool. Striking workers can interrupt work without criminal
 liability but cannot be assured of keeping their jobs. The
 LRIDA and other laws provide that certain categories of
 essential services workers (usually government-employed) do
 not have the right to strike. Such workers and their
 organizations may negotiate terms of employment with employers
 and can appeal to the higher bodies described below.
 Unions have played a major role in Jamaican economic and
 political life since the 1930s. About 25 percent of the work
 force belongs to unions, and union influence is felt in all
 important economic sectors. Competition among unions for
 members heightens the quality of union representations for
 organized workers. The two largest unions, the Bustamante
 Industrial Trade Union and the National Workers Union, have
 organizational and leadership ties to the two major political
 parties, the JLP and the PNP, respectively. Both unions
 maintain their independence and sometimes take positions
 different from those of their respective parties. The third
 largest Jamaican union, the University and Allied Workers
 Union, is linked with the (Communist) Workers Party of
 Jamaica, whose leadership maintains direct control over the
 union. Jamaican laws and governmental practice do not
 restrict trade unions, and no allegations of worker rights
 violations have been reported through international or
 national organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize and belong
 to labor unions, and LRIDA provisions include guidelines for
 labor, management, and government on issues such as organizing
 work sites, negotiating agreements, and conflict resolution.
 Employees may not be fired solely because they are union
 officers. On the other hand, union affiliation may not be a
 prerequisite to employment. The Government rarely interferes
 with union organization efforts, and judicial and police
 authorities effectively enforce the LRIDA and other labor
 regulations.
 Labor, management, and government remain firmly committed by
 law and in practice to collective bargaining in contract
 negotiations and conflict resolution. Collective bargaining
 is widely used, even in some nonunionized firms. When labor
 and management fail to reach an agreement, cases may be
 referred to the Ministry of Labor for arbitration or
 mediation. An independent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT)
 forms the first appeal level above the Ministry. Any cases
 not resolved by the IDT pass to the civil courts. This system
 has proved effective, although unions and some employers
 continue to protest a 1986 LRIDA amendment, which permits the
 Minister of Labor unilaterally to refer cases involving the
 national interest to the IDT, because they fear it will
 undermine collective bargaining as a process.
 Domestic labor laws apply to Jamaican export free trade
 zones. Ministry of Labor officers cite a need for more
 compliance verification, especially in the free zones, but
 believe that most employers obey legal requirements. While
 domestic manufacturing companies are predominantly unionized,
 only 2 of the 18 factories in the Kingston Free Zone have
 union representation. During 1988 nonunionized workers in
 some of these free zone plants conducted short work stoppages
 
 
 630
 JAMAICA
 to protest working conditions. Free zone employers, all
 foreign, have historically opposed unionization, and the
 Government, concerned about possible loss of jobs and export
 earnings, has treated the problem cautiously. Jamaica's
 second largest union has indicated that it intends to organize
 workers in zone factories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution does not specifically address the matter'of
 forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party to
 the ILO Convention which prohibits compulsory labor, and there
 have been no allegations of this practice in Jamaica.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Juvenile Act provides that children under the age of 12
 shall not be employed except by parents or guardians. Such
 employment may be only in domestic, agricultural, or
 horticultural work. Children under 12 years of age may not be
 employed at night or at industrial sites. The Educational Act
 stipulates that all children aged 6 to 11 must attend
 elementary school. Industrial safety, police, and truant
 officers are charged with enforcing the law. However,
 enforcement is difficult, and children under 12 are sometimes
 seen peddling goods or services on city streets. There is no
 evidence of widespread illegal employment of children in other
 sectors of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The LRIDA establishes some basic conditions of work. The
 Factory Act stipulates that all factories be registered and
 approved by the Labor Ministry before they can begin
 operating. The Ministry's industrial safety division is
 required to make annual inspections of all factories, but
 budget constraints reduce the number of inspections actually
 made. The Ministry maintains records on industrial accident
 victims. If a private sector work site does not meet the
 definition of a "factory,' the Ministry does not have the
 authority to inspect it.
 Although based on freely negotiated settlements, government
 wage policy aims to keep maximum annual wage and fringe
 benefit increases to 10 percent or less to help contain
 inflation. Most wage settlements have followed this
 guideline, but exceptions have been made for workers with a
 history of inadequate pay. The Government increased minimum
 wage levels in a two-step process that began in June 1988 to
 $18.18 per week effective January 1, 1989. This amount is
 adequate for minimum food and shelter needs. Higher minimum
 wages apply to skilled workers, depending on their specialty.
 The minimum wage law also provides for a 42-hour standard
 workweek and overtime pay. The Ministries of Labor, Finance,
 the Public Service, and National Security enforce labor laws
 and regulations.
