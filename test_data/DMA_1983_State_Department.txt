 DOMINICA
 Dominica is a member of the British Commonwealth. It has a
 Westminister-style system of parliamentary democracy, which is
 the legacy of the pre-1978 British colonial rule. The Prime
 Minister, Eugenia Charles, was democratically elected in July
 1980. A period of political instability, including two armed
 attempts to overthrow her Government, marked the first year of
 her tenure, but recently the political atmosphere has calmed.
 The Charles Government enjoys broad support, although the oppo-
 sition is vocal in criticizing the slow progress of economic
 development.
 Dominica, one of the least developed countries in the Eastern
 Caribbean, has still not fully recovered from hurricane damage
 suffered in 1979 and 1980. The worldwide recession has further
 hampered economic progress and the Government's attempt to
 develop the country.
 The only security force in the country is the police. The
 force is small, undermanned, and lacks modern equipment and
 training, but it is imbued with traditions of integrity,
 professionalism and respect for human rights.
 Dominica continues to have a good human rights record. There
 have been no reports of significant violations of human rights
 in 1983.
 Section I   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom froms
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no reports in 1983 of killing for political
 motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of disappearance in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of torture or cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment in 1983. The opposition
 had accused the Government of a cover-up in the case of John
 Rose Lindsay, who died in 1981 as a result of injuries
 sustained while in police custody. After the opposition called
 for an independent inquiry, the Government in 1983 appointed a
 senior police investigator from neighboring Barbados to lead an
 inquiry. The Government has given the-investigator an office
 and asked that he be provided any information about the death.
 The results of the inquiry are still pending.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that anyone arrested shall be brought
 before a court within 72 hours, and this is honored in
 practice. The Dominican government abides by the constitu-
 tional provisions on arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. There
 have been no reports of arbitrary arrests, other forms of
 detention, or summary exile in 1983.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Dominica provides for public trials before an independent and
 impartial court. There is a presumption of innocence and

 defendants are allowed legal counsel. An appeal can be made if
 it is believed that these judicial rights have been violated.
 In connection with a coup attempt in 1981, former Prime
 Minister Patrick John has appealed to the Privy Council a 1982
 ruling by the West Indies Associated States Court of Appeal
 which ordered his rearrest and trial for coup plotting. John
 remains free awaiting the Privy Council decision.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry and search. There
 have been no reports of the state's arbitrary intrusion into
 the private life of the individual.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government affirms the right of free expression, which is
 provided in the Constitution. The opposition press freely
 criticizes the Government without interference. Early in 1983,
 one newspaper which is highly critical of the Government made
 unconfirmed allegations of media harassment by Government
 sympathizers. The paper continues to be freely distributed and
 there is no evidence that it has tempered its criticism of the
 government. In 1983, the privately-owned pro-Government
 newspaper broadened its coverage to include opposition view-
 points; previously it had been almost exclusively an organ of
 the ruling party.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to assemble peaceably is honored without
 exception. Opposition groups hold rallies and meetings without
 hindrance from the Government. Labor has the right to organize
 and conduct strikes. Labor unions are small in number and do
 not constitute a significant political force.  The unions which
 do exist are independent of the Government. The Banana Growers
 Association is a strong trade association which plays a signif-
 icant independent political role.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Dominicans are primarily Roman Catholic or Anglican. There is
 also a small Muslim community. No restrictions are enforced
 against any religious group, including the Rastafarians,
 although the 1979 "Dread Act* which prohibits membership in the
 Rastafarian cult is still on the books.
 In 1983 the Government called a meeting of representatives of
 the 17 religious denominations represented on the island to
 urge them to be more tolerant of each other. The meeting was
 called in response to feuding between some Christian fundamen-
 talist sects which the Government feared might result in an
 outbreak of violence. At the meeting, the Prime Minister
 reasserted Dominica's commitment to religious freedom, stressed
 religious tolerance, and emphasized the need to unify the
 country rather than divide it.

 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in law and honored in practice.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Dominica has a freely elected parliamentary system of
 government in which citizens have a real choice of policies and
 candidates from the ruling and opposition parties. In the 1980
 elections, the ruling Dominica Freedom Party won 17 seats in
 the House of Assembly; the Democratic Labour Party and indepen-
 dents each won 2 seats.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is responsive to complaints about any human
 rights violations. The establishment of an independent inquiry
 into the death of John Rose Lindsay is an example of this.
 There are no branches of international human rights orga-
 nizations in Dominica. The Dominica National Workers Union's
 human rights committee, a Marxist-Leninist organization, occa-
 sionally has published allegations of human rights violations
 in Dominica. The committee's one allegation in 1983 was that
 the March death of Eustace Bobb was caused by the police. The
 police have denied this and provided details of an inquest
 which strongly indicate that Bobb was murdered by members of
 the Rastafarian movement, with which he was closely identified.
 Amnesty International did not report on Dominica in 1983.
 Freedom House lists Dominica as free.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Dominica is a small and poor country with a population of
 74,000 people and a high emigration rate.  The 1983 population
 growth rate was minus .2 percent. The country relies heavily
 on banana exports and subsistence agriculture. Its estimated
 per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a little over $800
 per year and is among the lowest in the region.
 The Government places significant emphasis on education. With
 the assistance of external donors, it has rebuilt many primary
 schools destroyed by recent hurricanes. Literacy is estimated
 to be above 90 percent.
 The Government has made a concerted effort to improve health
 care through the construction of public health clinics. A
 major restructuring of the public health administration has
 improved the level of service in rural areas. At 19.6 per
 thousand live births, Dominica has one of the lowest infant
 mortality rates in the Eastern Caribbean.
 There are no legal restrictions on the role of women in
 Dominican society. Past tradition, where women were limited to
 the home and family, is rapidly being overcome. Improvement in
 educational opportunities for women and the example set by
 Prime Minister Eugenia Charles are expected to lead to greater
 participation of women in public life.
