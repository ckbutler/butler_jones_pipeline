 BENIN.
 Benin is a small one party socialist state with very
 limited natural resources. It has experienced frequent
 changes of government since it became independent in
 1960. The present regime, oriented on "scientific"
 Marxism-Leninism, has endured the longest of any and
 has offered some measure of stability. In January
 1977 mercenaries landed at Cotonou airport and tried
 to take over the government by military force. Their
 effort ended in total failure. The social and econo-
 mic goals set by the state are given precedence over
 integrity of the person and civil liberties.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Government of the People's Republic of Benin (GPRB)
 does not condone nor is there reliable evidence that
 it engages in torture. Amnesty International has re-
 ceived reports that, in 1975, some political prisoners
 were seriously mistreated and even tortured during
 their detention. We were not able to substantiate
 these reports nor have we received reports of serious
 mistreatment of those arrested following the January 16,
 1977 mercenary attack.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although rumors circulated in 1976 of persons being
 subjected to degrading treatment, their authenticity
 has never been substantiated. Prison conditions reflect
 the poverty of the country. Individuals who have open-
 ly criticized the Revolution have been sent to military
 camps for "revolutionary education." This involves
 standing for long hours reciting slogans and absorbing
 precepts of "scientific socialism." Indoctrinees us-
 ually have been released within two or three days. In
 1975 and 1976, Amnesty International criticized GPRB
 treatment of political prisoners and asked for a commu-
 tation of eight death sentences pronounced upon coup
 plotters, many of whom were condemned in absentia.
 While the government did not respond to Amnesty Inter-
 national's appeal, it has never carried out any of the
 
 
 executions. Current indications are that it does not
 intend to do so.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 During the five years that the Revolutionary Military
 Government has held power there have been four actual
 or alleged coup attempts, each of which has been fol-
 lowed by a wave of arbitrary arrests, imprisonment of
 suspected accomplices or plotters, and threats against
 would-be enemies of the state. Amnesty International
 has reported that in 1975 persons protesting the cir-
 cumstances of the death of the minister of the interi-
 or (allegedly shot for adultery) were arrested, held
 without trial and suffered ill treatment prior to their
 release. The gist of this report appears to be accu-
 rate. Immediately following the January 16 mercenary
 attack a large number of Beninese and foreigners were
 taken into custody and questioned but nearly all were
 released after varying periods of detention.
 The number of political prisoners currently being held
 in Cotonou is estimated at about 50. Most of them were
 arrested in connection with the January 16, 1977 coup
 attempt. Alleged coup collaborators from the military
 are reportedly being held outside the city, but we do
 not know how many.
 Detainees must spend a lengthy period in prison before
 positive action is taken. Authorities seldom notify
 families of arrest. Nor when the person detained is a
 foreigner do the authorities typically inform the appro-
 priate embassies. A major cause of delay is bureaucrat-
 ic, e.g., no detainee can be released without signature
 of the arresting officer whose identity in many cases is
 not clear. In some instances release must be approved
 by the minister of the interior but access to him is
 most difficult to obtain.
 The best-known political prisoners are three former
 presidents (Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadegbe) and Captain
 Janvier Assogba, leader of the alleged coup d'etat at-
 tempt in 1975.
 
 
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The previous constitution was suspended and rule by de-
 cree instituted shortly after Mathieu Kerekou seized
 power in 1972. The legal system, which was crippled by
 abrogation of the former constitution was dealt a final
 blow by the state of emergency instituted after the
 January 16, 1977 attempted coup d'etat. Thus, no guar-
 antees of an impartial p]ublic trial exist.
 The government has in the past staged show trials of
 political prisoners. The new constitution, approved
 in September 1977, provides for public trial by "profes-
 sional and non-professional" judges. It is too soon
 to tell how or whether this system will work.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The January 16, 1977 mercenary attack led to widescale
 unauthorized searches of homes of Beninese and foreign
 nationals. Fears of a renewed mercenary attack have
 since abated; there have been no recent instances of
 arbitrary searches.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Economic policy is aimed at helping the poor, and speci-
 fically at improving education and health care. Lim-
 ited government resources and many institutional and
 policy changes in the past few years have hampered de-
 velopment efforts.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and. Assemblv
 The GPRB's 1972 abrogation of the previous constitution
 and its efforts to transform Benin into a Marxist-
 Leninist state based on principles of "scientific soc-
 ialism" led to suppression of independent political or
 
 
 labor activity, demonstrations, free expression or any
 other activities implying criticism of the regime. The
 press is government-controlled and distribution of
 western publications is limited. Labor Unions are firm-
 ly controlled by the government. Although all religions
 are allowed to practice, the Kerekou Government, con-
 cerned about the power of local cult practices, has
 heavily curtailed traditional religious ceremonies.
 Christians have been harassed occasionally but churches
 continue to function normally. The only sect against
 which drastic action has been taken are the Jehovah's
 Witnesses who refused to acknowledge the ligitimacy of
 the revolution. All expatriate members of this sect
 was expelled in April 1976 and their property confis-
 cated.
 The new 1977 constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 press, thought, assembly, association and demonstration
 (article 134). Article 136 also guarantees individual
 liberty to all citizens of the People's Republic of
 Benin. Again it is too soon to know the degree to
 which the new constitution will be implemented.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on the movements of Beninese
 citizens within the country. Travel of foreigners with-
 in Benin is restricted. Although the government con-
 trols emigration and foreign travel, in fact, it has
 apparently not sought to prevent dissidents from leaving
 the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Such freedoms as existed in Benin were suspended with the
 abrogation of the former constitution in 1972. The new
 1977 constitution, however, makes provision within a one-
 party context for an elected assembly by universal adult
 sufferage. No date for elections has been definitively
 set. The People's Revolutionary Party remains the most
 important single element in the new political system.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is no record of requests for on-the-spot outside
 investigations of human rights conditions in Benin. The
 government would be likely to view such requests as inter-
 ference in its internal affairs.
