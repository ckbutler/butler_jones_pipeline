 CAMEROON
 Cameroon has a civilian government operating under a
 constitution and within a single party system.
 Its unique history has led Cameroon to make national
 unity a principal objective. Three European powers
 governed Cameroon -- Germany, Britain and France.
 Furthermore, an ethnically based and ideologically moti-
 vated guerrilla campaign, begun against the French and
 continued against the independent government, severely
 tested that government's ability to foster national
 unity. By the mid-sixties, however, the Cameroonian
 government had managed to assert its control over the
 area in conflict. In 1965, President Ahidjo organized
 the Cameroon National Union (CNU) as the country's single
 political party, an amalgamation of previously existing
 ethnic and regional parties. In recent years, as the,
 threat of internal subversion has receded, political
 detainees have been released, and restrictions of civil
 liberties have been largely removed.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited in Cameroon. This prohibition
 appears to be observed in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Inadequate prison conditions result from financial woes
 and not from deliberate policies. In March 1977,
 Cameroon Presbyterian Church parishes organized a fund
 raising campaign to aid prisoners and bring their plight
 to public attention. Since then, the Cameroonian Govern-
 ment has stepped up its efforts to improve the training
 of prison officials, stressing the need always to regard
 prisoners as fellow human beings.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In 1976, Amnesty International selected Cameroon as one
 of its priority countries in francophone Africa and is
 currently investigating a number of alleged arbitrary
 arrests. The Cameroon Government has said that all re-
 maining political prisoners were released in conjunction
 (14)
 
 
 with National Day celebrations on May 20, 1977. At the
 present time, we have no information on specific individ-
 uals being detained on political charges.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants are allowed a fair, public trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home does not occur with government sanction.
 sanction.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The government is .actively seeking ways to improve the
 living standards of the nation's poorest segments. At
 least half of the new five year development plan (1976-81)
 deals with improving social conditions. Specifically,
 the government plans to expand the educational and health
 facilities for both urban and rural populations; increase
 employment opportunities," improve non-formal educational
 systems; provide professional training; and integrate
 youth into the development process. Some of these pro-
 grams are already enjoying a fair degree of success.
 Perhaps Cameroon's most ambitious plan is for the crea-
 tion of a sound infrastructural base. The government
 has undertaken a project to improve the rail link between
 Yaounde and Douala in the expectation that a modern and
 efficient transport system will spur economic growth
 and benefit the rural population as has been the case
 with regard to the recently completed rail line between
 Yaounde and Ngaoundere. A port expansion program at
 Douala should bring about similar results.
 In 1972, the country's three labor federations were united
 to form the National Union of Cameroon Workers, an affili-
 ate of the CNU. Labor unions have little political or
 economic strength because of the small size of the sal-
 aried work force and government control over union acti-
 vities. Strikes are banned in Cameroon.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 In fact, Cameroon is characterized by diverse ethnic and
 religious traditions which are not only tolerated but
 encouraged. Freedom of speech and the press is circum-
 scribed within the single party system. However, the
 press, while subject to government control, is relatively
 outspoken and is often a source of admitted embarrassment
 to government leaders.
 Freedom of religion is observed in a nation comprised
 of animists, Christians, and Moslems. Christian mission-
 aries are free to carry out their duties throughout the
 country, including the Moslem north.
 Freedom of assembly for social and non-political pur-
 poses is generally unrestricted. Political meetings,
 however, are organized and controlled by the Cameroon
 National Union (CNU), the country's single political
 party.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Cameroonians move freely throughout the country. Inter-
 national travel and emigration are usually unrestricted.
 Exit visas are required and are sometimes difficult to
 obtain, due to bureaucratic red tape. Occasionally,
 delays have resulted from the government's attempts to
 prevent certain individuals from leaving the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Cameroon is a one-party state. The government does permit
 a considerable amount of discussion and competition among
 candidates vying for local or regional offices. Suffrage
 is universal, and elections for seats in the National
 Assembly are regularly scheduled. Only those candidates
 enjoying the CNU imprimatur, however, are allowed to
 have their names on the ballot.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights:
 In the past, the government has been quite willing to allow
 outside investigation into human rights violations.
 Amnesty International was invited to attend a series of
 political trials in 1971 and the resulting report was
 received and acknowledged by government officials.
 Recently, however, Amnesty International claimed that
 the government was being less responsive to its specific
 inquiries.
