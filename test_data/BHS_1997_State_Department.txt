 BAHAMAS
 The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy
 and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Queen Elizabeth II, the nominal
 head of state, is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister Hu-
 bert A. Ingraham's Free National Movement (FNM) has controlled the Government
 and Parliament since August 1992. The judiciary is independent.
 The police and the small Bahamas Defence Force answer to civilian authority and
 generally respect laws protecting human rights. However, there continue to be re-
 ports that police occasionally abuse detainees.
 The economy depends primarily on tourism, which accounts for nearly two-thirds
 of the gross domestic product. Financial services, particularly offshore banking and
 trust management, are also a major source of revenue. While some citizens enjoy
 relatively high income levels, there is considerable underemployment and poverty.
 The official unemployment rate is over 11 percent, but unofficial estimates range
 up to twice that figure.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of democratic freedoms and human rights. The prin-
 cipal human rights problems include reports of occasional police abuse of detainees,
 continuing harsh conditions at the only prison, lengthy pretrial detention and delays
 in trials, violence and discrimination against women, and violence against children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits-torture and other cruel and degrading treatment or pun-
 ishment, but corporal-punishment-abolished in 1984-was reinstated in 1991.
 Human rights monitors -and members of the general -public continued to express
 concern over instances of police abuse against criminal suspects. Many of the
 charges of abuse involved beatings in order to extract confessions. Policeaofficials de-
 nied that there have been violations of defendants' rights. According to the officials,
 these rights are protected by the trial judge, who determines the admissibility of
 the defendant's statement as evidence at trial. The Police Complaints and Discipline
 Unit, which reports directly to senior police officials, is responsible for investigating
 allegations of police brutality.
 Conditions at Fox Hill, the only prison, continue to improve, but remain harsh
 and overcrowded. The men's prison, originally built in 1953 to house about 600 in-
 mates, holds over 1,400 prisoners. The women's prison population is around 30, con-
 siderably less than full capacity. Male prisoners are crowded into poorly ventilated
 .cells that generally lack running water and adequate sanitation facilities. There are
 no separate- facilities for inmates being held on remand, although some are eventu-
 ally segregated;in a-medium security wing after being processed through maximum
 security. Prison officials estimate that about 13 percent of the incoming prisoner
 population is infected with the H1W virus. Most prisoners lack beds, many sleep on
 concrete floors, and most are locked in their cells 23 hours per day.   Facilities for
 women are less severe .and do have running water. Organizations providing aid,
 counseling services, and religious instruction have regular access to inmates.
 In October migrants from the Dominican Republic rioted to protest poor condi-
 tions at the Carmichael Road Detention Center (see Section 2.d.).
 The Government provided funds to enable prison officials to make improvements
 in prison facilities and to continue prisoner rehabilitation programs. Modern train-
 ing facilities for prison officers and staff are equipped with new computers and addi-
 tional personnel. The prison offers some educational and literacy progams for pris-
 oners, has added a new dental unit, and is building a prison workshop to provide
 some-activity for inmates. Plans for critically needed new maximum security living
 space have not yet been implemented.
 Local-and international human rights groups were able to visit the prison during
 the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. The authorities conduct .arrests openly and, when required, ob-
 tain judicially issued warrants. Serious cases, including those of suspected narcotics
 or firearms offenses, do not require warrants where probable cause exists. Arrested
 persons appear before a magistrate within 48 hours (or by the next business day
 or cases.arising on weekends and holidays) to hear the charges against them. They
 may hire an attorney of their choice. The Government does not provide legal rep-
 resentation except to destitute suspects charged with capital crimes. Police some-
 times deviate from prescribed procedures, however, and act arbitrarily. The Govern-
 ment respects the right to a judicial determination of the legality of arrests.
 The Bail Act prohibits bail for repeat offenders and those accused of certain vio-
 lent crimes. Judges tend not to grant bail to foreign suspects, particularly on more
 serious offenses, since the authorities consider foreign offenders likely to flee if re-
 leased 'on bail. Judges sometimes authorize cash bail for foreigners arrested on
 minor charges, but in practice, foreign suspects generally prefer to plead guilty and
 pay a fine rather than pursue their right to defend themselves, given possible delays
 in court cases and harsh conditions in the prison. Attorneys and other prisoner ad-
 vocates continued to complain of excessive pretrial detention.
 The authorities detain illegal migrants, primarily Haitians and Cubans, at the
 Carmichael-Road Detention Center until arrangements can be made for them to
 leave the country or they obtain legal status. Conditions at the detention center are
 Spartan, but most detainees do not remain for an excessively long period of time.
 The Government has earmarked $800,000 to renovate the center. In October mi-
 grants from the Dominican Republic rioted to protest poor conditions at the center.
 The rioters threw stones at the guards and set fire to the center's mess hall. The
 authorities transferred the detainees who rioted to the prison.
 Illegal migrants convicted of crimes other than immigration violations are held at
 the prison and remain there for weeks or months, pending deportation after serving
 their sentences, unless they can arrange private means for their repatriation.
 Exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The justice system derives from English common
 law. The judiciary, appointed by the Governor General on the advice, in most cases,
 of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission, has always been independent.
 
 
 409
 Magistrate's courts are the lowest level courts and only handle crimes with a max-
 imum sentence of 5 years. Trial by jury is only available in the Supreme Court,
 which is the trial court that handles most major cases. Its decisions may be ap-
 pealed to the Court of Appeal, with the Privy Council in London being the final
 court of appeal.
 Trials are fair and public. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and the
 right to appeal. Defendants can confront and question witnesses against them and
 present evidence on their own behalf. The judicial system is plagued by a large
 backlog of cases. In order to reduce the backlog, the Government has streamlined
 the appeals process, limited the availability of bail in serious cases, computerized
 court records, and added new judges, lay magistrates, and trained court reporters.
 Despite these measures to improve efficiency in the courts, complaints persist of ex-
 cessive pretrial detention and delayed justice for victims.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the Government gen-
 erally respects these prohibitions in practice. The law usually requires a court order
 for entry into or search of a private residence, but a police inspector or more senior
 police official may authorize a search without a court order where probable cause
 to suspect a weapons violation exists. Such an official may also authorize the search
 of a person (that extends to the vehicle in which the person is traveling) without
 a court order, should probable cause exist to suspect drug possession.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:  I                         I "
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government respects the constitutional pro-
 vision for the right of free expression, and the political opposition criticizes the Gov-
 ernment freely and frequently. Three daily and several weekly newspapers, all pri-
 vately owned, express a variety of views on issues of public interest, including vary-
 ing degrees of criticism of the Government and its policies. Foreign newspapers and
 magazines are readily available.
 There is a government-run radio station 'and three privately owned radio broad-
 casters. The country's sole television station, the state-owned Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion of the Bahamas, presents a variety of views, although opposition politicians
 claim with some justification that their views do not receive as, extensive coverage
 as those of the Government.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights to free assembly and association, and the authorities respect these rights
 in-practice. The law permits private associations, but groups must obtain permits
 to hold public demonstrations. The authorities grant such permits almost without
 exception.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Govern-
 ment did not grant first asylum to any persons in 1997, but 11 requests were pend-
 ing decision at the end of the year. There were no reports of forced return of persons
 to a country where they feared persecution.
 Although the repatriation agreement between the Bahamas and Haiti expired at
 the end of 1995, the Government continued to repatriate illegal Haitian immigrants
 based on the terms of the agreement. The Bahamas signed a repatriation agreement
 with the Government of Cuba in January 1996, and since -then the authorities have
 successfully repatriated illegal Cuban immigrants.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy with two major politi-
 cal parties and general elections at least every 5 years. An elected Prime Minister
 and Parliament govern. The political process is open to all elements of society, and
 citizens 18 years of age and older are eligible to register and vote; voting is by secret
 ballot. The two principal political parties are the ruling Free National Movement
 and the opposition Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). The PLP led the country for 6
 
 
 years of internal self-government from 1967 to 1973 and held power from independ-
 ence in 1973 until 1992. The FNM won general elections in 1992 and 1997.,
 The FNM holds 35 of 40 seats in the House of Assembly, and the PLP holds 5.
 Both the ruling party and the opposition name members to the upper house-the
 Senate-in compliance with constitutional guidelines. Although it does pass legisla-
 tion, the Senate is primarily-a deliberative body that serves as a public forum to
 discuss national problems and policies to address them.
 The Parliament has six elected female members, including the speaker of the
 House, and five appointed female-Senators, including the government leader in the
 Senate. The Foreign Minister is a woman, and women also head the Ministry of
 Education and the Ministry of Labor, Immigration, and Training.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Non. governmental In-
 . vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 - Individual human rights monitors and several local human rights groups, as well
 as representatives of international human rights organizations, operate freely, ex-
 pressingtheir. opinions and reporting their findings on alleged human rights viola-
 tions without government restriction. The Government allows them broad access to
 Anstitutions and individuals.
 -Section 5. -Discrimination Based on Race,- Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government generally respects in practice the constitutional provisions for in-
 dividual rights and freedoms regardless of race, place of origin, political opinion,
 creed, or sex. However, both the Constitution and the law discriminate against
 women in several respects.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women continued to-be a serious problem,
 with many women seeking shelter at the private, but government-supported, crisis
 center in Nassau. The Government has established-a nationwide toll-free hot line,
 with two trained volunteers on each of the inhabited -islands on call to respond in
 the event of a crisis. The crisis center, with help from the Government, continued
 a public- awareness campaign to highlight the problems of abuse and domestic vio-
 lence. The Domestic Court; which deals exclusively with family issues such as
 -spousal abuse, maintenance payments, and legal separation, continued to receive a
 high volume of cases. The court can and does impose various legal constraints to
 protect women from abusive spouses or companions. However, advocates for wom-
 en's rights see a need to improve the effectiveness of enforcement of orders of the
 Domestic Court.
 The Constitution discriminates against women by not providing them with the
 same right as men to transmit citizenship to their foreign-born spouses. Addition-
 ally, the law makes it -easier for men with foreign spouses to confer citizenship on
 their. children than for women with foreign spouses. Some inheritance laws also
 favor men over women. For example, when a person dies without a will, the estate
 passes to the oldest legitimate son, or in cases where there is no son, the closest
 legitimate male relative. Prominent women of all political persuasions continue to
 push for an amendment to the Constitution and related laws to redress this situa-
 tion.
 Women participate fully in society 'and are well represented in the business and
 professional sectors, as well as -inThe judiciary and government (see Section 3). The
 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Janet Bostwick, also  directs the Bahamian Bureau of
 Women's-Affairs, which is within- the-Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chief Justice
 of the Supreme Court is a woman.
 Children.-The Government places-priority on maintaining adequate expenditures
 for child welfare and education. However, child abuse and neglect remain serious
 problems. The, law requires that anyone having contact with a child they believe to
 be sexually abused must report their suspicion to the police. The same reporting re-
 quirement does not apply to cases of physical -abuse, which nonetheless are high.
 The police refer reported cases of sexual and physical abuse to the Department of
 -Social Services, which investigates them and can bring criminal charges against
 perpetrators. The Department may remove children from abusive situations if the
 court-deems it necessary.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the 1973 National Building-Code mandates
 - certain accommodations for the physically disabled in new public-buildings, the au-
 thorities rarely enforce this part of the code. The code fails to mandate accommoda-
 tion in new private buildings, however, which often lack accessibility as well.
 The Disability Affairs Unit of the Ministry of Social Development and National
 Insurance works with the Bahamas Council for Disability, an umbrella organization
 for groups offering services for the disabled, to provide a coordinated public and pri-
 
 
 411
 vate sector approach to the needs of the disabled. A mix of government and private
 residential and nonresidential institutions provide a range of education, training,
 counseling, and job placement services for both physically and mentally disabled
 adults an childrn. The country is participating in an International Labor Organi-
 zation pilot program to provide specialized training to persons who provide services
 to the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-An estimated 30,000 Haitians reside in the
 Bahamas legally and productively, but social, economic and political sensitivities re-
 main. Members of the Haitian community reported that some police and immigra-
 tion officials have taken Haitians off the streets into custody before allowing them
 a chance to produce their residency permits. Haitians also complained that officials
 sometimes came to their residences late at night, a violation of the terms of the ex-
 pired Bahamas-Haiti repatriation agreement. These alleged violations are difficult
 to confirm, but some similar past complaints resulted in procedural changes by the
 authorities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that labor unions have the
 right of free assembly and association. Private sector and most public sector workers
 may form or join unions without prior approval. Members of the police force, defense
 force, fire brigade, and prison guards may not organize or join unions. Workers exer-
 cise the right of association extensively, with aimost one-quarter of the work force
 (and one-half the workers in the important hotel industry) belonging to unions.
 Three major umbrella labor organizations, the National Workers Council of Trade
 Unions and Associations, the Trade Union Congress (TUC), and the National Con-
 gress of Trade Unions, along with individual labor unions, all function independent
 of government or political party control.
 The Industrial Relations Act requires that, before a strike begins, a simple major-
 ity of a union's membership must vote in favor of a motion to strike. The Depart-
 ment of Labor must supervise the vote. Unions instituted work stoppages at the
 Nassau International Airport and at a major hotel construction site in Nassau dur-
 ing the year. In order to resolve trade disputes more quickly, the Industrial Rela-
 tions Act was amended in 1996 to establish an industrial tribunal. According to the
 act, labor disputes are first filed with the Ministry of Labor and then if not resolved,
 are turned over to the tribunal. The tribunal follows normal court procedures for
 the admission of evidence, direct examination, and cross examination. The tribunal's
 decision is final and is only appealable in court on a strict question of law. Some
 employers complain that the industrial tribunal is unfairly biased in favor of em-
 ployees.
 All labor unions have the right to maintain affiliations with international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers freely exercise their
 right to organize and participate in collective bargaining, which the law protects.
 Unions andemployers negotiate wage rates without government interference.
 The Constitution and the Industrial Relations Act prohibit antinion discrimina-
 tion by employers. The act requires employers to recognize trade unions, and it re-
 quires the reinstatement of workers fired for union, activities. Employers may dis-
 miss workers in accordance with applicable contracts, which generally require some
 severance pay. The Government enforces labor laws and regulations uniformly
 throughout the country.
 There are two small free trade zones. Labor law and practice in these zones do
 not differ from those in the rest of the country
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor by all persons, including children, and such labor does not exist
 in practice.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14 for industrial work, work
 during school hours, or work at night. There is no legal minimum age for employ-
 ment in other sectors, and some children work part time in light industry and serv-
 ice jobs. The constitutional prohibition of forced and compulsory labor is respected
 in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the regu-
 lar workweek to 48 hours and provides for one 24-hour rest period. The act requires
 overtime payment (time and a half for hours beyond the standard. The act permits
 the creation of a Wages Council to recommend the setting of a minimum wage, but
 the Government has never established such a council or a general minimum wage.
 However, in 1996 the Government established a specific minimum wage of $4.12 per
 hour for all hourly and temporary workers throughout the public sector.
 
 
 412
 The Ministry of Labor, responsible for enforcing labor laws, has a team of inspec-
 tors who conduct on-site visits to enforce occupational health and safety standards
 and investigate employee concerns and complaints, but inspections occur only infre-
 quently. The Ministry normally announces inspection visits in advance, and employ-
 ers generally cooperate with inspectors to implement safety standards.
 The national insurance program compensates workers for work- related injuries.
 The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to find suitable alternative em-
 ployment for-employees injured on the job but still able to work. The law does not
 provide a right for workers to absent themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
