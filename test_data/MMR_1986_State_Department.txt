 BURMA
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is a one-party,
 authoritarian state whose leaders come from a narrow elite
 within the military. The ruling Burma Socialist Program Party
 (BSPP) parallels and dominates the Government. It is
 subordinate to its chairman, U Ne Win, who commanded the army
 when he took power in a 1962 coup. The 1974 Constitution
 -established the framework of Burma's one-party Government,
 recognized the BSPP as the sole legal political party, and
 gave it responsibility to "lead the state." The Government is
 headed by a 29-member Council of State whose chairman, U San
 Yu, is ex-officio President of Burma. A unicameral National
 Assembly consisting of 489 members elected for 4-year terms is
 the titular source of all power in the state. Candidates for
 election to the various levels of state administration are
 nominated by the party and run unopposed, though they can be
 defeated by a negative vote. Nonparty members are permitted
 to run for the Assembly and local "peoples' councils" (the
 basic unit of local administration), but candidates must be
 approved by the BSPP. Opposition political groups are banned
 and public criticism of the Government is not tolerated.
 A 1975 antisubversion law codified the wide discretionary
 powers of government security agencies. Besides several
 government organizations charged with state security, each
 local people's council has its own security committee with
 block and neighborhood wardens. In addition, the BSPP has a
 system of local informants.
 Since the early 1960's, the Government has been trying to
 build a centrally planned economic system under an ideological
 program known as the "Burmese Way to Socialism." Most
 significant economic enterprises are government owned. For
 many years, the Government pursued a rigid policy of economic
 self-sufficiency. -The Government recently has tempered its
 doctrinaire socialism with some pragmatic economic measures,
 including greater tolerance of the private sector and
 acceptance of foreign-grant and loan capital. However,
 statistically, Burma remains among the world's least developed
 countries. Although the State retains ultimate rights to all
 land and natural resources, the right to own property is
 recognized by the Constitution and respected in practice.
 An important factor affecting the human rights situation
 continues to be the widespread insurgencies. Dozens of
 different insurgent groups, based primarily on Burma's ethnic
 minorities, have been fighting the Government for decades.
 Some of these groups are fighting for autonomy or independence
 and against what they perceive to be domination by ethnic
 Burmans. The Burma Communist Party (BCP) also has been
 fighting for nearly 40 years to overthrow the Government. It
 and many of the insurgent groups traffic in narcotics to
 finance their operations. Some of the groups are in effect
 narcotics syndicates with private armies.
 There continue to be a number of serious human rights problems
 in Burma. Authoritarian control over the political and
 economic system essentially is unchanged. Abuses of human
 rights by all sides in the insurgencies continue. Persons of
 non-Burmese ancestry continue to face elements of
 institutionalized discrimination.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political-Killing
 Although summary executions are not allowed under the Burmese
 judicial system, there were reports that government forces
 executed captured prisoners or killed suspected insurgent
 supporters during military operations. There also were
 frequent credible reports of noncombatant deaths resulting
 from military/insurgent clashes.
 Some insurgent-groups carried out summary executions of
 prisoners,'opponents, and suspected informers. Attacks by
 insurgent groups against civilian targets continued and
 included shelling towns, mining 'trains, kidnaping, and
 assassination.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no specific reports over the past year of people
 being abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine
 detention by security forces. There is usually no attempt to
 conceal common criminal or political/security arrests from
 family members, although details about the charges may not be
 revealed. Some insurgent groups resorted to abduction as a
 political weapon to coerce local inhabitants into cooperation.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhumane, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although the Constitution provides that punishment shall not
 be in violation of human dignity, and the Government denies
 that torture or inhumane treatment is practiced, reports over
 the years suggest that the police and other security forces
 sometimes use psychological coercion and torture during
 investigations in both common criminal and political/security
 cases. There were also reports of mistreatment of some
 low-level political/security prisoners in regular prison
 facilities. Prison conditions are poor as a consequence of
 the generally low standard of living, overcrowding, low
 government expenditures, and limited staff.
 Insurgent groups sometimes employ death threats, beatings, and
 other forms of physical and mental coercion against opponents
 or villagers who refuse to cooperate with them. There were
 reports that insurgent groups tortured captured government
 soldiers in the course of gathering information about Burma
 army operations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no provision in Burmese law for a person in detention
 to seek a judicial determination of the legality of his
 detention. In serious cases involving national security, some
 persons may not be formally charged but held in indefinite
 detention without trial. In less serious political/security
 cases, detention is nominally limited to 180 days, but this
 may be extended with Cabinet approval.
 In common criminal cases, police may detain suspects up to 24
 hours, after which a court order must be sought from competent
 judicial authorities. These renewable court orders authorize
 
 
 665
 BURMA
 14-day extensions of the detention until charges are formally
 brought before a court. Detainees frequently are held
 incommunicado during the period of investigation and
 interrogation but normally are allowed visitors thereafter.
 In August, perhaps as many as 200 persons were arrested for
 their involvement with foreigners in various smuggling and
 illegal currency activities. A few of these have been
 released, but many have not yet been charged. Most are being
 detained under the 180-day provision mentioned above.
 Refugees and other stateless persons are regarded as illegal
 immigrants subject to arrest. If they cannot be repatriated
 after serving sentences for illegal entry, they may be
 detained indefinitely. The Government is thought to have
 under detention several hundred illegal immigrants from a
 number of Asian countries. It reportedly is willing to
 release those remaining if they are accepted for permanent
 resettlement elsewhere.
 Burma's Legal Code does not contain any statutory prohibition
 of forced labor. The Burma army frequently conscripts
 civilian males in the vicinity of military operations
 (primarily in areas populated by ethnic minorities) for porter
 duty. Some of these porters are killed by mines planted by
 insurgents and in military engagements. Insurgent groups also
 press-gang villagers into service as recruits or porters.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A 12-member.Council of People's Justices (CPJ) exercises
 national jurisdiction (on an appellate basis only) and
 supervises courts at 3 lower levels. At the lower levels,
 justice is administered by three-judge panels. These panels
 are elected from a single slate of candidates chosen by the
 BSPP, All judges are BSPP members, and a large number are
 active or retired military officers. They are untrained in
 the law but normally advised by professional legal officers.
 The judiciary is not independent of the Government, which can
 influence both verdict and sentence, particularly in
 political/security cases. Influence, payments, and favors are
 often factors in lower court decisions. Tight control through
 BSPP channels and the mandatory use of three-judge panels tend
 to restrain judicial activism. At the same time, lower court
 judges are not always accountable to the CPJ. In March,
 discussions in the National Assembly revealed that the CPJ had
 had to reissue in 1981, and again in 1985, a 1975 directive to
 lower courts on minimum sentences in criminal cases.
 The legal code is based upon the British colonial system of
 law with an overlay from the present Constitution and other
 legal measures imposed by the Government. The Constitution
 provides for public trials in most cases, and this practice is
 followed in common criminal cases. In political/security
 cases, special judiciary committees may be named by the
 Council of State. The public normally is not allowed to
 attend such trials.
 The burden of proof is on the prosecution in both common
 criminal and political/security cases. The accused has the
 right to counsel in both types of cases and legal counsel is
 provided for indigent defendants faced with a possible
 sentence of 7 years or more. Normally, defendants can consult
 freely and privately with their lawyers. Defendants and their
 lawyers also are made aware of the charges and evidence and
 
 
 666
 BURMA
 are permitted to submit their own evidence. The verdicts of
 civil, security, and military courts may be appealed to the
 next higher court up to the Council of State.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In common criminal cases, police officials are required to
 have a valid search warrant or to be accompanied by a member
 of the local People's Council at the time of search. Search
 warrants are issued by local or state Judges' Committees. In
 political/security cases, security forces are not subject to
 judicial procedures and usually enter homes without warrants.
 In areas of insurgency, forced entry and warrantless searches
 are carried out by government security forces and rebel groups
 alike. It is widely believed that security personnel monitor
 private correspondence and telephone calls. A well-developed
 system of neighborhood informers reports on dissent and
 criticism of the Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are significant restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press in Burma. The Constitution guarantees freedom of
 speech, expression, and publication but stipulates that the
 exercise of such freedoms should not be "contrary to the
 interest of the working people and socialism." In practice,
 opposition viewpoints and public criticism of the Government
 are not tolerated. Party members can express some views about
 economic problems or bureaucratic failures, but outspoken
 members can be disciplined or expelled. Anyone criticizing
 the Government's leadership in public or private is subject to
 arrest, although muted private criticism is usually ignored.
 The Government owns and operates the mass media in Burma,
 including television, radio, and the six national newspapers.
 There are some private periodicals. Newspaper editors are
 appointed by the Ministry of Information and editorials must
 be approved in advance. Journalists are subject to strict
 guidelines as to what can be broadcast or published,
 especially on domestic matters. Although subject to prior
 review and selection, international news reporting is
 generally objective and balanced.
 Criticism of government officials is not permitted in the
 press, although cartoons and editorials will sometimes
 criticize local administration indirectly. All forms of
 communications--domestic and imported books and periodicals,
 stage plays, motion pictures, and musical recordings--are
 subject to government control and censorship. The Government
 monitors academic inquiry in the social sciences. The
 difficulty of obtaining scholarly publications from abroad and
 of communicating with foreign scholars impedes academic
 research, although there have been improvements in recent
 years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of assembly and
 association, but only for those organizations permitted by
 law. In practice, most legitimate organizations are linked to
 the BSPP. BSPP "mass organizations" for workers, peasants,
 and youth have been established at every administrative
 
 
 667
 BURMA
 level. These organizations serve primarily as vehicles for
 communicating national policies and implementing government
 programs. Opposition political groups are banned, and their
 members are subject to arrest. Public meetings must be
 sanctioned by the Government.
 There is no independent labor movement in Burma. Workers do
 not have the right to organize independently, to bargain
 collectively, or to strike. The labor force is organized into
 BSPP-controlled workers' and peasants' mass organizations.
 Most of the leaders of these organizations are party
 officials, and the national leadership is made up of ranking
 party and government officials. For example, the workers'
 organization national chairman is also the Minister for Social
 Welfare and Labor, and the peasants' organization chairman is
 also the Minister for Agriculture and Forests; both are
 members of the BSPP's Central Committee.
 Labor disputes in both the public and private sectors are
 mediated by arbitration boards composed of worker, management,
 and government representatives. In practice, these committees
 are under the control of the workers' association, and the
 BSPP, working through the Government, decides disputes. In
 the public sector where workers, management, and government
 representatives are all generally party officials, the process
 has little meaning. However, in the private sector this
 process can provide workers with a real voice. Burma is a
 member of the International Labor Organization (ILO). Labor
 organizations and other professional associations are
 generally not permitted to maintain independent relations with
 international private bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burma is a secular state dominated by the Burman ethnic
 group. Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution
 and widely observed in practice. The great majority of
 Burmese are Buddhist, although there are sizable Christian,
 Muslim, and animist minorities based principally in various
 minority ethnic groups. While minority religious groups are
 allowed to practice freely, some persons of mixed Burman and
 ethnic minority ancestry have been known to convert to
 Buddhism as a way of strengthening their claim to be
 considered ethnic Burmans.
 Religious groups can and do maintain links with coreligionists
 in other countries, such as with the Vatican in the case of
 Catholics. Religious travel such as the Hajj is permitted and
 in some cases subsidized by the Government. Foreign religious
 representatives are usually allowed only tourist visas and are
 not permitted to preach or proselytize, although a few foreign
 missionaries who are longtime residents of Burma have been
 permitted to remain and serve their congregations.
 All religious organizations are required to register with the
 Government. Religious publications are subject to the same
 government control and censorship as other publications. On
 occasion, the Government has used a nationalization law to
 take control of the property of religious organizations. It
 continued to try to limit the activities of Buddhist monks,
 promulgating new rules governing their behavior in public
 places.
 
 
 668
 BURMA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees Burmese citizens the right to live
 anywhere in the country. Except for limitations in areas of
 insurgent activity, Burmese citizens can travel freely within
 the country but must inform local authorities of their
 temporary place of residence. Noncitizens, including persons
 born in Burma who hold foreigners' registration cards, must
 obtain prior permission to travel.
 Legal requirements and bureaucratic procedures cause long
 delays in obtaining passports, and the right to emigrate often
 is denied. Severe limits are placed on what emigrants are
 allowed to take with them. Before traveling abroad, private
 citizens normally must reimburse the Government for their
 university and professional education and pay income tax in
 advance. Persons who retain Burmese citizenship and who left
 the country legally are generally allowed to return to visit
 relatives. Burma does not recognize dual citizenship:
 acquiring citizenship in another country results in the loss
 of Burmese citizenship. A 1986 relaxation of procedures
 permits overseas resident Burmese citizens who return to Burma
 for less than 2 weeks to retain their passports during their
 stay in Burma. Previously, all such visitors had to
 relinquish their passports and reapply to leave Burma, a
 process which took 1 to 2 months. Emigrants wishing to return
 permanently are still required to reapply for Burmese
 citizenship. In general, those who leave the country
 illegally cannot legally return.
 Burma does not permit foreign refugees or displaced persons to
 resettle or seek safe haven within Burma. The Government
 treats persons claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants
 and incarcerates them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Burma has an authoritarian, one-party system in which
 leadership is essentially drawn from a small elite within the
 military officer corps. All government institutions and other
 organizations in Burma are subordinate to the guidance of the
 ruling BSPP. The party in turn follows the leadership of
 Chairman U Ne Win, who has personally ruled and guided the
 formulation and execution of national policy for the last two
 decades.
 Ethnic Burmans dominate the political system although the
 party seeks to expand participation by Burmese ethnic
 minorities. Women are underrepresented both in the Government
 and in the Party relative to their percentage of the general
 population.
 Political opposition is not tolerated, and opposition
 political parties are illegal. The BSPP is used to mobilize
 popular support behind decisions of the leadership rather than
 as a vehicle to express the individual or group opinions of
 the members. The party chooses a single slate of candidates
 for government offices. Although party nominees run
 unopposed, they must receive 50 percent of the vote to be
 elected. In party and governmental decisionmaking assemblies,
 votes are almost always unanimous.
 
 
 669
 BUR MA
 Party candidates generally win elections at state and division
 levels. But at the township levels and below, several
 thousand party candidates have not been elected recently, and
 many who were elected barely met the 50 percent vote
 requirement. If the electorate refuses party candidates three
 times, party candidates from outside the district are brought
 in. However, when such plans are announced, the township
 usually opts for local party candidates over outsiders.
 Under the 1982 citizenship law, ethnic Burmese, including
 indigenous minorities, enjoy advantages that are not available
 to immigrants and their immediate descendants. The law
 significantly limits the political rights of immigrants
 (primarily ethnic Chinese and Indians) whose parents or
 grandparents are not citizens. Full citizenship is conferred
 only on those whose ancestors lived in Burma prior to the
 first Anglo-Burman war in 1824.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Burmese Government does not permit investigations of its
 human rights practices, nor is it willing to discuss human
 rights problems with outside governmental or nongovernmental
 organizations. The Government has permitted visits by U.N.
 organizations such as the ILO and the Office of the United
 Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to discuss a few
 specific issues. No Burmese organization, governmental or
 private, monitors the human rights situation in Burma, nor
 does Burma actively participate in international or regional
 human rights bodies.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion
 Language, or Social Status
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities have their own distinct
 cultures and languages, and many of the minority groups have
 historically resisted assimilation. Economic development
 among minorities has lagged, and many still live at the
 subsistence level. This is due in part to geographic factors
 which impede economic development in rugged, isolated ethnic
 minority-populated border areas. Burma's chronic
 insurgencies, many of which are based on ethnic minority
 groups' perceptions of Burman dominance of the country at the
 expense of the minorities, also play a large role in lagging
 economic development. Minorities are underrepresented in the
 BSPP and Government, are largely excluded from the military
 leadership, and sometimes suffer other forms of
 discrimination. Persons of nonethnic Burmese ancestry,
 primarily Indians and Chinese, while denied full citizenship
 status and excluded from party or government positions,
 continue to play an important role in the economy.
 Women in Burma have distinct social roles, which vary with
 their cultural traditions and ethnic backgrounds. In general,
 Burmese women enjoy most of the same legal rights as men.
 They keep their own names after marriage, are active in trade,
 and eften control family finances. There are few women in the
 senior ranks of government service, although younger women are
 entering universities and the civil service in increasingly
 large numbers.
 
 
 670
 BURMA
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Burma is continuing to revise and update its labor laws. At
 present .the minimum age for workers is 15. There is a 5-day,
 35-hour workweek for employees in the public sector and a
 6-day, 44-hour workweek for private and parastate sector
 employees, with .overtime pay for additional work. Workers
 have 21 paid holidays a year, and there are numerous legal
 provisions to protect workers' health and safety. The minimum
 legal wage is about 75 cents per day. In the private sector
 the minimum wage law applies only to cheroot-rolling plants
 and rice mills. The gap between legal provisions and actual
 conditions can vary widely, with government entities and
 government corporate enterprises coming closest to the legal
 standards. The Law Commission of the National Assembly has
 under consideration legislation boncerning ILO Conventions 17
 (workers' compensation) and 52 (hours of work). Because the
 Commission has a large backlog of work, it is not expected to
 consider this legislation or send it on to the Assembly any
 time soon.
