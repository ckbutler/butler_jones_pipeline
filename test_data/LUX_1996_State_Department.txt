 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary form
 of government. The role of the Grand Duke is mainly ceremomal and administra-
 tive. The Prime Minister is the leader of the dominant party in the popularly elected
 Parliament. The Council of State, whose members are appointed by the Grand
 Duke, serves as an advisory body to the Parliament. The judiciary is independent.
 The Government effectively controls the security apparatus, which consists of po-
 lice and gendarmerie.
 Luxembourg has a prosperous market economy with active industrial and service
 sectors. The standard of living and level of social benefits are high.
 The Constitution and laws provide for the full range of human rights, and the
 Government respects these rights in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-Thiere were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. The Government per-
 mits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 The law stipulates that judicial warrants are required for arrests except in cases
 of hot pursuit. Within 24 hours of arrest the police must lodge charges and bring
 suspects before a judge. Suspects are not held incommunicado. They are given im-
 mediate access to an attorney, at government expense for indigents. The presiding
 judge may order release on bail.
 Exile is never imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial--The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides

 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. The independent judiciary is head-
 ed by the Supreme Court, -whose members are appointe7 by the Grand Duke. De-
 fendants are presumed innocent. They have the right to public trial and are free
 to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence. Either the defendant or the
 prosecutor can appeal a ruling; appeal results in a completely new judicial proce-
 dure, with the possibility that a sentence may be increase or ecreased.
 In response to a 1995 decision by the European Court of Human Rights the Gov-
 ernment passed legislation establishing an administrative court system. The Euro-
 pean Court had held that Luxembourg's Council of State could no longer serve as
 both a legislative advisory body, a pproving all legislation enacted, and as an admin-
 istrative court, reviewing citizen challenges to that legislation. The dual role of the
 Council of State was seen by the Court as a violation of the right to a fair trial.
 The new administrative courts were to begin fmctioning on January 1, 1997.
 There were no reports of political prisners.
 f. Arbitrary Interfence With Pvacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and
 press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Print media are pri-
 vately owned. The privately owned national radio and television company has exclu-
 sive television broadcasting rights within the country. A permit system allows estab-
 lishment of other private radio stations. Radio and television broadcasts from neigh-
 boring countries are freely available.
 Academic freedom is fully respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is no state religion, but the State
 ys the salaries of Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish clergy, and several
 ocal governments maintain sectarian religious facilities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 m ractice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. A new law estab-
 lishes proedures for granting the right of asylum in conformity with procedures in
 other European Union countries. The Government provides first asylum and grant-
 ed it to three persons in 1996. The Government also continued to alow about 1,800.
 persons from the former Yugoslavia to remain in protected status on humanitarian
 grounds. The Government does not expel those having a valid claim to refugee sta-
 tus; there were no reports during the year of the forced return of persons to coun-
 tries where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Luxembourg is a multiparty democracy. Suffrage is universal for citizens ages 18
 and above, and balloting is secret. National parliamentary elections are held every
 a years.
 women are active in political life. Of 60 Members of Parliament, 11 are women,
 as are 3 members of the Cabinet. The mayors of several major municipalities, in-
 cluding the capital, are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction. Government offi-
 cials are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits racial, sexual, or social discrimination, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions. Blatant societal discrimination occurs only rarely.
 Women.-Neither society nor the Government is tolerant of violence against
 women, and the Government prosecutes persons accused of such. The Government
 funds organizations providing shelter, counseling, and hot lines. The main shelter
 provides refuge to about 65 abused women per year, many with their children, and
 responds to between 40 and 45 telephone calls per day. bout 150 to 200Dcases of
 sexual abuse occur in an average year.

 Women enjoy the same property rights as men. In the absence of a prenuptial
 agreement, property is divided equally upon dissolution of a marriage.
 T1he law mandates equal y or equal work. To date there have been no work-
 related discrimination suits. Women constitute 36.2 percent of the work force (1995
 data). The Ministry for the Promotion of Women has a mandate to encourage a cli-
 mate of equal treatment and opportunity in fact aswell, as in law. The Ministry has
 initiated a preschool educaton project on gender issues, a secondary school
 mentoring project for girls, and a study of the image of women in the media.
 Chldren.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care, which are available equally to girls and boys. Education law mandates school
 attendane from ages 4 to 16. Schoo ling is free through the secondary level, and the
 Government provides some financial assitance for postsecndary education.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children. Child abuse does
 not appear to be widespread, and laws against child abuse are enforced. An organi-
 zation for the prevention of child abuse estimates that there are about 300 new
 cases a year. Several organizations provide counseling and telephone hot line serv-
 ices to abused children and their families. The Government began a campaign in
 the schools to educate children about sexual abuse. A new shelter for girls who are
 victims of sexual abuse is scheduled to open in January 1997.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law does not
 directly mandate accessibility for the disabled, but the Government pays subsidies
 to builders to construct "disabled-friendly" structures. Despite government incen-
 tives, only a modest proportion of buildings and public transportation have been
 modified to accommodate people with disabilities.
 The Government helps diisabled persons obtain employment and professional edu-
 cation. By law, businesses and enterprises with at least 25 employees must fill a
 quota for hiring disabled workers and must pay them prevailing wages. The quota
 is fixed according to the total number of employees, and employers who do not fulfill
 them are subject to sizable monthly fines. There have been no known complaints
 of noncompliance.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although foreigners constitute over 30 per-
 cent of the total population, antiforeigner incidents remain infrequent. The Govern-
 ment granted to citizens of European Union countries who reside in Luxembourg
 the rigKnt to vote and run in municipal elections. Minimum residency requirements
 are 6 years for voters and 12 years, including 6 months residence in the commune,
 for candidates to run for town councils. The Government also formed a commission
 to initiate projects against racism in conjunction with the European Year Against
 Racism.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the right to associate freely and
 choose their representatives. About 65 percent of the labor force is unionized. Mem-
 bership is not mandatory. Unions operate free of governmental interference. The
 two largest labor federations are linked to, but organized independently of, major
 political parties. The law prohibits discrimination against strike leaders, and a labor
 tribunal deals with complaints.
 The Constitution provides all workers with the right to strike except for govern-
 ment workers such as police, armed forces, and hospital personnel providing essen-
 tial services. Legal strikes may occur only after a lengthy conciliation procedure be-
 tween the parties; the Governmentes National Conciliation Office must certify that
 conciliation efforts have ended for a strike to be legal. There were no legal strikes
 during the year, and there have been no illegal strikes since 1979.
 Unions maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for and pro-
 tects collective bargaining, which is conducted in periodic negotiations between cen-
 tralized organizations of unions and employers. Enterprises having 15 or more em-
 ployees must have worker representatives to conduct collective bargaining. Enter-
 prises with over 150 employees must form joint works councils composed of equal
 numbers of management and employee representatives. In enterprises with more
 than 1,000 employees, one-third of the membership of the supervisory boards of di-
 rectors must be employees' representatives.
 The law provides for adjudication of employmnt-related complaints and author-
 izes labor tribunals to deal with them. A tribunal can impose a fine on an employer
 found guilty of antiunion discrimination, but it cannot require the employer to rein-
 state a worker fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and neither occurs.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chi/dren.-The law prohibits employment of
 children under age 15 and requires children to remain in school until age 16. Ap-
 prentices who are 15 or 16 years old must attend school in addition to their job
 training. Adolescent workers under age 18 have additional legal protection, includ-
 ing limits on overtime and the number of hours that can be woriked continuously.
 The Ministries of Labor and Education effectively monitor the enforcement of child
 labor and education laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law provides for minimum wage rates at
 levels that vary according to the worker's age and number of dependents. The mini-
 mum for a single worker over age 18 is approximately $8.29 (Lux F 253) per hour.
 Supporting a family is difficult on the minium wage, but most employees earn
 more than the minimum.
 National legislation mandates a workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required
 for overtime or unusual hours. Employment on Sunday is permitted in continuous-
 process industries (steel, glass, and chemicals), and for certain maintenance and se-
 curity personnel; other industries have requested permission for Sunday work,
 which the Government has granted on a case-by-case basis. Work on Sunday, al-
 lowed for some retail employees, must be entirely voluntary and compensated at
 double the normal wage; and employees must be given compensatory time off on an-
 other day, equal to the number of hours worked on Sunday. The law requires rest
 breaks for s    workers and limits all workers to a maximum of 10 hours per day
 including overtime. All workers receive at least 5 weeks of paid vacation yearly, in
 addition to paid holidays.
 The law mandates a safe working environment. An inspection system provides se-
 vere penalties for infractions. The Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor, and
 the Accident Insurance Agency of the Social Security Ministry, carry out their in-
 spections effectively.
 No laws or regulations specifically guarantee workers the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment,
 but every worker has the right to ask the Labor Inspectorate to make a determina-
 tion, and the Inspectorate usually does so expeditiously.
