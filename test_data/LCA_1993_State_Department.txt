 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. For almost three decades (except for a hiatus between 1979-
 82), the Government has been led by Prime Minister John Compton, whose United
 Workers Party (UWP) first came to power in 1964. His party defeated the main op-
 position St. Lucia Labour Party in 1987 and again in April 1992. The UWP cur-
 rently holds 11 seats in the 17-member House of Assembly.
 The Royal St. Lucia Police, which is the only security force in the country, in-
 cludes a small Special Services Unit with some paramilitary training and a coast
 guard unit. The police are controlled by and responsive to elected government offi-
 cials. Although the police have traditionally demonstrated a high degree of respect
 for human rights, in 1993 there were a few instances of alleged physical abuse by
 police and prison officials.
 The economy is largely based on the export of bananas, which also represent the
 principal source of foreign exchange earnings. To offset overdependence on this
 source, St. Lucia diversified into other types of agriculture, tourism, and, more re-
 cently, into light manufacturing and construction. Economic performance in all sec-
 tors was relatively strong during 1993. Unemployment, unofficially estimated as
 high as 20 percent, remains a source of potential instability.
 Most human rights were respected during 1993, but there continued to be some
 reports of police abuse of prisoners and detainees. Violence against women remained
 a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political or other extrajudicial killings in 1993.
 In August 1992, a Dominica-born prison officer in the capital city of Castries shot
 dead an inmate serving a 20-year jail term for rape, then was himself found dead
 in an apparent suicide. The prison officer had intervened in an altercation between
 two inmates and was attacked by one of the prisoners. The officer left the prison,
 returned with his personal firearm, and shot the prisoner who assaulted him. The
 matter was to be considered by an official commission of inquest in late 1993 or
 early 1994.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances or politically moti-
 vated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.--
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and no such incidents were reported.
 However, there has been an increase in the number of convictions based on confes-
 sions in St. Lucia in recent years, which may reflect an effort to force confessions
 in lieu of other investigative approaches. There were occasional credible allegations
 of physical abuse of prisoners by law enforcement officials prior to and during incar-
 ceration. In one incident, a former St. Lucian government minister accused police
 
 
 546
 of beating his two sons at a public event in September 1992 and filed a civil suit
 against the officer allegedly involved. At year's end, this matter was before the
 court.
 In July police investigated allegations by a 14-year-old girl that she was raped
 by policemen in a police station in the northern part of the island. The girl had been
 picked up twice before for loitering but was not being detained on charges at the
 time of the incident. On October 7, paramilitary policemen (Special Services Unit)
 shot dead two farmers during a scuffle to clear a blockade farmers had erected on
 the road to protest low banana prices. Responsibility for this incident was still being
 investigated as of year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government adheres to the constitu-
 tional provisions prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a court
 hearing within 72 hours after detention. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest
 or other forms of extralegal detention, or of forced exile in 1993.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution requires public trials before an
 independent and impartial court and, in cases involving capital punishment, the
 provision of legal counsel for those who cannot afford a defense attorney. Criminal
 defendants are entitled to select their own legal counsel, are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty, and have the right of appeal. Both constitutional and statutory
 requirements for fair public trials are followed. The regional West Indies Court of
 Appeal, a circuit court long noted for its impartiality, serves as St. Lucia's Appeals
 Court. The Privy Council in the United Kingdom serves as the ultimate court of ap-
 peal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private lives of individ-
 ual citizens. Authorities consistently observed constitutional prohibitions against ar-
 bitrary search, seizure, and entry.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Constitutional provisions for free speech and
 press are respected in practice. The Government neither interferes with the oper-
 ations of the press nor censors the content of the three privately owned major news-
 papers, which cover the spectrum of political opinion and are often highly critical
 of the Government. The one local television station is also privately owned and cov-
 ers a wide range of views. In addition, viewers may receive cable television service
 which provides broadcasting from a variety of sources. Radio St. Lucia is govern-
 ment owned and operated, but the programming staff has been allowed a large
 measure of autonomy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of association and of
 assembly are provided for by the Constitution. Permits for public meetings and dem-
 onstrations are necessary if meetings are to be held in public places such as streets,
 sidewalks, or parks. Permits are routinely granted. When permits are denied, it is
 normally because the police are concerned with the number and location of dem-
 onstrators and the number of police available who are trained in crowd control. Re-
 fusal to issue a permit is rare and generally stems from the failure of the organizers
 to request a permit in a timely manner, normally defined as a 48-hour notice.
 In 1991 and 1992, the opposition St. Lucia Labour Party objected strongly to de-
 nial of marching permits on a few occasions by the Police Commissioner. The party
 occasionally disregarded the decision and held its demonstration anyway. There was
 a similar incident in November when the opposition party planned a march in sup-
 port of protesting banana farmers but was denied a permit by the Police Commis-
 sioner.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The majority of the population is Roman Catholic. Other
 denominations are free to maintain places of worship, train clergy, establish reli-
 gious schools, and engage in the full range of activities normally associated with re-
 ligious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -These rights are provided for in the Constitution and honored in prac-
 tice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 St. Lucia's parliaments  s stem provides for genuine choices among parties, poli-
 cies, and officials. Althou  tere are two main parties, several other political orga-
 nizations also participate in free elections, which are held at least every 5 years by
 secret ballot. The opposition St. Lucia Labour Party plays a significant role in the
 country's political life and holds 6 out of the 17 seats in the House of Assembly.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no local human rights groups in St. Lucia, there are no govern-
 ment restrictions which would impede their establishment. International human
 rights organizations filed no reports or requests for investigations in 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Government policy is basically nondiscriminatory in the areas of housing, jobs,
 education, and advancement opportunities. There are no legal restrictions on the
 role of women or minorities.
 Women.-General awareness of the problem of violence against women has in-
 creased. Sexual harassment and battering are included as curriculum topics in some
 secondary schools. The police force asked for help in conducting a workshop for offi-
 cers reponsible for investigating rape and other crimes against women. Police and
 courts enforce laws to protect women against abuse, although police generally tend
 to be reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes. Lack of statistical data and pos-
 sible reluctance on the part of some victims to report cases of domestic violence or
 to press charges make it difficult to gauge its true extent.
 The St. Lucia Crisis Center monitors abuses (physical, mental, and emotional),
 and deals with such issues as incest, nonpaymentf child support alcohol and drug
 abuse, homelessness, custody,and visitation rights. The group publicized the plight
 of battered women and has protested the deaths of women who were victims of do-
 mestic violence. Extreme cases of this sort are not common. The Crisis Center is
 also working to establish a shelter for battered women and homeless girls.
 The Women's Affairs Division of the Ministry of Community Development and So-
 cial Affairs has responsibility for governmentplicy in this area. Its objectives in-
 clude protecting rights of women in domestic violence cases, ensuring-in compli-
 ance with U.N. conventions--that no discrimination takes place against women, and
 guaranteeing equal treatment in employment and overall equal status with men.
 The Division is also pursuing implementation of the National Policy Statement on
 Women adopted by Parliament in March 1991. In 1993 other activities included the
 establishment of an income-generating project for unemployed women and an AIDS
 treining workshop.
 Children.-A Children's Rights Act was passed in 1992 which details the Govern-
 ment's generally strong commitment to children's rights and welfare. However, the
 Government lacks the resources, organization, and skills needed to effect much posi-
 tive change in this area. The problems most affecting the welfare of children in St.
 Lucia are domestic violence and incest.
 People with Disabilities.-Awareness of the rights of the disabled has risen in re-
 cent years, but representatives of the National Council for the Disabled say that
 public education should be increased. There is no specific legislation protecting the
 rights of disabled, but the Council is pressing for development of a bill that would
 increase educational opportunities and guarantee access to public facilities for dis-
 abled people. There is no rehabilitation facility in St. Lucia, although the Ministry
 of Health operates a community-based rehabilitation program in people's homes.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies the right of workers to
 form or belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right of association.
 Unions are independent of the Government and are free to choose their own rep-
 resentatives. Union elections are often vigorously contested. All unions are free to
 publicize their views and choose policies to advance their members' interests. There
 is no restriction on forming a national labor federation, and several of the major
 unions in St. Lucia have joined together to form an umbrella grouping called the
 "Industrial Solidarity Pact." Unions are free to affiliate with international organiza-
 tions, and some have done so.
 Strikes in both public and private sectors are legal if efforts by the Government
 to resolve disputes fail. Strikes, as well as slowdowns and total work stoppages, do
 occur from time to time. In 1992, there were disputes between two unions over rep-
 resentation in the electricity company, Lucelec, and in some hotels. The industrial
 disputes were resolved after the Labour Ministry conducted polls of employees to
 determine which union had collective bargaining r:-hts. Because St. Lucia does not
 have trade union recognition legislation, the polls were done based on past practice
 rather than on local labor law.
 Banana farmers staged a violent pretest strike in October over what they consid-
 ered to be inadequate prices. Their dispute was with the St. Lucia Banana Growers'
 Association and the St. Lucia Government, however, and was not over labor issues.

 In November employees at St. Lucia's state owned radio station went on strike fol-
 lowing the firing of general manager Alva Clarke. Clarke was fired following the
 station's airing of a controversial radio call-in show during the banana strike that
 contained violently antigovernment comments--one caller advocated killing the
 Prime Minister-that were seen as a breach of acceptable norms of free speech, even
 in a live on-the-air program. However, striking employees were unhappy not so
 much with Clarke's firing as with general working conditions and what they consid-
 ered outdated promotion and personnel management procedures. After I week, the
 station went back on the air after Prime Minister Compton intervened in his posi-
 tion as Minister of Information and promised that worker demands would be ad-
 dressed.
 A second strike was staged in November by employees of the public water and
 sewage authority. Employees were protesting inadequate severance pay and retire-
 ment benefits. Again, the Prime Minister intervened, promising that the employees'
 concerns would be addressed, and work resumed after 4 days.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-Unions have the legal right
 to engage in collective bargaining and fully exercise that right. The majority of wage
 and salary earners belong to unions. During 1989 the Government negatiateda 6-
 year wage agreement with six unions representing public servants, resulting in un-
 usually harmonious government-labor relations. In the private sector, some compa-
 nies offer packages of benefits with terms of employment better than, or comparable
 to, what a union can obtain through nefotiation. This is especially true in export
 processing or industrial free zones (EPZs). Antiunion discrimination Iho employers
 is prohibited by law, and there are effective mechanisms for resolving cornplaints.
 Workers fired for union activities must be reinstated. Union organizing andcollec-
 tive bargaining are neither legally nor administratively discouraged in the EPZ's.
 Although labor law is applicable in the EPZ's, in practice many firms do not wel-
 come union efforts to organize in the EPZ's. Some of these firms are under foreign
 management and employ a young, female labor force at relatively low wages.
 Occasionallya persistent union is successful in winning a poll in an EPZ, in which
 case labor law applies to collective bargaining agreements in that company.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 14 years as stipulated by the Women and Young Persons Act. The law is enforced
 effectively by Labour Ministry officials.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-St. Lucia has legislated minimum wage rates
 for certain occupations only, set by the Wages Regulations (Clerks) Orders, effective
 since February 1985. Basic office workers receive a legislated minimum wage rate
 of about $300 (EC$800) per month. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family, but almost all categories of
 workers are paid much more than the legislative minimum for clerks, which is used
 only as a guide for other professions.
 Tiere is no legislated maximum workweek, although common practice is 40 hours
 in 5 days. Shop assistants, agricultural laborers, domestics, and young persons in
 industrial establishments have special legislation for hours.
 Occupational health and safety regulations are relatively well developed. The
 Labor Ministry periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places of em-
 ployment under the Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1985. The Act
 is enforced through throat of closure of business if violations are discovered and not
 corrected.
