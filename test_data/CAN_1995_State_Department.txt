 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal parliamentary form of govern-
 ment and an independent judiciary. Citizens periodically choose their representa-
 tives in free and fair multiparty elections.
 Elected civilian officials control the federal, provincial, and municipal police
 forces. The armed forces have no role in domestic law enforcement except in na-
 tional emergencies. Laws requiring the security forces to respect human rights are
 strictly observed, and violators are punished by the courts.
 Canada has a highly developed, market-based economic system. Laws extensively
 protect the well-being of workers and provide for workers' freedom of association.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 there were occasional complaints in some areas, primarily regarding discrimination
 against aboriginals, the disabled, and women. The Constitution and laws provide
 avenues for legal redress of such complaints. The Government and private organiza-
 tions seek to ensure that human rights are respected in practice at all levels of soci-
 ety and take steps to convict and punish human rights abusers. The Government
 has taken serious and active steps to address violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 A civilian inquiry is continuing into the activities of a now disbanded regiment
 during its 1993 peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Several soldiers from this regi-
 ment were found guilty in 1995 of various charges in the 1993 killing of a Somali
 teenager in Canadian military custody.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices. However, there were isolated reports of excessive
 use of force by police. In July a Montreal jury convicted four of five police officers
 for the December 1993 beating of taxi driver Richard Barnabe. The presiding judge
 imposed jail terms of 60 to 90 days, to be served on weekends, on three of the offi-
 crs. The fourth officer received a suspended sentence and was ordered to perform
 180 hours of community service. Media and human rights groups criticized the sen-
 tences as too lenient.
 Prison conditions meet international standards, and the Government permits vis-
 its by human rights monitors. A Federal Inquiry Commission is investigating com-
 plaints by six female inmates that they were shackled and stripped by a male riot
 
 
 815
 squad during the course of a riot and attempted escape in an Ontario women's pris-
 on in 1994.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process and vigorously enforces the right to
 a fair trial.
 The court system is divided into federal and provincial courts, which handle both
 civil and criminal matters. The highest federal court is the Supreme Court, which
 exercises general appellate jurisdiction and advises on constitutional matters. The
 judicial system is based on English common law at the federal level as well as in
 most provinces; in the province of Quebec, it is based on the Napoleonic Code.
 Throughout Canada, judges are appointed. In criminal trials, the law provides for
 a presumption of the defendant's innocence and the right to a public trial, to counsel
 (free for indigents), and to appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f, Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and of
 the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent
 press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 Journalists are occasionally banned from reporting some specific details of court
 cases until a trial is concluded, and these restrictions, adopted to ensure the defend-
 ant a right to a fair trial, enjoy wide popular support. Some restrictions on the
 media are imposed by provincial-level film censorship, broadcasters' voluntary codes
 curbing graphic violence, and laws against hate literature and pornography. The Ca-
 nadian Human Rights Act prohibits repeated communications by telephone that ex-
 pose a person or group to hatred or contempt. Human rights groups are exploring
 the possibility of extending this prohibition to the Internet.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 m practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The official opposition in Parliament and the provincial government both support
 sovereignty for Quebec. A referendum on the question of Quebec's relations with
 Canada, postulating Quebec sovereignty combined with a substantially revised eco-
 nomic and political relationship to Canada, was narrowly rejected in Quebec on Oc-
 tober 30.
 All citizens have equal political rights, and these rights are respected in practice.
 There are no impediments to participation by women, minorities, or aboriginals at
 any level in politics or government. Women have headed major political parties and
 served as Prime Minister and Governor General. Although aboriginals are usually
 consulted on decisions affecting their interests, many bands continue to press the
 Government to grant them more autonomy.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are very cooperative and responsive to their views.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides for equal benefits and protection
 of the law regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age, or
 mental or physical disability. These rights are generally respected in practice, but
 there are occasional charges of discrimination reflecting Canada's multicultural soci-
 tYne new Ontario provincial government elected in June pledged to repeal employ-
 ment equity (affiriative action) legislation introduced in 1994. The Ontario Premier
 said that the current legislation would be replaced by new regulations emphasizing
 equality of opportunity.
 he Constitution protects the linguistic and cultural rights of minorities. Laws in
 the province of Quebec stipulate that French is the working language of most busi-
 nesses and require most children to receive publicly funded education in French.
 Despite Canada's policy of bilingualism, English speakers in Quebec and French
 speakers in other parts of Canada must generally live and work in the language
 of the majority. In Quebec, language laws restrict access to English-language public
 schooling to those whose parents were educated in English in Canada and to short-
 term residents. Despite the latter exception, the step-child of a short-term resident
 foreign businessman required a Ministerial-level ' humanitarian" decision to permit
 attendance at an English-lanuage public school because the child was neither the
 biological nor adopted child of the businessman. Other provinces often lack adequate
 French-language schooling, which is of concern to local Francophones, although
 French-language schools are reported to be thriving in all three prairie provinces.
 Women.-Canadian law prohibits violence against women, including spousal
 abuse. Statistics Canada reported that one-half of all women have experienced at
 least one incident of violence by a male since the age of 16. According to a 1995
 government report, more than 200,000 women have been sexually abused by their
 husbands or common-law partners in the past year. In 1993 acquaintances or rel-
 atives were responsible for 72 percent of the violent attacks committed against
 women, compared with 37 percent of violent attacks against men.
 A bill amending the criminal code to eliminate extreme drunkenness as a valid
 defense became law in July. The bill was stimulated by a Supreme Court ruling that
 a Montreal man could use intoxication as a defense against a sexual assault charge.
 Prior to the United Nations Conference on Women, Status of Women Canada (a
 federal agency created in 1976 to coordinate government policy on issues affecting
 women) issued a federal plan for gender equality. This plan identified eight key ob-
 jectives for improving the status of women, including the implementation of gender-
 based analysis in the Federal Government, improving women's economic situation,
 and reducing violence in society, particularly against women and children.
 Women are well represented in the labor force, including business and the profes-
 sions. The law prohibits sexual harassment, and the Government respects this pro-
 vision. Statistics Canada reported that women as of 1993 represented 42 percent of
 managers and administrators, 56 percent of managers in social science and religion,
 and 18 percent of managers in the fields of natural sciences, engineering and mathe-
 matics. In the federal plan for gender equality, Status of Women Canada stated that
 women are underrepresented in senior management and overrepresented in clerical
 and service jobs. A 1993 study released in August showed that women earned an
 average of 72 cents for each dollar earned by men, an increase of 4 cents over 1990
 fin March 1,700 female public servants-primarily nurses, dieticians, and occupa-
 tional therapists-won more than $55.5 million (74 million Canadian dollars) in
 back pay and salary increases in an out-of-court pay equity settlement.
 Women enjoy marriage and property rights equal to those of men. The Supreme
 Court of Canada ruled m May that it is not discriminatory to require custodial par-
 ents (usually mothers) to pay income tax on child support while permitting
 noncustodial parents (usually fathers) to deduct these payments from taxable in-
 come. The court argued that the regulation did not discriminate against women, but
 human rights groups disagreed and criticized the court's decision.
 In June four aboriginal women were awarded damages after the Canadian
 Human Rights Commission (CHRC) determined native bands had discriminated
 against them 10 years ago, when the women regained their aboriginal status under
 changes to the Indian Act. The changes to the Act had entitled women who married
 white men to receive the same benefits as all other officially recognized aboiginals.
 Children.-eThe Government demonstrates its strong cmmitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Federal andprovincial regulations protect children from abuse, overwork, and
 discrimination and duly penalize perpetrators of such offenses. There is no pattern
 
 
 817
 of societal abuse of children. A private member's bill calling for punishments of up
 to 5 years for performing female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely con-
 demned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psycho-
 logical health, passed its second reading in the House of Commons in October and
 was then forwarded to the Justice Committee. The Minister of Justice argued that
 the Act is already covered by the Criminal Code under assault causing bodily harm.
 The Quebec Human Rights Commission warned that it will vigorously prosecute
 parents and doctors who subject girls to FGM. In 1994 a Montreal doctor said a
 dozen or more such operations are performed in that city each year.
 People With Disabiities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law man-
 dates access to buildings for people with disabilities, and for the most part the Gov-
 ernment enforces these provisions. However, human rights groups report that a
 large percentage of their complaints come from- those with disabilities. Disabled per-
 sons are underrepresented in the work force; for example, they comprise 2.6 percent
 of the federally regulated private sector work force, but those capable of working
 total 6.5 percent of the population.
 A survey conducted for the CHRC showed that only 2 of 29 automated teller ma-
 chines surveyed were accessible to people in wheelchairs. Access to such machines
 for the visually impaired showed slight improvement over the last 3 years. Another
 CHRC study criticized the Federal Government for not providing government publi-
 cations in alternate formats, such as Braille and large print, for the visually im-
 paired.
 Indigenous People.-Canada's treatment of its native peoples continued to be one
 of the most important human rights issues facing the country. Disputes over land
 claims, self-government, treaty rights, taxation, duty-free imports, fishing and hunt-
 ing rights, and alleged harassmenL by police continued to be sources of tension on
 reserves.
 Aboriginals remained underrepresented in the work force, overrepresented on wel-
 fare rolls, and more susceptible to suicide and poverty than other population groups.
 In February, prompted by a rash of suicides on a reservation, a government panel
 in Nova Scotia released a report warning that the suicide problem among native
 youths will worsen unless the Federal Government initiates a national campaign to
 address the problem. In a step towards aboriginal self-government, the Federal Min-
 istry of Indian and Northern Affairs signed a framework agreement with the First
 Nations of Manitoba at the end of 1994. The agreement calls for the transfer of the
 Department's regional operations to the First Nations. In New Brunswick, the Eel
 river First Nation protested fishing restrictions and in June and July set up block-
 ades on the river. The impasse was resolved when government officials agreed to
 modify the existing agreement.
 The British Columbia Treaty Commission is dealing with statements of intent
 from 43 First Nations to negotiate treaties. The treaty negotiations are expected to
 provide aboriginals with cash compensation or title to lands claimed by natives, a
 share in fishing and forestry revenues from those lands, and new powers for First
 Nation governments. In its second annual report, the Commission noted that "the
 status quo is unacceptable. The issues have been unresolved for over 140 years. The
 Commissioners firmly believe that the only viable solution is for the parties to come
 to the table and negotiate settlements." This result may be difficult to achieve, how-
 ever, since to date the federal and provincial governments have been unable to
 agree on the details of a cost-sharing arrangement, resulting in a stalemate in trea-
 ty negotiations.
 In Quebec, the Cree Nation strongly objected to the referendum on Quebec sov-
 ereignty, stating that the referendum was illegal and an affront to their rights. The
 Cree held a separate referendum rejecting Quebec sovereignty.
 The Royal Aboriginal Commission, established in 1991, continued hearings to ex-
 amine aboriginal concerns. The Commission is expected to publish a final report and
 recommendations by early 1996.
 In September police killed one person during a clash at Ipperwash with an armed
 aboriginal group (see Section l.a.). The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern De-
 velopment then appointed a representative to investigate the overall situation at
 Ipperwash, including land claims, and make recommendations.
 Religious Minorities.-Religious minorities are protected by law and are generally
 free from discrimination in practice.
 In March the B'nai Brith League for Human Rights reported the highest level of
 incidents of anti-Semitic harassment and vandalism in 13 years of monitoring. Such
 incidents increased to 290 from 256 the previous year. In Toronto hate messages
 were mailed to Jewish leaders and organizations, hate literature was left on vehicles
 
 
 818
 parked outside a Kitchener theater during a showing of "Schindler's List," and cars
 in Jewish neighborhoods were smeared with swastikas.
 The Quebec Human Rights Commission in February said that dress codes in-
 tended to ban the wearing of the hijab, an Islamic scarl in public schools are dis-
 criminatory.
 National RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Discrimination is prohibited by federal law
 and violators are prosecuted. Nevertheless, there were isolated incidents of racist-
 ins re d discrimination and violence.
 in June a Nova Scotia provincial government report concluded that black Nova
 Scotians have been educationally marginalized over the past 200 years. Accordingly,
 the Government has thus far adopted 42 of the reports 46 recommendations that
 focused on improving education services for blacks.
 On October 30, the Quebec sovereignty referendum secured a majority of the
 French speaking electorate's votes but was defeated by overwhelming opposition
 from non-French speakers combined with a minority of French speakers. The excep-
 tionally narrow defeat (49.4 percent vs. 50.6 percent) produced some mutual recrimi-
 nation and polarization between the two groups throughout the country as well as
 in Quebec. A referendum night statement by Quebec leader Parizeau, blaming the
 defeat on "money and the ethnic vote" has accentuated concerns of non-French
 speakers. Parizeaus remarks were widely criticized by French speakers and were
 associated with his decision to resign. Mainstream leaders have expressed concern
 over the disruptive and divisive potential of recently publicized organizations with
 radical or even terrorist agendas on both ends of the separatist-federal spectrum.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for members of the armed forces, workers in
 both the public and private sectors have the right to associate freely. The Labor
 Code protects these rights for all employees under federal jurisdiction, while provin-
 cial legislation protects all other organized workers.
 Trade unions are independent of the Government. They are free to affiliate with
 international organizations. Of the civilian labor force, 29.2 percent is unionized.
 All workers have the right to strike, except those in the public sector providing
 essential services.
 In the first 7 months of 1995, there were a total of 245 work stoppages, 18 of
 which were illegal. As of July, there were 115 unresolved labor disputes; the re-
 mainder were settled through direct bargaining, mediation, or (as in the case of rail-
 way workers and west coast longshoremen) by government back-to-work orders.
 The law probibits employer retribution against strikers and union leaders, and
 the Government enforces this provision.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers in both the public
 (except for some police) and the private sector have the right to organize and bar-
 gain collective. While the law protects collective bargaining, for some public sector
 workers providing essential services there are limitations, which vary from province
 to province.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination and requires employers to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities. There are effective mechanisms for resolving com-
 plaints and obtaining redress.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial sys-
 tem.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is illegal, and there
 were no known violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor legislation varies from
 province to province. The Federal Government does not employ youths under 17
 years of age while school is in session. Most provinces prohibit those under age 15
 or 16 from working without parental consent, or at night, or in any hazardous em-
 ployment. These prohibitions are effectively enforced through inspections conducted
 by the federal and provincial Labor Ministries. The statutory school-leaving age in
 all provinces is 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The federal minimum wage, established by
 ministerial order and enforced by the Ministry of Human Resources Development,
 applies to employees in industries under federal jurisdiction (less than 10 percent
 ofthe total work force). Since 1986 it has remained at $2.99 (4.00 Canadian dollars).
 In all provinces, the minimum wage is higher than the federal minimum. Although
 it is common practice among most federa jurisdiction employers to use the provin-
 cial/territorial rates, the Government announced in September plans to align the
 federal rate with the provincial/territorial minimum wage for workers over 18 by
 mid-1996. For youths and students, Ontario, Alberta, an the Northwest Territories
 
 
 have a minimum wage lower than the respective standard minimum. A family
 whose only employed member earns the minimum wage would be considered below
 the poverty line.
 Standard workhours vary from province to province, but in all the limit is 40 or
 48 a week, with at least 24 hours of rest.
 Federal law provides safety and health standards for employees under federal ju-
 risdiction, while provincial and territorial legislation provide for all other employees.
 Federal and provincial labor departments monitor and enforce these standards. Fed-
 eral, provincial, and territorial laws protect the right of workers with "reasonable
 cause -to refuse dangerous work.
