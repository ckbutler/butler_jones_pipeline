 CAPE VERDE
 Following the free elections of 1991 and the constitutional revision of 1992, Cape
 Verde continued its efforts to strengthen democratic institutions in 1993. Dr. Anto-
 nio Mascarenhas Monteiro, an independent remained as President, sharing con-
 stitutional powers with the Prime Minister, br. Carlos Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga,
 and his party, the Movement for Democracy (MPD), which controlled the National
 Assembly.
 A new police force, which has been separated from the military, has primary re-
 sponsibility for maintenance of law and order It is controlled by, and responsive to,
 civilian governmental authority. There were no reported human rights abuses by se-
 curity forces.
 Cape Verde has few exploitable natural resources except for an attractive climate,
 a hardworking population (350,000), and a strategic geographic position. Cape
 Verdeans have a long history of economically driven emigration, primarily to West-
 ern Europe and the United States, and receipts from Cape Verdeans abroad are im-
 portant sources of national income. Cape Verde can produce food for only 25 percent
 of its population, even in years of optimum rainfall. Because of this, the country con-
 tinues to rely heavily on international food aid. The National Assembly has adopted
 legislation to privatize Cape Verde's state-owned enterprises and to facilitate foreign
 investment, but 1993 brought limited progress.
 The Constitution provides strong guarantees for human rights, and it includes the
 principles of separation of powers, a political system based on individual rights and
 liberties, and a market-based economy. Cape Verdeans enjoy a wide range of civil
 and political liberties. The principal human rights problems in 1993 were societal
 discrimination and domestic violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RICirrs
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reported instances of
 political or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no allegations or reported occurrences of torture or other cruel, inhu-
 man, or degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Cape Verdean law requires that the ac-
 cused be brought before a judge to be charged within 24 hours of arrest. A person
 may not be arrested without a court order unless caught in the act of committing
 a felony. In exceptional cases, and with the concurrence of a court official, the for-
 mal charge process may be delayed up to 5 days after the arrest. These laws are
 observed in practice.
 For crimes against state security, the Ministry of Justice has 40 days to prepare
 the case for a trial, and the accused may be incarcerated until the trial or for a pe-
 riod not to exceed a year. There is a functioning system of bail.
 There were no known instances of security detentions or forced exile for political
 or other reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is composed of the Supreme
 Court and the regional courts. There are five Supreme Court judges, including one
 who is appointed by the President of the Republic, one appointed by the National
 Assembly, and three appointed by the High Council of Magistrates. Defendants
 enjoy a presumption of innocence. Trials are public; they are conducted by one judge
 and without a jury. Evidence suggests that the courts protect individual rights in
 criminal cases. The autonomous Institute for Judicial Support, to which most pri-
 vate lawyers belong, provides free counsel for indigent defendants. The defense is
 permitted to present witnesses and has access to government evidence. Verdicts
 may be appealed.
 Regional courts adjudicate minor disputes on the local level in rural areas. The
 local judges, appointees of the Ministry of Justice and Labor, usually are prominent
 local citizens. As older judges retire, the Government appoints local judges with
 higher levels of education. Regional court decisions may be appealed to the Supreme
 Court.

 The Government did not take any new initiatives to relieve the overburdened ju-
 dicial system, and the courts continued to experience a backlog of cases. The aver-
 age time for a case to come to trial is in excess of 6 months.
 There were no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the inviolability of domicile, correspond-
 ence, and other means of communication. These rights are respected. The law re-
 quires that warrants be issued by a judge before homes may be searched.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of citi-
 zens to express ideas by words, images, or any other means and for freedom of the
 press without censorship. These freedoms are respected in practice. Journalists are
 independent of the Government and are not obliged to reveal their sources. No au-
 thorization is needed to establish newspapers, other publications, or electronic
 media.
 The government-owned newspaper, Novo Jornal de Cabo Verde, reopened in
 March as a biweekly after restructuring to cut costs. Together with the government-
 owned radio and television stations, the Jornal gave balanced coverage to domestic
 and international events and to opposition viewpoints. Independent newspapers also
 enjoyed full freedom of the press without censorship. The national radio station
 broadcasts live National Assembly sessions in their entirety.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association without authorization and without
 harassment by authorities.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution requires the separation of church and
 state and prohibits the imposition of religious beliefs and practices. It provides for
 freedom to exercise individual or group religion and to express one's faith. About
 80 to 90 percent of the population, including much of the Government leadership,
 is nominally Catholic. There are no restrictions on resident foreign clergy or on the
 numerous and diverse religious groups represented in Cape Verde.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no extraordinary legal or administrative restrictions on trav-
 el or residence in Cape Verde. Historically, emigration has been an important and
 government-supported means to escape harsh economic conditions. The Government
 maintains an office to serve intending emigrants and maintains close contact with
 emigre communities. It also encourages Cape Verdeans living abroad, including dual
 nationals, to maintain ties with their homeland. Repatriation is a constitutional
 right and is not discouraged by the Government. Acquiring dual nationality, which
 is a right protected by the Constitution, is not a ground for revocation of citizenship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right. In January 1991, after 15 years of one-party rule, power
 was transferred peacefully through democratic elections to an opposition party
 which won the country's first free legislative and presidential elections. Promulga-
 tion of the new Constitution in 1992 consolidated this change.
 The Constitution provides for separation of powers. Government ministers are not
 required to be members of the National Assembly, but they are subject individually
 to parliamentary confirmation. Collectively, they must retain the support of a par-
 liamentary majority. The Government may be dismissed by the President, with the
 approval of the Council of the Republic. This Council is composed of the President
 of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the President of the Supreme Court,
 the Attorney General the President of the Regional Affairs Council, and four pri-
 vate members. Two o? the private members are appointed by the President, and two
 are appointed by the National Assembly. Referendums may be held under specified
 circumstances but they may not challenge individual political rights and liberties
 or the right of opposition parties to exist and function freely. No referendums were
 held in 1993.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice regarding the rights of women or mi-
 norities to vote or to participate in the political process. Cape Verde's Parliament
 is 7.6 percent female; there are 2 female ministers out of 13 government ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions on their formation, to date no private
 groups have been established to monitor and report on human rights. In late 1991,
 theGovernment established a human rights commission with the objective of rais-
 
 
 ing popular consciousness about human rights and the need to respect them at the
 institutional level. The commission was largely inactive in 1993.
 The Government cooperates fully with representatives of foreign private human
 rights organizations. Human rights organizations made no known visits to Cape
 Verde in 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde where the vast majority of
 the population shares mixed Portuguese and African ancestry.
 Women.-Despite constitutional prohibitions against sex discrimination and provi-
 sions for full equality, including equal pay for equal work, traditional male-oriented
 values predominate; women experience difficulties in obtaining certain types of em-
 ployment and are often paid less than men. Women comprise 38 percent of the work
 force, and make up more than 50 percent of the workers in business, hotels, res-
 taurants, social services and administrative positions. Roughly the same percent-
 ages of males and females attend universities and secondary schools; 0.7 percent of
 women hold university degrees (compared with 0.8 percent for the total population)
 and 14.3 percent hold secondary school certificates (compared to 13.8 percent for the
 total population).
 There was some improvement in employment opportunities for women as evi-
 denced by the increasing presence of women in the upper echelons of government
 and among law and medical professionals.
 Domestic violence against women, including wife beating, remains common, par-
 ticularly in the rural areas. Crimes such as rape and spouse abuse are rarely
 brought to the attention of the police or tried in the courts. While neither the Gov-
 ernment nor women's organizations have addressed directly the issue of violence
 against women, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs has undertaken to pub-
 licize civil and human rights of both women and children through an extensive cam-
 paign which includes public service programming on television and radio as well as
 a widespread poster campaign.
 Children.-Child abuse is a continuing problem in Cape Verde. The Government
 is concerned about children's welfare and has mounted a public relations campaign
 to educate both children and parents about the dangers of child abuse and the
 rights of individuals. Few cases are prosecuted, but, if a complaint is filed and found
 to warrant intervention, children can be removed from their parents' homes and
 placed in an orphanage.
 People with Disabilities.-Physically disabled persons are not subject to discrimi-
 nation in employment or education, and a campaign is under way to educate the
 public about the capabilities of the disabled for employment. There is no government
 mandate for access to public buildings for the disabled, thereby limiting access to
 some public services, but the Government attempts to provide transportation (a
 combination wheelchair and three-wheel motor scooter) for handicapped persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers are legally free to form and to join
 unions of their own choosing without government authorization or restriction. There
 are no reliable figures for union membership available. There are two umbrella
 union associations in Cape Verde: the Council of Free Labor Unions (CCLS), formed
 after the change in government, and the National Union of Cape Verde Workers
 (UNTC-CS), formed and controlled by the former ruling party. The Government did
 not interfere with the activities of these organizations, but both suffer from a lack
 of funding.
 The Constitution provides union members the right to strike, and there are no
 restrictions on this right. There were periodic strikes, most frequently in state-
 owned enterprises. An employer must reinstate a worker fired unjustly. Unions are
 free to affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides to
 unions the right to organize and operate without hindrance and specifically gives
 unions the right to sign collective work contracts. Workers and management in the
 small private sector, as well as in the public sector, reach agreement through collec-
 tive bargaining. As the country's largest employer, the Government continues to
 play the dominant role by setting wages in the civil service. It does not fix wages
 or the private sector, but salary levels for civil servants provide the basis for wage
 negotiations in the private sector.
 A legislative decree of November 1991 bans antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers and provides that fines may be levied on offenders. There were no reported cases
 of such discrimination in 1993.
 
 
 Cape Verde has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is forbidden by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 14. Although children under 16 are prohibited from working at night,
 more than 7 hours per day, or in establishments where toxic products are produced,
 the law is rarely enforced. The Director General of Labor in the Ministry of Justice
 and Labor is responsible for enforcing minimum age laws. In practice, however,
 minimum age laws are enforced only in the mainly urban formal sectors of the econ-
 omy and then only with limited success.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are no established minimum wage rates
 in the private sector. Large urban private employers link their minimum wage rates
 to those paid to civil servants, which for an entry level worker is $180 (15,000 Cape
 Verdean escudos) per month. The majority of jobs pay insufficient wages to provide
 a worker and his family a decent standard of living; therefore, most workers must
 rely on a combination which includes second jobs, extended family help, and subsist-
 ence agriculture.
 The maximum legal workweek for adults is 44 hours. While large employers gen-
 erally respect these regulations, many employed in domestic service or by small em-
 players in rural areas do not enjoy legally mandated work conditions.
 Rural laborers are largely uninformed of workers' rights, and these rights fre-
 quently are not respected. In 1992 the Director General of Labor established a small
 department in the Ministry of Justice and Labor dedicated to the protection of rural
 laborers.
 All enterprises must submit a yearly report to the Director General of Labor with
 information on each employee's wages and days of leave. Although the reports pro-
 vide the Government with current information on employment practices, they are
 not used as a control mechanism. Nevertheless, the Director General does carry out
 periodic inspections to ensure that employers adhere to correct labor practices and
 imposes fines on private enterprises which are not in conformity with the law. There
 is no overall safety and health code, although some regulations exist in this area.
 The Director General of Labor is responsible for enforcing labor regulations. How-
 ever, Cape Verde has few industries that employ heavy or dangerous equipment,
 and work related accidents are rare. Consequently, there is no systematic govern-
 ment enforcement of labor laws.
