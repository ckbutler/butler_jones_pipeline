 SOUTH AFRICA
 In 1992 South Africa continued to be ruled by a parliamentary-style government
 characterized by the domination by the white minority (13 percent of the popu-
 
 
 lation), the partial parliamentary participation of the "coloured," i.e., mixed race (8
 percent) and Asian (2.6 percent) minorities, and exclusion of the black majority (75.5
 percent) from the forma plitialprecess. However, the multiparty Convention for
 a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), which met from Decembler 1991 to June 1992
 to lay the groundwork for an interim government and the drafting of a new con-
 stitution, set South Africa on a new political course. The National Party, presently
 led by State President de Klerk, has formed every national Government since 1948.
 In May CODESA deadlocked because participants could not rach consensus on
 a package of agreements that would have allowed the installation of an interim gov-
 ernment. The African National Congress (ANC) suspended its participation in
 CODESA following the June 17 Boipatong massacre, demanding, among other
 things, that the Government take steps to curb violence, secure hostels, release re-
 maining apolitical prisoners," and agree to a democratically elected constitution-
 making body. Pendig implementation of these demands the ANC limited discus-
 sions with the Government to a dialog between a senior ANC official and a govern-
 ment minister.
 After several months of this limited communication, coupled with domestic and
 international pressure, the Government and ANC signed a September 26 "Record
 of Understanding," which the ANC accepted as sufficient prors on its demands
 to justify a return to constitutional negotiations. At year's end, senior Government
 and ANC negotiators met in wide-ranging, substantive bilateral discussions to clear
 obstacles to the resumption of multilateral talks. Follow-on bilaterals were sched-
 uled for January 1993; no date had been set for the resumption of more inclusive
 multiparty negotiations.
 According to 1990 census information, 33 percent of South Africa's black popu-
 lation resides in the 10 ethnic homelands, which comprise 13 percent of South Afri-
 ca's area. The Government maintains that 4 of the 10 homelands are independent.
 The homelands, heavily subsidized by the Government, are mostly fragmented par-
 cels of territory in impoverished rural areas. No other government besides South Af-
 rica recognizes the sovereignty of the four supposedly independent homelands.
 Transkei, Ciskei and Venda are ruled by military governments which gained power
 b  cou  d'etat; Bophuthatswana is governed as a one-party state. Authorities in
 Bophuthatswana and Ciskei in particular, continued in 1992 to suppress free politi-
 cal activity, particularly by the ANC.
 White control of the Government is backed by a powerful defense and police estab-
 lishment. The South African Defense Force (SADF) has about 85,000 active duty
 ersonnel, approximately 50 percent of whom are black, Asian or 'coloured," and
 91,000 reservists, all of whom are white. The multiracial South African Police
 (SAP) numbers 112,000 and is 40 percent white. The SADF assisted the police in
 patrolling unrest areas and continued to be active in responding to the violence in
 Natal and the Transvaal during 1992. New security laws in 1992 aimed at stem-
 ming political violence, drug trafficking, and other crimes gave the police and attor-
 neys general significantly widened powers of detention and infringement of privacy;
 these laws were widely criticized as excessive.
 The Goldstone Commission and other official investigations uncovered misconduct
 by the state security forces in 1992. The most publicized wrongdoings included evi-
 dence that the SADF had hired Ferdi Barnard, a convicted murderer and former
 member of the SADF's Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB), to recruit or criminally
 compromise members of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK), dur-
 ing 1991. In a separate incident, two SADF military intelligence agents in London
 attempted to discredit the ANC by gathering and feeding information to journalists
 about alleged links between MK and the Irish Republican Army and the Palestine
 Liberation Organization. One of those agents was implicated in an attempt to mur-
 der Dirk Coetzee, an exiled, former captain of the South African Police (see Section
 L.a.).
 Opposition groups continued to allege in 1992 that security force members, oper-
 ating with or without orders from superior officers engaged in various forms of vio-
 lence (e.g., train massacres,' assassinations) aimea at weakening the ANC and its
 allies. The revelations uncovered by the Goldstone Commission in 1992, along with
 past findings of misconduct such as those revealed by the 1990 Harms Commission
 inquiry of the COB and die 1991 findngs of covert government funding to the
 Inkatha Freedom Party (lFP), further undermined public confidence in the neutral-
 ity of the security forces.
 President de Klerk has reduced military spending and, in strengthening civilian
 control, reduced the security establishment's role in domestic and foreign policy-
 making. In 1992 he took a number of steps in an attempt to restore confidence in
 the neutrality of the security forces which included disbanding the CCB and two
 other security units. His most publicized move came in December, when he an-
 
 
 241
 
 nounced the compulsory retirement of 16 SADF officers, including_2 generals and
 4 brigadiers, and suspended 7 others. He revealed that an internal SADF investiga-
 tion, prompted by findings of the Goldstone Commission, had uncovered evidence
 that these officers were enagd in activities aimed at preventing a successful nego-
 tiations process. In Augusthe also took some steps to reform the police by establish-
 ing a nominally independent body to investigate criminal allegations against the po-
 lice, decentralizing some law enforcement functions, implementing new training
 methods, and retiring 18 high police officials. In addition, President de Klerk had
 legislation enacted granting amnesty to persons committing political crimes.
 A number of nongovernmental, paramilitary organizations within South Africa
 continued to influence considerably the human rights and political environment.
 These included: MK, which has suspended armed struggle but continued to recruit
 members and train them outside South Africa; the Azanian People's Liberation
 Army (APLA), the armed wing of the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), which has
 claimed responsibility for attacks on police and civilian targets; and the Afrikaner
 Resistance Movement (AWB), the only rightwing paramilitary organization known
 to have a sizable following, which claims to be preparing for the day when it will
 defend Afrikaners against "black domination."
 On the economic side, South Africa has a well-developed formal sector based on
 mining and manufacturing and a smaller, but important, sector based on agri-
 culture and services. Despite its free market ideology, South Africa has a mixed
 economy, with substantial government intervention existing jointly with a strong
 private sector. Suffering from a lengthy recession, the economy has created no new
 jobs in the productive sectors in the past 10 years, and real per capita income
 among all races has declined. Unemployment among blacks is estimated at 40 per-
 cent nationwide; 350,000 new jobseeker of all races entered the market this year.
 Although the Government has increased spending on blacks in recent years, major
 economic and social reform will be required to reduce continuing income disparities
 and to redress the socioeconomic legacies of apartheid in such areas as education,
 housing, and health care. Human rights groups estimate that 7.5 million black
 South Africans have no permanent shelter and contravene the Illegal Squatting Act.
 Despite the National Peace Accord, signed in September 1991 by State President
 de Klerk, ANC President Mandela, and IFP Chief   ister Buthelezi and 23 others
 crime and political violence remained at a high level in 1992. Most observers agreed
 that all parties- -including the government security forces, the ANC and the IFP-
 bear some measure of responsibility for the continuing pattern of violence. According
 to the Human Rights Commission (HRC), 3,324 people had died from political vio-
 lence by the end of November.
 Although the Government has repealed the broad legal pillars of apartheid, the
 majority of South Africans remain disenfranchised. South Africans who are not
 white continue to face de facto discrimination, restrictions on due process rights
 and deprivation caused by generations of social, economic, and other legally enforced
 inequalities. Positive developments in the area of worker rights continued in 1992,
 but little, if any, effort was made to address legal and societal discrimination
 against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--South Africa continued to experience
 high levels of political violence in 1992, which resulted in an estimated 2,924
 deaths, according to the South African Institute of Race Relations and 3,324 accord-
 ing to the HRC, both by the end of November. These figures represent an increase
 from 1991 and are part of a marked escalation of violence that has occurred since
 June 1990. According to police statistics, 226 police died in unrest incidents in 1992,
 some of them in ambushes while responding to calls for help from township resi-
 dents.
 The Goldstone Commission recently concluded that the largest single cause of po-
 litical killings was the confrontation between groups claiming affiliation with the
 ANC and IFP. Another major cause of deaths was random attacks by unknown ter-
 rorists. Evidence of acts of political violence by individuals attached to the military,
 police, and homelands police also continued to emerge in 1992. Other groups which
 contributed to the high level of violence and extrajudicial killings included APLA,
 rightwing groups, local self-defense units (SDU's), criminal gangs loosely affiliated
 with political parties, and undisciplined labor strike enforcers.
 The ANC and various human rights organizations have charged high officials in
 the military, the police, and the homelands police with involvement in covert "desta-
 bilization" activities. In December President de Kerk compulsorily retired 16 SADF
 
 
 242
 officers, including 2 generals and 4 brigadiers, and suspended 7 others. His decision
 came after an internal SADF investigation, prompted by findings of the Goldstone
 Commission, revealed that these officers were engaged in activities aimed at pre-
 venting a successful negotiations process. The extent of these activities is not yet
 known.
 The Goldstone Commission cited significant failures on the part of the military
 and police in responding to violence, as well as "well-documented criminal conduct
 by individual members of the South African Police and the KwaZulu Police."
 For example, following an April incident at the Phola Park squatter camp near
 Johannesburg, the Goldstone Commission found uncontested evidence that members
 of SADF's 32 Battalion returned to the camp and committed "unspecified acts of vio-
 lence" after some SDU members fired on SADF personnel. The Commission rec-
 ommended that the Attorney General investigate alleged acts of assault, rape, and
 murder by the security officials. The Commission also found that the 32 Battalion
 was an inappropriate foc or internal policing. State President de Klerk announced
 on July 15 that the Government would begin to disband the 32 Battalion. At the
 end of 1992, however, individual members had yet to be charged with any crimes
 stemming from the Phola Park incident.
 President de Klerk also announced he would reopen the inquest into the deaths
 of several eastern Cape activists. In May Transkei homeland leader Bantu Holomisa
 leaked to the press a 1985 top secret military intelligence document in which the
 current chief o military intelligence requested the immediate removal from society"
 of several eastern Cape activists, who were murdered 2 weeks later. Although offi-
 cials confirmed the document's authenticity, the Government denied further allega-
 tions that the State Security Council had approved the murders. State President de
 Klerk was a member of the Council at the time of the alleged incident. At year's
 end, the government-run inquest had released no findings, and the chief of military
 intelligence remained in his position.
 The 1990 Harms Commission implicated the CCB in at least two murders of
 antiapartheid activists. Former police captsin Dirk Coetree testified before the Com-
 mission that police forensic chief Lieutenant General Lothar Neethling furnished
 poison to police operatives targeting antiapartheid activists. Coetzee's testimony ap-
 parently precipitated the March 1991 killing of Bhieki Mlangeni, who was killed by
 a bomb intended for Coetze. In April 1992, British officials arrested two SADF
 aents in London on suspicion of setting up another assassination lot against
 Cotzee. The SADF, denying the agents were acting under orders, fired one of the
 agents for acting 'outside the instructions given by the SADF," but only after the
 incident became public 3 months later. The two agents were to be subpoenaed to
 apear in the Mlangeni inquest.
 Th ack of convictions in the many cases of unsolved, political murders prompted
 accusations that the police were unwilling to pursue those responsible. The
 Goldtone Commission called attention to the death~s of two people associated with
 witnesses to the Commission. Evidence arose of targeted deaths of other peace-
 makers-mostly members of local dispute resolution committees in strife-torn
 areas. In addition, Jan Shoba, a PAC and APLA organizer, was murdered in the
 otherwise peaceful Pretoria township of Atteridgeville in June. In another suspicious
 set of murders, returned exile Ranani Lifiedi was murdered in March, and 3
 months later 8 members of his family were murdered. No one has been charged in
 any of these deaths.
 After signing of the National Peace Accord in September 1991, the police formed
 a special investigating unit to look into violence-related crimes and allegations of
 polce wrongdoing. The Accord called on the police to be more responsive in inves-
 tigating allegations of misconduct.A British policing expert working under
 Goldstone Commission auspices found that the police hadlittle public accountability
 and generally inadequate skills to investigate unrest-related incidents. In his other-
 wise very negative report, the official did red that the unit's inquiry into allegations
 of plice involvement in the"Boipatong massacre had been "thorough, well-manned
 * *   well-led, and properly structured." The unit had not made its findings on
 Boipatong public at year's end.
 Homeland poie have been involved in a number of violent incidents. According
 to Black Sash, Democratic Party members who monitor violence, and others in
 Natal,at e KwaZulu police (KZP) have been actively involved in campaigns against
 residents they perceiv o  e o uANC-afliated. A rding to the HRC s Natal regional
 office, in Aug st uniformed KZP members fired on residents and torched homes in
 Maukazi, killing 5 people and destroying 40 homes. There were also allegations of
 KZP   involvement in  attacks in Folweni, Adams Mission, Esihaweni, and
 Umzinyathi in Natal. The Legal Resources Centre requested the Goldatone Commis-
 
 
 243
 
 sion investigate the alleged role of the KZP in the political violence; at year's end
 it had not done so.
 In Ciskei, the Ciskei Defense Force (CDF) on September 7 fired on ANC marchers
 near Bisho, killing 29 and  ring hundreds. The Goldatone Commission found that
 the CDF's conduct was "deliberatel aimed at causing as many deaths and injuries
 as possible." The CDF fired a total of 425 rounds of ammunition and 4 grenades
 at the retreating crowd. Some of those shot were on the South African side of the
 "border." Goldstone termed the CDF"s claim that it was fired upon first by dem-
 onstrators, "false or...highly exaggerated." Of the 29 people killed, 15 were shot in
 the back, according to an independent pathologist (see also Section 2.b.). The Com-
 mission also criticized ANC leaders for poor organization for inadequate use of the
 Peace Accord monitors present at the march, and for leaing the marchers into un-
 necessary danger.
 In 1992 a number of court cases revealed evidence of police involvement in fo-
 menting violence, including the 1988 Natal Trust Feeds massacre, in which several
 police officers were found guilty in the murder of 11 people, including 6 women and
 2 children. On April 30, a white police captain was sentenced to death and four
 black constables were each sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. The court found
 evidence that the captain worked closely with local Inkatha leaders to plan the at-
 tack. A judge also found evidene of a high-level poie coveru]  in the investigation
 of the massacre. The police will conduct an inquiry of the imtial police investiga-
 tions into the massacre.
 The continued deaths of people in detention further undermined police-community
 relations. In 1992 more than 100 people died while in police custody according to
 the HRC. This issue came to public attention in July, when Dr. Jonathan
 Gluckman a leading independent pathologist, called the police out of control," and
 asserted at 90 percent of the 200 cell death cases he investigated were due either
 to olice negligence or misconduct. In December Law and Order Minister Kriel pub-
 lic.y repudiated Gluckman's broad allegations of police misconduct, claiming that a
 police investigation found Gluckman's statistics erroneous. Gluckman has affirmed
 his charges regarding police misconduct.
 Following Gluckman's allegations, deaths in detention continued at a slightly
 higher rate than before, although one law enforcement expert noted that reporting
 had increased and previously ignored cases were being featured in the press. In re-
 spnse, Law and Order Minister Kriel promised in August to appoint retired mag-
 istrates to inspect prisen conditions. In October the Government gave permission to
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to make unannounced visits
 to detainees in police stations throughout South Africa, including those in the home-
 lands, which have ostensibly separate police forces. The agreement allows ICRC del-
 egates to meet detainees and prisoners alone, make repeat visits unannounced, and
 pass their findings on police cell conditions to higher government officials. Investiga-
 tions of previous years deaths continued.
 In some instances police have been prosecuted for abuses. For example, in 1992
 two police officers were found guilty in the August 1990 cell death of suspected car
 thief Johannes Theme. At year's end, an investigation into deaths in Welverdiend
 police custody found two policemen criminally responsible in one case. The case had
 been forwarded to the Transvaal Attorney General for a decision. In December a
 Natal court found a police warrant officer guilty of murdering an ANC member and
 attempting to murder another, sentencing him to 18 years' imprisonment. The pre-
 sidin ju dge sharply criticized the police investigating officer for "neglecting his hon-
 esty  due to "misplaced loyalty to another officer.
 other instances the security forces have been cleared of charts. For example,
 an iquet ceard te scurty  orcs o alegaion  ofan  ssiation operation
 againsthead ce      h     zima Mpm           the Congrs  of Traditional Lead-
 ers, his stepfather, and his driver. In another instance, the Supreme Court rejected
 an individual's claims that he was a member of a security forces hit squad. Overall,
 the number of prosecutions of police for unlawful killings and other abuses com-
 pared to the suspected incidence of such offenses was very low.
 A major factor in the countrs high death toll from political violence in 1992 was
 the ongoing rivalry between affiliates of the ANC and the IFP. This sometimes took
 the form of fighting between hostel residents, usually but not always affiliated with
 the IFP, and squatter camp/township residents, seen to be ANC supporters. Most
 of the violence occurred in the Natal region and the greater Johannesburg area. Ac-
 cording to the HRC, internecine fighting in the Natal region claimed the lives of
 1,79 people by the end of November. In the Johannesburg area, two of the dead
 liest examples of internecine fighting were the hostel massacre in Boipatong and the
 "war" between hostel and township residents of Alexandra. In Natal cycles of re-
 vene killinos and targeting of IFP and ANC officials continued.
 
 
 The worst single attack on civilians occurred on June 17 in Boipatong township
 (an area of ANC support). In less than an hour at least 100 men roamed from house
 to house, indiscriminately killing 49 residenta. Police said the attackes came from
 the nearby Kwamadala hostel, h ome to JEP members who had been driven out of
 another local hostel. At the end of 1992, the Goldatone Commission had made no
 finding on sllegations of security force involvement in the massacre.
 Over 500 I   me    ers were killed in 1992, according to the Inkatha Institute.
 The ANC reported nearly 400 of its followers were killed by the end of November.
 In some cases a chain reaction of retaliatory attacks in which political leaders of
 comparative importance were targeted for death seemed to occur. In March a cycle
 of violence between Alexandra hostel and township residents resulted in the deaths
 of dozens of people and made homeless hundreds more.
 Similar cycles of violence, in which local or personal grievances are enlarged to
 include political and socioeconomic rivalries, have been especially deadly in Soweto,
 Sharpeville, Sebokeng, Thokoza, and parts of Natal. Murder by "necklacing" contin-
 ued to be an element of the ongoing factional violence. (Necklacing is setting fire
 to a gasoline-soaked tire wedgd around a person.) In some cases ANC-affiliated
 youths carried out summary murders by necklacing or battery against alleged IFP
 supporters or government informants.
 There have been allegations that South African and homelands police played a
 role in inciting the continuing cycle of black-on-black violence. Witnesses claimed
 they saw members of the KZP at the killing of nine ANC members in September
 and that a KZP van blocked an injured resident's way to the hospital. On the south
 coast the following day, gunmen in military uniforms attacked a van of IFP support-
 ers on their way to work, setting fire to the van and killing 8 people. According to
 the Inkatha Institute, the van's driver was a well-known IFP supporter. The mas-
 sacres seem to be a well-coordinated effort by unknown forces to stoke violence in
 the area.
 Former ANC-held detainees, accused by the ANC of spying and treason, claim the
 ANC has instructed assassins to eliminate members of the Returned Exiles Commit-
 tee (REC). The group claims an ANC "hit squad" killed Bongani Ntshangase, a
 former detainee in Natal in June.
 In 1992 a number of deaths resulted from labor unrest and labor-led political
 demonstrations, some of which were aimed at curtailing the violence. The largest
 trade union in South Africa the ANC-allied Congress of South African Trade
 Unions (COSATU), was a leading organizer of many of the demonstrations. Accord-
 ing to the police, in a nationwide health workers' strike from June to September,
 30 people died in 16 different attacks, probably due to failures on the part of the
 military and police in preventing violence by strikers against perceived strike-
 breakers. Workers affiliated with the "IFP' union, the United Workers of South Af-
 rica (UWUSA), were used as strikebreakers during the COSATU-sponsored strike.
 Attacks on nonstrikers and their families in the form of petrol bombs and
 shootings, resulted in the deaths of nurses, sbop stewards, unionists, and a 4-year-
 old child.
 Many additional groups and organizations were accused of or implicated in fo-
 menting violence in 1992. For example, in November and December, APLA claimed
 respisbility for a series of attacks on white civilians that lef five pple dead.
 also publicly "ordered" the killings of police as "political targets. Of the 226
 plckilled in 1992, it was not known how many deaths could be attributed to
 Two rightwing politicians allegedl committed terrorist acts during 1992. Former
 Conservative Party Member of Pariament Koos Botha and four members of the
 rightwing AWB admitted to the January bombing of two post offices and to the July
 1991 bombing of a school that returning ANC exile children were to attend. In a
 separate incident, a Conservative Party local official was among those charged with
 detonating a limpet mine injuring nine people on April 9 at a Johannesburg fair.
 A fringe rightwing organization known as the Order of White Wolves claimed re-
 sponsibility for the explosion.
 Terrorist-style attacks by unknown persons on train commuters in the Johannes-
 burg area, which began in August 1990 continued to claim lives and property in
 1992. The police reported 363 train attacis and 173 related arrests through the end
 of October. According to the independent board of inquiry, 231 people had died in
 train violence by the end of October. The report by the indepndent board of inquiry
 on train violence found that victims were not targeted by political affiliation or eth-
 nicity but instead covered the "entire spectrum of black commuters."
 Many township youths, especially in the Transvaal, have formed well-armed self-
 defense units (SDPs), allegedly to protect residents from outside attack. SDU's have
 been accused of acts of intimidation, such as demands for 'protection money" from
 
 
 245
 local shopkeepers, common crimes, such as car theft and vigilante-style murders of
 suspected "informers2 or Inkatha sympathizers. The MK created many SDU's while
 others are loosely affiliated with the South African Communist Party (SACP).
 Former MK chief Chris Hani said the ANC has tried but is unable to control certain
 SDU's that have branched into criminal activities.
 A former KwaZulu official testified to the Goldstone Commission that the KZP
 gave weapons training to a youth gang in the eastern Transvaal town of Ermelo in
 1990. The gang later bombed the office of an ANC-linked attorney and fired on the
 funeral of an ANC member, killing one person, allegedly on orders of a man who
 carried both SAP and KZP identity documents. The official charged that the same
 policeman who had given the gang its instructions also investigated the bombing,
 and the gang leader was the Inkatha Youth Brigade chairman in the town.
 b. Dispearanc.-There were no known cases of antigovernment activists dis-
 appearing in 1992. The Goldstne Commission found prima facie evidence to inves-
 tigate two olicmen in the western Trnsvaal on chaaes of kidnaping a local ANC
 leader in December1991. The   NC leader, Jerry Mane, was returned unharmed
 and later gave statements to the media and the Goldstone Commission. Only after
 6 months, and following a public statement by Justice Goldstone expressing his im-
 patience, did the Attorney General recommend the case for trial. However, by De-
 cember 1992 the trial had yet to convene.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Court testimony and sworn affidavits support claims by lawyers and human rights
 activists that torture of detainees occurred in 1992. Alleged perpetrators include
 members of the South African police and homelands police. Allegations of torture
 in ANC prison camps in Angola, Tanzania, and Uganda during the 1980's were de-
 tailed in a 1992 report by Amnesty International and have been acknowledged by
 ANC President Nelson Mandela. For the most part, leaders of these organizations
 failed to identify individuals responsible and did not pursue legal actions to the end.
 There are no constitutional or statutory provisions against torture in part be.
 cause the current Constitution has no bill of rights. The Government, however, has
 stated that torture is not its policy and that, in cases where it has occurred, it was
 in contravention of official guidelines and regulations.
 In cases involving the police, a white South African alleged that the South African
 police beat him andgave him electric shocks while interrogating him on a murder
 charge. A 19-year-old detainee in Pinetown was hospitalized for severe burns after
 police officers allegedly 'necklaced' him. The officers were standing trial at year's
 end. In one case involving the homelands police, a Malawian woman claimed that
 a Bophuthatswana police constable raped her while she was imprisoned in a police
 station. Bophuthatswana human rights lawyer Patrick Huma suffered a broken arm
 while allegedly being beaten in detention. Huma has reportedly received death
 threats from the Bophuthatswana police.
 In October upon release of the findings of an ANC-sponsored investigation, the
 ANC acknowledged that detainees in its military camps had been tortured during
 the 1980's but did not identify or recommend action against the individuals respon-
 sible. In November the ANC appointed three persons to an independent panel to
 recommend punishment for the individuals responsible. The commission is to begin
 work in January.
 A December 1992 Amnesty International report found that 70 prisoners died of
 abuse and hundreds more were executed in ANC camps over the course of a dozen
 years. ANC detainees have claimed they were put in solitary confinement for long
 periods of time, beaten, and interrogated. Despite 1991 assurances by the ANC that
 it held no more prisoners, Amnesty International said it was aware of the continued
 detention of six prisoners at Dakawa camp in Tanzania. Amnesty also said it inter-
 viewed former prisoners released during 1992 from other camps in Tanzania.
 Prison officials occasionally use court-ordered whipping and deprivation of meals
 to punish minor offenders. Prisoners with certain political affiliations alleged har-
 assment and denial of medical attention. Since July 1991, the ICRC has had access
 to all inmates in South African and homeland prisons and can report substandard
 prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--Several laws provide for detention with-
 out charge if.in the opinion of a designated official, the person may commit an un-
 lawful act. The Public Safety Act authorizes detentions for up to 30 days "if nec-
 essary for combatting or preventing public disturbance, disorder, riot, or public vio-
 lence or the maintenance or restoration of public order." The Internal Security Act
 as amended, allows senior police officers to detain and interrogate persons suspected
 of terrorism or subversion or who withhold such information. After 10 days' deten-
 tion, continued incarceration requires judicial approval. According to Lawyers for
 Human Rights (LHR), the police generally do not block access to detainees.
 
 
 According to HRC statistics, in 1992 the number of detentions in South Africa in-
 creased, des pite a significant decrease in detentions in the so-called independent
 homelands. The HRG reported that, as of November 30, the Government had de-
 tained 227 people at one time or another under regulations applicable to unrest
 areas as detailed in the Public Safety Act. During the first 7 months of the year
 an additional 48 persons suspected of terrorism were detained under the Internal
 Security Act.
 The Criminal Law Second Amendment Act (CLSAA) of 1992, described by the
 Ministry of Justice as a 'declaration of war against violence," along with other laws
 aimed at stemming political violence, drug trafficking, and other crime, gives the
 police and attorneys general significantly widened powers. Many observers criticized
 these extraordinary powers as running counter to a rule of law culture and being
 susceptible to abuse. The CLSAA shifted the customary burden of Rroof from the
 State to the accused and criminalized the vague offense of 'indirect intimidation,
 while increasing sentences up to 25 years for certain intimidating acts. The CLSAA
 also allowed special, shortened procedures for offenses involving violence and intimi-
 dation and granted wide powers to the attorneys general to deny bail in such cases,
 with no judi~cial review.
 At the end of 1992, the HRC believed no persons were being detained under secu-
 rity legislation in the homelands. The HEC reported the following total numbers of
 detainees during 1992 for the homelands: Transkei (5), Bophuthatswana (26), Venda
 (0), and Ciskei (120). In December the Bophuthatswana authorities announced a
 general amnesty for prisoners with remaining sentences of between 6 and 18
 months. In December the Transkei authorities announced they would reduce the
 sentences of all their prisoners by 6 months.
 In many cities street children are arrested and sent to adult prisons while they
 await trial. While some children are arrested on criminal charges, many are ar-
 rested on petty charges, such as loitering. These children are often held in over-
 crowded cells and suffer physical and sexual abuse. Most prisons have no edu-
 cational or counseling facilities. The prison service reported in late 1992 that 2,656
 children under 18 awaited trial in adult prisons countrywide.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The South African judiciary is headed by the ap-
 pellate division (Court of Appeals) of the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein and six
 regional supreme courts. The appointment of the country's first judge not from the
 white minority occurred in 1991. Judges, appointed by the State President serve
 until age 70 and may only be removed through impeachment by Parliament. By tra-
 dition judges of the appellate division and the supreme courts are chosen from the
 senior ranks of the ehte corps of South African Supreme Court practitioners ('advo-
 cates"). A March survey found about 50 black advocates, 3 of whom were "senior"
 advocates. The power of the judiciary at all levels continues to be circumscribed by
 the principle of parliamentary sovereignt, under which judges possess no authority
 to alter, strike own, or refuse to enforce laws of Parliament.
 South Africa has an adversarial system of criminal justice drawn from a mixed
 heritage of Roman-Dutch and English jurisprudence. Lesser offenses are heard by
 magistrates, career employees of the executive branch civil service. More serious of-
 fenses, including capital crimes, are tried in the supreme courts. The presiding
 judge or magistrate determines guilt or innocence. Juries were abolished in 1969.
 Judges in capital and other serious cases may appoint two assessors, who serve as
 fact finders and have the power to overrule the judge on questions of fact but not
 on questions of law.
 Persons charged with common crimes are presumed innocent until proven guilty,
 although Parliament has modified the general presumption of innocence for many
 security offenses (as reflected in the new Criminal Law Second Amendment bill dis-
 cussed above). Both security-related and common criminal cases are tried in civilian
 courts.
 Although defendants in criminal cases may retain legal counsel, a 1990 study
 found that 85 percent of those convicted in ordinary criminal cases had no represen-
 tation. The concept of publi defense was significantly boosted when a widely rep-
 resentative group, comprising members of the government-supported legal aid board
 and all major legal organizations, met to develop such a system. A pilot public de-
 fender's program began in Johannesburg in 1991 and has been highly successful.
 Plans are underway for similar demonstration projects. As a matter of practice,
 courts usually appoint counsel for capital cases when the defendant cannot afford
 a lawyer.
 Prospects for law school graduates to receive "articles of clerkship," which qualify
 them for admittance to the bar, were enhanced in 1992. Currently, the only way
 to receive articles is through a 2-year apprenticeship with a law firm. This system
 has minimized opportunities for blacks to advance in the profession, thus contribut-
 
 
 247
 ing to perceptions that South Africa has a 'white" system of justice. In 1992 the
 Association of Law Societies proposed new routes of entry into the profession, in-
 cluding credit for work at offices of public defenders, university law clinics, and
 similar community-based entities which offer legal assistance to indigent clients.
 The Government-ANC Pretoria Minute of August 1990 included an agreement to
 release political prisoners and grant indemnity for nonprisoners convicted or sus-
 pected of political offenses (mostly exiles). A continuing dispute over the interpreta-
 tion and implementation of that arrangement contributed to a September 1992 Gov-
 ernment-ANC agreement that political motivation would be the sole criterion in as-
 sessing a prisoner's eligilit for release. This led to the immediate release of 153
 prisoners endorsed by the ANC-including some who had been responsible for mul-
 tiple civilian deathsand the establishment of Government-ANC case-by-case re-
 view procedures for the purpose of further releases after November 15. In a move
 from which the ANC disassociated itself, the Government also released a white pris-
 oner who had been convicted of randomly killing eight blacks on the streets of Pre-
 toria.
 In October the Government submitted to Parliament the Further Indemnity Bill,
 allowing persons to apply without public disclosure for indemnity from prosecution
 for politically motivated crimes. After Parliament rejected the proposal, the Govern-
 ment referred the provision to the President's Council, an infrequently used mecha-
 nism with questioned legitimacy, for final passage (see also Section 3). Since most
 ANC members have already gone through an indemnity process-during which their
 offenses were publicly disclosed-the bill was widely seen as protecting the security
 forces.
 So-called people's courts, which emerged in part due to the black community's dis-
 trust of the existing court system, continued to operate but at a reduced level. A
 human rights lawyer said that these tribunals pass judgment on criminal charges,
 such as rape (for which the punishment is often whipping), or political charges, such
 as acting as a police informer (which may result in a death sentence, carried out
 by the commumty). The courts are headed by mostly self-appointed community lead-
 ers. The system is very vulnerable to false rumors based on political or personal ri-
 valries. Women, in particular, have been tried for witchcraft.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-At the
 end of its 1992 ordinary session, South Africa's Parliament adopted the Interception
 and Monitoring Prohibition bill whereby an attorney general or judge may author-
 ize the security forces to tap telephones, bug rooms, and intercept mail. Permission
 to use these methods may be sought verbally by police, defense force, and national
 intelligence service officers, who must demonstrate that an offense has been or is
 being committed and cannot be investigated in any other way.
 The new lawgives the State significantly widened powers to interfere with cor-
 respondence and privacy. It empowers agents to enter premises at any time to in-
 stall, maintain, or remove a monitoring device. Surveillance is supposed to be used
 only for serious crimes, such as treason, sedition, public violence, murder, kidnap-
 ing, and theft. Opposition parties objected to the fegislation, claiming it was rushed
 through Parliament without proper debate and noting the absence of a requirement
 for judicial scrutiny over such intrusive surveillance.
 Police are free to make searches, seizures, and arrests without warrants in all
 "unrest areas," as designated by the Minister of Law and Order. In fact, according
 to human rights lawyers, warrants are unusual for any search and seizure in black
 homes, whether in designated "unrest areas" or not.
 Insufficient housing has resulted in an increased squatter population. Despite
 government efforts to develop a more realistic policy toward illegal settlements,
 many provincial and local authorities continued to pressure squatters to move. The
 Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act requires all landowners-whether public or pri-
 vate-to remove unauthorized structures from their property. As a result, even
 when private landowners raise no objection, police have the option of prosecuting
 the landowner, fining the squatters or evicting them. The police usually disperse the
 squatters.
 Although the repeal of the Land Acts largely failed to provide for either resettle-
 ment or compensation of the estimated 3.5 million persons who had been previously
 removed forcibly from their land, in late 1992 the Advisory Commission on Land
 Allocation honored the historical land claims of two communities and allocated them
 state-owned land. Also, in 1992 human rights groups began to challenge evictions
 in court with a measure of success. A community of 700 people which had lived on
 the Welverdiend farm in the western Transvaal since 1926 was threatened with
 eviction after the land was allocated for residential purposes in 1989. The commu-
 nity has obtained a succession of interdicts to prevent the owner from evicting the
 community. As a result, the landowner is now willing to sell the land to its occu-
 
 
 248
 pants. The community, however, has neither the money nor the desire to purchase
 the land, arguing that after 65 years it is not a squatter camp.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-In 1992 freedoms of speech and ress were less
 restricted in South Africa. Both the mainstream and alternate press ave vigorously
 informed the public and criticized both the Government and the opposition. Consid-
 erable legislation permitting the Government to restrict and penalize the press re-
 mained on the books, but it was used infrequently by the Government, while con-
 cern over official harassment, both overt and covert, declined.
 On the other hand, overt action by extreme right and left opposition groups has
 become a growing concern to journalists, reporters, and photogra hers in the field.
 At the beg ning of the year, Parliament repealed section 27  ofthe Police Act of
 1958, which provided for a fine of up to $3,500 or a prison sentence of up to 5 years,
 or both, for a journalist who published untrue information about the police without
 having "reasonable grounds" for its accuracy. Section 205 of the Criminal Procedure
 Act, in which authorities can subpoena journalists to disclose confidential informa-
 tion regarding the identity of sources under threat of imprisonment, remains in
 force.
 Other laws limit press freedom by restricting, inter alia, the publication of infor-
 mation about the South African police, the South African Defense Force, petroleum
 products, prisons, and mental institutions. Under the Publications Act any news-
 paper or magazine which is not a member of the newspaper press union can be de-
 clared "undesirable" and banned. The Internal Security Act allows the Minister of
 Law and Order to ban organizations and their publications.
 Opposition groups, and especially black militant youths, continued to harass the
 press. For example, in April journalists from The Natal Witness who were covering
 an IFP rally were charged by a group of youths verbally abused, and attacked with
 stones. In another incident in June, a group of AC youths assaulted reporters and
 photographers who were covering a funeral for some of the victims of the Boipatong
 massacre. In August the ANC regional office in Port Elizabeth, apparently angered
 by anti-ANC editorials by The Eastern Province Herald, targetedthe paper or a
 boycott, demonstrations, and the public burning of newspapers. Black journalists re-
 port they have resorted to self-censorship out of fear of retribution in the form of
 necklacing, shooting, and torching of homes.
 The South African Broadcasting  orration (SABC) was criticized from all sides,
 including the Government. While the SABC has succeeded in delivering programs
 containing a more balanced exposure of the various players on the South African
 political scene than previously, opposition elements have called for its restructuring
 and creation of an independent broadcasting authority. The Government criticized
 SABC for its extensive coverage of o position political parties. Radio news reporting,
 in particular that of privately-owned Radio 702, is both independent and balanced.
 There are no official restrictions on academic freedom in South Africa. Some cen-
 sorship of publications and films exists, and in some cases these restrictions might
 cause academic research to be limited.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Relaxation of security restric-
 tions on antiapartheid organizations resulted in increased freedoms of assembly and
 association in South Africa, except in the homelands. These organizations have
 taken advantage of the changed political climate to participate openly in the debate
 for a new political order in South Africa.
 Although the Government lifted its 15-year blanket ban on all outdoor political
 gatherings in March 1991, specific assemblies are occasionally banned by district
 magistrates or by the Minister of Law and Order. Also, under the current Internal
 Security Act, the Minister has the power to reinvoke the blanket ban at a future
 date. Unrest area designation imposes curfew hours (usually 9 p.m. to 4 a.m.), al-
 lows police to search homes without warrant, restricts gatherings, allows the use
 of force to disperse gatherings and grants security forces indemnity from prosecu-
 tion. The Government declared 40 localities unrest areas in 1992, according to the
 HRC.
 At midyear the Goldstone Commission issued a set of guidelines on mass dem-
 onstrations that enshrined the right to peaceful assembly and proposed procedures
 for planning and approval, with the cooperation of the police and local authorities.
 In a number of cases, the Government denied permission to groups wishing to
 hold demonstrations or, in some instances, dispersed or arrested some engaging in
 peaceful protest. For example, the Government dispersed and arrested groups on
 March 25 in Alexandra, on May 5 in Pietermaritzburg (Natal), on June 22 in
 Cradock (eastern Cape), on July 4 in East London (eastern Cape), in July in
 Rustenburg (western Transvaal), and on October 18 in the northern Transvaal.
 
 
 249
 
 In the so-called independent homelands, notably Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, po-
 litical organizing is subject to more stringent limits. In October the Bophuthatswana
 legislature passed a bill making all marches or gatherings illegal unless permitted
 by the minister for law and order. In violation of the Goldstone Commission's guide-
 lines, Bophuthatswana police are instructed to disperse illegal marries with force
 if necessary. In August the Bophuthatswana Supreme Court overturned legislation
 that prohibited "noncitizens" from speaking at public meetings. Internal security
 regulations in Bophuthatswana restricted the political activities of the ANC and
 other organizations, like the Black Sash.
 On July 22, a Ciskei magistrate refused permission for the ANC to hold a meeting
 in Keiskammahoek. Despite the ban, ANC supporters gathered at the arranged
 venue. Ciskei police dispersed them with tear gas, injuring about 50 people. Over
 100 Bophuthatswana police forcibly dispersed a peaceful protest march by 40 clergy-
 men in Bophuthatwana on November 27.
 The freedom to assemble peacefully was most flagrantly violated at an ANC alli-
 ance march on the Ciskei "capital" Bisho on September 7. Although the Ciskei court
 granted a permit for the march, Ciskei Defense Force soldiers opened fire on un-
 armed ANC. marchers who had diverted from the approved march route in order to
 "occupy" Bisho. Soldiers shot and killed 29 marchers and wounded approximately
 200 more (see Section L.a.).
 These incidents notwithstanding, various groups were able to hold legal peaceful
 protests in cities throughout the country. In some cases, police cooperated withpro-
 test organizers to try to ensure the safety of participants and nonparticipants. Nota-
 ble national protests include ANC and PAC demonstrations at the opening sessions
 of Parliament in January and October in Cape Town.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-South Africa is religiously plural, and religious groups
 are allowed to worship freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 atriation. -In so far as is known, no passports were denied in 1992 to white or
 black antiapartheid activists, including trade union leaders. Although foreign gov-
 ernments o not recognize homeland travel documents, blacks assigned to a so-
 called independent homeland can easily obtain South African passports. The Min-
 ister of Home Affairs continues to have absolute discretion to revoke or refuse to
 issue a passport without giving reason for action.
 Although South Africa is not a party to international conventions on refugees and
 does not formally recognize any form of refugee status, the Government did sign a
 memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the United Nations High Commissioner
 on Refugees (UNHCR) in 1991. The agreement allows the UNHCR to manage the
 repatriation of South African exiles, most of whom were affiliated in some way with
 antiapartheid organizations while in exile. The Government has extended the
 UNHCR's mandate for operations until September 1993.
 Since the 1990 Government-ANC agreement on procedures for indemnifying and
 repatriating political exiles, 7,026 people have received indemnity, while 91 have
 not. An estimated 7,000 exiles returned before the MOU, and 9,000 to 12,000 more
 will return under UNHCR auspices.
 The Government and monitoring groups estimate that 500,000 Mozambicans dis-
 placed by civil strife and economic hardships due to war and drought have entered
 South Africa, many of them considered illegal aliens by Pretoria. Approximately
 250,000 of these refugees live in the homelands of Kangwane and Gazankulu, where
 they have a legal temporary resident status based on their ethnic ties to homeland
 residents.
 The approximately 250,000 Mozambicans who live outside the two homelands of
 Kangwane and Gazankulu are considered illegal aliens. According to the Ministry
 for Home Affairs, every month about 3,000 are caught and forcibly repatriated,
 without determining whether they can safely return. Many of these refugees imme-
 diately return to South Africa. The 1991 Aliens Control Act gave immigration offi-
 cers greater internal control over aliens, allowing immigration officers to enter pri-
 vate premises without warning.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although Parliament repealed the remaining"pillars of apartheid" in 1991, under
 the present Constitution the extent to which South African citizens have the right
 to change their government still depends on their race. The black majority still lacks
 ,the right to vote in national elections or otherwise to participate meaningfully in
 the political system. While the Government has repeatedly stated that citizens of
 all races will be able to participate equally in future elections, necessary constitu-
 
 
 250
 tional changes have not yet been made; they will depend on the outcome of
 multiparty negotiations, which were in abeyance at the end of 1992.
 The current political order is based on the 1983 Constitution, which created a
 tricameral Parliament with separate chambers for whites, 'coloureds," and Asians.
 Membership of the three houses is such that Asians have only one-fourth the num-
 ber of white representatives, and "coloured' representatives are one-half the number
 of whites. Members of each house are elected in multiparty elections on a constitu-
 ency basis from separate racially based voter rolls. Each house has primary respon-
 sibi ity for its "own affairs," i.e., legislation affecting racially segregated services
 such as education housing, and welfar. In October Parliament gave authority to
 the President to abolish the "own affairs' administrative system, but he has not yet
 done so.
 Such matters as foreign policy defense, national security, and black affairs are
 classified as "general affairs' and are debated in all three chambers. In the event
 that the three chambers cannot agree on a piece of "gneral affairs" legislation, the
 bill may be referred to the President's Council for final determination. A majority
 of the seats on this Council are automatically filled by the majority party in the
 white chamber. Thus, while the 1983 Constitution allows for the representation of
 "coloureds" and Asians, power over almost all important matters is kept in white
 hands.
 Similarly, the 1983 Constitution grants members of the "coloured and Asian
 chambers representation in the electoral college that elects the State President, but
 agan a majority of the college members are chosen by the majority party in the
 white House of Assembly.
 With the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991, South Africans are
 no longer assigned ethnicity at birth. Blacks born before repeal of the law remain
 assigned to homelands, however. The legislation to repeal the Act stated that the
 population register 'as it exists at the commencement of this Act" shall remain in
 effect until the current Constitution is repealed. Thus, blacks' rights to vote and
 hold office remain limited to their respective homelands or, in the case of more than
 10 million urban blacks, to their township councils. Blacks residing in supposed
 independent homelands lost their South African citizenship upon receiving the "citi-
 zenship" of the homeland. An estimated 8 million blacks have been assigned citizen-
 ship of Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, or Ciskei homelands.
 Political rights vary within South Africa's 10 black homelands. During the period
 1976-1981, the Government declared four homelands "independent* nations
 (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei). South Africa is the only country that
 recognizes their "independence.* Rampant corruption and other factors inspired suc-
 cessful military coups in Transkei Ciskei, and Venda. As of late 1992, all three were
 controlled by military regimes. Bophuthatswana continues to be ruled as a one-
 party state.
 Multiparty negotiations to create a new, nonracial and democratic constitutional
 order for South Africa began on December 20, 1991, when the Convention for a
 Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began deliberations. By May 1992, CODESA
 working groups had made substantial progress on many fronts, including: designing
 the structure of a transitional government; determining some of the ground rules
 for free political debate and for the first nonracial election; designing a constitution-
 making body; and laying out mechanisms for reincorporating the "independent"
 homelands.
 On March 17, South African whites, in a special referendum, gave President de
 Klerk a mandate to negotiate an end to white minority rule. At a plenary session
 in mid-May, however, CODESA deadlocked on issues relating to the composition
 and functioning of the constitution-making body. One month later, the ANC with-
 drew from CODESA deliberations following the Boipatong massacre, bringing the
 constitutional negotiating process to a halt. As of the end of the year, the multiparty
 negotiations had yet to resume, though there was considerable bilateral discussion
 amotig some of the parties that had attended CODESA.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Many local organizations are involved in a wide range of human rights questions,
 contributing to the public debate on human rights issues and providing a mecha-
 nism for public accountability for the Government and opposition groups. With some
 exceptions, the Government did not interfere with the activities of human rights
 groups in 1992 and allowed them greater freedom than in the past to organize, in-
 vestigate, and publish reports. In December pathologist Dr. Jonathan Gluckman al-
 legedthat his office had been extensively bugged following his disclosures to the
 press of deaths in police detention.
 
 
 251
 In July the Government dropped criminal charges against human rights activist
 Sally Sealey, who had been arrested in September 1991 on charges of intimidating
 a police officer whom she alleged had detained a person who had accused the officer
 of torture. Sealey claims her arrest and the legal case against her were instances
 of intimidation and harassment. Sealey has been active in persuading Khutsong
 township residents who were allegedly assaulted by the police during interrogations
 to press charges against the police. This has led to the suspension of 19 policemen.
 Assaults and reported death threats by the Bophuthatwana police on Patrick
 Huma, a human rights lawyer, were related to his human rights activity.
 International human rights organizations became increasingly active during 1992.
 The Government has become more cooperative with the United Nations. It allowed
 various U.N. representatives to make extended visits to South Africa, including the
 official missions to South Africa on behalf of the U.N. Secretary General by Special
 Envoy Cyrus Vance and Special Representatives Virendra Dayal and Tom Vraalsen.
 The Government also allowed the visits of 10 U.N. observers in August and a longer
 term 50-person U.N. observer team that arrived in September, saongwith observer
 teams from the European Community, the Commonwealth, and the Organiation of
 African Unity. At year's end, approximately 90 international observers were in
 South Africa in an effort to reduce the violence and strengthen the National Peace
 Accords structures.
 As noted earlier (see Section l.a and 1S.), the ICRC has now received permission
 from all relevant authorities to visit prisons and police stations in South Africa and
 the 10 homelands, with the exception of Venda (for which permission was not
 asked). ICRC delegates have made numerous visits to both prisons and police sta-
 tions and have made confidential recommendations to the authorities on ways to im-
 prove those facilities and the treatment of detainees and prisoners.
 The International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, and British
 criminologist Dr. Peter Waddington produced reports critical of South African polic-
 ing methods in 1992. The Government rejected the conclusions of the first two re-
 ports but made no attempt to block their publication. The Ministry of Law and
 Order has implemented some procedural changes in line with the Waddingtoen re-
 port recommendations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Race discrimination dominated social and legal institutions, despite the repeal of
 major apartheid legislation in 1990 and 1991. Under the present Constitution,
 blacks remain unable to participate in national elections or in most local elections,
 except in segregated townships or homelands. President de Klerk announced in late
 1992that no further national elections or byelections would take place until all
 South Africans become eligible to vote. De facto racial discrimination is prevalent
 in many areas of life. As noted above, despite repeal of the Population Registration
 Act, persons born before 1991 remain classified in the race group to which they were
 assigned at birth. The Government continues to discriminate in the payment of old
 age pensions, with whites receiving the highest annuity, 'cloureds and Indians
 somewhat less, and blacks the least. In recent years, however, rates have ap-
 proached parity.
 Education is, perhaps, the most crucial area of continuing race discrimination; per
 pupil spending on whites is roughy four times that spent on blacks. The Govern.
 ment has admitted that the inequty is unacceptable and is moving progressively
 to eliminate this bias, but main s that it cannot allot more than the present 20
 percent of the national budget for education. It also notes that to cut white spending
 to the current level for blacks would generate insufficient savings to upgrade edu-
 cation  for the vast black  m jority significantly. In  1992 the Government
 semiprivatized most white schools, requiring parents to assume a significant share
 of the costs through payment of school fees.
 White public schools formerly were prohibited from enrolling blacks. Effective in
 1991, parents at each school were allowed to vote to determine the racial admittance
 policy of the school, provided that at least 50 percent of the student body remained
 white. Bowing to public pressure, the Government also began allowing white schools
 that had closed due to shreining enrollments to reopen as fully nonracia schools.
 Legislation enacted in June 1991 followint repeal of the Group Areas Act enables
 local neighborhoods to establish their own norms and standards regarding local
 living conditions. This measure may serve to perpetuate disriminatory housing pat-
 terns. In 1991 Parliament repealedthe Land Acts of 1913 and 1938, which limited
 land ownership in rural areas to whites. Blacks deemed to be citizens of one of the
 supposedy independent homelands no longer face legal restrictionon  where they
 canlive, accordin  i to the Department for Home Affairs.
 
 
 252
 South Africa's Defense Act requires all citizens to serve in the militaiy except "fe-
 males or persons who are not white." In 1992 the Pretoria Supreme Court upheld
 this statute against arguments that such race4ased conscription could not be en-
 forced because of the repeal of the Population Registration Act. The Court ruled that
 for the purpose of the Defense Act, the definition of 'whites! still had legal effect.
 Sex discrimination remains a serious problem in South Africa, particularly against
 black women. In many, if not most cases, women of all races donot receive equal
 pay for equal work. Benefits in the workplace, including higher pensions and pref-
 erential home loans, are often restricted to men on the grounds that they are most
 likely to be heads of households. Black women teachers who marry lose their home
 loans, and in KwaZulu women teachers who become pregnant must resign imme-
 diately.
 Women in all racial proups-particularly blacks--still suffer from legal, cultural,
 and economic discrimination. Tditional African customs discriminate against
 women in South Africa's black homelands. In many areas a woman is legally and
 traditionally a minor and cannot sign contracts or own property. She is under the
 authority of her father before marriage, and her husband afterward. However, some
 reforms are under way. In the homelands of KwaZulu and the Ciskei, a woman's
 right to own some forms of property is now recognized. Violence against women of
 all races is a serious problem, particularly because very little legal redress exists.
 South Africa's rape incidence is believed to be among the highest in the world, more
 than double that of the United States. A South African sociologist estimates, based
 on police figures, that 750,000 women are raped each year, with only 1 rape in 20
 reported. Marital rape is not considered a crime. A husband may be charged for as-
 sault accompanying a rape, but courts will not convict upon the evidence of the
 woman alone. There are no government-subsidized programs or counseling centers
 for abused women, except for overextended welfare and social workers.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-South Africa's Labor Relations Act entitles all work-
 ers in the private sector to join trade unions of their choosing. In 1979 legislation
 granted blacks full status as employees with the right to form free and independent
 trade unions. Membership in South Africa's 200 registered trade unions was ap.
 proximately 2.75 million in 1992. An additional 300,000 workers are members of the
 47 unregistered unions, bringing union membership to over 3 million workers or 45
 percent of the employed, economicall active population. Probably more than half of
 all union members are black. The Laor Relations Act does not cover domestic serv-
 ants, farmworkers, or public servants thus hindering trade union organizing in
 those sectors. However, the Ministry of Manpower agreed, in an agreement reached
 in November with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), South
 Africa's largest trade union confederation, to extend the Labor Relations Act to do-
 mestic servants and farmworkers during the 1993 parliamentary session.
 While South Africa's unions are formally independent of direct government con-
 trol, the legacy of apartheid continues to affect all aspects of industrial relations.
 Union suspicion of employer and government intent, management's often uncompro-
 mising attitude during negotiations, and the rapid politicization of major strikes cre-
 ate a tense and sometimes violent atmosphere which exacerbates industrial conflict.
 COSATU continues to accuse the Government of attempting to undermine trade
 union activity and organization through intimidation and violence. Specifically,
 COSATU alleges thatthe United Workers Union of South Africa (UWUSA), linked
 to the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and until 1991 secretly financed by the Govern-
 ment, has sent scabs to break strikes and led violent and sometimes deadly attacks
 against COSATU members. COSATU claims that at least 45 of its members were
 killed during 1992 in violence directed against legitimate union activities.
 As a result of South Africa's pre-1990 ban on black political parties, trade unions
 played an im rtant political role during the midto late-1980's struggle against
 apartheid, and they continue to exercise important political influence. COSATU is
 formally aligied with the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African
 Communist Party (SACP). South Africa's second largest trade union federation, the
 National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU), while officially independent from politi-
 cal groups, has considerable contact with the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) and the
 Azanian Peoples' Organization (AZAPO). Beth federations have supported general
 strikes and boycotts as useful tools to pressure the Government.
 Since 1979 all private sector workers, regardless of race, have had the right under
 law to strike. Industrial action during the first 9 months of 1992 was up nearly 50
 percent over the comparable 1991 period, with strikes accounting for more than 3
 million lost man-days. Nearly 75 percent of strike activity in 1992 was provoked by
 
 
 wage disputes. Grievances, dismissals, and discipline accounted for the remaining
 25 percent.
 South African law prohibits all public employees from striking, a prohibition
 COSATU alleges is too broad and not in keeping with internationally recognized
 practice. Each minister, in consultation with appropriate offices and advisory bodies,
 determines annual wage increases for his or her ministry, and legislation governing
 each public service sector establishes machinery for collective bargaining with staff
 associations. The cumbersome nature of this process and a lack of effective dispute
 resolution mechanisms make public sector bargaining contentious and a potential
 industrial relations flash point. The Government sought to introduce new public sec-
 tor labor legislation during the 1992 special parliamentary session. Opposition to
 the legislation by COSATU and other trade unions delayed submission of the legis-
 lation. The Ministry of Manpower has since agreed to consult with COSATU on this
 legislation.
 South Africa does not restrict union affiliation with regional or international labor
 organizations. The country's two largest confederations, COSATU and NACTU, are
 affiliated internationally only with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 Many of their affiliates, as well as independent unions, are members of inter-
 national trade secretariats and have developed contacts with their counterparts in
 North America and Western Europe.
 Although a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) from its incep-
 tion in 1919, South Africa withdrew from the Organization in 1964 but remains
 bound by the 12 ILO conventions it has ratified. In 1988 COSATU lodged a com-
 plaint through ECOSOC with the ILO against the Government, claiming that
 amendments made that year to South Africa's Labor Relations Act give preference
 to racially constituted unions and abridge the right to strike. The Government de-
 clined to accept ILO jurisdiction over the complaint until February 1991, when it
 invited the organization to send a fact-finding mission to South Africa. Even though
 the immediate cause of COSATU's petition to the 110 had been resolved by 1991,
 the designated ILO fact-finding and conciliation commission on freedom of associa-
 tion visited South Africa. In June 1992 it made a number of recommendations re-
 garding how South Africa could bring its labor laws into line with internationally
 accepted standards. In a November agreement with COSATU, the Ministry of Man-
 ower agreed to establish a consultative process with COSATU to determine how
 uth Africa could implement the ILO recommendations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--South African labor law now
 provides a statutory structure for collective bargaining, including the establishment
 of industrial councils, the registration and regulation of trade unions, trade union
 federations, and employer organizations, as well as mediation, conciliation, and arbi-
 tration procedures to resolve industrial disputes. This structure has effectively
 eliminated direct government interference in private sector union organizing and
 collective bargaining. South African law prhibits discrimination by private sector
 employers against union members and organizers. Disputes over recognition in the
 private sector are few.
 Historically, black unions were excluded from the statutory system of industrial
 councils. Nevertheless, black unions developed a plant-level collective-bargaining
 tradition of their own. Typically, many employers established pollective bargaining
 relations with shop unions on the basis of majority representation. The 1979 Labor
 Relations Act, and its subsequent amendments, included black unions within the
 statutory structure of industrial councils and formalized black union participation
 in collective bargaining, both at plant and industry levels.
 COSATU will reenter the National Manpower Commission (NMC), a tripartite ad-
 visory body to the Ministry of Manpower, in January 1993. This follows the Novem-
 ber 1992 COSATU-Ministry of Manpower agreement in which the Ministry prom-
 ised to submit to the 1993 Parliament the legislation necessary to extend basic labor
 law to farm and domestic workers. Should the Government comply with its agree-
 ment, labor law regarding collective bargaining will be extended to farm and domes-
 tic workers a significant portion of the working population.
 South Arica's labor law does not apply to the so-called homelands, where labor
 legislation has not matched South Africa's and union organizing is often actively
 discouraged. Nevertheless, trade union organizing and activity is on the increase in
 almost all of South Africa's homelands. Some, such as Transkei and Ciskei, have
 responded to pressure by slowly bringing their labor legislation closer to inter-
 national standards. Others, such as Bophuthatswana, have tightened limits on
 trade union activity. South African trade union confederations such as COSATU see
 free trade union activity in the homelands as an important priority. In the Novem-
 ber 1992 agreement, the Ministry of Manpower agreed to establish a consultative
 process to explore harmonization of South African and homeland labor law.

 Private mediation services are available and have been voluntarily resorted to by
 management and black trade unions to resolve industrial disputes. The Labor Rela-
 tions Act establishes the Industrial Court to rule in labor-management disputes,
 and its decisions appear to be balanced. The most common complaints filed with the
 Court concern dismissals, followed by unfair labor practices. A Labor Court of Ap-
 peals oversees the Industrial Court and can overturn its decisions.
 South Africa has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-South Africa does not constitu-
 tionally prohibit forced labor however, the country's system of Roman-Dutch cm-
 mon law does not permit it, and it is not practiced. Relief workers in the
 Mozambican refugee areas allege that refugees who work on South African farms
 are paid significantly less than minimum     and that farmers sometimes turn
 in such workers to the authorities immediatelybefor payday to be deported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The B asic Conditions of Employ-
 ment Act prohibits the emp[oyent of minors under age 15 in most industries,
 shops, and offices. The Mines and Works Act prohibits minors under 16 from work-
 ing underground. There is no restriction, however, on the age at which a person
 may work in agriculture. Legislation is only partially enforced by the Ministry of
 Manpower and the Mineral and Energy Affairs Ministry. One of the best known and
 documented instances of underaged employment is young boys employed in black
 township coalyards.
 Education is compulsory for all white and "colourd" children until they reach the
 age of 16 or pass the 10th grade and for Asian children until age 15. There is no
 compulsory education for black children. The Department of Education and Culture
 effectively enforces compulsory education for white children. It is less diligent in en-
 forcing it for coloured" and Asian children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legal minimum wage in South Afri-
 ca. The Labor Relations Act instead provides a mechanism for negotiations between
 labor and management to set minimum wage standards industry by industry. At
 present over 100 industries covering most nonagricultural workers come under the
 provisions of the Act.
 Establishing a "living wage," or a subsistence-level minimum wage has been an-
 other priority goal of most industrywide unions. A survey by the Labour Research
 Service found that of 17 sectors surveyed, only one paid a minimum wage above
 what was estimated to be a "living wage." Further, the average minimum wage was
 some 30 percent below the living wage. Wages paid unskilled workers, especially do-
 mestic servants and agriculturalworkers, are often significantly less.
 Most industries have a standard workweek of 46 hours (which is also the well-
 enforced legal maximum), as well as vacation and sick leave. Overtime is voluntary
 and limited to 10 hours a week. The law does not mandate a 24-hour rest break.
 The Basic Conditions of Employment Act which legislates minimum    workplace
 standards does notyet apply to agricultural workers and domestic servants. Their
 work conditions andthose of workers in the homelands depend on the good will of
 their employers and range from acceptable to deplorable.
 The state-funded National Occupational and Safety Association claims that the
 Ministry of Manpower effectively enforces government-legislated minimum stand-
 ards ibr workplace environment; nevertheless, in some industries, injury or even
 death at the workplace is still common. For example, the National Union of
 Mineworkers reports that an average of two workers are killed every day in mine
 accidents.
 South African occupational safety and health laws, while requiring employers not
 to place their workers at unreasonable risk, do not give workers the right to remove
 themselves from a hazardous job. An employee's decision to leave a hazardous work-
 site could possibly lead to dismissal, but more probably would result in disciplinary
 action. The occupational safety and health laws do provide protection for workers
 who report or file complaints against unsafe working conditions. Such workers may
 not be diismissed or reduced in rank or salary because of their actions.
