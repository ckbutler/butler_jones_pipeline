 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic ruled by a democratically elected govern-
 ment. President Zhelyu Zhelev, former chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces
 (UDF), was elected in 1992 to a 5-year term in the country's first direct presidential
 elections. Prime Minister Lyuben Berv, who headed the government after the fall
 of the UDF government in 1992, lacked a stable parliamentary majority during 1993
 and 1994 and was forced to depend on the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), heir to
 the Communist party, for much of his support. Nevertheless, he resigned in Septem-
 ber. When the sitting parliament failed to form a new cabinet, President Zhelev dis-
 solved the Parliament, called for new parliamentary elections in December, and ap-
 pointed a caretaker Government for the interim. Results of the December 18 elec-
 tions gave the BSP an absolute majority in Parliament.
 Most security services are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, which
 controls the police, National Security Service (NSS--civilian counterintelligence), in-
 ternal security troops, border guards, and special forces. The President oversees the
 National Intelligence Service (foreign intelligence). In June Parliament passed a bill
 regulating NSS activities. There were some allegations of police abuse toward Roma.
 The transformation of a centrally planned economy into a market-oriented system
 has been retarded by continued political and social resistance. The service and
 consumer goods sectors in private hands continued to grow, but progress in the pri-
 vatization of large and medium-sized state enterprises was very slow. Integration
 with Western security and economic structures continued, and an association agree-
 ment with the European Union entered into force. The Government reached agree-
 ment with its commercial creditors to restructure $8 billion of defaulted commercial
 debt, concluded a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund, and
 negotiated structural adjustment loans with the World Bank.
 The Government generally respected freedom of speech, press, association, assem-
 bly, and travel, but xenophobia, nationalism, and antiethnic expression grew mark-
 edly among the population at large. Government actions and the rising level of pub-
 lic intolerance significantly interfered with the activities of some non-Eastern Ortho-
 dox religious groups. Police beatings of Roma during arrest continued, albeit on a
 reduced scale; there were no reports that the Government tried and convicted any
 of the perpetrators. Private citizens increasingly attacked Roma and other minority
 groups. The Constitution's provisions against ethnically based political parties con-
 tinued to hamper political expression. Parliament, over President Zhelev's objec-
 tions, passed a judicial reform bill which could have resulted in removal from office
 of the sitting Chief Prosecutor and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a move
 eventually blocked by a Constitutional Court decision.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Itegrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KiUling.-According to human rights observers
 and journalists, the body of a Pazardzhik resident who died while in police custody
 following an August roundup of suspected criminals in that town showed traces of
 beating on the head and body and burn marks on the genitals. The man died 2 days
 after his detention during the roundup, which was carried out by police from Sofia
 and several other regions of the country. Police and one human rights group have
 initiated an investigation.
 On September 25, a detainee died 1 day after being taken into custody by the re-
 gional police department of Pleven. The death is attributed to anemia, embolism,
 and hematoma on the death certificate; however, a witness told a human rights non-
 governmental organization (NGO) that the body displayed facial injuries. The family
 
 
 765
 of the deceased plans to pursue the case by requesting an investigation, and police
 have indicated that they would be cooperative.
 A police investigation of a 1993 incident in which police allegedly beat three es-
 caped prisoners upon recapture, initiated in January by the Sofia prosecutor's office,
 was referred to the National Investigative Service in September for further inves-
 tigation. Two of the prisoners in that incident were reportedly beaten to death. The
 police have generally refused the requests of human rights groups to make reports
 of its investigations public. The climate of impunity that the Government allows to
 prevail is the single largest obstacle to ending such abuses.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported instances of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture, cruel, inhuan, or degrading treat-
 ment, forcible assimilation, and subjection to medical, scientific or other experimen-
 tation without consent.
 There continued to be a number of credible reports, although fewer than during
 1993, that police beat Roma upon arrest or during other confrontations. Human
 rights groups also complained of police brutality directed at non-Roma citizens. To
 date, the Government has failed to convict and punish any police personnel for bru-
 tality a.ainst civilians.
 Conditions in some prisons are substandard, although they do not appear to
 threaten life or health. Prisoners' complaints continued to receive media coverage,
 which in some cases resulted in improved treatment. The Government cooperated
 with requests by NGO's to monitor prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for access to
 legal counsel from the time of detention. Judicial authorities must rule on the legal-
 ity of a detention within 24 hours. Defendants have the right to visits by family
 members, to examine evidence, and to know the charges against them. Charges may
 not be made public without the permission of the Chief Prosecutor. Pretrial deten-
 tion is limited to 2 months under normal circumstances, although the Chief Prosecu-
 tor may extend this to 6 months and may also restart the process.
 About 30 percent of Bulgaria's approximately 8,500 prison inmates are in pretrial
 detention. In the event of a conviction, time spent in pretrial detention is credited
 toward the sentence. The Constitution provides for bail, and some detainees have
 been released under this provision although bail is not widely used. Neither inter-
 nal nor external exile is used as a irm or punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Pubic _r_.-The Constitution grants the judiciary independent
 and coequal status with the legislative and executive branches. The court system
 consists of regional courts, district courts, and the Supreme and Constitutional
 Courts. A 25-member Supreme Judicial Council appoints judges who, after serving
 for 3 years, are assured of tenure, xept under limited, specified circumstances.
 The Constitutional Court is empowered to rescind legislation it considers uncon-
 stitutional, settle disputes over the conduct of general elections, and resolve conflicts
 over the division of powers between the various branches of government. Of the 12
 justices on the Constitutional Court, whose term of office is 9 years, a third are
 elected by the National Assembly, a third appointed by the President, and a third
 elected by judicial authorities. Military courts handle cases involving military per-
 sonnel and some cases involving national security matters. The Constitutional Court
 does not have specific jurisdiction in matters of military justice.
 The Constitution stipulates that all courts shall conduct hearings in public unless
 the proceedings involve state security or state secrets. In one case, the defense law-
 yer for indicted mayor Yusuf Djudjo complained he had been given inadequate ac-
 cess to witnesses (see below). Defendants have the right to know the charges against
 them and are given ample time to prepare a defense. The right of appeal is guaran-
 teed and widely used. Defendants in criminal proceedings have the right to confront
 witnesses and to have an attorney, provided by the State, if necessary, in serious
 cases.
 In June Parliament passed a judicial reform bill which established separate Su-
 preme Courts of Cassation (civil and criminal appeal) and Administration. Nearly
 all observers welcomed the law's comprehensive reforms as improvements in the ju-
 dicial system, consistent with the Constitution. However, several elements proved
 controversial, particularly one establishing the requirement that high-level judicial
 figures, including the Chief Prosecutor, the Director of the National Investigative
 Service, and the Presidents of the Supreme Courts have not only 15 years' experi-
 ence within the legal system but also 5 years' experience as a jude, prosecutor, i-
 vestigator, or law researcher with academic rank In effect, this requirement dis-
 qualified anyone who had not held such positions under the Communist regime, in-
 cluding sitting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Ivan Grigorov and Chief Prosecu-
 tor Ivan Tatarchev. Parliament by a majority vote overruled President Zhelev's ob-
 
 
 766
 jection to this provision. The President then petitioned the Constitutional Court for
 a ruling. The Court held that Grigorov and Tatarchev could not be removed from
 office, but that the experience requirement was otherwise valid and would apply to
 future selections for these posts.
 Most observers agreed that the judiciary, while generally independent, struggled
 with continuing problems in 1994. In addition to the confusion created by the reform
 bill, it is plagued by relatively low salaries, many unfilled positions, and a heavy
 backlog of cases which sparked complaints that pretrial detention is excessive _
 lengthy. Partly as a legacy of communism, and partly because of the court systems
 structural andpersnnel problems, most citizens have little confidence in their judi-
 cial system.
 A number of criminal cases against former leaders for alleged abuses during the
 Communist period were carried forward in 1994. In January a Supreme Court panel
 upheld the 1992 conviction of former dictator Todor Zhivkov for abuse of power in-
 valving personal expense accounts and state privileges. Zhivkov's sentence was
 upheld by one review panel but remains suspended pending further supervisory re-
 view by the Supreme Court. A second case begun in 1993 involving a charge of em-
 bezzlement for giving grant aid to Communist parties in other countries (the "Mos-
 cow case") moved forward slowly. In another case, 43 former high-level Communists
 were indicted in 1994 for having given grant aid during the 1980's to then friendiy
 governments in the developing world such as Cuba, Angola, and ihbya. Some
 human rights observers criticized these and previous indictments, asserting the ac-
 tivities in question were political and economic in nature not criminal acts. The
 Chief Prosecutor responded that the transfer of funds had teen carried out without
 parliamentary approval and was thus illegal. President Zhelev in August pardoned
 on grounds ofl    ealth former Prime Minister Georgi Atanasov, convicte in 1993
 of embezzlement of state funds, and he was release from prison. Former Minister
 of Economy and Planning Stoyan Ovcharov, convicted on the same charge, remained
 in . sn.
 ]ttle progress was made in a case begun in 1993 concerning the forced assimila-
 tion and expulsion of ethnic Turks in 1984-85 and 1989. Human rights groups com-
 plain that local prosecutors and magistrates sometimes fail vigorously to pursue
 crimes committed against minorities. In a trial relating to the notorious death
 camps set up by the Communists after they came to power in 1944, 3 defendants
 were charge  with the murder of 14 camp inmates. A key witness in the case was
 murdered in September and some speculated that her murder was intended to frus-
 trate the prosecution of the case. Police authorities initiated an investigation. The
 trial, itself, has been delayed further while replacements are found for two jurors.
 A controversial 1992 "lustration7 act ("Law for Additional Requirements Toward
 Scientific Organizations and the Higher Certifying Commission") known as the
 "Panev law" continued in effect in 1994. Under this law, former secretaries and
 members of Communist party committees are barred from positions as academic
 council members, university department heads, deans, rectors, and chief editors of
 science magazines. By one conservative estimate, a total of 1,637 people have lost
 positions in academic institutions alone due to application of the Panev Law. The
 Act applies a presumption of collective guilt that conflicts with international human
 rights standards.
 In October 1993, a local prosecutor removed Satovcha mayor Yusuf Djudjo from
 office on charges that he had falsified official documents and abused his administra-
 tive powers by intimidating Pomaks (Muslims of Slavic ancestry). The charge of in-
 timidation was later dropped for lack of evidence, but Djudjo was convicted in 1994
 on the charge of falsifying documents and given a suspended sentence. An examina-
 tion of the documents in question suggests that the changes made were minor and
 without significant ethnic implication, e.g., changing the name "Asan" to "Hasan,"
 or "Ibraimova" to "Ibrahimova." Despite protests by Dudjo's awyer that he had in-
 adequate access to witnesses, the Supreme Court upheld Djudjo's conviction. Human
 rights groups, including Amnesty International, protested that the proceedings
 showed clear bias against the defendant. They also complained that provisions in
 the Penal Procedural Code give prosecutors the right to remove appointed and elect-
 ed officials, who have little satisfactory recourse.
 Bulgaria has no political prisoners, although it appears that political motives lie
 behind some indictments of former Communist leaders on a variety of charges.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for inviolability of the home, protects the freedom and con-
 fidentiality of correspondence, and provides for the right to choose one's place of
 work and residence. Parliament passed a bill in June regulating the activities of the
 NSS which is responsible for civilian counterintelligence. The law allows the Inte-
 rior Minister to authorize electronic surveillance for up to 24 hours without inform-
 
 
 ing other government agencies, if he determines there is imminent danger to na-
 tional security. Some human rights groups asserted that the Government has car-
 ried out unjustified surveillance of religious groups and of the outlawed Macedonian
 group UMO-Ilinden (see Section 2.b.). Laor-ea er Krustyo Petkov charged that se-
 curity services monitored union activities during the period before a threatened gen-
 eral strike in May.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution prohibits censorship of the
 press and mass media, and the Government generally respected this prohibition.
 The variety of newspapers published by political parties and other organizations
 represented the full spectrum of political opinion, and foreign newspapers circulated
 without hindrance. A notable degree of self-censorship exists in the press among
 journalists who believe the, must conform to what are often heavily politicized edi-
 torial views. Large financial groups hold controlling interests in many nominally
 independent national dailies and in some cases intervened directly to control edi-
 torial content.
 Following an October 1993 newspaper article which accused a high-level prosecu-
 tor of using his position to acquire an apartment at a low price, the Chief Prosecutor
 issued a warrant to begin an mvestigation of the case. The Union of Bulgarian Jour-
 nalists and human ights groups complained the warrant did not specify charges
 and amounted to an effort to intimidate the press. On March 31, the Sofia Regional
 Court terminated the case for technical reasons, effectively closing the case. In No-
 vember, the press reported, the Chief Prosecutor's Office began a preliminary pro-
 ceeding against the editor in chief of the Bulgarian Socialist Parys daily news-
 paper, charging him with insulting the President in an earlier article. The President
 said that he did not need the "protective measures" taken by the Chief Prosecutor's
 Office, and the Deputy Chief Prosecutor characterized the action as only an "exam-
 ination" rather than a preliminary proceeding. Nevertheless, some observers
 thought the incident might have a negative effect on freedom of the press in Bul-
 garia.
 Most television broadcasting is in state hands and under parliamentary super-
 vision. Two channels broadcast in Bulgarian, while a third broadcasts Russian pro-
 gramming, and a fourth broadcasts a mixture of Cable News Network inter-
 national, and French-language programming. Bulgaria's first private television
 channel received a license in 1993 and began limited broadcasting in July 1994. For-
 eign government radio programs, such as those of the British Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion and the Voice of America, had unrestricted access to commercial Bulgarian
 radio frequencies. Television and radio news programs present opposition views but
 are generally seen as being biased in favor of the Government. There are no formal
 restrictions on programming. Some political groups complained that coverage was
 one-sided, although they acknowledged that their representatives were interviewed
 regularly by media journalists. Both television and radio provide a variety of news
 and public interest programming, including talk format and public opinion shows.
 More than 30 independent radio stations are licensed in Bulgaria. The Govern-
 ment twice required Radio Aura of the American University in Blagoevgrad to stop
 broadcasting, and it complained of harassment; the Government correctly asserted
 that the station was broadcasting beyond its licensed area of operations and had
 never gone through the procedure to obtain an appropriate license. Other private
 stations complained that their licenses unduly restricted the strength of their trans-
 missions in comparison to state-owned stations. Some Turkish-language broadcast-
 ing takes place. The Government owns all radio transmitter facilities.
 Private -book publishing remained active, with more than 50 publishers in busi-
 ness. With the notable exception of the Panev law described in Section .e., there
 was continued academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to peaceful and unarmed assembly. Permits from municipal authorities are
 required for rallies and assemblies held outdoors, and most legally registered orga-
 nizations were routinely granted permission to assemble. Many non-Orthodox reli-
 gious groups reported difficulties obtaining permits for outdoor assemblies as well
 as for renting assembly halls. Vigorous political rallies and demonstrations were a
 common occurrence and took place without government interference.
 Bulgaria, as a member state of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Eu-
 rope, has undertaken to respect the rights of individuals and groups freely to estab-
 lish their own political parties or other political organizations. Despite this under-
 taking, there are constitutional and statutory restrictions that limit the right of as-
 sociation and meaningful participation in the political process. For example, Article
 44 of the Constitution prohibits organizations which threaten the country's terri-
 
 
 768
 torial integrity or unity or that incite racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. It barred
 a Macedonian rights group, UMO-Ilinden, from legal registration since 1990 on the
 grounds that it espouses separatist views. Police in 1994 forcibly broke up its at-
 tempts to hold public meetings. TMO-Ilinden, a related cultural group, had its legal
 registration suspended in 1993 at the request of the Chief Prosecutor. George
 Solunski, leader of this ogrup, was arrested in June 1993 on a charge of attempted
 murder for allegedly firing a shot at a political opponent. The murder charge was
 drop ped, but Solunski was kept in pretrial detention on a charge of hooliganism
 untl January 1994. The case remains open.
 The Constitution forbids the formation of political parties along religious, ethnic,
 or racial lines and prohibits citizens' associations from engaging in political activity.
 These restrictions were used in 1991 to challenge the legitimacy of the Movement
 for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), which has a mainly Muslim constituency. A 1991
 Constitutional Court ruling preserved the party's legal status. Some observers be-
 lieve the Court's ruling was definitive, while other believe the MRF remains vulner-
 able to a new challenge to its legal status. Its right to compete in the National As-
 sembly elections held on December 18 was not challenged.
 A Roma party, denied registration in 1991 on the grounds it was ethnically based,
 chose not to challenge this stricture in 1994. A party which professes to represent
 the interests of Bulgaria's Pomak (Muslim of Slavic descent) population was reg-
 istered as a political party. To date, its legal status has not been challenged.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The ability of a number of religious groups to operate
 freely came under attack in Bulgaria in 1994, both as a result of government action
 and because of a rising tide of public intolerance. Dozens of articles in a broad range
 of newspapers depicted lurid and inaccurate pictures of the activities of non-Ortho-
 dox religious groups, attributing teen suicides and the breakup of families to the ac-
 tivities of these religious groups.
 The Government refused visas and residence permits for missionaries, and some
 came under physical attack in the street and in their homes. A skinhead group at-
 tacked the Bulgarian Church of God in Ruse during a religious service, seriously
 injuring eight people. Members of the Mormon Church complained of continued acts
 of harassment, with limited, indifferent police response.
 Credible charges of police complicity were raised by a human rights organization
 and the press in the April 15 shooting death of Yordan Tsolov, an Orthodox priest
 in Surnitsa. Reports differ as to why a police officer shot at the priest but a human
 rights organization cited eyewitness accounts that material facts about the case
 were misreported. To date, no criminal proceedings have been initiated.
 Parliament passed amendments to the Families and Persons Act, tightening reg-
 istration requirements for groups whose activities had a religious e ement. More
 than 75 groups which had originally registered with the courts as civil organizations
 were given 3 months to apply for reregistration through the Religious Affairs Direc-
 trat. Afer review by the Directorate and the Council of Ministers more than two-
 thirds of them were denied legal registration. Among those turned down were a Bul-
 garian chapter of Gideon Interational, Jehovah's Witnesses, and several Muslim
 groups. Human rights groups protested this action as unconstitutional on the
 grounds that it was an executive branch revocation of a judicial branch action and
 that it denied religious freedom. Gideon International and some other groups are
 reapplying, which they are free to do.
 Human rights groups credibly charged that the NSS had conducted surveillance
 and infiltration of religious groups, including those legally registered. A teacher in
 Karlovo was fired on the grounds that she had proselytized students, although she
 claimed she had mentione her adherence to Jehovah's Witnesses only after normal
 school hours.
 The Constitution designates Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the "traditional" re-
 ligion of Bulgaria. A number of major religious bodies, including the Muslim and
 Jewish communities, receive government financial support. For those religious
 groups that were able to maintain their registration, there were no restrictions on
 attendance at religious services or on private religious instruction. A school for
 mains, a Muslim Cultural Center, university theological faculties, and religious pri-
 mary schools operated freely. Many new mosques were constructed, primarily in the
 southern re~ions. Bibles and other religious materials in the Bulgarian language
 were freely imported and printed, and Muslim, Catholic, and Jewish publications
 were published on a regular basis.
 The schism which opened in the Orthodox Church in 1992 persisted in 1994.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement within the country and the right to leave it are
 constitutionally enshrined and not limited in practice, with the exception that some
 areas along the border are off limits beth to foreigners and Bulgarians not resident
 
 
 769
 therein. Every citizen has the right to return to Bulgaria, may not be forcibly expa-
 triated, and may not be deprived of citizenship acquired by birth. A number of
 former political emigrants were granted passports and returned to visit or live in
 Bulgaria. Bulgaria pursued agreements with Poland and Germany for the repatri-
 ation of thousands of Bulgarians illegally resident in those countries.
 Bulgarian law provides for the granting of asylum to persons persecuted for their
 opinions or activities based on standards in the 1951 Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. Estimates of the number of illegal aliens
 resident in Bulgaria range from 15,000 to 30,000. Bulgaria often serves as a tem-
 porary refuge for third-country nationals seekin to travel to the West. Approxi-
 mately 600 refugees have applied for asylum. A Bureau of Territorial Asylum and
 Refugees, established in 1993 is preparing to process applications for refugee sta-
 tus. Protests by skinhead and local citizens' groups, however, have frustrated the
 Bureau's plans to establish a refugee processing center in the Sofia area as of No-
 vember 1, and attempts to locate centers at alternate sites in the country have like-
 wise failed.
 Approximately 100 to 150 persons fleeing the conflict in the former Yugoslavia are
 resident in Eulga   and have received assistance from the Government and the
 United Nations-Iigh Commissioner for Refugees; an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 more
 have not registeredofficially and are staying with friends and relatives.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and head of state through the
 election of the President and of the members of the unicameral National Assembly,
 although restrictions on political parties based on religious, ethnic, or racial identi-
 ties have the effect of circumscribing access to the political process (see Section 2.b.).
 President Zhelyu Zhelev was elected in 1992 in the first direct presidential elections.
 The most recent parliamentary elections took place in December 1994 when more
 than 40 political parties and coalitions participated and approximately 75 percent
 of the electorate voted. The Bulgarian Socialist Party won an absolute majority of
 the 240-seat Parliament, which i to be convened no later than 1 month after its
 election, according to the Constitution. International observers commented that the
 vote was conducted in accordance with free and democratic election procedures and
 in a peaceful, well-organized fashion. However, CSCE and other observers voiced
 concern about the unequal access to the mass media for all political parties, particu-
 larly to television.
 The Constitution provides for elections by secret ballot. The 240 parliamentary
 deputies are elected by a proportional system from party lists. Their term is for 4
 years, altough he Constituton prvies fr preterm elections if Parliament is un-
 able to agree on a government. Suffrage is universal at the age of 18. A distinct
 separation of powers exists between the Government (Prime Minister and Council
 of Ministers) and the President, who is Chief of State. The President has limited
 powers and is elected for a term of 5 years.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in government. A
 number of women held elected and appointed office atIhigh levels; the Prime Min-
 ister of the preelection caretaker Government and a Deputy Prime Minister, who
 also served as Finance Minister, were women. However women held only 15 percent
 of the seats in the most recent Parliament and no dabinet-level positions in the
 Berov government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely. Among these is the
 Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, founded in 1992 and formally affiliated with the
 international Helsinki organization in 1993. A separate group, called Helsinki
 Watch, is not affiliated with the International Helsinki Federation. Another group,
 the Human Rights Project, actively investigated police-Roma clashes and made ef-
 forts to work with the Ministry ofthe Interior and local officials. The Government
 did not interfere with the work of NGO's and human rights groups, although it was
 often reluctant to provide information or active cooperation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual riohts, equality, and protection against
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particularly against
 women and Rema.
 Women.-The Constitution forbids privileges or restrictions of rights on the basis
 of sex. However, women face discrimination both in terms of recruitment for employ-
 
 
 770
 ment and the likelihood of layoffs. Official figures show the rate of unemployment
 for women to be higher than that for men, and this gap appears to be widening.
 While women are equally likely to attend university, some single mothers report dif-
 ficulty in finding housing, either for financial reasons or because their needs are
 perceived to be less compelling. Women, in the main, continue to have primary re-
 sponsibility for child-rearing and housekeeping even if they are employed outside
 the home.
 The courts prosecute rape, although it remains an underreported crime because
 some stigma still attaches to the victim. The maximum sentence for rape is 8 years;
 convicted offenders often receive a shorter sentence or early parole. Marital rape is
 a crime but rarely prosecuted. Human rights and women's groups say that domestic
 abuse is a serious problem, but there are no figures, official or otherwise, on its oc-
 currence. Courts and prosecutors tend to view domestic abuse as a family rather
 than criminal problem, and in most cases victims of domestic violence take refuge
 with family or friends rather than approaching the authorities. No government
 agencies provide shelter or counseling for such individuals, and there are no active
 programs to address the problem.
 Many of the approximately 30 women's organizations in Bulgaria are closely asso-
 ciated with political parties or have primarily professional agendas. Of those which
 exist mainly to defend women's interests, the two largest are the Women's Demo-
 cratic Union of Bulgaria, heir to the group that existed under the Zhivkov dictator-
 ship, and the Bulgarian Women's Association, which disappeared under communism
 but has now reemerged and has chapters in a number of cities.
 Children.-The Government appears to be committed to protecting children's wel-
 fare. It maintains, for example a sizable network of orphanages throughout the
 country. Groups that exist to defend the rights of children charge that an increasing
 number of children are at serious risk because the Government's social insurance
 ayments fall farther behind inflation and are often disbursed as much as 6 months
 The vast majority of some 2 million children are free from societal abuse, al-
 though skinhead gups beat some Roma children, particularly the homeless or
 abandoned. Some Eoma minors were forced into prostitution by family or commu-
 nity members; there was little police effort to address these problem of discrimina-
 tion.
 National /Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic Turks and Roma make up the two
 largest minorities, each constituting from 6 to 9 percent of the population. Pomaks
 constitute the other sizable minority, comprising 2 to 3 percent of the population.
 Sometimes referred to as Bulgarian Muslims, Pomaks are a distinct grup of Slavic
 descent whose ancestors converted from Orthodox Christianity to Islam. Most are
 Muslim, although a handful have become atheists or reconverted to Christianity.
 There are no restrictions on the practice of Muslim religious traditions, the speak-
 ing of Turkish in public, or the use of non-Slavic names. A defense bill before Par-
 liament sparked controversy when deputies proposed Ian a e that would make use
 of the Bulgarian language mandatory in the military. %3 leaders charged this
 might lead to harassment of Turkish-speaking military recruits. An eventual com-
 promise in the text of the draft bill made Bulgarian the official language of the mill-
 tary the Minister of Defense stated publicly that recruits who wished to speak
 Turkish among themselves were free to do so.
 Voluntary Turkish-language classes, funded by the Government, continued and
 expanded in areas with signficantTurkish-speaking populations. Some ethnic Turk-
 ish leaders, mainly in the MRF, demanded that Turkish-language schooling be
 made compulsory in ethnic Turkish areas, but the Government resisted this. Gov-
 ernment regulations issued in September specify that pupils may begn study of a
 non-Bulgarian mother tongue in the first grade rather than in the third grade, as
 had been the case previously.
 BSP and nationalist figures, as well as members of the Internal Macedonian Rev-
 olutionary Organization, continued to accuse some members of the ethnic Turkish
 community of "forcible Turkification," i.e., pressuring Pomaks to declare themselves
 ethnic Turks and take Turkish names. Independent observers found community and
 peer pressure but no evidence of forcible Turkification. Reports continued in 1994
 that some Muslim religious figures refused to perform burial services for Muslims
 with Slavic names, a practice which some observers saw as an encroachment on reli-
 gious freedom.
 In the 1992 census, approximately 3.4 percent of the population identified itself
 as Roma. The real figure is probably at least twice that high, since many persons
 of Roma descent prefer to identify themselves to the authorities as ethnic Turks or
 Bulgarians. Roma groups continued to be divided among themselves, although sev-
 
 
 771
 eral groups had some success presenting Roma issues to the Government. As indi-
 viduals and as an ethnic group, Roma laed sharply rising levels of discrimination.
 A troubling new development in 1994 was a series of attacks by private citizens
 on Roma communities. The most serious attack took place in February in the village
 of Dolno Belotintsi. After a Roma conscript who had deserted his military unit ap-
 parently committed a murder, inhabitants of the town launched a series of attacks
 upon some 20 Roma families who lived there. Roma houses were broken into and
 destroyed, and a group of men wielding guns and farm tools forced about 30 Roma,
 including children and aged persons, to carry out a forced march to a neighboring
 town and back. Despite repeated complaints by the victims during the 2 days of at-
 tacks, local police and prosecutors took no action. Amnesty International and Bul-
 garian human rights groups have charged that the Government violated the human
 rights of these Bonn by failing to provide them adequate protection. The home of
 one family was burned to the ground, and the family was housed in inadequate tm-
 f       at the end o the year. The other families eventually returned to
 ,ner homes.
 Roma encounter difficulties applying for social benefits, and rural Roma are dis-
 couraged from claiming land to which they are entitled under the law dividing uP
 agricultural collectives. Most Roma children are directed at age 12 into special
 schools for "vocational training" which severely limit their subsequent employment
 prospects.
 Overall, there were fewer reports of police mistreatment of Roma than in 1993,
 but many more instances in which private citizen groups attacked Roma. In some
 cases police were accused of standing by and deliberately failing to intervene. Apo-
 lice investigation into 1993 allegations of police brutality in Stara Zagora concluded
 there was no inappropriate police behavior, although the American chapter of Hel-
 sinki Watch, Amnesty International, the Human Rights Project, and the Bulgarian
 Helsinki Committee all concluded that police had behaved with brutality.
 Recognizing the discrimination that Roma and other minorities face, the Council
 of Ministers set up an interagency Ethnic Affairs Council chaired by a deputy prime
 minister. The Ministry of Education continued its program to introduce Roma-lan-
 guage schoolbooks into schools with Roma students, albeit slowly. Roma police were
 d in some localities, and some teachers received Roma-language training, al-
 though this program lagged far behind its Turkish-language counterpart and ran
 into significant local opposition.
 Workplace discrimination against minorities continued to be a problem, especially
 for Roma. Employers justify such discrimination on the grounds that most Roma
 have relatively low training and education. Supervisory jobs are generally given to
 ethnic Bulgarian employees, with ethnic Turks, Pomaks, and Roma among the first
 to be laid off.
 During compulsory military service, most Muslims and Roma are shunted into
 labor units where they often perform commercial as well military construction and
 maintenance rather than serving in normal military units. The MF protested this
 practice, as did human rights groups and labor observers who cited it as a violation
 of International Labor Organization (ILO) accords. There are only a few ethnic
 Turkish and reportedly no Roma officers in the military.
 Thousands of Bulgarians, mainly in the southwest, identify themselves as Mac-
 edonians, most for historical and geographic reasons. Active members of the two or-
 ganizations which purport to de endthe interests of ethnic Macedonians, UMO-
 Ilinden and TMO-flinden, are believed to number in the hundreds (see Section 2.b.).
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons receive a range of financial assistance,
 including free public transportation, reduced prices on modified automobiles, and
 free equipment such as wheelchairs. As in other areas, however, budgetary con-
 straints mean that such payments have fallen behind. Handicapld individuals
 have access to university training and to housing and employment, although no spe-
 cial programs are in place to allow them to live up to their full employment poten-
 tial. To date, little efbrt has been made to change building or street layouts to help
 blind or otherwise physically handicapped persons. The policy under the previous
 regime of deliberately separating both mentally and physically handicapped ersons,
 including very young children, and often placing them in homes and workplaces re-
 mote from the larger cities, remains unchanged.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution guarantees the right of all
 workers to form or join trade unions of their own choice, and this right appears to
 have been freely exercised in 1994. Estimates of the unionized share of the work
 force range from 30 to 50 percent. This share is shrinking as large firms lay off
 workers and most new positions appear in small, nonunionized businesses.

 Bulgaria has two large trade union confederations, the Confederation of Independ-
 ent Trade Unions of Bulgaria (C1TUB) and Podkrepa. CITUB, the successor to the
 trade union controlled by the former Communist regime, operates as an independent
 entity. Podkrepa, an independent confederation created in 1989, was one of the ear-
 liest opposition forces but is no longer a member of the UDF.
 The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right to strike when other means of conflict
 resolution have been exhausted, but political strikes are forbidden. Workers in es-
 sential services such as the military, police, energy production and supply, and
 health sectors are prohibited from striking. Students and miners went on strike in
 1994 but won no major concessions from the Government. Legal actions initiated
 against some unions in 1992 on the grounds their activities had violated the con-
 stitutional prohibition against poitical activities by citizens' associations (defined to
 include trade unions) were still pending in 1994. Until the limitations of this con-
 stitutional prohibition are more clearly defined, either by legislation or judicial
 precedent, there remains the ptential for inappropriate attacks on legitimate union
 activities, although no such attacks took place in 1994.
 The Labor Coces prohibitions against antiunion discrimination include a 6-month
 period of protection against dismissal as a form of retribution. While these provi-
 sions appear to be within international norms, there is no mechanism other than
 the courts for resolving complaints, and the burden of proof in such a case rests en-
 tirely on the employee.
 The ILO in 1993 requested further information on lustration proceedings, meas-
 ures directed at compensating ethnic Turks for abuses under the previous regime,
 efforts taken to improve the economic situation of minorities, and measures to pro-
 mote equality of workplace opportunity between men and women. At the end of
 1994, the ILO was stilreviewing the information provided to it by the Government
 and had not yet issued opinions or recommendations.
 There are no restrictions governing affiliation or contact with international labor
 organizations, and Bulgarian unions actively exercise this right.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain CollectiveWy.-The Labor Code institutes
 collective bargaining, which was practiced nationally and on a local level. Both
 CITUB and Podkrepa complained, however, that while the legal structure for collec-
 tive bargaining was adequate, many employers failed to bargain in good faith or to
 adhere to concluded agreements. Because most large firms are still state owned, the
 unions demanded that the Government enforce collective bargaining procedures.
 The Government responded that since state-owned firms were independently man-
 aged, the appropriate recourse was through the courts, not the executive branch.
 Only Pod    pa and CITUB are authorized to bargain collectively. This restriction
 led to complaints by smaller unions, which may in individual workplaces have more
 members than either of the two large confederations. One of these smaller unions,
 the National Trade Union, lodged a formal complaint with the ILO. Smaller unions
 also protested their exclusion from the National Social Council.
 There were no instances in which an employer was found guilty of antiunion dis-
 crimination and required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. The Inter-
 national Confederation of Free Trade Unions continued to charge that the revised
 Labor Code does not provide effective protection against acts of antiunion discrimi-
 nation. It also asserted that the "national representation" requirement for participa-
 tion in the National Social Council violated the right to organize, and criticized a
 provision making negotiation of individual contracts possible regardless of existing
 collective agreements.
 The same obligation of collective bargaining and adherence to labor standards
 prevails in the export processing zones, vhich at year's end appear to exist largely
 on pa r.
 c. Pohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Many observers agreed that the practice of shunting minority
 and conscientious-objector military draftees into work units which often carry out
 commercial construction and maintenance projects is a form of forced labor (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code sets the minimum
 age for employment at 16 years; the minimum for dangerous work is set at 18. Em-
 ployers and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare are responsible for enforcing
 these provisions. Child labor laws are enforced well in the formal sector. Underage
 employment in the informal and agricultural sectors is increasing as collective farms
 are broken up and the private sector continues to grow. However, the practice does
 not yet seem to be either widespread or systematic.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The national monthly minimum wage was ad-
 justed three times in 1994 and stood at year's end at approximately $33 (2,143 leva).
 Pensions, unemployment, and child benefits were raise dby about 25 percent during
 
 
 773
 the year. Inflation in 1994 was estimated at 100 percent and dramatically increased
 the cost of living. The minimum wage is not enough to provide a wage earner and
 family a decent standard of living. The Constitution stipulates the right to social
 security and welfare aid assistance for the temporarily unemployed, although in
 practice such assistance was often either late or not disbursed.
 The Labor Code provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one
 24-hour rest period per week. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare enforces
 both the minimum wage and the standard workweek. Enforcement has been gen-
 erally effective in the state sector, although there are reports that state-ran enter-
 prises fall into arrears on salary payments to their employees if they incur losses.
 Enforcement of work conditions is weaker in the emerging private sector.
 Bulgaria has a national labor safety program with standards established by the
 Labor Code. The Constitution states that employees are entitled to healthy and
 nonhazardous working conditions. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is re-
 sponsible for enforcing these provisions. Under the Labor Code, an employee has the
 right to remove himself from a work situation which presents a serious or imme-
 diate danger to life or health without jeopardizing continued employment. In prac-
 tice, refusal to work in situations with relatively high accident rates or associated
 chronic health problems would result in loss of employment for many workers. Con-
 ditions in many cases are worsening owing to budget stringencies and a growing pri-
 vate sector over which labor inspectors have not yet achieved effective supervision.
