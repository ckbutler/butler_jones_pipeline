 GUINEA
 In 1986 Guinea's military leaders consolidated their hold on
 political power and, under the ruling Military Committee for
 National Recovery (CMRN), significantly expanded civilian
 participation in the day-to-day operations of the Government.
 Civilians now fill 19 of the 35 cabinet-level positions,
 including 7 exiles who had fled the late President Sekou
 Toure's Guinea. The CMRN is sensitive to ethnic divisions and
 has attempted to strike a balance among the major groupings in
 appointments and promotions of high officials.
 General Lansana Conte has consolidated power in his third year
 as Head of State, a process facilitated by his building up of a
 well-armed presidential guard. Since the aborted coup of July
 1985, there have been no known attempts forcibly to overthrow
 the Government. President Conte and his Government continue to
 enjoy support from having overthrown in a bloodless coup the
 successors of Sekou Toure, who died unexpectedly in March 1984
 after having been Guinea's leader since 1958, and from the
 emphasis they place on improving human rights in Guinea. Conte
 has pledged to make Guinea, "a nation of laws, and fully
 respectful of human rights and liberties."
 Despite abundant natural resources, Toure's legacy of
 mismanagement and authoritarianism has left Guinea among the
 poorest countries in the world, with a per capita gross
 national product below $300. Eighty percent of the population
 is engaged in subsistence agriculture, and the salaried sector
 consists almost entirely of the 79,000-member civil service.
 Guinea is seeking to overcome this legacy with a comprehensive
 economic reform program aimed at introducing an environment
 conducive to individual initiative and the operation of the
 free market.
 The fragility of Guinea's improved human rights situation under
 Conte was illustrated in 1986 by widespread international press
 attention on the fate of a number of Sekou Toure's family
 members and political associates, and of those former CMRN
 members and others arrested after the July 1985 coup attempt.
 These reports indicated a growing belief that many of these
 people had been executed. At the end of 1986, the Government
 had still not charged or brought these persons to trial but was
 under growing pressure to give some accounting of their
 whereabouts and status.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Jeune Afrique and other leading Africa-oriented publications
 published allegations that political killings had taken place
 within 4 days of the 1985 coup d'etat. In no case was hard
 evidence presented in support of these charges, but Jeune
 Afrique asserted that the Government has the burden to show
 that those incarcerated are still alive. The Government has
 chosen not to respond to these specific charges or to exhibit
 the persons. In a speech on December 22, 1985, Conte implied
 that at least some of the detainees may have been summarily
 executed. However, the official government position remains
 that these persons are in prison, and that they will be tried
 after the appropriate judicial investigation is completed. The
 prisoners involved are all identified with one particular
 
 
 134
 GUINEA
 ethnic group, the Malinke. The Malinke were closely identified
 with the Sekou Toure regime. President Conte is from the
 Soussou ethnic group.
 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated abductions or disappearances were
 reported.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Since coming to power in April 1984, the Government has
 repeatedly condemned the cruel and inhumane practices of the
 Sekou Toure regime. It has, in some cases, corrected past
 abuses by law enforcement and prison officials when these cases
 have been brought to its attention. Government officials
 admit, however, that control over the lower ranks of the
 police, gendarmerie, and military forces is at best uneven, and
 maltreatment of prisoners still occurs. For example, prisoners
 have reportedly been stripped naked during their confinement.
 Because of Guinea's general underdevelopment, prison conditions
 are squalid and unsanitary, and the low-ranking officials who
 guard them are poorly educated, trained, paid, and supervised.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The exact number of political detainees is unknown, but,
 according to Amnesty International in its 1986 Report,
 60 persons with ties to Sekou Toure remained in detention at
 the beginning of 1985 and another 200 persons were arrested
 after the July 1985 coup attempt. Some of these were released
 during 1985. The whole process of arrest, interrogation,
 release, or further detention of the suspects remained shrouded
 in secrecy.
 There have been a number of reported cases involving arbitrary
 arrests on nonexistent or trumped-up charges, often by police
 officials seeking to supplement low salaries through extortion.
 Presidential admonitions and frequent campaigns against this
 practice in the government media have not succeeded in bringing
 continued reports to a halt.
 Guinea in the post-Toure era does not deliberately practice
 incommunicado detention, but the authorities are often slow
 in acknowledging arrests involving common criminals, in part
 due to the lack of a functioning communications system. These
 cases typically conclude with a delayed official
 acknowledgement of arrest after the family of the prisoner has
 been unofficially informed. Guineans are troubled by the
 shortcomings of the current law enforcement system, including
 the lack of safeguards for bringing accused persons before a
 judge within a reasonable period of time. Guineans no longer
 have, however, the paralyzing fear they harbored for the brutal
 party state apparatus of the Toure regime.
 Compulsory labor is prohibited and not practiced in Guinea.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In 1986 Guinea continued the process of developing a modern and
 independent judicial system, which on paper includes procedural
 safeguards for the accused. The judiciary, as evolving, will
 have courts of the first instance at the subprefecture and
 prefecture levels and courts of appeal at the provincial level.
 
 
 135
 GUINEA
 In September the Government abolished the Supreme Court, which
 was to have multiple functions, and in its place created a more
 narrowly focused Court of Annulment, charged with reviewing
 lower court decisions and determining whether applicable legal
 codes or relevant precedents have been followed.
 In September the Government also placed a new emphasis on
 quality in the appointment of judges and the training of
 lawyers. In addition, it created an "independent" Guinea Bar
 Association to assist in the reform process, in part through
 the development of objective criteria for licensing attorneys.
 Heretofore, judges have been inadequately paid, have had poor
 or no access to reference materials, and often have allowed
 their decisions to be influenced by other than purely legal
 considerations. Ideology no longer plays a role in the
 appointment of either judges or lawyers (formerly called
 "popular lawyers"). By the end of 1986, nearly 20 attorneys
 had been admitted to the Bar. The consolidation of both the
 court system and the licensing procedures for attorneys reflect
 the Ministry of Justice's new emphasis on quality versus
 quantity, as it attempts to reduce the size of the country's
 legal machinery in proportion to the means available to support
 it.
 Citizens accused of treasonous acts are to be tried by a new
 Court for National Security, the existence of which was first
 announced in 1985. According to the Government, former
 civilian officials of the previous Toure regime and civilians
 implicated in the July 1985 attempted coup will be tried in
 this Court. Military men implicated in the coup attempt are to
 be tried in a military court. As noted, no progress was made
 in 1986 in bringing any of these cases to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government has stressed traditional family values and the
 inviolability of the home, but there are no legal or
 constitutional safeguards to protect these rights. In general,
 the CMRN is less willing than the former regime to abuse police
 powers. However, it does authorize from time to time stepped
 up police patrols and roundups of persons considered to be
 suspicious on the streets after midnight. While these patrols
 respond to a significant increase in city crime and juvenile
 delinquency, there have been excesses by police and
 paramilitary forces.
 Mail and telephones, especially of foreigners, are likely to be
 monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While there is no longer a network of informers, after 26 years
 of totalitarian rule many Guineans are still hesitant to speak
 their minds on sensitive issues. With all media operated or
 controlled by the Government, freedom of the press does not
 exist. The Ministry of Information and Culture continues to
 act both as censor and administrator, but, within limits, has
 permitted some movement in the direction of press freedom.
 Local news media were given greater latitude during 1986 to
 report on the progress or lack of progress in the Government's
 reform programs. Reporters working for the newly formed
 Guinean press service were permitted to cover a broader
 
 
 136
 GUINEA
 spectrum of domestic issues than had been the case under the
 previous Government. In several cases, however, articles
 denouncing corrupt practices did not have the promised sequels
 and journalists were reassigned. A few foreign books and
 magazines circulate freely, even when they contain material
 critical of the CMRN.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There was a proliferation of voluntary associations in Guinea
 in 1986, generally in the human services and professional
 fields, such as the Red Cross and the Chamber of Commerce. The
 officers of the newly founded journalists' association,
 however, were dismissed by the Minister of Information as
 though they were Ministry employees.
 During 1986 the Guinean National Labor Confederation (CNTG)
 completed its second year as an autonomous entity. It
 maintains relations with recognized regional and international
 bodies, including the International Labor Organization (ILO),
 and regularly sends representatives to their meetings.
 Organized labor in Guinea derives its power almost entirely
 from the prestige of its leadership, as economic conditions in
 the country have placed workers in a weak bargaining position.
 Most workers represented by CNTG affiliated unions are
 government employees, a large percentage of whom are slated for
 either early retirement or layoff due to government efforts to
 trim the civil service. Nongovernment workers have the right
 to strike, but by union policy need the permission of the CNTG
 executive board to do so. In late October the Government, with
 the support of the CNTG, ordered the firing of 27 workers
 involved in a wildcat strike of a major bus company.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Approximately 85 percent of the population is Muslim, but there
 is religious freedom and toleration for worshipers of all
 faiths. Christians, despite their numerical minority, are
 accorded equal status, and there is no official state religion.
 The first Anglican bishop was installed in July 1986. All
 religions in Guinea have the right to maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries. Missionaries may come to
 Guinea and proselytize, but the Ministry of Religious Affairs
 limits their numbers. The Government has declared both Muslim
 and Christian holy days as public holidays. It also subsidized
 pilgrimages to Mecca and the Vatican in 1986.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Guineans are free to move about the country and change
 residence or workplace, although they may be menaced
 occasionally by petty harassment by the poorly paid police
 and/or military at unauthorized roadside checkpoints. The
 Government has tried to slow the pace of rural-urban migration
 by primarily noncoercive means. In Conakry itself, however,
 the Government has seen a need to augment late night police
 patrols with added force deployments and occasional curfews to
 respond to reports of increased crime committed by bands of
 delinquent youth, many of whom are recent arrivals from the
 interior and incapable of finding productive work. Foreign
 travel involves considerable red tape for the prospective
 Guinean traveler, but there are no unusual restrictions.
 Foreigners are required to have a routinely granted laissez
 
 
 137
 GUINEA
 passer for travel into the interior. The sudden increase in
 the numbers of non-African expatriates in the country has
 rekindled xenophobic fears in many Guineans and caused the
 Government to tighten immigration procedures from time to time.
 There are no accurate statistics on the number of former exiles
 from the Sekou Toure dictatorship who have returned to Guinea.
 There is much evidence to indicate, however, that they are
 returning in significant numbers. There are no political
 obstacles to repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since independence, Guinea has had no experience in democracy,
 and there is still no legal provision for political parties or
 formal opposition to CMRN rule. The day-to-day running of the
 country has devolved increasingly upon the civilian members of
 the Cabinet, but ultimate authority still rests with the
 military dominated CMRN, which rules by decree. The CMRN has
 shown no inclination to relinquish its power or to permit
 national elections, apparently fearing that political
 organization would cleave Guinea along ethnic lines.
 Decentralization became a major theme in 1986 in meeting ethnic
 tensions and was the subject of a national administrative
 conference in September, attended by the entire CMRN, the
 civilian Cabinet, and representatives of all the country's
 prefectures. In this connection,' the Government launched an
 administrative reform program to develop local governing bodies
 at village and city neighborhood levels. A new government
 department, the Secretariat of State for Decentralization, was
 charged with introducing these local structures which involved
 local elections. There were reports of certain coercive
 measures to prevent some objectionable candidacies by persons
 associated with the previous regime, but in most cases the
 people were able to choose freely. The new local governing
 bodies are not to replace the prefecture layer of government
 and are limited to concerning themselves with developmental and
 social issues. Prefectural appointments are still made by the
 President, with the appointees commonly being natives of the
 regions to which they are assigned.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No local human rights organizations are known to exist in
 Guinea, but certain abuses are reported in the media. The CMRN
 has been publicly self-critical of its record, asserting that
 its overall approach to human rights distinguishes it from the
 repressive regime it overthrew but admitting that lapses have
 occasionally occurred. In this way, the Government has raised
 public consciousness on human rights issues. It has allowed
 Amnesty International to expand its membership and activities
 in Guinea, including circulating its publications freely in the
 country. Guinea is one of the few countries in Africa where
 Amnesty International has a local affiliate. In addition,
 French-based groups, such as The Assembly for the Protection of
 Human Rights and Liberty in Guinea, make known their concerns
 about human rights.
 
 
 138
 GUINEA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While the Government has not excluded any of the four major
 ethnic groupings in the country from executive or other
 positions, and while it has repeatedly exhorted its citizens to
 think of themselves as Guineans and not as members of a
 particular group, discrimination and mutual suspicion still
 characterize relations across ethnic lines within and outside
 government.
 Women in Guinea enjoy a special status which has grown out of
 the political role they played in the pre-independence period.
 They still lag, however, in educational and employment
 opportunities despite the considerable influence of market
 women on the local economy. The Government publicly supports
 the advancement of women, but the presence of women within the
 civilian part of the Government is not large. The current
 Secretary of State for Social Affairs is a woman who was
 imprisoned for her political views during the previous regime.
 Her predecessor, also a woman, helped create the Guinean
 Association for Family Well-Being (AGBEF), a nonprofit, private
 organization to promote family planning and maternal and child
 health care. During 1986 the Organization of Women Workers
 established itself as a quasi-independent advocate of women's
 rights within the CNTG. This labor organization, plus the
 AGBEF and the National Office on the Feminine Condition, have
 conducted seminars and colloquia on women's issues and
 developed contacts with sister organizations overseas.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 By accepted practice, children under the age of 17 are not
 usually employed outside the family. An exception is in the
 area of subsistence agriculture where farming is traditionally
 a family affair. With the help of the ILO, a new labor code is
 scheduled. for introduction in 1987 which will include a minimum
 employment age of 17, a 40 hour work week, acceptable health
 and safety standards, and fair collective bargaining
 procedures. These labor standards are for the most part
 already in effect in the modern mining enclaves. Under
 existing legislation, a collective labor agreement signed in
 1986 governs relations between Guinean mineworkers and the
 mining industry. Fair collective bargaining procedures were
 followed in hammering out this agreement.
