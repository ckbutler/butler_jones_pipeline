 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal constitutional democracy with an executive branch headed
 by an elected president, a bicameral legislature, and a separate judiciary. In 1995
 voters reelected President Carlos Saul Menem to a second term that runs until
 1999. His Justicialist party won a majority of seats in both houses of Congress.
 The President is the constitutional commander in chief, and a civilian Defense
 Minister oversees the armed forces. The responsibility for maintaining law and
 order is shared by several law enforcement agencies. The Federal Police report to
 the Interior Minister, as do the Border Police and Coast Guard. Provincial police
 are subordinate to the respective provincial governors. Provincial policemen contin-
 ued to commit human rights abuses.
 Argentina has a mixed agricultural, industrial, and service economy. An economic
 reform and structural adjustment program, begun in 1989, led to 3 years of high
 growth with sharply reduced inflation, and spurred competitiveness. As a result of
 privatization, private sector adjustment, and a lingering recession, however, the na-
 tional unemployment rate remained high at 17.2 percent. The high cost of living af-
 fectd those on low fixed incomes the most, although the entire country benefited
 from the end of hyperinflation.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. There continue to be instances of extrajudicial
 killings and physical mistreatment of detainees by local police, who also arbitrarily
 arrest and detain citizens. However, provincial authorities investigated, tried, and
 convicted a number of police officials for such abuses. Prison conditions are poor.
 The judicial system is subject to political influence at times and to inordinate
 delays, resulting in lengthy pretrial detention. Discrimination and violence against
 women are also problems. Revelations of extrajudicial killings by former military of-
 ficers who served under the 1976-83 military government sparked a national debate
 over a full accounting of those who disappeared during that period. The Government
 and the armed forces said, however, that they have no information about those who
 disappeared beyond that released in 1984 by the National Commission on Dis-
 appeared Persons and collected since then by the Interior Ministrs Subsecretariat
 for Human and Social Rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated extrajudicial killings.
 Provincial police, however, were believed responsible for a number of other
 extrajudicial killings and were sometimes accused of being "trigger happy." Provin-
 cial governments have investigated and in some instances detained and tried the
 officers involved. For example, in February the authorities placed a Buenos Aires
 provincial policeman in preventive custody for the killing of Ramon Roldan, shot
 while seated in the back of a car that was rushing his daughter to a hospital. In
 March four police officers in the same province were arrested, and their supervisors
 relieved of duty, in connection with the killing of a 16-year-old boy, Cristian
 Campos, and the burning of his remains. In June the authorities arrested a police-
 man in the province of Cordoba in connection with the shooting death of 19-year-
 old Ariel Lastra.
 In March the governor of the province of Tucuman dismissed the chief of the pro-
 vincial police after the latter was quoted as saying he would like to "put a few bul-
 lets" into thieves in the province. In September the chief of police of the province
 of Buenos Aires was also replaced.
 Two gunmen attempted to kill a former police doctor, Jorge Antonio Berges, who
 had been convicted in December 1986 of aiding in the torture of prisoners and of
 delivering the babies of illegally detained women in the 1970's and facilitating their
 fraudulent adoptions. A domestic criminal group, the People's Revolutiona  Organi-
 zation, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it tried to kill Berges in the
 name of all those who had suffered at the hands of the "torturers" of the military
 dictatorship.

 In January a court sentenced an army officer and two noncommissioned officers
 to up to 15 years in prison for the 1994 murder of Omar Carrasco, a young army
 recruit who was beaten to death during a hazing incident in Neuquen. In August
 the authorities indicted two army officers in an investigation of alleged attempts to
 cover up the crime. In May a court sentenced three officers in the province of Jujuy
 to prison terms of 16 years for the kidnap and murder in 1994 of a young engineer,
 Diego Rodriguez Laguens.
 The authorities arrested 15 members of the Buenos Aires provincial police, includ-
 ing 3 high-ranking officers and a former officer, in connection with the 1994 bomb-
 ing of the AMIA Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires. In August they charged
 the 4 officers with homicide on the grounds that they allegedly supplied the van
 that was filled with explosives; the bomb killed 87 people and injured 250 others.
 At year's end, the 4 remained in jail; all 15 will be tried.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 In May a judge in La Plata ordered the arrest of two police officers accused of
 torturing to death a 23-year-old student, Miguel Bru, who disappeared in 1993. In
 June the province of Mendoza appointed two commissions to investigate the dis-
 appearances of three men (Adolfo Garrido, Raul Baigoria, and Cristian Guardatti)
 in two separate incidents in 1990 and 1992, and to determine appropriate levels of
 compensation for their families. According to witnesses, the three were in the cus-
 tody of provincial police when they were last seen. The families had filed suit in
 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and in January the President in-
 structed the Foreign Ministry to enter into discussions with them in order to arrive
 at a settlement, According to the Inter-Aerican Commission on Human Rights
 (IACHR), an ad hoc investigative commission established an arbitration award to
 be paid to the victims and issued a report on August 16. The IACHR stated in Octo-
 ber however, that the recommendations of the ad hoc committee had not been car-
 ried out and that no settlement had been reached and called on the Government
 to publish and distribute the ad hoc committee's report.
 Revelations concerning disappearances under the 1976-83 military regime contin-
 ued to claim public attention, and a federal court promised anonymity to anyone
 who would come forward with new information. The court reactivated the cases of
 two French nuns and a Swedish student who disappeared at different times during
 the period of military rule, in an attempt to determine their fate. The navy officer
 convicted in absentia in France for the disappearance of the nuns, and wanted in
 Sweden for the disappearance of the Swede, took early retirement.
 In September a federal udge in Spain opened a criminal investigation into the
 torture, disappearance, and killing of 266 Spanish citizens in Argentina during the
 military regime. He charged 97 former and active military and police officers in the
 case and seeks to interrogate them in Spain or Argentina. They reportedly include
 members of military juntas, commanders of clandestine jails, and doctors who at-
 tended torture sessions. A parallel investigation focuses on the alleged abduction of
 54 children of Spanish citizens who remain missing.
 Most reliable estimates place the number of those who disappeared between
 10,000 and 15,000. In 1984 the National Commission on Disappeared Persons issued
 a report that lists 8,961 names based on public testimony from friends, relatives,
 and other witnesses. Since then, the Ministry of the Interior's Subsecretariat for
 Human and Social Rights has added approximately 2,500 new names, also based on
 voluntary re rting.
 The Grangothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group, continued efforts
 to reunite the children of couples who disappeared under the military regime with
 their biological next-of-kin. The group is working with the National Commission on
 the Right to Identity, an agency of the Subsecretariat for Human and Social Rights.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the Criminal Code provides penalties for tor-
 ture that are similar to those for homicide. Nevertheless, police brutality remains
 a serious problem. In February a court sentenced a policeman in Mar del Plata to
 9 years in prison for torturing a 15-year-old boy who had been arrested on suspicion
 of raping a child. In April the authorities arrested two policemen in Posadas on sus-
 picion of raping a 13-year-old girl in a police station where they had taken her in
 what they said was a crackdown on prostitution. In April two policemen in Cordoba
 were detained on suspicion of raping a young woman who had come to a local jail
 to visit a prisoner.
 In February the government of Buenos Aires province announced the suspension,
 pending further investigation, of 11 police officers, including 1 inspector and 2 dep-
 uty inspectors, for their role in violently repressing a student demonstration at the
 La Plata police headquarters. This and other incidents of hasty use of force by the
 provincial police impelled President Menem to meet with his senior security officials
 
 
 340
 and the police chiefs of all the provinces in order to analyze the problem. They
 adopted an action plan calling for more human rights training for police officers,
 more careful recruiting, and closer community liaison, among other measures.
 On September 13, the Government agreed to an out-of-court settlement with Jose
 Siderman, who had sued it in a U.S. court for torture and other abuses that he suf-
 fered at the hands of the 1976-83 military regime, as well as abuses committed by
 later governments.
 Prison conditions are poor in a number of overcrowded jails where the facilities
 are old and dilapidated. Severe overcrowding apparently contributed to a riot in
 March in the Villa Floresta prison near Bahla Blanca, the second riot there in 3
 months. In March inmates at the Sierra Chica maximum security penitentiary in
 Buenos Aires province mutinied after a botched escape attempt. In the ensuing bat-
 tles between rival gangs, one inmate was killed, seven died in a fire touched off by
 the riot, and other prisners were reported missing. In addition, the rioters took
 hostages, including a judge who arrived to negotiate an end to the uprising.
 In April there was a wave of prison riots in the province of Buenos Aires and else-
 where in the nation. A total of 17 prisons were affected, throughout the country,
 with an estimated 5,600 prisoners in active revolt. An additional 6,000 prisoners
 participated in hunger strikes or signed petitions, out of a national prison popu-
 lation of 27,000. The prisoners complained about overcrowding in the jails, the slow
 pace of resolving their cases, excessive bail amounts, and incongruous criminal pen-
 alties (e.g., the sentence for auto theft is 9 years longer than that for manslaughter).
 In the Buenos Aires provincial penitentiary system, courts have yet to try and con-
 vict 70 percent of the prisoners. The prisoners sought compliance with a 1994 law
 that gives unsentenced prisoners 2 days' credit toward their final sentence for every
 day served prior to sentencing, after a period of 2 years.
 To help relieve prison overcrowding in the province of Buenos Aires, the Govern-
 ment solicited bids for the construction of two new prisons designed to be more se-
 cure and to offer better living conditions for inmates. The Government is also ex-
 ploring the possibility of contracting some prison services to private firms in order
 to upgrade conditions.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.*The Penal Code places limits on the ar-
 rest and investigatory power of the police and the judiciary, but provincial police
 often ignored these restrictions. Human rights groups find it difficult to document
 such incidents, because victims are reluctant to file complaints.
 Police detain teenagers and young adults, sometimes overnight, sometimes for an
 entire weekend, without formal charges. They do not always provide such detainees
 with the opportunity to call their families or an attorney. These detainees are re-
 leased only upon a complaint from relatives or legal counsel.
 The law provides for the right to bal, and it is utilized in practice. Nonetheless,
 the law allows p retrial detention for up to 2 years, and the slow pace of criminal
 trials often results in lengthy pretrial detention periods.
 The law does not permit involuntary exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial f a Fair Public Wal.-The Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary. While it is nominally independent and impartial, its processes are ineffi-
 cient, complicated, and, at times, subject to political influence.
 The judicial system is divided into federal and provincial courts, each headed by
 a Supreme Court with chambers of appeal and section courts below it. The system
 is hampered by inordinate delays, procedural logjams, changes of judges, and incom-
 petence. Allegations of corruption are widely reported, especially in civil cases.
 Trials are public and defendants have the right to legal counsel and defense wit-
 nesses. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. In 1992 some federal and pro-
 vincial courts began deciding cases using oral trials instead of the practice of writ-
 tn submissions. Oral trials are less time consuming, and they have helped reduce
 the number of prison inmates awaiting trial. Nevertheless, lawyers and judges are
 still struggling to adjust to the new prhedures, and substantial elements of the old
 system remain. For example, before the oral part of a trial begins, judges receive
 written documentation regarding the case which, according to prominent legal ex-
 perts, can bias a judge before ora testimony is heard.
 Constitutional reforms in 1994 provided for a blue-ribben judicial council that
 would have responsibilityefo foederal court administration and the selection and re-
 moval of judgs However, due to disagreement over the composition of the council,
 Congress  as not yet passed the necessary enabling legislation.
 International human rights groups have claimed that Juan Antonio Puigane, a
 Capuchin monk sentenced to prison with 19 others in a 1989 attack on an army
 barracks, is jailed for political reasons. Argentine officials maintain, however, that
 Puigeane was properly tried and convic    or involvement in a violent rebellion
 
 
 341
 against a democratically elected government. There were no other reports of politi-
 cal prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions. Violations are subject to legal sanction, although in practice,
 local police have the right to stop and search individuals without probable cause.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 ent press and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom
 of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 There were several reported attacks on journalists. In February gunshots were
 fired at the office of a news photographer in Cordoba who had taken graphic hotos
 of a prison riot. In August two journalists in the province of San Juan comp ained
 to the Association of Argentine News Organizations (ADEPA) that their homes had
 been deliberately set on fire. The perpetrators of the attacks were unknown. In June
 ADEPA released a statement criticizing proposed laws it said would threaten free-
 dom of the press, including a bill to increase fines for publishing information about
 offenses by minors and a draft anticorruption law that included penalties for pub-
 lishing financial disclosure statements concerning inheritances. The Government de-
 scribed the accusation as 'profoundly unfair" and called on ADEPA to acknowledge
 the extent of press freedom that existed; ADEPA said that it would continue to
 warn against such proposals.
 In March the judges hearing a controversial murder case in Catamarca province
 announced a suspension of radio and television coverage of the trial, thereby provok-
 ing sharp public reaction and rallies throughout the country. Although fascination
 with the soap opera-like courtroom drama is partly responsible for the outcry, many
 also believed that the judges decided to ban media access as part of a deal to get
 the defendant, the son of an influential politician, an acquittal. Less than 48 hours
 later, the Catamarca Supreme Court ordered the trial to resume media coverage,
 but the judges hearing the case subsequently resigned, charging political inter-
 ference in the process.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution and laws pro-
 vide for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and law provide for these rights, and the Government
 respects them in practice.
 The Government recognizes as refugees those persons who meet the criteria of the
 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The refugee eli-
 gibility committee, composed of representatives of the Ministries of Justice, Foreign
 Affairs, and the Interior is responsible for determining a refugee's status. A rep-
 resentative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees may participate in commit-
 tee hearings, but may not vote. The Government has granted refugee status to nu-
 merous persons and accepted them for resettlement. The issue of the provision of
 first asylum, however, has rarely arisen. There were no reports of the forced return
 of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 Since its return to democratic government in 1983, Argentina has held periodic
 free and fair elections to choose federal, provincial, and municipal office holders.
 Universal adult suffrage is obligatory in national elections. Political parties of vary-
 ing ideologies operate freely and openly. The revised Constitution provides that all
 adult citizens shall enjoy full participation in the political process, and they do so
 in practice.
 e Constitution stipulates that the internal regulations of political parties and
 party nominations for elections be subject to affirmative action requirements to as-
 sure that women are represented in elective office. A 1993 decree implementing a
 1991 law required that a minimum of 30 percent of all political party lists of can-
 didates be female. As a result, the presence of women in the Congress is increasing.
 There are 72 women in the 257-seat Chamber of Deputies and 4 of 50 Senators are
 women. Women are also assuming positions of greater authority in provincial and
 local governments.
 
 
 342
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 Cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel~igon, Disability, Language or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and federal law provide for equality for all citizens. The 1988
 Antidiscrimination Law establishes a series of penalties from 1 month to 3 years'
 imprisonment for anyone who arbitrarily restricts, obstructs, or restrains a person
 based on "race, religion, nationality, ideolog, political opinion, sex, economic posi-
 tion, social class, or physical characteristics. There is no evidence of any systematic
 effort to abridge these rights by the Government or by private groups.
 Women.-Violene and seal harassment against women are problems. Insen-
 sitivity among poice and judges sometimes discourages women from reporting as-
 salts, espeially domestic violene. The National Women's Council has been work-
 ing with law enforcement authorities to include in their police training curriculum
 material on handling cases of violence against women. Many public and private in-
 stitutions offer prevention programs and provide support and treatment or women
 who have been abused.
 Women still encounter economic discrimination and occupy a disproportionate
 number of lower paying jobs. Often they are paid less than men for equal work,
 even though this is explicitly prohibited by law. Female labor leaders pressed their
 male counterparts for affirmative action programs within the trade union movement
 to counteract this. Women are also found disproportionately in the informal sector,
 where they are effectively denied work-related economic and social benefits enjoyed
 by those in the formal sector.
 The National Women's Council, created in 1992 in response to recommendations
 in the United Nations Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination
 against women, carried out programs to promote equal opportunity for women in
 education and employment, encourage the participation of women in politics, and
 support women's rights programs at the provcial level. Provisions in the revised
 Constitution have greatly increased women's participation in politics.
 Children.-The 1994 Constitution incorporates the U.N. Convention on the Rights
 of the Child. The Ministry of Interior's Subsecretariat for Human and Social Rights
 works with the United Nations Children's Fund and other international agencies to
 promote children's rights and well-being.
 Historically, Argentina has had numerous programs to provide public education,
 health protection, and recreational services for all children, regardless of class or
 economic status. According to some nongovernmental organization (NGO) and
 church sources, however, child abuse and prostitution are on the rise, and the Na-
 tional Council on Children and the Family believes that those affected tend to be
 younger than previously. The Council, which the Government established in 1990,
 works actively with federal and local agencies to im rove child protection programs.
 The federal capital, most of the 24 provinces, anc-the Federal Government have
 passed child protection laws.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1994 law aimed at elimina   physical barriers to
 disabled persons regulates standards regarding access to public buildings, parks,
 plazas, stairs, and pedestrian areas. An increasing number of street curbs in Buenos
 Aires have been modified to accommodate wheel chairs, but few buildings and public
 areas in the capital or other cities offer easy access to persons with disabilities.
 In June Congress passed a law creating a federal disabilities council composed of
 national, provincial, and NGO representatives and chaired by the President of the
 National Advisory Commission for the Integration of Disabled Persons, who has the
 rank of state secretary within the Federal Government. Federal law also prohibits
 discrimination against the disabled in employment. Since establishment of the Na-
 tional Program Against Discrimination in 1994, the largest single group bringing
 complaints has been disabled persons.
 Indigenous People.-The revised Constitution provides the right of minorities to
 be represented in government and incorporates international agreements intended
 to promote their economic, social, and cultural rights. Estimates of the size of the
 indigenous population vary from 60,000 to 150,000, but the National Statistical In-
 stitute put the figure at below 100,000 as of 1992. Most live in the northern and
 northwestern provinces and in the far south. Their standard of living is considerably
 below the average, and they have higher rates of illiteracy, chromc diseases, and
 unemployment. Indigenous groups are sometimes involved in disputes over tribal
 
 
 lands, which tend to be prolonged due to an inefficient court system unable to expe-
 dite conflicting land title claims.
 The Kolla Indiana made some progress in their efforts to obtain title to ancestral
 lands, following a protest and the blacking of roads in July. The Mapuche Indians
 in Patagonia organized protests for similar reasons.
 Religious Minorities.--The large Jewish community alleges that anti-Semitism ex-
 ists in the military and security services and that this may have affected the Gov-
 ernment's investigation of the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy and the 1994
 bombing of AMIA, a Jewish cultural center. The Government denies these allega-
 tions and cites the immense complexity of investigating terrorist cases as the prin-
 cipal reason for the lack of definitive results to date. There were concrete, if modest,
 advances in the AMIA investigation, including the arrest of several senior provincial
 police officers alleged to have procured a van used as a carbomb in the attack (see
 Section L.a.). In November the Government announced an increase in the reward
 it had offered since 1994 for information or evidence to "clarify the acts of inter-
 national terrorism! against the Israeli embassy and the AMIA center from $2 mil-
 lion to $3 million.
 The Government's desire to accommodate the sensitivities of the Jewish commu-
 nity was evident in July, when Justice Minister Rodolfo Barra, already a controver-
 figure for other reasons, resigned abruptly, in the face of gro    evidence that
 he had been a member of a pro-Nazi youth movement. (Barra later became a legal
 adviser to the Senate.) When an Italian court acquitted Nazi officer Erich Priebke,
 who had resided in Argentina until his extradition for trial in Rome, the Govern-
 ment immediately announced that Priehke would not be allowed to reenter the
 country.
 In October vandals desecrated the predominantly Jewish La Tablada cemetery
 outside Buenos Aires, in the third incident of its kind during the year. The vandals
 smashed or defaced scores of tombstones and mausoleums, painting swastikas on
 many tombstones. The Government was quick to condemn the act, and the authori-
 ties arrested four suspects in the case and charged them with desecrating 60 tombs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Asaociation.-With the exception of military personnel, all workers
 are free to form unions. Estimates regarding union membership vary widely. Most
 union leaders believe it to be about 40 percent of the work force; government figures
 indicate union membership at 30 percent. Trade unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment or political parties, although most union leaders are aiated with Presi-
 dent Menems Justicialist party. Unions belong to either the General Confederation
 of Labor (CGT), the largest union federation; the Movement of Argentine Workers,
 a dissident group within the CGT; or the independent Congress of Argentine Work-
 ers. Unions have the right to strike, and members who participate in strikes are
 protected by law. The CGT staged general work stoppages in August, September,
 and December to protest the Government's labor and social policies. During the Sep-
 tember stoppage, about 70,000 workers staged a peaceful protest outside Govern-
 ment House in Buenos Aires.
 Unions are members of international labor associations and secretariats and par-
 ticipate actively in their programs.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law prohibits antiunion
 practices, and the Government enforces this prohibition. The trend towards bargain-
 ing on a company level, rather than negotiating on a sectoral basis, continued, but
 the adjustment has not been an easy one for either side. Both the Federal Govern-
 ment and a few highly industrialized provinces are working to create mediation
 services to promote more effective dispute resolution.
 Export processing zones, known as "zonas francas," exist or are planned in several
 provinces. The same labor laws apply in these zones as in all other parts of the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Comulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor and there were no reports that it was practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 children under 14 years of age, except in rare cases where the Ministry of Education
 may authorize a child to work as part of a family unit. A small number of children
 work with their parents harvesting fruits and vegetables. Minors aged 14 to 18 may
 work in a limited number of job categories but not more than 6 hours a day or 35
 hours a week. The law is effectively enforced except in some isolated rural areas
 where government enforcement capabilities are stretched thin. A report by the
 International Labor Organization indicated that 140,000 children under 14 years of
 age (4 percent of the population aged 10 to 14) work.
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national monthly minimum wage is $200
 (200 pesos), which is not sufficient to sustain an average family of four.
 Federal labor law sets standards in the areas of health, safety, and hours. The
 maximum workday is 8 hours and workweek 48 hours. As part of its economic re-
 structuring program, the Government enacted into law reforms aimed at giving
 small and medium enterprises greater flexibility in the management of their person-
 nel. The Government is also proposing to modernize the system of workers' com-
 pensation.
 Occupational health and safety standards are well developed, but federal and pro-
 vincial governments lack sufficient resources to enforce them fully. In spite of union
 vigilance, the most egregious cases of inhumane working conditions involve illegal
 immigrants, who have little opportunity or knowledge to seek legal redress.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous or unhealthful work
 situations, after having gone through a claim procedure, without jeopardy to contin-
 ued employment. Nevertheless, workers who leave the workplace before it has been
 proven unsafe run the risk of being fired; in such cases, the worker has the right
 to judicial appeal, but this process can be very lengthy.
