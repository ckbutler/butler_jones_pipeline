 MALI
 Mali has a constitutional Government headed by President Alpha Konare. After
 the overthrow of the Moussa Traore regime in March 1991, the country went
 through a 14-month transition period during which Mali held its first democratic
 national elections. In a series of six direct elections between January and April
 1992, Malians ratified a new Constitution, elected municipal councilors, National
 Assembly deputies, and finally a President. Twenty-one political parties nationwide
 participated in elections, judged by international observers to be free and fair.
 There was a gradual normalization of the security situation following the signing
 of the National Pact in April 1992, a major truce agreement, which ended the insur-
 gency in the north involving varied Tuareg and Maur groups, rangng from politi-
 cally motivated persons seeking an autonomous Tuareg state to those engaged in
 simple banditry. The improved security situation relieved some domestic pressure
 but allowed other problems to come to the fore. Violent student demonstrations over
 government efforts to restrict scholarships in April forced the resignation of the first
 government of the Third Republic. The President, in a bid to develop a consensual
 approach to the nation's problems, incorporated several former opposition political
 arties into the second Government, headed by Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou
 Mali's military and security forces number some 7,000 and are divided between
 the Arm   Air Force, Gendarmerie, the Republican Guard, and the police. The Army
 and Air Force are under the control of a civilian Minister of Defense. The Gendar-
 merie and Republican Guard are also part of the defense structure but are assigned,
 for operational purposes, along with the police, to the Ministry of Territorial Admin-
 istration. This was done in an attempt to provide a more concerted and better orga-
 nized force in the face of rising civil disturbances. With the end of the Tuareg rebel-
 lion, there were few reports of abuses by the military and security forces, who re-
 main supportive of the young democracy.
 Mali continues to be beset by a myriad of economicproblems including a sagging
 economy, a national debt roughly equal to its gross domestic product, dependence
 on international donors, inadequate government revenues, demands from a number
 of vocal special interest groups, and a literacy rate of only 23 percent. Its annual
 per capita gross national product is approximately $300. Mali's economy is based
 primarily on subsistence farming and animal husbandry, making it highly depend-
 ent on adequate rainfall for its economic well-being. The Government, at the senior
 levels, continues to be committed to implementing reforms aimed at modernizing
 the economy through fiscal and regulatory reforms.
 The Government respected constitutional provisions on freedom of speech, press,
 assembly, association, and religion, and, with the signing of the National Pact and
 the end of the Tuareg rebellion, there were no new extrajudicial killings committed
 by the security forces. Nevertheless, there were human rights abuses, notably in the
 Government's inability to process the large backlog of judicial cases in accordance
 with the law. This has resulted in persons languishing in prison for several years
 awaiting trial. Social and cultural factors continued to sharply limit economic and
 educational opportunities for most women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings and no credible reports of extrajudicial killings on the part of secu-
 
 
 173
 rity forces. The signing of the National Pact in 1992 with the Tuareg rebels, the
 formation of mixed patrols, and the integration of 600 former Tuareg rebels into the
 armed forces in the north brought an end to most organized insurgency in region.
 However, the Commission of Inquiry that was to have been established to inves-
 tigate all deaths on both sides of the conflict had not been created by year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There have been no incidents of abduction or disappearances
 attributable to government or opposition forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that no one will be subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman,
 degrading, or humiliating treatment. There were no known reports, including in the
 media, of police or military beating of detainees.
 Prison conditions are still characterized by overcrowding, inadequate medical fa-
 cilities, and limited food supplies. The Government is seeking foreign assistance to
 help improve the situation, and several associations are working with women and
 juvenile prisoners to improve their conditions. Juvenile offenders are generally held
 in the same prison as adult offenders. Women are housed in the same prison as men
 but live in a separate compound. During past prison riots, male inmates have at-
 tacked and raped female inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--The Constitution has expanded the
 rights of arrested persons. Arrested persons must be charged or released within 48
 hours, and they are entitled to counsel. In practice, detainees are not always
 charged within the 48-hour period, and administrative backlogs as well as insu1i-
 cient numbers of lawyers, judges, and courts often cause lengthy delays in bringing
 people to trial. In extreme cases, individuals can languish several years in prison
 before coming to trial.
 The law does not provide for release on bail, but detainees are sometimes released
 on their own recognizance. In October the court released on their own recognizance
 six former government and party officials from the Moussa Traore regime, awaiting
 trial for economic crimes against the State (see Section i.e.).
 In July 1991, the Government arrested Commandant Lamine Diabira and several
 other military personnel for plottingt overthrow the then transitional government.
 At year's endDiabira had still not been charged with a crime and remained in cus-
 tdy. Meanwhile, the Government has released his accused coconspirators. In re-
 sponse to diplomatic inquiries, the Ministries of Justice and Human Rights insisted
 that the Government was not technically in violation of the law, although the au-
 thorities failed to clarify the legal ground for the continued imprisonment of Diabira
 without trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of the judiciary. However, the executive branch has considerable influence on the
 judicial system: The Ministry of Justice appoints judges and supervises both law en-
 forcement and judicial functions, and the Superior Judicial Council, which super-
 vises judicial activity, is headed by the President. The Supreme Court has both judi-
 cial and administrative powers. The Constitution established a separate Constitu-
 tional Court and a High Court of Justice with the power to try senior overnment
 officials in cases of treason. Except in the case of minors, trials are public, and de-
 fendants have the right to be present and to have an attorney of their choice. De-
 fendants are presumed innocent and have the right to appeal decisions to the Su-
 preme Court. Court-a pointed attorneys are provided for the indigent.
 Following the overty. row of Moussa Tranre in 1991, the new government arrested
 him, his family, and about two dozen members of his government and political party
 and charged them with various crimes. A court found the former president and
 three former government officials to be responsible for the deaths of over 100 people
 during the demonstrations that led to Traore's overthrw and sentenced the our to
 death in 1993. Although the Suprme Cnurt denied their subsequent appeal, the
 President could still commute their sentences. These 4 men and 17 others, including
 the former president's wife, son, and brother-in-law, face additional charges for eco-
 nomic crimes against the State.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Invio-
 lability of the home isprovided for in the Constitution and is respected in practice.
 Police searches are in  en, and warrants, issued by judges, are required. The
 security forces maintain physical surveillance of individuals and groups suspected
 or known to be a threat to internal security, and, with court approval, may maintain
 technical surveillance as well.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-oThe Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press. The Government controls the only television station, one radio station,
 and the only daily newspaper, but these all operate on a semi-indepndent basis and
 
 
 174
 are open to a wide range of views, including those critical of the President, the Gov-
 ernment, and other politicians. Apart from the government radio chain, there are
 seven independent stations in Bamako and another six independent regional sta-
 tions. In spite of only a 23-percent literacy rate, there are nearly 50 independent
 newspapers and journals. Political meetings take place openly and without inter-
 ference.
 The National Assembly passed new laws regulating the press. These laws provide
 substantial penalties, including imprisonment, for slander and for public injury to
 the Head of State and other officials, including foreign diplomats. Such injury is not
 defined in the law and therefore is subject to judicial interpretation. In a case cur.
 rently under way, the President of the Supreme Court is suing the publisher of two
 weekTy newspapers for slanderous comments.
 Fol owing complaints from journalists' organizations, the Government asked the
 National Assembly to review all press laws, particularly those on the composition
 of the proposed National Press Council that will be responsible for enforcing press
 regulations. No results were available at year's end.
 Academic freedom i    s  ted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution protects the
 right of assembly and association. Permits must be obtained for mass demonstra-
 tions, and these are routinely granted. However, in Bamako in April, students did
 not obtain a permit, and their demonstrations protesting reductions in scholarships
 turned violent, leading to destruction of property.
 There are dozens of political parties and hundreds of professional and special in-
 terest associations. The Constitution forbids the formation of political parties based
 on religion, region, or ethnicity, and political parties must have their charters ap-
 p roved by the Ministry of Territorial Administration. Following the former Presi-
 dent's overthrow the transitional government banned the party of Moussa Traore,
 the Democratic Union of the Malian People (UDPM). The UDPM applied in 1993
 for recognition, but tho Government denied the application on a technicality. This
 action engendered much public debate and criticism, and the UDPM planned to ap-
 peal the Government's decision.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Mali is a secular state. The Government does not dis-
 criminate on religious grounds. Although 90-95 percent of the population are Mus-
 lim members of other religions freely practice their faiths and are permitted to es-
 tablish houses of worship and schools. Christian missionaries of various denomina-
 tions, including foreign missionaries, operate freely. Proselytizing and conversion
 ar permitted.The Government prohibits publications in which one religious group
 defames another the Minister of Territorial Administration determines whether a
 publication is defamatory.
 In October the Ministry of Territorial Administration canceled the visa of a
 Protestant German evangelist who had been planning to hold a number of revival
 meetings in Bamako later that month. The official reason for the cancellation was
 fear of civil unrest as the evangelist's visit to Nigeria in 1991 had led to large-scale
 riots. However, it was widely assumed that the Government canceled the visa as
 a result of pressure from local Islamic organizations and associations. The press was
 critical of the Government's decision, calling it a violation of the Constitution.
 Administrative orders promulgated in 1977 prohibiting members of the Baha'i
 faith from meeting in groups of more than three people are not enforced, and Baha'i
 practice their faith without interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted although police checks
 occur in which Malians and foreigners are stopped, particularly at night. These
 checks are ostensibly used to restrict the movement of contraband goods and to ver-
 ify vehicle registrations, but some police and gendarmes use the occasion to extort
 bribes. An exit visa is no longer needed.
 In recent years, Mali has both accepted and generated displaced persons. Approxi-
 mately 13,000 Mauritanian Peuhl refugees, who fled strife in their country in 1990,
 settled in Mali. For the most part, they have been absorbed into the local economy.
 The fighting in the north between government troops and Tuareg rebels generated
 an estimated 100,000 Tuareg and Maur refugees, most of whom fled to Mauritania,
 Algeria, and Burkina Faso. With the improved security situation in the three north-
 ern regions, the flow of Malian refugees declined, and the Government, together
 with its neighbors and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), planned to repatriate Malians refugees in those countries. However, at
 year's end, only a few families had returned.
 Initial reports of an incident on December 12 indicate that an army patrol killed
 three Tuareg refugees returning from Mauritania. The patrol contends that the
 three were bandits killed in a fire fight as the patrol attempted to apprehend them
 
 
 175
 following an earlier attack on a transport convoy. The Office of the Chief of Staff
 of the Armed Forces and senior representatives of the rebel movement formed a
 joint commission to investigate the incident but had not released a report by the
 end of the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1992 Malians for the first time exercised their right to change their govern-
 ment through peaceful means, electing a new President and a new multiparty Na-
 tional Assembly.
 The Third Republic is a multiparty democracy, based on the Constitution drawn
 up at the August 1991 National Conference and ratified in the January 1992 ref-
 erendum. Under the Constitution, the President is Chief of State and Commander
 in Chief of the Armed Forces and is elected for a term of 5 years with a limit of
 two terms. The President appoints a Prime Minister who is Head of Government.
 The National Assembly consists of 116 members, and representation is apportioned
 according to the population of administrative districts. Election is both direct and
 by partylist. The Constitution provides for a separation of executive, legislative, and
 judicial powers and for control of the military by the President.
 Twenty-one political parties nationwide participated in the municipal, legislative,
 and presidential elections held between Fe ruary and April 1992. The parties cam-
 paigned freely and had brad access to the state-owned media. Citizen participation
 in the elections was low but was fairly evenly distributed across most regions, ethnic
 groups, and between men and women. Balloting was secret.
 Although there were comnplaints about some irregularities, all parties accepted the
 outcome. President Al pha Oumar Konare won 60 percent of the vote in the second
 round of presidential balloting. Konare's party, the Association for Democracy in
 Mali, also won the majority of seats in the National Assembly in which 10 other
 parties are represented. The National Assembly is still a young institution. Most
 legislation originates in the Government and its ministries and is approved by the
 Assembly, but debate on key issues is vigorous.
 Women are poorly represented in the political process. There are 2 female depu-
 ties in the 116-member National Assembly and 1 female minister in the Cabinet.
 A second woman, the Secretary for the Promotion of Women, holds ministerial rank.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two independent human rights organizations: The Malian Association
 for Human Rights (AMDH), and the smaller Malian League of Human Rights. Nei-
 ther organization has been active in highlighting human rights abuses since the in-
 stallation of democracy in Mali.
 In April the Government established a Ministry of Human Rights separate from
 the Ministry of Justice, but by year's end the Human Rights Ministry had been fold-
 ed into the Ministry of Justice.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution affirms that there shall be no discrimination based on
 sex, but social and cultural factors give men a dominant role. While there are a
 number of women in the professions and government, economic and educational op-
 portunities for women remain limited. Women often live under harsh conditions, es-
 pecially in the rural areas, where they perform much of the hard farm labor and
 most of the child-rearing.
 A 1991 United Nations report indicated that females receive only 29 percent of
 the schooling of males (in terms of average number of years of schooling). Only 20
 percent of children have access to basic education. The Government, with help from
 international donors and private voluntary organizations, is working to persuade
 the public of the need for increased female education, but limited financial re-
 sources, social and cultural factors, and the harsh demands of daily life keep fe-
 males from participating to the same extent as their male counterparts.
 Despite legislation passed giving women equal rights regarding property, tradi-
 tional practice and ignorance of the law prevent women from taking advantage of
 this reform. There are some active women's groups that promote the rights of
 women and children.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is accepted and pervasive. The
 society generally does not tolerate spousal abuse that results in physical injury and
 deals with the problem informally at the village or family level. Legal action for re-
 dress of injury in such cases is not normally available, although severe physical in-
 jury is grounds for divorce.
 
 
 176
 Children.-There is no constitutional or legal provision to protect the interests
 and rights of children, but the Constitution provides for basic human rights for all
 persons. The Malian Social Services Department investigates and intervenes in
 cases of reported child abuse or neglect. The Government's resources are insufficient
 to meet the basic health care and education needs of Malian children.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. It is still com-
 mon in Mali, especially in rural areas, and is performed at an early age on females.
 The Government has not proposed legislation prohibiting female circumcision, but
 it supports educational efforts to eliminate the practice through seminars and con-
 ferences. It also provides media access to women's groups and others who are at-
 tempting to end female genital mutilation. According to an international expert, 75
 percent of the females in Mali have undergone this mutilation.
 NatioalRacial/ Ethnic Minorities.-Virtually all ethnic and language groups 
 represented at all levels of government and society and suffer little disrimination.
 The nomadic populations, however, are not completely integrated into the economic
 and political mainstream, and they resent being plitically dominated by other more
 nume rou   t  c   oups. Economic life in the t ree northern regions was signifi-
 cantly disrupted during the recent rebellion, but the National Pact, signed in April
 1992, makes prvisions for the social and economic reintgration of the displaced
 populations and for a much greater degree of political autonomy. Resource limita-
 tions have hindered implementation of the Pact's provisions.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the physically disabled or mentally handicapped, including on accessibility. The
 physically disabled are not discriminated against in access to employment, edu-
 cation, and other state services. Given the high unemployment rates, however, the
 physically disabled are often unable to find work.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code specifically
 provide for the freedom of workers to form or join unions and protect freedom of
 association. Only the military, the gendarmerie, and the Republican Guard are ex-
 cluded from forming unions. Virtually all salaried employees in Mali are organized.
 Under the old constitution, labor unions had to belong to one confederation, the
 National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM). While most unions are still part of the
 UNTM and while no new confederations have yet formed, some unions have with-
 drawn from the UNTM, and new unions tend to remain outside the UNTM. Workers
 have established independent unions for teachers, magistrates, and health workers.
 The UNTM, for its part, was a leading force in the overthrow of the previous regime
 and has maintained its autonomy from the current Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and although there are some lim-
 iting conditions, these are not especially restrictive. There were several strikes, no-
 tably among civil servants in the education and health sectors, over salary issues
 and working conditions. They were legal and did not involve violence. The strike ac-
 tions were generally resolved by negotiations between the labor unions, manage-
 ment, and the Government. Workers must give 2 weeks' notice of a planned strike
 and must enter into negotiations with the employer and a third party, usually the
 Ministry of Labor. Workers receive no pay for the time they are on strike. The Labor
 Code does prevent retribution against strikers. Most strikes have involved govern-
 ment employees, and there has been no attempt on the part of the Government to
 retaliate.
 Unions in Mali are free to associate with and participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-True collective bargaining
 does not take place. Wages and salaries for those workers belonging to the UNTM
 unions are set by tripartite negotiations between the Ministry of Labor, labor
 unions, and representatives of the federation of employers of the sector for which
 the wages are being set. These negotiations usually set the pattern for unions out-
 side the UNTM. The Ministry of Labor acts as a mediator in labor disputes.
 Neither the Constitution nor the Labor Code addresses the question of antiunion
 discrimination, but there have been no reports or complaints of antiunion behavior
 or activities. If the parties cannot come to agreement, the dispute goes to the Labor
 Court for decision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. However, the Bela are traditional slaves of Maurs and Tuaregs
 in Northern Mali, and some de facto slavery probably still exists, especially in the
 extremely remote salt mining communities north of Timbuktu.
 
 
 177
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment is 14, but with parents' permission children may be apprenticed at age 12.
 This regulation is often ignored in practice and has no effect on the vast number
 of children who work in rural areas, helping with family farms and herds, and in
 the informal sector, e.g., in street vending. They are not protected by laws against
 unjust compensation excessive hours, and capricious discharge. The Labor Inspec-
 tion Service of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for and reasonably effective in,
 enforcement of child labor laws in the modern sector only.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code specifies conditions of employ-
 ment, including hours, wages, and social security. The national minimum wage rate
 is $70 per month (20,000 CFA francs) effective as of 1991. Workers paid on a daily
 basis receive a rate of $2.65 (750 CFA francs). Workers must be paid overtime for
 additional hours. The minimum wa e is supplemented by a required package of ben-
 efits, including social security anyhealth care benefits. While this total package
 could provide a minimum standard of living for one person, in practice most wage
 earners support large extended families and must supplement their income by some
 subsistence farming or work in the informal sector.
 The normal legal workweek is 40 hours, with a requirement for at least one 24-
 hour rest period.
 The Social Security Code provides a broad range of legal protection against haz-
 ards in the workplace, and workers' groups havebrought pressure on employers to
 respect parts of the regulations, particularly those affecting personal hygiene. With
 unemployment high, however, workers are often reluctant to report violations of oc-
 cupational safety. he Labor Inspection Service of the Ministry of Labor oversees
 these standards, but enforcement is limited to the modern, formal sector due to the
 lack of inspectors. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations and request an investigation by the Social Security Department,
 which is responsible for recommending remedial action, where deemednecessary.
