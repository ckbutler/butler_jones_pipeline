 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic and parliamentary democracy. Executive power
 is vested in a president who appoints as prime minister the leader of the party that
 gains a plurality of seats in the quinquennial elections for the unicameral legisla-
 ture. The two major political parties reflect widely divergent political views. The Na-
 tionalist Party, which was brought back to power in 1987 after 16 years of Labor
 Party rule, won the elections again in 1992 with a three-seat majority in Par-
 liament.
 Law enforcement and internal security are the responsibilit of the Malta police
 under the command of a civilian commissioner. The Minister or Home Affairs and
 Social Development has jurisdiction over the police. Specially trained riot police, the
 Special Assignments Group, form part of the regular police force. Total military ex-
 penditures or 1989, the last yearor r which the Arms Control and Disarmament
 Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $22 million. The 1992 defense budget
 continues a trend of slight increases which can be attributed in part to the armed
 forces' assumption in recent years of physical security responsibility at the airport,
 banks, and government offices, and to the purchase of equipment designed to en-
 hance Malta s coastal surveillance capabilities.
 The Maltese economy is a mixture of state-owned and privately owned industry.
 In a gradual move toward a free market economy, the Government is attempting
 to divest itself of some of the state-owned companies. Tourism and light manufactur-
 ing industry are the largest contributors to the economy. Foreign investment is ac-
 tively promoted; the Government is also developing Malta as a container trans-
 shipment point and as a center for offshore business and ship registration.
 The Maltese Government is strongly committed to human rights. Constitutional
 protection for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual is upheld by
 an independent judiciary. Women continue to encounter culturally and legally based
 discrimination, and family violence against women and children has received in-
 creased attention (see Section 5). A constitutional amendment that will prohibit dis-
 crimination based on sex was passed in 1991 and becomes effective in July 1993.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There have been no reports of politi-
 cal or extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance. -No cases of political disappearance are known to have oc-
 curred.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. These
 prohibitions are generally respected in practice. A legal inquiry into a case, pending
 since 1991, of alleged mistreatment of a foreigner imprisoned for drug muggling
 cleared the prison authorities of any deliberate wrongdoing.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention is provided for in the Constitution and generally respected in practice. The
 police may, on the basis of reasonable suspicion, arrest a person for questioning.
 ithin 48 hours, persons so arrested must be brought before the court and charged
 or released. There is no right to legal counsel dunng this 48-hour period. Persons
 incarcerated pending trial have access to counsel, and periodic hearings are manda-
 tory. Provision for bail exists.
 Political exile is prohibited by law. There are no reports of such exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution requires a fair public trial before
 an impartial court. Defendants have the right to counsel of their choice, including
 court-appointed counsel at public expense if necessary; they enjoy a presumption of
 innocence, may confront witnesses and present evidence, and have the right of ap-
 peal. The courts' jurisdiction is limited in certain areas. Lay tribunals (e.g.. the In-
 
 
 845
 dustrial Tribunal and the Inheritance Partition Tribunal) have exclusive authority
 over certain judicial functions. Defendants before these tribunals may be rep-
 resented by lawyers.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Protec-
 tion of privacy of the home is provided for in the Constitution and generally re-
 spected in practice. There were only four claims of alleged violations of invasion of
 privacy, none of which were upheld by the constitutional court. Police officers of the
 rank of inspector and above may issue search warrants without a court order. Elec-
 tronic surveillance is prohibited by law.
 Membership and participation in political parties are voluntary. However, there
 is strong societal (e.g., family or employment) pressure for affiliation with particular
 parties.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of expression in speech and in the
 press is protected by the Constitution and generally respected in practice. An excep-
 tion is the 1987 constitutional amendment that bans foreign participation in local
 politics (eg., guest foreign speakers sponsored by a political party) during the period
 prior to an election. Since the passage of the 1991 Broadcasting Law establishing
 pluralism in the broadcast media, 7 new private radio stations have been licensed
 making a total of 10 stations operating in 1992. In addition to the government
 owned television channel, a commercial cable television company began operations
 in 1992.
 Eleven daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers freely express their views. Several
 newspapers are associated with political parties. Academic freedom generally is re-
 spected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of peaceful assembly
 is provided for in the Constitution. Police permits are routinely issued for political
 meetings and other public activities of political parties or groups of citizens.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The right to practice the religion of one's choice is pro-
 tected constitutionally and is respected. The overwhelmingly dominant religion is
 Roman Catholicism; small numbers of people practice other religions. State sub-
 sidies are granted only to Catholic schools. In the government schools, students
 have the opportunity at any stage to opt out of religious instruction in the Catholic
 faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within the country, foreign trav-
 el, or emigration. Various civil rights groups, among those the Association for Men's
 Rights, initiated a campaign against abusive use of the "impediment of departure"
 provision of Maltese law. According to this law, a court may place a temporary order
 prohibiting a person from leaving the country for such offenses as nonpayment of
 debts or non-support of an estranged wife and children. Maltese emigrants who
 have acquired the citizenship of another country and resided abroad for a minimum
 of 6 years may hold dual citizenship.
 A large number of persons of various nationalities sought refuge in Malta in 1992.
 Foreign nationals claiming refugee status while visiting Malta generally are not per-
 mitted to remain permanently but often receive temporary work permits until ar-
 rangements have been made for settlement in a third country. The Ermigrants Com-
 mission, established in 1987 as the local representative of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has worked well in providing assistance and
 counseling for refugees until they are accepted by the UNHCR.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Malta is a parliamentary, democracy in which the incumbent Nationalist Party
 and the opposition Malta Labor Party dominate public life. Elections in which all
 parties participate freely ar held every 5 years, with universal suffrage for those
 18 years of age and over. During the 1992 election over 96 percent of the electorate
 voted.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights gups and persons interested in promoting and pro-
 tecting human rights operate freely. The Governmentplaces no restrictions on in-
 vestigations by international human rights groups. It is strongly committed to
 human rights and is active in international human rights forums.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Maltese citizens have a legal right to housing, employment, and education on a
 nondiscriminatory basis. However, for reasons derived from tradition and culture,
 Maltese society has only recently begun to associate women's rights with human
 rights. Current law subordinates married women to their husbands in economic and
 financial matters, as well as in authority over the children. Although the Govern-
 ment circulated a white paper draft of a reformed family law in 1991, it did not in-
 troduce the legislation in Parliament in 1992 as expected, despite pressure by wom-
 en's groups and the Government's own Commission on the Advancement of Women.
 Under the constitutional amendment passed in 1991, to become effective in Julr
 1993, the Government committed itself to promote economic, social, cultural, civil,
 and political equal rights and to take appropriate measures to eliminate all forms
 of discrimination between the sexes. As of the effective date, an aggrieved person
 will be able to seek redress in court on the basis of sex discrimination. The constitu-
 tional amendment to eliminate all forms of discrimination between the sexes will
 not automatically invalidate the present family law. However, parties who feel they
 are discriminated against may take legal action and expect to obtain redress from
 the courts. A transition period was incorporated specifically to amend ancillary laws
 and regulations, such as the family law, to conform with the constitutional amend-
 ment.
 There are no laws specifically prohibiting abuse of women. Violence in the family
 and abuse of women and children are more widespread than was previously be-
 lieved. Responding to increased publicity and pressure from various women's groups
 demanding more government involvement and laws dealing with family violence,
 the Government announced the creation of a special police squad to work with vol-
 untary organizations on problems of domestic violence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right, respected in practice, to as-
 sociate freely and to strike. The only groups restrained from striking are the uni-
 formed personnel of the armed forces and the police. In 1992 there were 24 reg-
 istered trade unions representing about 50 percent of the work force. During 1992
 the institutional ties between the General Workers' Union and the Malta Labor
 Party were ended. As a result, all unions are now generally independent of political
 parties. They belong to a variety of international trade union groups. In 1992 there
 were 4 strikes involving a total of 99 workers and a loss of 68 workdays.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act of 1976, the responsible minister may refer
 disputes to the Industrial Tribunal for binding settlement. The International Labor
 Organization (ILO) objects to that provision, most recently in the 1991 Committee
 of Experts' report, pointing out that it, in effect, limits the right to strike; however,
 both labor and employers appear to have no objection to the clause. In practice, a
 striking union can ignore an unfavorable decision by continuing the strike on an-
 other ground. Last year the Government initiated a study of the 1976 Act aimed
 at bringing it into conformity with European Community laws as well as ILO Con-
 vention 87 on freedom of association and also at improving certain provisions, such
 as those affecting job security.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free, in law and
 in practice, to organize and bargain collectively. While most wages are negotiated
 between unions and employers, the Government in 1990 mandated a substantial na-
 tionwide wage increase after reaching agreement with the unions and employers. In
 December 1990, the three social partners (government, trade unions, and employers)
 signed a comprehensive agreement regulating industrial relations and income pol-
 icy. Cost-of-living increases are now established in accordance with government sta-
 tistics based on the retail price index as calculated by a tripartite independent com-
 mittee. During the term of this 3-year agreement, the Malta Council for Economic
 Development will inform all three partners semiannually of the projected changes
 in the price index. The projections are to serve as a basis for negotiations on collec-
 tive agreements.
 According to the Industrial Relations Act, an employer may not take action
 against any employee because he or she belongs to a trade union. Complaints may
 be addressed through a court of law or an industrial tribunal composed of one mem-
 ber each named by the employer, the union, and the Government. Complaints of dis-
 crimination may also be lodged with the Commission against Injustices.
 There are no export processing zones in Malta.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is constitutionally
 prohibited and does not exist. Any claimed violations would be submitted for adju-
 dication to the Constitutional Court.
 
 
 847
 d. Minimum   ge for Employment of Children.-Children younger than 16 years
 may not legally be employed. The law is generally respected, and the Department
 of Labor, which is responsible for enforcement, does so effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage, which is generally
 enforced, provides a decent standard of living for a worker and family when govern-
 ment subsidies for housing, health care, and free education are added.
 Hours of work are regulated by Wage Council orders for various trades. For most
 sectors, the standard is 40 hours per week, but in some trades the standard before
 overtime is paid is 43 or 45 hours per week. Government labor regulations prescribe
 daily rest periods of I hour. The annual paid vacation according to law is currently
 22 working days. In general, these laws and regulations are effectively enforced by
 the Department of Labor.
 The government-proposed establishment of an authority for workers' health, safe-
 ty, and welfare still has not occurred. Enforcement of occupational health and safety
 standards, the responsibility of the Department of Labor, has been lax. Existing
 laws are considered by some to be outdated and inadequate to protect workers effec-
 tively.
