 BOLWIA
 BOLWIA
 A constitutional, multiparty democracy with an elected president and bicameral
 legislature, Bolivia has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches with an
 attorney general independent of all three. The judiciary, while independent, is cor-
 rupt and inefficient. The executive and legislative branches share these defects to
 some extent. Constitutional amendments to reform the political and judicial systems
 that were approved in August 1994 were partially implemented by the end of 1996.
 The National Police have primary responsibility for internal security, although
 the army, navy, and air force can be called upon for help in critical situations. A
 special antinarctica force (FELCN), including the Mobile Rural Patrol Unit
 (UMOPAR), is dedicated to antinarcotics enforcement. Civilian authorities maintain
 effective control of the security forces, but some members of these forces committed
 human rights abuses.
 Although rich in minerals and hydrocarbons, Bolivia has an annual per capita
 gross domestic product of about $1,000. Principal exports are minerals, natural gas,
 and other raw materials; traditional agriculture dominates the domestic economy.
 Poverty is endemic. Many citizens lack such basic services as water, electricity, sew-
 ers, and primary health care. The centralized economy has long depended heavily
 on foreign aid. To promote development and a transition to a marketleconomy, the
 Government is carrying out a program of privatization, deficit reduction, to
 strengthen the banking system, and encourage increased exports and foreign invest-
 ment.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 legal and institutional deficiencies prevented their full protection. The Government
 continued its initiatives to improve this situation, but implementation was slow. The
 most pervasive human rights abuse continued to be prolonged incarceration of de-
 tainees due to antiquated procedures, inefficiency, and corruption in the judicial sys-
 tem.There were credible reports of abuses by police including excessive force, petty
 theft, extortion, and improper arrests. Prison guards beat prisoners. Human rights
 
 
 groups criticized the FELCN and the UMOPAR for abuses, particularly against coca
 growers and peasants in the Chapare region. Although the authorities disciplined
 or brought charges against 40 members of these units, in general police remained
 reluctant to prosecute their own colleagues for offenses. Investigations of alleged of-
 ficial abuses were slow. Other problems include harsh prison conditions, violence
 and discrimination against women, discrimination against and abuse of indigenous
 people, abuse of children, and inhuman working conditions in the mining industry.
 on roversy continued as to whether certain actions, s as as temporary detentions
 taken to implement a state of siegein April 1995, were unconstitutional and violated
 human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. However, there were two instances in which security forces killed
 protesters while trying to control demonstrations.
 Two deaths resulted from confrontations between demonstrators and security au-
 thorities in connection with teachers' union protests. On March 25 a police antiriot
 shotgun pellet evidently killed Rosendo Chino Olori, a market porter, in central La
 Paz. Chino was an innocent paserby caught up in a battle between teachers' union
 demonstrators armed with sln   and dyamite, and police using tear  s and rub-
 her shotgun pellets. Demonstrators at first prevented police from reacng Chino's
 body, claiming that he was a murdered fellow teacher. They roughed up a television
 camera crew at the scene. Police initially asserted that Chino died because the
 teachers did not allow him to receive medical assistance. However, a televised au-
 topsy confirmed what closeup news photos of the corpse had suggested, i.e., that
 Chino's chest wound was massive and that no treatment could have saved him. A
 pathologist displayed on camera what appeared to be a large plastic pellet he re-
 moved from Chino's body and stated that it had been fired at close range causing
 nearly instantaneous death. The authorities did not deny that a police weapon killed
 Chino, although they said they had not authorized government forces to fire. The
 Government closed its investigation after failing to determine which policeman fired
 the shot.
 Wilber Ferreira Cespedes, age 15, was killed in Cobija, Pando department, on
 May 23. The death occurred when demonstrators stoned the department administra-
 tive offices where officials were signing an agreement to end a 2-month teachers
 strike. A shotgun projectile fired by a police official guarding the building struck
 Ferreira. One pathologist identified it as a lead pellet, and another as a rubber pel-
 let. An investigation was still in progress at year's end.
 The final results of these investigations, and of the investigations into the five law
 enforcement-related deaths in the Chapare in 1995, have not been released. No ac-
 tion is known to have been taken against any official involved. The police officer ac-
 cused in 1994 of murdering coca worker Felipe Perez Ortiz, who escaped from cus-
 tody in September of that year, has not been recaptured. The investigation contin-
 uedin the case of five police officials arrested at the end of 1994 and charged with
 culpable negligence in the death of a prisoner, and the five officers remained free
 pending its completion. The Government's failure to complete effective investiga-
 tions and publish the findings witlin a reasonable time amounts to impunity de-
 spite contrary government policies.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government honors the constitutional prohibition against torture. However,
 there were reports that police used undue force in detaining farm workers during
 antinarcotics operations. Although many such allegations clearly were politically
 motivated exaggerations, the similarity and volume of such claims suggest that they
 had some basis in truth. However, no security personnel were charged or tried. In
 July the National Police announced activation of a special Police Control Corps to
 monitor police behavior and to discipline officials who commit abuses. Beginning
 with an 18-member unit in La Paz, the Government plans to extend the corps
 throughout the country.
 The authorities disciplined or held for prosecution 40 members of the FELCN and
 the UMOPAR for offenses including corruption, extortion, and attempted rape. The
 three policemen accused of raping a juvenile prisoner in 1995 were discharged and
 in jail awaiting trial at year's end. In general, however, the police were reluctant
 to prosecute their own colleagues for offenses. Congress has yet to take action on
 the 1995 report of its Human-Rights Committee resurrecting allegations that police
 
 
 359
 officials had in past years tortured captured terrorists and recommending that
 criminal proceedings be opened against a number of named officers.
 There were credible reports that guards beat some prisoners for attempting to es-
 cape from custody. The authorities suspended some prison personnel pending inves-
 tigation.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Prisons are overcrowded, and conditions can be life
 threatening for inmates without money. Ability to pay can determine cell size, visit-
 ing privileges, day-pass eligibility, and place or even length of confinement. Cell
 prices range from $20 to $5,000, paid to prior occupants or to prisoners who control
 cell blocks. In the poorest parts of La Paz" San Pedro prison, for example, inmates
 occupy tiny cells (3 by 4 by 6 feet) with no ventilation, lighting, or beds. Crowding
 in some "low-rent" sections obliges inmates to sleep sitting up. Children up to 6
 years old may live with an incarcerated parent; an estimated 400 children do so.
 The authorities worked to get such children out of prisons, but many have nowhere
 else to go. The standard prison diet according to a 1995 study, can cause anemia.
 Drugs and alcohol are readily available for those who can pay. There is no adequate
 health care within the prisons, and it is very difficult for prisoners to get permission
 for medical treatment outside. Affluent prisoners, however, can obtain transfers to
 preferred prisons or even to outside private institutional care for "medical" reasons.
 Convicted juvenile prisoners are not segregated from adult prisoners in jails. Re-
 habilitation programs for juveniles or other prisoners are scarce to nonexistent. The
 Government has acknowledged these problems but does not have sufficient re-
 sources to correct them quickly.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors and news media
 representatives.
 The incidence of violence was far lower in the Chapare coca growing region than
 in 1995, as more growers agreed to have their crops eradicated in exchange for com-
 pensation. However, there were credible reports that coca growers unions used phys-
 ical coercion and intimidation to prevent farm workers from cooperating with the
 Government in coca eradication. indigenous groups complained that armed coca
 growers invade their lands by force and coerce or bribe their members to cultivate
 iegal coca.
 Indigenous communities in areas with little or no central government presence
 impose corporal punishment such as whipping on members who violate traditional
 laws or rules, although such punishment is foridden by the Constitution.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arrests are carried out openly. The law
 requires a valid warrant, which a court must confirm within 48 hours. However,
 there were credible reports that these legal safeguards were violated in some cases.
 Denial of justice through prolonged detention remains the most pervasive human
 rights problem. Judicial corruption, a shortage of public defenders, inadequate case-
 tracking mechanisms, and complex criminal justice procedures keep persons incar-
 cerated for months, or even years, before trial. A survey in September of the largest
 prison, San Pedro, revealed that about 80 percent of the inmates still were awaiting
 either trial or sentence. The Constitution provides for judicial determination of the
 legality of detention. Prisoners are released if a judge rules detention illegal, but
 the process can take months. Prisoners may see a lawyer, but approximately 70 per-
 cent cannot afford legal counsel, and public defenders are overbulrdened. Bail exists,
 except in some drug cases, and is generally granted.
 The Government continues to address the problem of delay of justice by imple-
 menting the 1994 constitutional reforms to streamline the judicial system and tak-
 ing measures to correct other deficiencies as they come to light. The Personal Recog-
 nizance Law promulgated in February permits pretrial release on personal recog-
 nizance for those unable to post bond, and provisional liberty for those declared in-
 nocent but awaiting review or appeal, or those already imprisoned longer than the
 maximum sentence for their alleged offense. The new law also shortens the permis-
 sible time for various stages of the penal process, including preventive detention.
 The authorities freed more than 1,000 prisoners provisionally or permanently under
 this law in its first 7 months. When it became known that hundreds of cases were
 suffering long delays because the defendants could not pay postage costs to transfer
 their files between judicial offices, a Supreme Decree eliminated that obligation.
 The Public Defender programi being expanded with a current total of 16 of-
 fices nationwide, has in its first 3 years of existence freed neariy 18,000 persons who
 probably would have remained imprisoned for lack of legal defense. From its estab-
 lishment in October 1994 until September 1996, the Public Defender's office in the
 coca-growing Chapare region-where most allegations of official abuse arise-rep-
 resented persons in 2,141 cases, obtaining iberty for the defendants in 1,502 of
 them. The office is taking an active approach by distributing concise information
 about human rights to the populace and seeking to be involved in arrest cases at
 
 
 360
 the earliest possible juncture to ensure that human rights and due process are hon-
 ored. A new program of mobile public defenders who can reach out to the more re-
 mote parts of the area has proven effective, and is being extended to other isolated
 regions of the country.
 Children from 11 to 16 years of age can be detained indefinitely in children's cen-
 ters for known or suspected offenses, or for their protection, simply on the orders
 of a social worker. There is no judicial review.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent, but corruption and
 intimidation in the judicial system remain major problems. Poor pay and working
 conditions help make judges and prosecutors susceptible to bribes. Five Supreme
 Court ministers face investigations and possible corruption charges. Several lower
 court judges, as well as some" prosecutors, were the subjects of similar allegations
 during the year, resulting in some firings and pending legal actions.
 The judicial system has four levels: Investigative, tri, and superior courts, with
 the Supreme Court at the apex. In mid-1995, the Congress approved five new jus-
 tices to complete the Supreme Court bench, ending a period of 18 months in which
 the court was not fully staffed or fully functional. T ustices admit, however, that
 it is still difficult to assemble the quorum needed for decisions, and rulings are un-
 duly delayed.
 Police present the case of an arrested person to a prosecutor. If the prosecutor
 decides to prosecute, the case is then submitted to an investigative court which de-
 cides whether there is sufficient evidence to issue an indictment; if so, the case goes
 to a trial court. The trial court's decision may be appealed to superior court and,
 eventually, to the Supreme Court. Bail is usually available. Cases of persons ar-
 rested under the counternarcotics law go directly from a special prosecutor to the
 trial court. There is no bail in narcotics cases. The trial court's decision must be re-
 viewed by the district superior court, which may confirm, lower, raise, or annul the
 sentence, or impose a sentence where there was none before. Both the district pros-
 ecutor and the defense attorney may make recommendations and comments at this
 stage. Superior court deisions in narcotics cases must be reviewed by the Supreme
 Court whose decision is final. Under the Personal Recognizance Law, persons who
 are absolved or found innocent in either of the two first instances may then be
 nted provisional liberty while they await the mandatory higher reviews.
 e authorities generally respect the constitutional guarantee of the riht to a
 fair public trial. However, the maximum time periods prmitted by law fur different
 stages of the judicial process frequently are exceeded. efendants have the right to
 an attorney, to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal judicial deci-
 sions. The authorities generally honor these rights. Although the law provides for
 a defense attorney at public expense if needed, one is not always promptly available.
 The highly formal and corrupt judicial system makes it difficult fur poor, illiterate
 persons to have effective access to courts and legal redress.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides fur the sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens, and
 government authorities generally respect these provisions. There were credible sre-
 g ations of UMOPAR abuses involving illegal searches and thefts of property from
 somes. However, residents in the coca growing areas generally are reluctant to file
 and pursue formal complaints. In August 1995, the Government and coca growers'
 union representatives agreed to form a mixed commission with offices throughout
 the Chapare coca-growing region, where most offenses allegedly occur. These offices
 would accept and pursue complaints of human rights abuses committed by anyone,
 including police, narcotics traffickers, or coca growers. The first such office began
 to function in Chimore in December 1995 and has been active in investigating some
 complaints.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the fundamental
 right to express ideas and opinions freely by any means of dissemination. There are,
 however, some limitations on freedom of speech. The Penal Code provides that per-
 sons found guilty of insulting, defaming, or slandering public officials fur carrying
 out their duties may be jailedi from 1 month to 2 years. If the insults are  ted
 against the President, Vice President, or a Minister, the sentence may be increased
 by one-half. Although this law was rarely enforced, in March the authorities jailed
 former attorney genera    l Manuel Morales Davila for accusing the President of trea-
 son. At year's end, Morales Davila was at liberty pending trial.
 State-owned and private radio and television stations operated freely. Newspapers
 are privately owned most adopt antigvernment positions.
 
 
 The Government respects academic freedom, and the law grants public univer-
 sities autonomous status. Some Marxist groups of teachers and students sought to
 deny academic freedom and to impose their political agenda on the education proc-
 ess. Radical, Trotskyite elements of the La Paz teachers' union symbolically burned
 books to be used in the Government's education reform plan, which removes the
 teachers' control of the curriculum and subjects them to quality review by parents
 and civic authorities.
 b. Freedom of Peacefui Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the rights
 of peaceful assembly and association, and the authorities respect them in practice.
 The Government routinely grants permits for marches and rallies and, as a rule,
 the authorities try to avoid confronting demonstrators. However, police clashed with
 union and other demonstrators on many occasions. Labor, political, and student
 groups carried out many demonstrations and rallies in La Paz and other cities
 throfighout the year, particularly during the first quarter. The authorities inter-
 vened only when they became dangerously violent or interfered substantially with
 normal civic activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism predominates, and the Constitution
 recognizes it as the official religion. However, citizens may practice the religion of
 their choice. About 400 religious groups, mostly Protestant, are active. Missionary
 goups must register with the Foreign Ministry as nongovernmental organizations
 GO's)- there was no indication that they were treated differently from other
 NGO's. ihe Ministry did not disallow any registrations by missionary groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel. The law permits emigration and
 provides for the right to return. The Government does not revoke citizenship for po-
 litical reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Some refugees
 were accepted for resettlement. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not
 arise. Early in 1996, the authorities returned some Peruvians deemed to be improp-
 erly in the country in the wake of the 1995 kidnaping of industrialist Samuel Dora
 Medina by the Tupac Amar terrorist group, but there were no reports that they
 were subsequently persecuted in Peru.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Political parties ranging from far
 left to moderate right function openly. Implementing regulations for the 1994 con-
 stitutional revisions provide for more than half of the congressional deputies to be
 elected individually and directly, rather than from party lists.
 No legal impediments exist to women or indigenous people voting, holding politi-
 cal office, or rising to political leadership. Nevertheless, the number of women and
 indigenous people who have prominent positions in politics remains small. Most of
 the political parties have said that they will accede to demands from women that
 they be allocated a fair share of the candidacies in the 1997 national elections.
 There are 13 women in the 130-seat Chamber of Deputies, but none in the Senate
 or the Cabinet. The Vice President, Victor Hugo Cardenas, is an Aymara.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. However, they criticize
 human rights advocates for paying attention exclusively to the negative aspects of
 the Government's performance. The Human Rights Committee of the Congress is
 very active and frequently criticizes the Government publicly.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based upon race, sex, language, religion,
 political or other opinion, origin, or economic or socil1 condition. Nonetheless, there
 was significant discrimination against women, indigenous people, and the small
 la n          l        e inorIy
 blackeminorioence against women is pervasive. A study by the National Institute
 Wo en ;jo    om:
 of Statistics covering the July 1992une 1993 period found that 40 percent of all
 reported violent attacks in La Paz department were perpetrated against women.
 Ninety-five percent of the attackers were male; in 71 percent of the cases the
 
 
 362
 
 attacker was closely related to the victim. Of these domestic violence complaints, 52
 percent involved physical mistreatment and 48 percent involved psychological abuse.
 A total of 11,069 complaints of violence against women were registere in La Paz
 during this period. The Government estimates that there are about 100,000 inci-
 dents of violence against women annually nationwide and that as many as 95 per-
 cent of them go unpunished. The Congressional Committee on Women stated that
 an average of 3.5 cases of rape or statutory rape were reported each day for the
 first half of 1995 and estimated that twice that many cases were not reported.
 The Government continued to implement a program to protect women. In Decem-
 ber 1995, the Government promulgated the Law on Domestic Violence, which makes
 rape a public crime and broadens the definition of family member abuse. Public
 agencies state that reported incidents of abuse have increased markedly as a result
 of the new law, as citizens become more aware of the problem and of the availability
 of help.
 Comprehensive legal services offices continued to be established to help and sup-
 port women. There were 26 such offices operating throughout the country by early
 1996. Family protection police units, staffed by specially trained officers including
 women, were also expanded with a target of 10 by mid-year. Other elements of the
 program include revisions to school curriculums and educating health care providers
 about the appropriate manner of dealing with female patients.
 A new medical security program inaugurated in July guarantees free medical care
 to women of reproductive age and to children under the age of 5, based on economic
 need.
 The Penal Code does not define sexual harassment as a crime; the authorities
 must try persons accused of harassment under other penal provisions. There are no
 statistics on the incidence of sexual harassment, but the problem is generally ac-
 knowledged to exist widely in the male-oriented society.
 Women generally do not enjoy a social status equal to that of men. Many women
 do not know their legal rights; traditional prejudices and social conditions remain
 obstacles to advancement. Women generaly earn less than men for equal work.
 Young girls often leave school to work at home or on the economy. Although not
 effectively enforced, the national labor law is overprotective in some aspects, limit-
 ing women to a workday 1 hour shorter than that of men and prohibiting them from
 working at night.
 Children.-The Government is aware of the precarious situation of children and
 the need to provide legal and institutional infrastructure for their protection. How-
 ever, the Governmenthas not given the situation sufficient political priority to en-
 sure that it will be corrected quickly and effectively.
 Statistics from the Ministry of Planning's Education Reform Team show that in
 rural areas, only 0.7 percent of girls and 1.4 percent of boys finish high school; in
 urban areas, 26 percent of girls and 31 percent of boys do so. The 1994 Education
 Reform  Act sought to improve the situation of children; even optimistic observers,
 however, noted that it will take years for it to have an impact.
 The National Institute of Statistics calculated in 1995 that 47 percent of children
 in La Paz were chronically undernourished, and that 10 percent of the children mi-
 grating from rural areas showed evidence of acute malnutrition.
 Many children, particularly from rural areas, lack the birth certificates and iden-
 tity documents they need to secure social benefits and protection. There were credi-
 ble allegations that as many as 200 juveniles, for instance, were incarcerated as
 adults in the San Pedro jail for lack of reliable civil documents proving their ages.
 The Minor's Code promulgated in 1992 has proven inadequate.
 According to a 1995 report by the director of the National Institute of Child Devel-
 opment, 96,000 children have mental disabilities, 37,000 have physical disabilities,
 4,000 have hearing impairments, and 2,500 have visual impairments. Because of
 scarce resources, only about 400 of these children were treated in government facili-
 ties.
 Government surveys suggest that about 1 million children (or about 1 child in 3)
 suffer physical or psychological abuse--13 percent of them at school, where corporal
 punishment and veral abuse are common, and 87 percent at home. About 20 per-
 cent of all children suffer abuse severe enough to result in bruises, scars, or burns.
 Although laws provide safeguards against children working, they are not effectively
 enforced, and about 216,000 children work, usually to help provide for family sub-
 sistence, in uncontrolledad sometimes unhealthy conditions (see Section 6.d.).
 The old practice of "criadit" service still persists in some parts of the country.
 Criadito s are indigenous children of both sexes, usually 10 to 12 years old, whom
 their parents indenture to middle- and upper-class families to perform household
 work mn exchange for education, clothing, room, and board. Therere no controls
 
 
 363
 over the benefits to, or treatment of, such children, who may become virtual slaves
 for the years of their indenture.
 People With Disabilities.-In December 1995, the Congress passed a law on dis-
 abilities drafted by the Senate Commission on Social Development and interested
 NGO's. The law provides for equal employment and social rights for the disabled,
 provides incentives to employers, and requires national and local governmental
 agencies to strengthen or create units charged with responsibility for the disabled.
 It also establishes the right of access to pub_'c and private facilities -without archi-
 tectural impediment" for people with disabilities. The new electoral law made ar-
 rangements for blind voters. in general, however, there are no special services or
 infrastructure to accommodate pple with disabilities. A lack of adequate resources
 impedes full implementation of the new law. Social attitudes keep many disabled
 persons at home from an early age, limiting their integration into society.
 Indigenous People.-Discrimination against, and abuses of, indigenous people con-
 tinued. The indigenous majority generally remains at the low end of the socio-
 economic scale, facing severe disadvantages in health, life expectancy, education, in-
 come, literacy, and employment. Lack of education, inefficient farming and miin"g
 methods, indigenous cultural practices, inability to speak Spanish, and societal bi-
 ases keep the indigenous people poor. They continued to be exploited in the work-
 place. Some rural indigenous workers are ke t in a state of virtual slavery by em-
 ployers who charge them more for room and bard than they earn. Although the
 October Agrarian Reform Law extended the protection of the national labor law to
 all paid agricultural workers, including indigenous workers, the problem persists for
 lack of effective enforcement.
 The Agrarian Reform Law also provides for indigenous communities to have legal
 title to their communal lands and for individual farmers to have title to the land
 they work. The Government and indigenous leaders jointly developed provisions of
 this law; the authorities presented the first communal titles to seven indigenous
 groups in December.
 Indigenous people complain that their territories are not legally defined and pro-
 tected, and that their resources are exploited by outsiders. Specific offenders alleg-
 edly are coca growers and timber pirates. Indigenous groups have taken advantage
 of the Popular Participation Law to form municipalities that offer them greater op-
 portunities for self-determination.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assciation.-Workers may form and join organizations of their
 choosing. Th~e Labor Code requires prior government authorization to establish a
 union, permits only one union per enterprise, and allows the Government to dissolve
 unions' however, the Government has not enforced these provisions in recent years.
 While the code denies civil servants the right to organize and bans strikes in public
 services, including banks and public markets, nearly all civilian government work-
 ers are unionized. Workers are not penalized for union activities. In theory the Bo-
 livian Labor Federation (COB) represents virtually the entire work force; however,
 only about one-half of workers in the formal economy actually belong to labor
 unions. Some members of the informal economy also participate in labor or trade
 organizations.
 Workers in the private sector frequently exercise the right to strike. Solidarity
 strikes are illegal but the Government has not prosecuted those responsible nor im-
 posed penalties. Significant strikes centered around annual negotiations over sala-
 ries and benefits for public employees. However, their real targets were the Govern-
 ment's economic and social reform programs. Most strikes were conducted and led
 by the militant Trotskyite element of the Urban Teachers Union. Other disturb-
 ances occurred in the Chapare region where the coca growers' unions opposed gov-
 ernment eradication efforts. Normal activity in major cities was sometimes para-
 lyzed by rioting unionists in the first quarter of the year.
 Unions are not free from influence by political parties. The COB itself is a politi-
 cal organization directed by Marxist ideologues. Its stated aim is to overthrow the
 Government's neoliberal economic program, and it gives little attention to serious
 collective bargaining. Most parties have labor committees that attempt to influence
 union activity and also have party activists inside the unions.
 The law allows unions to join international labor organizations. The COB became
 an affiliate of the Communist, formerly Soviet-dominated, World Federation of
 Trade Unions in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Workers may organize and
 bargain collectively. In practice, collective bargaining, defined as voluntary direct
 negotiations between unions and employers without participation of the Govern-
 ment, is limited. Consultations between government representatives and labor lead-
 
 
 364
 ers are common, but there are no collective bargaining agreements as defined above.
 In state industries, the union issues a list of demands and the Government concedes
 some points. Private employers often use public sector settlements as guidelines for
 their own adjustments, and some private employers exceed the government settle-
 ments. The Government, conscious of International Monetary Fund guidelines, rare-
 ly grants wage increases exceeding inflation.
 The law prohibits discrimination against union members and organizers. Com-
 plaints go to the National Labor Court, which can take a year or more to rule. The
 court has ruled in favor of discharged workers in some cases and successfully re-
 quired their reinstatement. However, union leaders say problems are often moot by
 the time the court rules.
 Labor law and practice in the seven special duty-free zones arethe same as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. However, the practices of child apprenticeship and agricultural ser-
 vitude by indigenous workers (see Section 5) constitute violations, as do some indi-
 vidual cases of household workers effectively imprisoned by their employers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 persons under 18 years of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work. The Labor
 Code is ambiguous on conditions of employment for minors from 14 to 17 years of
 age, and permits apprenticeship for those 12 to 14 years old. This practice has been
 criticized'by the International Laor Organization.
 Responsibility for enforcing child labor provisions resides in the Labor Ministry,
 but it generally does not enforce provisions about employment of children. Although
 the law requires all children to complete at least 5 years of primary school, the re-
 quirement is poorly enforced, particularly in rural areas. Urban children sell goods,
 shine shoes, and assist transport operators. Rural children often work with parents
 from an early age. Children are not generally employed in factories or formal busi-
 nesses but, when employed, often work the same hours as adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In conformity with the law, the minimum wage
 is subject to annual renegotiation and was adjusted in April to approximately $43.30
 (223 Bolivianos) per month plus bonuses and fringe benefits. The minimum wage
 does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family, and most
 workers earn more. Although the minimum wage falls below prevailing wages in
 most jobs, certain fringe benefits are pegged to it. The minimum wage does not
 cover about 20 percent of urban workers-vendors and shoe polishers, for example-
 nor does it cover farmers, some 30 percent of the working population.
 Only half the urban labor force enjoys an 8-hour work day and a workweek of 5
 or 51/ days, because the maximum workweek of 44 hours is not enforced. The Labor
 Ministry's Bureau of Occupational Safety has responsibility for protection of work-
 ers' health and safety, but relevant standards are poorly enforced. Working condi-
 tions in the mining sector are particularly bad. Although the State Mining Corpora-
 tion has an office responsible for safety, many mines, often old and using antiquated
 equipment, are dangerous and unhealthy. In some mines operated as cooperatives,
 miners earn less than $3 per 12-hour day. They work without helmets, boots, or res-
 pirators in mines where toxic gases abound; they buy their own supplies, including
 dynamite, have no scheduled rest periods, and must survive underground from 24
 to 72 hours continuously with little water and food. There are no special provisions
 in law defining when workers may remove themselves from dangerous situations.
 Unless the work contract covers this area, any worker who refuses to work based
 on the individual's judgment of excessively dangerous conditions may face dismissal.
