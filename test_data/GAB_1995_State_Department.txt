 GABON
 A one-party state until 1990, Gabon held its first multiparty elections in 1991,
 with President Omar Bongo's party retaining a large majority in the National As-
 sembly. President Bongo, in office since 1967, was reelected in 1993 in an election
 marred by serious irregularities. After several months of contention and civil unrest,
 parties supporting the President and the principal opposition parties negotiated in
 October 1994 the "Paris Accords," which included promises of reforms to amend
 electoral procedures, to include opposition leaders in the Government and to assure
 greater respect for human rights. More than 96 percent of citizens voting in a na-
 tional referendum in July endorsed laws and constitutional amendments codifying
 these reforms. The 27-member Cabinet includes 6 opposition leaders. Municipal and
 legislative elections are scheduled for 1996. The judiciary is generally independent,
 but remains vulnerable to government manipulation.
 The national police and the gendarmerie enforce the law and maintain public se-
 curity. In accordance with the Paris Accords, the National Assembly reassigned au-
 thority over the security forces from the Ministry of Defense to the civilian Ministry
 of the Interior and redesignated as the "Republican Guard" the elite heavily-armed
 corps which protects the President. In 1994 the Defense Minister used this corps
 for violent repression of public dissent, but in 1995 there were no instances in which
 it acted with undue force.
 The Government generally adheres to free market principles, particularly in the
 export sector, which is dominated by petroleum, timber, and minerals. A majority
 of workers in the formal sector are employed by the Government or by large, ineffi-
 cient parastatal organizations. Per capita income is a pproximately $5,000 annually,
 but income distribution is badly skewed in favor of urtan dwellers and a small eco-
 nomic elite. Immigrants from other African countries dominate the informal sector.
 The rural population is poor and receives little in social services. Financial mis-
 management and corruption in earlier years have resulted in significant arrears in
 domestic and external debt. The Government has begun a 3-year Structural Adjust-
 ment Program with the International Monetary Fund.
 The Government's human rights performance improved, with no use of deadly
 force to control crowds, a significant reduction in killings, and initiatives to promote
 democratic electoral practices. Civil peace generally prevailed as the ruling Gabo-
 nese Democratic Party and its coalition partners conducted negotiations with the op-
 position parties, appealed to legal institutions, and used international mediation to
 resolve differences over interpretation and implementation of the Paris Accords. The
 Government reinforced its control over illegal immigration and repatriated undocu-
 mented aliens. This was carried out with abuses limited to demands for bribes by
 some minor officials. However, the Interior Minister personally intimidated the
 management of the only rotary printing plant into refusing to print three editions
 of certain weekly independent newspapers which he found offensive to the Govern-
 ment. On one occasion he briefly blocked imports of French newspapers and maga-
 zines.
 Other longstanding human rights abuses included security forces' beatings of pris-
 oners and detainees, abysmal prison conditions, and societal discrimination and vio-
 lence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no instances of political
 killing. In January policemen in Libreville pursued two armed individuals suspected
 of car theft. After wounding one of them, police appeared to carry out a summary
 execution of the other at a distance of 58 meters from eyewitnesses. They also hunt-
 
 
 97
 ed down and shot to death a third armed suspect in bushes nearby. The chief of
 police later said that he would order an investigation into the circumstances, but
 he did not subsequently publish or divulge the results of an inquiry.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and inhuman or extreme punishment.
 However, security forces often beat prisoners and detainees as punishment and to
 exact confessions.
 Conditions in most prisons are abysmal and life threatening. Sanitation and ven-
 tilation are poor, and medical care is almost nonexistent. Prisons rarely provide food
 for inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for up to 48 hours of
 initial preventive detention, during which time police must charge a detainee before
 a judge. In practice, however, police rarely respect this provision. Bail may be set
 if there is to be a further investigation. Pretrial detainees have the right to free ac-
 cess to their attorneys. This is respected in practice. Detainees have the right to an
 expeditious trial, as defined by Gabonese law. Pretrial detention is limited to 6
 months for a misdemeanor and to 1 year for a felony. These periods may be ex-
 tended up to 6 months longer by the examining magistrate. The Attorney General's
 office estimates that roughly 40 percent of prisoners are pretrial detainees.
 The Government gave illegal aliens a 6-month period-initially until January 31,
 1995, but extended to February 15-to legalize their status. It then reinitiated
 measures to detect and detain aliens without approved residence papers. The police
 generally released illegal aliens only after the embassies of their countries of origin
 confirmed that the aliens would be repatriated at their government's expense.
 Exile is not used as a punishment nor as a means of political control, and there
 are no opposition leaders currently living in exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system includes the regular courts,
 a Military Tribunal, and a civilian State Security Court. The regular court system
 includes trial courts, appellate courts, and the Supreme Court. The Constitutional
 Court is a separate body charged with examining constitutional questions, including
 the certification of elections. There are no traditional or customary courts. In some
 areas minor disputes may be taken to a local chief, but the Government does not
 recognize such decisions. The State Security Court, last convened in 1990, is con-
 stituted by the Government on an ad hoc basis to consider matters of state security.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a public trial and the right to legal
 counsel. These rights are generally respected in criminal cases. Nevertheless, proce-
 dural safeguards are lacking, particularly in state security trials, and the judiciary
 remains vulnerable to government manipulation. The law still applies the concept
 of presumed guilt. A judge may thus deliver an immediate verdict at the initial
 hearing if sufficient evidence is presented by the State.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for protection from surveillance, from searches without war-
 rant, and from interference with private telecommunications or correspondence. As
 part of criminal investigations, police may request search warrants from judges,
 which they obtain easily, sometimes after the fact. The Government has used them
 in the past to gain access to the homes of opposition figures and their families. Gov-
 ernment authorities also routinely monitor private telephone conversations, per-
 sonal mail, and the movements of citizens.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right of free
 speech and press, and in practice, citizens speak freely and criticize leaders. Legisla-
 tors in the National Assembly openly criticize government policies, ministers, and
 other officials.
 The only daily newspaper is the government-owned L'Union, but there are more
 than a half-dozen weekly or periodical publications in newspaper format, represent-
 ng_ independent views and those of various political parties. All-including
 L'Union-actively criticized the Government and political leaders of all parties. Most
 also criticized the President. On three occasions, the Minister of the Interior prohib-
 ited the publication or distribution of editions which he judged offensive, issuing ex-
 tralegal instructions directly to the country's only industrial press instead of seeking
 an injunction from the National Communications Counsel, as required by law.
 The Government controls national electronic media, which reaches all areas of the
 country. It announced the award of licenses for three private radio stations. As part
 of the Paris Accords, the Government undertook to obtain authorization from the
 National Assembly to compensate those who suffered damages in the 1994 rioting
 
 
 98
 and riot control actions, including the owners of the political opposition's Radio Lib-
 erty. The National Assembly approved a code of rights and responsibilities of jour-
 nalists and broadcasters after the Government carried out extensive consultations
 with media industry representatives.
 The Government does not interfere with broadcasts of international radio stations
 Radio France 1, Africa No. 1, and Voice of America, but it did very briefly censor
 international printed media. Although foreign newspapers and magazines were
 widely available, for a period of several weeks in April the Minister of the Interior
 imposed an extralegal ban on foreign publications containing news articles which he
 ju4ged to be offensive to the President.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom, including research.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens and recognized orga-
 nizations normally enjoy freedom of assembly and association. Groups must obtain
 permits for public gatherings in advance, and the Government usually grants them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and au-
 thorities do not engage in religious persecution or favoritism. While the Government
 has not lifted its ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, it has not enforced this ban. There
 is no state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no legally mandated restrictions on internal movement, but
 police and gendarmes frequently stop travelers to check identity, residence, or reg-
 istration documents, and members of the security forces routinely harass expatriate
 Africans working legally as merchants, service sector employees, and manual labor-
 ers, extorting bribes and demanding services with the threat of confiscation of resi-
 dence documents or imprisonment. Residence permits cost approximately $1,000.
 An unevenly enforced law requires married women to have their husband's per-
 mission to travel abroad. An exit visa for citizens is no longer required for travel
 abroad. Aliens legally resident in the country must obtain a visa in order to leave
 and return.
 The Government still controls the process of refugee adjudication, and its policy
 is strict. Coordination with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has
 improved, however, and there were no credible reports that the Government forcibly
 repatriated illegal aliens. There were about 200 refugees at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1991 Constitution explicitly provides this right, but mismanagement and seri-
 ous irregularities in both the 1990 and the 1993 presidential elections called into
 doubt the extent to which this right existed in practice. However, in July citizens
 approved in a constitutional referendum by a 96 percent majority to adopt changes
 previously agreed in the Paris Accords, including most significantly the establish-
 ment of an independent National Electoral Commission. The July election was car-
 ried out under arrangements which assured that all political parties could monitor
 voting and the vote count. Later in the year, the National Assembly passed laws
 authorizing the National Electoral Commission.
 Municipal elections were scheduled for 1996.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in politics.
 There are 6 women among the 120 National Assembly deputies and 1 in the Cabi-
 net. Women serve at all levels within the various ministries, the judiciary, and the
 opposition. Despite governmental protections, indigenous Pygmies rarely participate
 in the political process, and the Government has made only marginal efforts to in-
 clude them (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government officially allows the existence of independent human rights
 groups. There are two human rights groups, neither of which was active. There were
 no reports of harassment by officials.
 There have been no active inquiries from foreign groups in recent years.
 The Government was responsive to the concerns expressed by foreign govern-
 ments and by international observers in response to its announcement that immi-
 gration controls would be strictly enforced after January 31 (subsequently extended
 to February 15). The President and ministers issued specific instructions to assure
 humane and correct treatment for aliens arrested without proper documentation.
 These immigration controls resulted in the departure of between 30,000 and 50,000
 undocumented aliens.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1991 Constitution forbids discrimination based on national origin, race, gen-
 der, or opinion. The Government does not uniformly enforce these constitutional
 guarantees, tolerating a substantial degree of discrimination against women, espe-
 cially in domestic affairs. It has also not provided the same level of health and edu-
 cational services to expatriate children that it provides to citizens.
 Women.-Violence against women is common and especially prevalent in rural
 areas. While medical authorities have not specifically identified rape to be a chronic
 problem, religious workers and hospital staff report that evidence of physical beat-
 ings of women is common. Police rarely intervene in these cases and women vir-
 tually never" file complaints with civil authorities. Only limited medical and legal
 assistance is available.
 The law provides that women have rights to equal access in education, business,
 and investment. Women own businesses and property, participate in politics, and
 work throughout the Government and the private sector. Women nevertheless con-
 tinue to face considerable societal and legal discrimination, especially in rural areas.
 By law couples must stipulate at the time of marriage whether they will adhere
 to monogamous or polygynous relationships. For monogamous married couples, a
 common property law provides for the equal distribution of assets after divorce.
 Wives who leave polygynous husbands suffer severe reductions in their property
 rights. In inheritance cases the husband's family must issue a written authorization
 before his widow can inherit property. Common law marriage, which is also socially
 accepted and widely practice    ords a woman no property rights.
 A National Assemibly committee proposed modification of the marriage law to
 allow husbands to change the legal status of the marriage from monogamy to po-
 lygyny without the consent of the first wife. The proposed text would have retro-
 active effect. If enacted, the proposed law, which the Assembly did not formally
 present to the Government, would significantly reduce women's rights by retro-
 actively denying them the protection of a permanently monogamous marriage and
 could permit    usbands to deny property rights previously conferred by the
 monogamous marriage. Women's rights groups vigorously oppose the proposal.
 There law still requires that women obtain their husband's permission to travel
 abroad although this law is not consistently enforced.
 Children.-The Government has used Gabon's oil wealth to build schools, pay ade-
 quate teacher salaries and promote education, even in rural areas. Even so, accord-
 ing to U.N. statistics, Gabon still lags behind its poorer neighbors in infant mortal-
 ity and access to vaccination. Traditional beliefs and practices provide numerous
 safeguards for children, but children remain the responsibility of the extended fam-
 ily, including aunts, grandmothers, and older siblings. There is little recorded evi-
 dence of specific physical abuse of children.
 There is concern about the problems facing the large community of expatriate Af-
 rican children. Almost all enjoy far less access to education and health care than
 do nationals. These children are often victims of child labor abuses (see Section
 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws prohibiting discrimination against
 persons with disabilities, nor providing for accessibility for the disabled. An Associa-
 tion of the Physically Handicapped carried out a campaign of demonstrations and
 public education to raise awareness of their situation.
 Indigenous People.-Several thousand indigenous Pygmies live in southern Gabon.
 In principle, they enjoy the same civil rights as other citizens. Pygmies are largely
 independent of formal authority, keeping their own traditions, independent commu-
 nities, and local decisionmaking structures. Pygmies did not participate in govern-
 ment-instituted programs that integrated many small rural villages into larger ones
 along major roads; thus their access to government-funded health and sanitation fa-
 cilities is limited. There are no specific government programs or policies to assist
 or hinder Pygmies.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Persons from all major ethnic groups contin-
 ued to occupy prominent positions in government, the military, and the private sec-
 tor. Credible reports suggest, however, that ethnic favoritism in hiring and pro-
 motion is pervasive. There was evidence, especially within the armed forces, that
 members of the President's ethnic group held a disproportionately large share of
 both senior positions and jobs within the ranks.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution places no restrictions on the
 right of association and recognizes the right of citizens to form trade and labor
 unions. Virtually the entire work force is unionized. Unions must register with the
 
 
 Government in order to be recognized officially. Public employees may unionize al-
 though their right to strike is limited if it could jeopardize public safety. Until 1990
 there was only one recognized labor organization, the Gabonese Labor Confederation
 (COSYGA), to which all workers were required to contribute 4 percent of their sala-
 ries. In 1992 the Government accepted the establishment of independent unions and
 abolished the mandatory COSYGA contribution.
 In November 1994 the National Assembly passed an extensively revised version
 of the Labor Code, which was published and implemented in early 1995. The Code
 provides extensive protection of worker rights.
 Strikes are legal if they occur after an 8-day notice advising that outside arbitra-
 tion has failed. The Labor Code prohibits direct government action against individ-
 ual strikers who abide by its arbitration and notification provisions; it also provides
 that the Government cannot press charges against a group as a whole for criminal
 activities committed by individuals. Unions and confederations are free to affiliate
 with international labor bodies and participate in their activities. COSYGA is di-
 rectly afilliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, while the Gab-
 onese Confederation of Free Unions (CGSL) is affiliated with the International Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions. Both COSYGA and CGSL have strong ties with
 numerous other international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining. Labor and management meet to negotiate differences, and the
 Ministry of Labor provides an observer. This observer does not take an active part
 in negotiations over pay scales, working conditions, or benefits. Agreements also
 apply to nonunion workers. While no laws specifically prohibit antiunion discrimina-
 tion, the court may require employers found guilty by civil courts of having engaged
 in such discrimination to pay compensation.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and there are no reports that it now exists.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children below the age of 16 may
 not work without the express consent of the Ministries of Labor, Education, and
 Public Health. These ministries rigorously enforce this law with respect to Gabonese
 children, and there are few Gabonese under the age of 18 working in the modern
 wage sector. A significant number of children work in marketplaces .or perform do-
 mestic duties. The U.N. Children's Fund and other concerned organizations have re-
 ported that government officials often privately use foreign child labor, mainly as
 domestic or agricultural help. These children do not go to school, have only limited
 means of acquiring medical attention, and are often victims of exploitation by em-
 ployers or foster families. Laws forbidding child labor theoretically extend protection
 to foreign children as well, but abuses often are not reported. There is no compul-
 sory education law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code governs working conditions
 and benefits for all sectors and provide a broad range of protection to workers. The
 Code stipulates a 40-hour workweek with a minimum rest period of 48 consecutive
 hours. Employers must compensate workers for overtime work. Foreign and local
 companies in the modern wage sector pay competitive wages and grant generous
 fringe benefits, including maternity leave and 6 weeks of annual paid vacation.
 Traditionally representatives of labor, management, and the Government met an-
 nually to examine economic and labor conditions and to recommend a minimum
 wage rate within government guidelines to the President, who then issued an an-
 nual decree. This procedure was not followed in 1995, however, in part because the
 Government was pursuing a policy of wage austerity recommended by international
 financial institutions. The minimum monthly wage was kept at its 1994 level of
 about $125 (cfa 64,000). Wages do in fact provide for a decent standard of living.
 The Ministry of Health has established occupational health and safety standards,
 but does not effectively enforce or regulate them. Industry application of labor
 standards varies greatly depending upon company policy. The Government report-
 edly did not enforce Labor Code provisions in sectors where the bulk of the labor
 force is non-Gabonese. Foreigners, both documented and undocumented, may be
 obliged to work under substandard conditions, may be dismissed without notice or
 recourse or, especially in the case of illegal aliens, may be physically mistreated.
 Employers frequently require longer hours of work and pay less, often hiring on a
 short-term, casual basis only in order to avoid paying taxes, social security, and
 other benefits. In the formal sector, workers may remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations. without fear of retribution.
