 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with parliamentary democratic rule. Queen
 Margrethe i  is Head of State. The Cabinet, accountable to the unicameral Par-
 liament (Folketing), leads the Government. A minority, three-party coalition took of-
 fice in September following national elections.
 The national police force is fully controlled by and responsive to civilian authori-
 iThe advanced industrial economy is essentially market-based, with public owner-
 ship limited largely to utilities and public transportation. The Government contin-
 ues to seek ways to reduce the public sectos share of the economy.
 Deeply rooted democratic principles, an egalitarian tradition, and a free press
 have resulted in high ofcial as well as societal respect for human rights. There are
 
 
 799
 well-established legal channels for seeking redress for mistreatment by any national
 authority.
 Amnesty International (AI) issued a controversial report in June citing allegations
 that police in Copenhagen used excessive force in a 1992-93 crackdown on
 lawbreakers and during riots in May 1993. The Government suspended three police-
 men for firing into a crowd during those riots.
 Indicative of the Government's commitment to promoting human rights inter-
 nationally were its actions on behalf of the U.N. Tribunal on War Crimes in the
 Former Yugoslavia in bringing to justice an accused war criminal from Bosnia. After
 consultations with the chief prosecutor, the Government decided to bring Rafic Saric
 to trial in Denmark. In a landmark decision, in November a Danish court found him
 guilty of committing war crimes while he worked with Bosnian Croats in Bosnia and
 Herzegovina. The court sentenced Saric to 8 years in jail for his assaults against
 inmates at the Dretelb camp.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Ktilling-There were no reports of such
 killings.
 b. Disappearanc.-There were no known abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law. Torture does not occur, and allegations of
 physical mistreatment are rare. However, since 1988 Al has complained that the po-
 lice occasionally use excessive force, and Al has never been fully satisfied by the
 Government's responses to those complaints.
 In June Al published "Danish Police I1l Treatment," a controversial sweeping crit-
 icism focusing primarily on two episodes. In one, the police on May 18-19, 1993,
 apparently shot indiscriminately at demonstrators in Copenhagen who were protest-
 ing the outcome of a national plebiscite in which the voters accepted the Maastricht
 Treaty. When demonstrators hurled paving stones at the police, some police fired
 into the crowd, wounding at least 11 people; in 1994 the police leadership suspended
 three police on a charge that these firings violated regalations on the use of fire-
 arms.
 Also under focus in the Al report was the police's conduct of a campaign in 1992-
 93 against drug-dealers and other lawbreakers in a section of Copenhagen. Police
 detained or arrested hundreds of people, and immobilized some detainees by using
 a "leg-lock," a potentially verny painful constraint. Immediately after AI's report, the
 police ceased using the leg-lock.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--No person may be deprived of personal
 liberty without due process of law. Those arrested must appear before a judge with-
 in 24 hours. A judge may order pretrial detention, and may require the detainee
 to be in isolation (for renewable 4-week periods after a hearing before a judge), for
 a period up to the length of the prison sentence for the charged crime. Pretrial de-
 tention usually lasts from a few weeks to a few months. As of October, 633 of the
 3,752 prisoners in Danish jails (17 percent) were in pretrial detention. Any detainee
 has the right to choose an attorney or have a free public attorney. Bail is allowed,
 but it is rarely used; courts have presribed six other means for obtaining pretrial
 release, and these are generslly considered preferable. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/-The right to a fair public trial is enforced by a
 fully independent judiciary. Trials are usually public, but judges may make excep-
 tions to protect the privacy or security of any participant, e.g., in divorce cases or
 where the charge is rape or paternity. In criminal cases, trials are closed when nec-
 essary to protect a victim's privacy, such as in rape cases, or to safeguard a witness'
 identity.
 Defendants are presumed innocent, and hav   e right to be present, to confront
 witnesses, and to present evidence. Both the defendant and the prosecution have the
 right to appeal a sentence.
 Judges are appointed by the Minister of Justice, and serve until age 70. They can-
 not be dismissed but can be impeached for negligence or criminal acts.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy. Family, Home, or Correspondence-The
 Constitution stipulates that without a court order there can be no searching of any
 home, surveillance of any individual, seizure of any paper, or breaching of the con-
 fidentiality of any communication. The Government respects these prohibitions.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, an effective judiciary,
 and a democratic political system ensure freedom of speech and press. There is one
 state-owned radio and television company. Editorial control is exercised by a board
 independent of the Government. A second national television channel is one-third
 government subsidized. Several independently owned Danish-language channels are
 available on the local cable net or via satellite dishes. Programs critical of the Gev-
 enent appear on all channels. Cab le vision and satelte dishes, which are now
 common, ensure wide access to foreign news broadcasts.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these freedoms, and the Government respects them. Public meetlings require per-
 mit, which are routinely given. Any organization may afiliate with international
 bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion-The Constitution provides for complete religious freedom,
 and the Government respects this in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movenent Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citiens have full freedom of travel and movement within and outside
 Denmark and freedom of repatriation. People who qualify as refugees are never re-
 patriated against their will. However, pursuant to the Dublin Convention, asylum-
 seekers who arrive via another safe country are returned directly to that country.
 Also, Denmark increasingly seeks to repatriate applicants unable to establish a
 claim to asylum. Unsuccessful asylum applicants are returned directly to their home
 countries.
 Lu 1993 Justice Minister Erik Ninn-Hansen was impeached for his illegal actions
 in hamperig the processing of family-reunification petitions from Tainil refugees.
 His trial was postponed in 1994 due to his severe illness.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have both the right and the ability to change their government peace-
 fully. Ministers are responsible to the Folketing and may be removed by a vote of
 no confidence. The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen after consultation with
 parties in the Parliament. Parliamentary elections must take place every 4 years
 or (by decision of the Prime Minister) earlier, with votin by secret ballot. A system
 of proportional representation benefits small parties. There ae no restrictions, in
 law or in practice, on the participation of women or minorities in voting, politics,
 or government. Women currently head two political parties in the Parliament; hold
 7 of the 20 cabinetpsitions; and hold 58 of the 179 seats in the Parliament.
 The territories of Greeniand (whose population is primarily Inuit) and the Faroe
 Islands (whose inhabitants have their own Norse anuae have doncratically
 elected home-rule governments with powers encompassing all matters except foreign
 affairs, monetary affairs, and national security. Greenlandrs and Faroese are Dan-
 ish citizens, with the same rights as those in the rest of the Kingdom. Each territory
 elects two representatives to the Folketing.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic and international human rights organizations freely monitor and issue
 reports, without government restriction.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Relsion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government's operations and extensive public services do not discriminate on
 the basis of any of these factors or on the basis of sexual orientation. The rights
 of indigenous people arme carmfully protected.
 Woren.-There are no restrictions on participation of women in the civilian work
 force. Women hold positions of authority throughout society, though they are
 underrepresented at the top of the business world. The law requires equal pay for
 equal work, hut wage inequality still exists. The law prohibits discrimination on the
 basis of    se a  ides ers such as access to the Equal Status Council.
 Children.-The Government is committed to ensuring that each child receives hu-
 mane treatment within the family and from society. There is no pattern of societal
 abuse agi  t children. The production (but not the possession) of child pornora phy
 is illegal in Denmark. The law requires parents to protect children from pysic
 and psychological abuse. The authorities act swiftly to protect children from actually
 or potentially abusive or neglectful parents.
 
 
 801
 Indigenous People.-The law protects the rights of the inhabitants of Greenland
 and the Faroe Islands. The Greenlandic legal system seeks to accommodate Inuit
 customs. Accordingly, it provides for the use of lay people as judges, and it sentences
 most prisoners to holding centers (rather than to prisons) where they are encour-
 aged to work, hunt, or fish during the day.
 In Greenland, education is provided to the native population in both the Inuit and
 Danish languages.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no Danish legislation explicitly banning dis-
 crimination against the handicapped in hiring or on-the-job treatment. However, a
 longstanding regulation on hiring for the civil service gives preference to any handi-
 capped candidates among equally qualified ones.
 Danish regulations require special installations for the handicapped in public
 buildings built or renovated after 1977, and in older buildings that come into public
 use.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law states that all workers, including military
 personnel and the police, may form or join unions of their choosmg. Approximately
 80 percent of all workers are union members. The unions are inependent of the
 Government and political parties. The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions, which
 includes about half of the country's work force, remains closely associated with the
 Social Democratic Party. Unions may affiliate freely with international organiza-
 tions, and they do so actively.
 All unions except those representing civil servants or the military have the right
 to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers and employers ac-
 knowledge each otheis right to organize. Collective bargaining is protected by law,
 and is widespread in practice.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members
 and organizers, and there are mechanisms to resolve disputes. Employers found
 guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union
 activities.
 In the private sector, salaries, benefits, and working conditions are agreed upon
 in biennial negotiations between the various employers' associations and the union
 counterparts. If the negotiations fail, a national conciliation board mediates, and its
 proposal is voted on by management and labor. If the proposal is turned down, the
 Government may force a legislated solution on the parties (usually based upon the
 mediators' proposal). The agreements, in turn, are used as guidelines throughout
 the public as well as the private sector. In the public sector, collective bargaimng
 is conducted between the employees' unions and a government group led by the Fi-
 nance Ministry.
 Labor relations in Greenland are conducted in the same manner as in Denmark.
 In disputes, Greenlandic courts are the first recourse, but Danish mediation services
 or the Danish Labor Court may also be used.
 In the Faroes there is no umbrella labor organization, but individual unions en-
 gage in periodic collective bargaining with employers. Disputes are settled by medi-
 ation.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for full-time
 employment is 15. The law specifies limitations on the employment of workers be-
 tween 15 and 18 years of age, and it is enforced by the Danish Working Environ-
 ment Service (DWES), an autonomous arm of the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage, but national labor agreements effectively set a wage floor. The lowest
 wage is currently about $11 per hour (Danish Kroner 68 per hour), which is suffi-
 cient for an adequate standard of living for a worker and family. The law provides
 for 5 weeks of paid vacation. A 37-hour workweek is the norm, establishedby con-
 tract, not by law. The law does, however, require at least 11 hours between the end
 of one work period and the start of the next.
 The law also prescribes conditions of work, including safety and health; duties of
 employers, supervisors and employees; work performance; rest periods and days off;
 and medical examinations. The DWES ensures compliance with labor legislation.
 Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations or arms production
 without jeopardizing their employment rights, and there are legal protections for
 workers who file complaints about unsafe or unhealthy conditions.
 
 
 802
 Similar conditions of work are found in Greenland and the Fames, except that
 their standard workweek is 40 hours. As in Denmark, this is established by con-
 tract, not by law, and the law requires an 11-hour rest period.
