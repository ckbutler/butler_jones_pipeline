 NIGER
 Niger began the year as a multiparty parliamentary democracy, but on January
 27 a up of army officers led by then Colonel Ibrahim Mainassara Bare overthrew
 the e-cted government. The leaders of the coup d'etat quickly established a Military
 Council of National Salvation (CSN) and a subordinate interim cabinet. The CSN
 suspended the 1992 Constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, implemented a
 state of emergency, and temporarily prohibited political activity. Top civilian govern-
 ment leaders were put under house arrest. The Government subsequently organized
 a Constitutional Conference, held a referendum on the new Constitution, and con-
 ducted a seriously flawed presidential election, which was won by Bare, the coup
 
 
 leader. November legislative   elections were  boycotted  by  the  opposition.
 Progovernment parties and sympathizers claimed all 80 National Assembly seats.
 Security forces consist of the army the Republican Guard, the gendarmerie (para-
 military police), and the national police. The police and the gendarmerie tradition-
 ally have primary responsibility for internal security. However, since the coup the
 army has had a much more prominent role. The January coup was led by army offi-
 cers with some support from the gendarmerie. Since the coup, members of all secu-
 rity forces have committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is based mainly on traditional subsistence farming, herding, small
 trading, and informal markets. Less than 15 percent of the labor force is in the mod-
 em sector. Uranium is the most important export. Per capita income is less than
 $260. Persistent drought, deforestation and soil degradation, low literacy, a flat ura-
 nium market, high import prices, and burdensome debt further weakened the al-
 ready troubled economy. Niger is heavily dependent on foreign assistance, and one
 of the aftermaths of the coup was a sharp fall in foreign aid.
 The Government's human rights record worsened in 1996 as the Government com-
 mitted  numerous   abuses. The   fraudulent  presidential election  effectively
 disenfranchised Nigeriens, preventing them from exercising their right to change
 their government. Security forces beat political opponents and violated laws govern-
 ing searches, treatment of prisoners, and length of detention. Prison conditions re-
 mained poor. The overloaded judicial system and delays in trials resulted in Iong
 periods of pretrial confinement. The Government intimidated the private press and
 radio, arresting and mistreating journalists and publishers, and temporarily closing
 two private radio stations. Civic and political organizations were banned from hold-
 ing gatherings or demonstrations for much of the year, under a declared state of
 emergency and other bans. Societal discrimination and domestic violence against
 women continued to be serious problems. Female genital mutilation persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials.
 Violence in the North  as been minimal since the signing of the April 1995 peace
 p act between Tuareg separatists and the Government. A similar agreement in April
 between the Government and the Arab/Toubou/Kanouri Front (CRA) based in east-
 erm Niger, which seeks independence for its region, also lessened sporadic violence
 in that area. After an attack in February on Dirkou and its small military base by
 a CRA subgroup, the Government reported CRA casualties of 12 dead and 8 wound-
 ed. Skirmishes with the same group in the Lake Chad area in January and Feb-
 ruary produced a similar number of deaths with casualties on both sides. The group
 also killed and wounded several civilian road workers in an attack in June in the
 same area. The Government has not yet met its peace accord commitment to disarm
 Arab militias and has produced no report of a promised investigation into the 1995
 killing of a Tuareg rebel leader, reportedly by Arab militia.
 b.Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits such practices, there were reports that police
 or military personnel beat or otherwise abused several political leaders and their
 supporters. Mamane Abou, editor of the weekly newspaper, L  Republicain, and
 president of the p a  press association, was detained briefly by police on July 21,
 who shaved his head bald to humiliate him (see Section 2.a.).
 Prisons are underfunded and understaffed. They are overcrowded and diet,
 health, and sanitary conditions for prisoners are very poor. For example, the Agadez
 prison's health budget for 182 prisoners was $825 a year.
 Prisoners are segregated by sex. Family visits are allowed, and prisoners can re-
 ceive supplemental food and other necessities from their families. There are no re-
 ports of unduly harsh treatment, beyond the very poor conditions of detention noted
 above, but petty corruption among prison staff is also reported rampant.
 Human rights monitors visit the prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary detention, and laws officially prohibit detention without charge in excess of 48
 hours, police violate these provisions in practice. If police fail to gather sufficient
 evidence within the detention period, the prosecutor gives the case to another offi-
 cer, and a new 48-hour detention period begins.
 Authorities detained numerous political party leaders, generally for brief periods,
 and sometimes roughly treated them, as part of an effort to intimidate the opposi-
 tion. Authorities placed the four political party candidates who contested the July
 
 
 205
 7 to 8 presidential elections under house arrest after the elections and held them
 until July 22. One candidate, Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS)
 head Mahamadou Issoufou, was put under house arrest again by authorities from
 July 27 to August 12, and two other party leaders were detained for 3 days, after
 party members staged a protest on July 27 against the election fraud. In February
 authorities arrested eight members of former President Ousmane's party, reportedly
 to prevent them from helping him seek asylum in a Western embassy. They were
 released within a few days; no charges were filed. Two PNDS party leaders were
 detained by soldiers for 5 days in early May without explanation; one was beaten.
 The Government arrested several dozen protesters at the time of the July elections
 but released them by July 22. At least one, possibly more, were beaten while in cus-
 te judicial system is seriously overloaded. There are no statutory limits on pre-
 trial confinement of indicted persons; detention frequently lasts months or years. As
 many as 80 percent of prisoners in Niamey are awaiting trial.
 The law provides for a right to counsel, although there is only one defense attor-
 ney known to have a private practice outside the capital. A defendant has the right
 to a lawyer immediately upon detention. The State provides a defense attorney for
 indigents.
 Bail is available for crimes carrying a penalty of less than 10 years' imprison-
 ment. Widespread ignorance of the law and lack of financial means prevent full ex-
 ercise of these rights.
 In August President Bare pardoned most prisoners with less than 2 years yet to
 serve and substantially reduced the sentences of most others. All juveniles, nursing
 and pregnant women, elderly prisoners, and those with certain illnesses were re-
 leased regardless of the time remaining on their sentences.
 The Constitution prhibits exile, and there were no reports of its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. Although the Supreme Court has on occasion asserted its independence,
 human rights groups assert that family and business ties influence the lower courts
 and undermine their integrity. Judges sometimes fear reassignment or having their
 financial benefits reduced if they render a decision unfavorable to the Government,
 though such coercive tactics are reportedly less frequently used.
 Defendants and prosecutors may appeal a verdict, first to the Court of Appeals,
 then to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals reviews questions of fact and law,
 while the Supreme Court reviews only the application of law and constitutional
 questions.
 A traditional chief or a customary court try cases involving divorce or inheritance.
 Customary courts, located only in large towns and cities, are headed by a legal prac-
 titioner with basic legal education who is advised by an assessor knowledgeable in
 the society's traditions. The judicial actions of chiefs and customary courts are not
 regulated by code, and defendants may appeal a verdict to the formal court system.
 Women do not have equal legal status with men and do not enjoy the same access
 to legal redress (see Section 5).
 The law provides that the Government constitute a State Security Court to trv
 high crimes against the State in secret, but due process provisions still apply. Civil
 and criminal trials are public except in security-related cases. Defendants have the
 right to counsel, to be present at trial, to confront witnesses, to examine the evi-
 dence against them, and to appeal verdicts. The Constitution affirms the presump-
 tion of innocence.
 The law provides for counsel at public expense for minors and indigent defendants
 charged with crimes carrying a sentence of 10 years or more. Although lawyers com-
 ply with government requests to provide counsel, they are generally not remuner-
 ated by the Government.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that police have a search warrant, normally issued by a judge. Police may
 search without warrants when they have strong suspicion that a house shelters
 criminals or stolen property. The police routinely violated requiredprocedures when
 invading the homes and interfering in the affairs of political party leaders and jour-
 nalists after the July presidential elections. These actions confirm human rights or-
 ganizations' reports that police often conduct routine searches without warrants.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Like its predecessor, the 1996 Constitution, ap-
 proved by referendum in May, provides for freedom of speech and the press. Never-
 theless the current Government, following the January coup and through the fraud-
 ulent July presidential elections, took actions to limit press freedom and stifle politi-
 
 
 206
 
 cal discussion, through intimidation, harassment, and detention. The editor of Le
 Soleil newspaper was kidnaped and beaten by unknown persons, presumed to be
 government agents. The Government detained the editor of The Alternative news-
 paper in April, after he published an article critical of the Bare regime. On May
 3, an edition of the (antimilitary) Tribune du Pueple containing an editorial critical
 of the Government was seized at the printers. On May 5, the Government detained
 and imprisoned without charges the editor of Tribune du Pueple.
 On July 7, during presidential voting and after independent radio station R and
 M aired comments by a party candidate critical of the regime, police temporarily
 shut down the station and arrested the editor in chief. On July 8, military authori-
 ties closed independent radio station Anfani, which had also carried remarks the
 previous day by a political leader opposing Bare. The station was not allowed to re-
 sume broadcasting until early August. Mamane Abou, editor of the weekly news-
 paper, Lie Repubicain, and president of the private press association, was detained
 briefly by police on July 21, who shaved his ea bad to humiliate him. Police also
 arrested Amadou Hamidou, publisher of Tribune du Pueple, in July. British Broad-
 casting Corporation correspondent Abdoulaye Seyni was briefly detained by the Gov-
 ernment and released in early August. All arrested persons listed above were re-
 leased after brief detention.
 Despite these governmental efforts to control media content, the local independent
 press remained relatively assertive in protesting the July electoral fraud and other
 government actions. No newspaper was forced to shut down. Foreign journals cir-
 culated and reported freely.
 Government harassment of the private media continued during the legislative
 elections with the private radio station Anfani being most repeatedly targeted. Sta-
 tion managers decided to suspend all news programming for the weekend of the
 election because of concerns that government officials would arbitrarily detain both
 staff and management.
 The most important public medium is the government-operated, multilingual na-
 tional radio service. It provided only minimal air time for opposition political activi-
 ties. The Government publishes the French-language daily, Le Sahel, and its week-
 end French edition. There are about 12 private French and Hausa language
 weeklies or monthlies, some published by political parties.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Nevertheless, the Government retains the au-
 thority to prohibit gatherings either under tense social conditions or if advance no-
 tice (48 hours) is not provided. A decree prohibiting political party activity remained
 in effect from January until Ma 20. In addition, the Government declared a state
 of emergency after the coup, under which it selectively banned public assemblies or
 gatherings until lifting it on May 23. Authorities used a ban on public demonstra-
 tions issued after the July elections to mute public protest of the results. On July
 10 and 11, police dispersed opposition supporters, who defied the ban in large num-
 bers in Niamey and Zinder respectively, with tear gas and baton charges, assisted
 by armed forces personnel.
 Opposition parties which boycotted the legislative elections were not permitted to
 hold meetings or demonstrations during the campaign period. Government spokes-
 men claimed that only parties contesting elections ad such a right although the
 Constitution makes no such distinction.
 Under the Constitution, Nigeriens may form political parties of any kind, except
 those that are based on ethnicity, religion, or region, and the Government respects
 this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government respects freedom of religion. Most
 Nigeriens practice Islam. Christians (including Jehovah's Witnesses) and Baha'i
 practice freely. Foreign missionaries work freely, but their organization must be reg-
 istered as a Nigerien association.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of movement. Neither emigration nor re-
 patriation is restricted. The coup-installed Government closed the country's airports
 and land borders immediately following the coup but reopened them several days
 later.
 Among the Hausa and Fulani peoples in eastern Niger some women are clois-
 tered and may leave their homes only if escorted by a male and usually only after
 dark. Security forces at checkpoints monitor travel of persons and the circulation
 of goods, particularly near major population centers and sometimes demand extra
 payments. Attacks by bandits on major routes to the North have declined consider-
 ably, although people often travel in convoy with military escort for security.
 
 
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees.
 The Government has provided first asylum in the recent past to several thousand
 Chadian refugees. Thousands of Malian refugees have resided in recent years in
 western Niger. The issue of first asylum is not known to have arisen in any new
 cases in 1996. There are 1,500 Chadian refugees in eastern Niger. In addition,
 20,000 to 25,000 Tuareg refugees from Mali reside in Niger. A tripartite agreement
 was negotiated by Mali, Niger, and the UNHCR for the repatriation of Malin refu-
 gees beginning in early 1997. Many refugees have begun to return voluntarily to
 Mali with assistance from the Governments of Niger and Mali, the International
 Committee of the Red Cross, and the UNHCR.
 There were no reports of forced repatriation of refugees. There were no reports
 of forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 President Bare, through the Military Council of National Salvation and his Coun-
 cil of Ministers, rules by decree. The January coup d'etat led by then Colonel Bare
 overthrew the democratically elected government. In the days following the coup,
 Bare and the coup leadership dissolved the National Assembly; banned political
 party activity; suspended the 1992 constitution; and declared a state of emergency.
 Bare scheduled presidential elections for July and legislative elections for a new Na-
 tional Assembly for September, later postponed until November.
 In a May 10 referendum with a low turn-out, voters approved a new Constitution
 that reiterates rights  anted under the 1992 document. Citizens 18 years of age
 and over can vote, and balloting is by secret ballot. The Constitution provides for
 a political system with checks and balances, an ethnically representative 83-seat
 National Assembly, and an independent judiciary. The most prominent constitu-
 tional changes are the provisions for a stronger presidency, which make the Prime
 Minister more clearly subordinate to the President.
 The military government organized presidential elections on July 7 and 8, in
 which General Bare (promoted from colonel in May), the leader of the coup, ran
 against four political party candidates. However, midway through the voting, the re-
 gime dismissed the independent electoral commission, took control of ballot boxes,
 and prevented political part representatives and neutral observers from monitoring
 the vote tabulation. Bare claimed 52 percent of the votes, a result widely viewed
 as fraudulent by both local and international observers. An association of non-
 governmental organizations (NGO'a), the Collectif, issued in mid-July a very critical
 report on the Government's organization of the presidential elections, including the
 vote-counting phase. The report cited numerous violations of the electoral code and
 concluded that the elections were not transparent and therefore not credible. Gen-
 eral Bare was sworn into office on August 7.
 Circumstances were similar for the legislative elections, postponed until Novem-
 ber 23 from their original September date. The Government and opposition at-
 tempted to negotiate terms for full and free political participation, with the opposi-
 tion seeking to annul the presidential election and further postpone legislative elec-
 tions. During this period of negotiation, the Government arrested Bello Tiousso
 Garba, the leader of a small opposition party, after he criticized the Government in
 an interview on a local radio station. Although Garba was released within 24 hours,
 the Minister of the Interior subsequently prohibited the party from all activities for
 3 months. Ultimately the sides could not reach agreement, and when the Govern-
 ment moved forward with the elections as scheduled, the opposition called for a boy-
 cott. The elections were characterized by a modest turnout with the Government
 claiming 36 percent participation, but foreign observers indicated a more accurate
 figure was 25 percent.
 Women traditionally play a subordinate role in politics. The societal practice of
 husbands' voting their wives' proxy ballots effectively disenfranchises many women.
 This practice was widely used in recent presidential and National Assembly elec-
 tions.
 In the now-dissolved National Assembly, 3 of the 83 members were women. In the
 Assembly elected in November only 1 of the 80 elected members is female. The last
 Government appointed 5 women to ministerial positions; the present Government
 has appointed 4 women. Many women were active in the brief summer electoral
 campaign, focusing on getting out the female vote, voter registration, and organizing
 campaigns.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several independent human rights    ups and associations operate without ex-
 plicit governmental hindrance, athouh a certain atmosphere of intimidation has
 prevailed since the coup. Dominant among the associations are the Nigerien Asso-
 ciation for the Defense of Human Rights (ANDDH); Democracy, Liberty, and Devel-
 opment (DLD) the National League for Defense of Human Rights; Adalci the Net-
 work for the Integration and Diffusion of Rights in the Rural Milieu (known as
 "Ridd-Fitla); and the Association of Women Jurists of Niger. There are several
 other women's rights groups. The International Committee of the Red Cross is ac-
 tive in Niger.
 An association of local NGO's representing all political views created an umbrella
 association, the "Collecti, to promote human rights and democracy. (see Section 3)
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability Language, or So-
 cia~l Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex, social origin, race, eth-
 nicity, or religion. In practice, however, there is discrimination against women, ci-
 dren, ethnic minorities, and disabled persons, including limited economic and politi-
 cal opportunities.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women is widespread, althouh firm statistics
 are lacking. Wife beating is reportedly common, even in upper scial strata. Fami-
 lies often intervene to prevent the worst abuses, and women may (and do) divorce
 because of physical abuse. While women have the right to seek redress in the cus-
 tmnary or modern courts, few do so from ignorance of the legal system, fear of social
 stigma, and fear of repudiation. Women's rights organizations report that prostitu-
 tion is often the only economic alternative for a woman who wants to leave er hus-
 band.
 Despite the Constitution's provisions for women's rights, the deep-seated tradi-
 tional belief in the submission of women to men results in discrimination in the po-
 litical process (see Section 3), in education, employment, and property rights. Dis-
 crimination is worse in rural areas, where women do much of the subsistence farm-
 ing as well as childrearing. Despite being 47 percent of the work force, women have
 made only modest inroads in civil service and professional employment and remain
 underrepresented in these areas.
 Women's inferior legal status is evident since, for example, a male head of house-
 hold has certain lega i rights; but divorced or widowed women, even with children,
 are not considered to be the heads of their households. In 1995 the Government con-
 sidered a draft family code modeled on codes in other African Muslim countries in-
 tended to eliminate gender bias in inheritance rights, land tenure, and child cus-
 tdy, as well as end the practice of repudiation, which permits a husband to obtain
 an immediate divorce with no further responsibility for his wife or children. In June
 1995, when Islamic associations condemned the draft code, the Government sus-
 pended discussions and has taken no further action. Islamic militants reportedly
 threatened women who supported the code with physical harm.
 Children.-Although the Constitution provides that the State promote children's
 welfs a n nialreso re  ae extremely limited. Only about 25 percent of children
 of primary school age attend school, and about 60 percent of those finishing primary
 school are boys. The majority of young girls are w a home to work and rarely
 attend school for more than a few years, resulting in a female literacy rate of 7 per-
 cent versus 18 percent for males. Tradition among some ethnic eups allows young
 girls from rural families to enter marriage agreements on thebasis of which girls
 are sent at the age of 10 or 12 to join their husband's family under the tutelage
 of their mother-in-law. There are credible reports of underage girls being drawn into
 prostitution, sometimes with the complicity of their families.
 According to international experts, female genital mutilation (FGM), which is
 widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health, is practiced by several ethnic groups in the western and the
 far eastern areas of the ountry. Citridetomy is the most common form of FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-uThe Constitution mandates that the State provde for
 psople with disabilities. However, the Government has yet to implement regulations
 that call for accessibility and education for those with special needs.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities-Tuareg, Fulani, Toubou,
 Kanouri, and Arab--continue to assert that the far more numerous Hausa and
 Djerma ethnic groups discriminate against them. The Hausa and Djerma dominate
 government and business. The Government has supported greater minority rep-
 resentation in the National Assembly and increased education and health care. It
 supports in principle the April 1995 peace accord calling for special development ef-
 
 
 209
 
 forts in the north where the Tuareg population is dominant. However, nomadic peo-
 ples, such as Tuaregs and many Fulam, continue to have less access to government
 services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides formal recognition of
 workers' longstanding right to establish and join trade unions. However, more than
 95 percent of Niger's work force is employed in the nonunionized subsistence agri-
 cultural and small trading sectors.
 The National Union of Niyerien Workers (USTN), a federation made up of 42
 unions, represents the majority of salary earners; most are government employees,
 such as civil servants, teachers, and employees in state-owned corporations. The
 USTN and the affiliated National Union of Nigerien Teachers (SNEN) profess politi-
 cal autonomy but, like most unions, have informal ties to political parties. There is
 also an independent magistrate's union.
 However, in February the Government suspended the two national police unions,
 with the purported aim of restoring order within the police service. It also sus-
 pended the customs, and water and forest workers' unions in April, because of their
 "paramilitary nature."
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, except for security forces and po-
 lice. In March 1994, the National Assembly passed a new strike law specifying that
 labor must give notice and begin negotiations before work is stopped; that public
 workers must maintain a minimum level of service during a strike; that the Govern-
 ment can requisition workers to guarantee minimum service; and that striking pub-
 lic sector workers will not be paid for the time they are on strike. The latter condi-
 tion already prevailed in the private sector.
 During the year, labor challenged the Government on the budget and a new law
 regulating strikes. The USTN staged several short strikes, most over pay demands.
 Civil servants struck for 2 days over salary arrears in January, and uranium and
 coal mine workers struck for several days in February and March over expanded
 pay and benefits. Television journalists and announcers struck briefly in March over
 allowances. In June USTN orchestrated a 48-hour general strike to protest salary
 arrears that it claimed were due to civil service and parastatal workers. These
 strikes largely failed to achieve their objectives but demonstrated that the right to
 strike, within accepted procedures, would be honored. Following the tainted July
 presidential elections, USTN called a poorly heeded strike to protest the dissolution
 of the independent electoral commission midway through the voting and vote count-
 ing. However, the Government announced that the strike was illegal, because its
 goal was not to advance workers' 'material and moral" interests but was only to
 make a "plitical demand" outside the unions' competence.
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 abides by that organization's policy of having no formal affiliations outside the Afri-
 can continent. However, it enjoys assistance from some international unions, and in-
 dividual unions such as the teacher's union are affiliated with international trade
 secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In addition to the Constitu-
 tion and the Labor Code, there is a basic framework agreement, negotiated by the
 USTN's predecessor, employers, and the Government, which defines all classes and
 categories of work, establishes basic conditions of work, and defines union activities.
 In private and state-owned enterprises, unions widely use their right to bargain col-
 lectively with management without government interference for wages over and
 above the statutory minimum as well as for more favorable work conditions. Collec-
 tive bargaining also exists in the public sector. However, since most organized work-
 ers, including teachers, are government employees, the Government is actually in-
 volved in most bargaining agreements. The USTN represents civil servants in bar-
 gaining with the Government, and labor/management agreements apply uniformly
 to all employees.
 The Labor Code is based on International Labor Organization principles; it pro-
 tects the right to organize and prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers.
 Labor unions reported no such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, except for legally convicted prisoners. There were no reports
 of violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Child labor in nonindustrial enter-
 prises is permitted by law under certain conditions. Children under the age of 14
 must obtain special authorization to work, and those 14 to 18 years of age are sub-
 ject to limitation on hours (a maximum of 4.5 hours per day) and types of employ-
 
 
 ment (no industrial work) so that schooling may continue. Minimum compulsory
 education is 6 years, but far fewer than half of school-age children complete 6 years
 of education.
 The law requires employers to ensure minimum sanitary working conditions for
 children. Law and practice prohibit child labor in industrial work.  nistry of Labor
 inspectors enforce child labor laws. Child labor is practically nonexistent in the for-
 ma(wage) sector, althbough children work in the unregulated agricultural, commer-
 cial, and artisan sectors. Rural children (the majority) regularly work with their
 families from a very early age-helping in the fields, getting firewood and water,
 and other similar tasks. There is no official regulation of this labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code establishes a minimum wage
 for salaried workers of each class and category within the formal sector. The lowest
 minimum is a p proximately $38 (cfa 20,50)er month. Additional salary is granted
 for each family member and for such working conditions as night shifts and re-
 quired travel. Minimum wages are not sufficient to provide a decent living for work-
 ers and their families. Mosthouseholds have multiple earners (largely informal com-
 merce) and rely on the extended family for support.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours with a minimum of one 24-hour rest period. How-
 ever, for certain occupations the Ministry of Labor authorizes longer workweeks-
 up to 72 hours. There were no reports of violations.
 The Labor Code also establishes occupational safety and health standards; Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors enforce these standards. Due to staff shortages, however,
 inspectors focus on safety violations only in the most dangerous industries: mng,
 building, and manufacturing. Although generally satisfied with the safety equip-
 ment provided by employers, citing in particular adequate protection from radiation
 in the uranium mines, unions say workers should be better informed of the risks
 posed by their jobs. Workers have the right to remove themselves from hazardous
 conditions without fear of losing their jobs.
