 LEBANON
 Lebanon is a parliamentary republic in which the President is by tradition a
 Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of the
 Chamber of Deputies a Shi'a Muslim. The Parliament consists of 128 deputies,
 equally divided between Christian and Muslim representatives.
 The security forces comprise the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which may arrest
 and detain suspects on national security grounds; the Internal Security Forces (1SF)
 which enforce laws, conduct searches and arrests, and refer cases to the judiciary;
 and the State Security apparatus and the Surete General, both of which collect in-
 formation on groups that may jeopardize state security.
 Non-Lebanese military forces control much of Lebanon. These include about
 30,000 Syrian troops, a contingent of Israeli army regulars and an Israeli-supported
 militia in southern Lebanon, and several armed Palestinian factions. All undermine
 the authority of the central Government and prevent the application of law in areas
 not under its control. In 1991 the Governments of Lebanon and Syria concluded a
 security agreement which provides a framework for cooperation between their
 armed forces. However, Syrian military and intelligence units in Lebanon conduct
 their activities independently of the arement.
 In 1989 the Arab League brokered a peace settlement at Taif, Saudi Arabia, to
 end the hostilities in Lebanon. According to the Taif Accord, Syrian troops were
 scheduled to be redeployed from Lebanon's coastal population areas to the Biqa' Val-
 ley, with full redeployment to take place thereafter. The Syrian Governmenthas re-
 fused to carry out that redeployment. Lebanese government officials have not
 pressed the issue, citing such reasons as the Lebanese Army's alleged unreadiness
 to take over security functions from Syrian forces. However, pervasive Syrian influ-
 ence over Lebanese politics and decisionmakers lies at the root of the Government's
 unwillingness to engage Syrian authorities on the withdrawal. This relationship
 with Syria does not reflect the will of significant segments of the Lebanese public.
 Israel exerts control in and near its self-proclaimed "security lone" in southern
 Lebanon through its surrogate, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), and the presence
 of about 1,000 Israeli troops. The SLA maintains a separate and arbitrary system
 of justice in the zone, independent of Lebanese central authority. SLA officials have
 reportedly deported some alleged criminals to Israel to face legal charges. Also in
 south Lebanon the Iranian-backed Shi'a Muslim militia, Hizballah, and allied Pal-
 estinian guerillas continue to be locked in a cycle of raids and counterraids with Is-
 raeli forces and the SEA.
 Palestinian groups operate autonomously in refugee camps throughout the coun-
 try and maintain a separate, arbitrary system of justice for other Palestinians. In
 1994 the Government continued to consolidate its authority in the parts of the coun-
 try under its control. It has disarmed private Christian militias but has made little
 effort to disarm Hizballah and its allies, the SLA, or to reassert state control over
 the Palestinian refugee camps.
 Before the 1975-89 hostilities, Lebanon was an important financial and commer-
 cial center. The war weakened its commercial leadership and inflicted massive dam-
 age on the economic infrastructure. In 1994 the free market economy continued to
 recover, as the Government took steps to restore confidence and implement a recon-
 struction program. Although many citizens lack the confidence to repatriate much
 
 
 1132
 of the estimated $30 billion deposited abroad, there have been some significant cash
 flows reflecting cautious optimism in the Government's program.
 The human rights situation continued to deteriorate. Government abuses included
 the arrest and detention of individuals and groups opposed to government policies
 and the presence of Syrian forces. There were credible re rts that government
 forces tortured and mistreated prisoners. In February the bombing of a Maronite
 Christian church precipitated the two major human rights developments of 1994:
 the Government arrested and members of the Lebanese Forces (LF) party, which
 it claimed had carried out the bombing, and before filing formal charges, revoked
 the LF's license as a political party. Second, in March the Government suspended
 all news broadcasts on the grounds that some broadcasters were using the church
 bombing to inflame sectarian tensions. The Government lifted the suspension in
 July. In October Parliament passed a new audiovisual law which most interested
 parties consider adate to protect freedom of expression. The IF remains banned.
 Although the overll level o armed conflict declined, life and property, especially
 in the south, are still threatened by artillery and aerial attacks by the various con-
 tending forces. In 1994 these forces continued to carry out abductions, assassina-
 tions, and terrorist bombings.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-In 1994 political killings declined as
 the Government further consolidated its authority over the country. However, secu-
 rity or police personnel were responsible for at least three extrajudicial killings. In
 one case, authorities at the Bayt-Al-Din Prison beat a prisoner, Tariq Hassaniyah,
 to death in March. Authorities arrested the warden and five officers, but at the end
 of the year had not made public their investigation, nor had they brought any
 charges against the perpetrators.
 Amnesty International (AI) reported that Fawzi Al-Rasi, a prisoner in his early
 thirties, died in custody on April 22. According to official sources, Al-Rasi died of
 a heart attack whle detained-at the Ministry of Defense. However, A1-Rasi's col-
 leagues maintained that his heart attack resulted from physical abuse.
 In July, the Lebanese Association for Human Rights claimed that a suspect died
 during an interrogation conducted by narcotics officers. Accordingto the Association,
 citizens have lodged numerous complaints about the Antidrug Bureau, where offi-
 cers reportedly detain suspects for weeks without charge; some are reportedly tor-
 tured. At year's end, the Government had not investigated or punished those re-
 sponsible for these alleged killings.
 Various factions and unknown persons carried out assassinations. On April 12, an
 Iraqi opposition figure, Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi, was assassinated in Beirut. Secu-
 rity forces arrested two Iraqi diplomats assigned to Beirut and charged them with
 murder. According to newspaper reports, the suspects admitted their guilt, but at
 year's end there was no movement towards a trial.
 Rival Palestinian factions continued to engage in a cycle of politically motivated
 murders, mostly in the southern city of Sidon and nearby refugee camps.
 On January 29, two gunmen assassinated Na'eb 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah, first sec-
 retary of the Jordanian Embassy in Beirut. Authorities arrested and tried seven
 persons associated with the radical Ahu Nidal Palestinian faction for the crime. In
 October a court sentenced the four principal defendants to death and the others to
 10 years in prison for abetting the crime. The death sentences were commuted to
 life imprisonment at hard labor.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known disappearances attributable to state se-
 curity forces. However, the fate of thousands of inhabitants kidnaped during the
 years of civil unrest is still unknown. Militias and non-Lebanese forces were respon-
 sible for most of the kidnapings. Some victims are believed to have been murdered.
 The Government has taken no judicial action against groups responsible for the
 kidnapings.
 On May 21, Israeli commandos abducted the senior leader of an Islamic resistance
 organization, Mustafa Dirani, from his house in the central region of the Biqa' Val-
 ley, an area under Syrian control. Dirani is detained in Israel. Israeli authorities
 stated that they had seized Dirani to obtain information from him on the fate of
 a missing Israeli pilot, Ron Arad, who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and
 is still listed as missing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continued to be credible reports that the Lebanese Army in some instances
 employed torture against the members of the disbanded Christian militia, the Leba-
 nese Forces (LF). Army personnel beat detainees and suspended them by their
 
 
 1133
 wrists for lengthy periods. The Government has not adequately investigated those
 accused of the abuse, nor has it punished anyone.
 The Government made no attempt to investigate reports that security forces tor-
 tured several persons arrested in 1993 and charged them with contact with the
 enemy-Israel-and conspiracy to aid enemy forces. According to AL, security forces
 broke the arm of one suspect, George Haddad, during an interrogation in 1993. In
 January Al expressed concern about the arrest and reported torture of Samir Nasr
 in late 1993. Nasr was charged with dealing with the enemy-Israel-solely on the
 basis of a statement extracted under duress.
 Al also reported that Hanna Ati4, arrested in the spring for his suspected involve-
 ment in the bombing of a church, was admitted to a hospital for injuries reportedly
 sustained while under interrogation at the Ministry of Defense.
 In September the Army's itelligence services arrested several individuals for
 their alleged involvement in authoring and distributing a leaflet opposing Syrian in-
 fluence in Lebanon. Ministry of Defense securit officers reorte  y beat the male
 detainees, hung them by their wrists, and beat them on the  sticles during interro-
 gation. The officers reportedly stripped two female detainees of their clothing and
 insulted them. During the interrogation, security officials did not allow the detain-
 ees access to their lawyers. The Government charged the detainees under Article
 295 of the Penal Code (campaign aimed at weakening the national feeling or incit-
 ing sectarian discord) and Article 125 of the Military Code (conspiracy aimed at a
 leader's authority or soldier's security). Authorities detained the group for 23 days
 and then released them. No date has been set for trial.
 Prison conditions do not meet internationally recognized minimum standards. In-
 mates lack heat, and there are an insufficient number of showers and toilets. In
 September the Minister of Interior acknowledged publicly that the prisons are over-
 crowded, with 50 to 60 prisoners often housed to a cell. There are as many as 60
 children detained in prisons, sharing the same facilities as adult prisoners.
 Abuses also occurred in areas outside the State's authority, especially in the Pal-
 estinian refugee camps. There were credible reports that members of the various
 Palestinian groups which control the camps detained and tortured their Palestinian
 rivals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government resorts to arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. Although the law requires security forces to obtain arrest war-
 rants before making arrests, the military prosecutor reportedly issues blank war-
 rants to be completed after arrest are made. Arresting oficers are supposed to refer
 suspects to a prosecutor within 24 hours of arrest but frequently do not.
 The law requires the authorities to release a suspect after 48 hours of arrest if
 they do not bring formal charges against him. Some prosecutors flout this require-
 ment and detain suspects for long periods in pretrial confinement without a court
 order. The law authorizes a judge to remand a suspect to incommunicado detention.
 There is a system of bail, but felons are excluded from using it. Defendants have
 the right to legal counsel, but there is no public defender's office for those who can-
 not afford a lawyer.
 The army continued the practice of arbitrary arrest, detaining mainly the former
 members of the dissolved Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces. It conducted most
 of these detentions after a bomb at a Maronite Christian church in the A-Zuq re-
 ogin of .Isriwan killed 12 worshipers and injured many others. The Army report-
 y detained the frmer militiamen in order to carry out their investigation into
 the bombing. LF commander Samir Ja a publicly stated that the Christian commu-
 nity needed to take security measures if the State was unable to do so. The Army
 released most of the detainees after 2 or 3 days.
 In April security forces arrested Samir Jaja' as a suspect in the AI-Zuq church
 bombing-and also in the 1990 murders of Dany Chamoun, the leader of the Liberal
 Psrty, hs wife, and two children. Defense lawyers maintain that Ja'Ja's detention
 in an underground room at the Ministry of Defense violates the law and that the
 conditions of detention are degrading and inhuman. The Government maintains
 that it selected the detention facility to safeguard Jaja's life from possible assassins.
 In April Army intelligence officers arrested 12 Lebanese members of the Iraqi
 Ba'th P arty and transferred some of them into the custody of Syrian authorities. Se-
 curity forces arrested another Lebanese member of that party, Rafiq Abu Younes,
 in September. By year's end, the Government had not provided information about
 his whereabouts.
 Security forces also detained persons who opposed the presence of Syrian forces
 in Lebanon (see Section 1.c.).
 Local militias and non-Lebanese forces continued to conduct arbitrary arrests in
 areas outside the central Government's authority. The SLA detains at least 200 Leb-
 anese citizens and an undetermined number of Palestinians at the AI-Khiyam pris-
 
 
 1134
 on in South Lebanon. The SLA denies detainees the right to correspond with family
 members and prohibits visits by family members and representatives of the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross, despite receiving many requests for such vis-
 its.
 Israel is known to hold several Lebanese citizens, including Sheikh Abdel Karim
 Obaid and Mustafa Dirani, who are figures associated with the Islamic resistance.
 Palestinian refugees are subject to arrest, detention, and harassment by the state
 security forces, Syrian security forces, the various militias, and rival Palestinian fac-
 tions.
 In the recent past, the Government resorted in a few cases to exile as a means
 of punishment, In 1991 it pardoned former army commander and self-proclaimed
 Prime Minister General Michel 'Awn and two aides, on condition that they depart
 the country and remain in exile for 5 years. The Government had accused the three
 of attempting to usurp the authority of the State. They remain in exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Lebanese judicial system is composed of the
 regular civilian courts; military courts, which try cases involving military personnel;
 the Judicial Council, which is a state security court; and the religious tribunals of
 the various denominations which adjudicate disputes involving marriage, inherit-
 ance, and personal status.
 The Judicial Council is a permanent tribunal of five senior judges who adjudicate
 cases involving threats to state security. On the recommendation of the Minister of
 Justice, the Cabinet decides whether to try a case before this tribunal.
 The judiciary is generally impartial and independent of executive authority. How-
 ever, influential politicians and Syrian intelligence officers sometimes intervene to
 protect their clients from prosecution.
 The Ministry of Justice appoints judges according to a formula based on religious
 affiliation. Low salaries have compelled competent judges to resign from the lench
 while others have become susceptible to corruption and bribery. n 1994 the Min-
 ister of Justice announced the nomination of 42 additional judges. The shortage of
 judges has impeded efforts to adjudicate cases backloged during the years of inter-
 nal conflict.
 Trial delays are also caused by the Government's inability to conduct investiga-
 tions in areas outside its control. According to the Minister of Interior, 600 prisoners
 are in detention, some for long periods, awaiting trial.
 In refugee camps, Palestinian elements operate an autonomous and arbitrary sys-
 tem of justice. The Islamic militia, Hizballah, operates its own system of justice. In
 February it stated that Islamic law would apply in the areas it controls.
 In 1994 Hizballah authorities tried and executed a person accused of murder. The
 Government did not attempt to stop the execution. According to Lebanese press re-
 ports, Hizballah is holding in captivity Muhammad Diram, a cousin of 7Mustafa
 Dirani, an Islamic leader abducted by Israeli commandos (see Section L.b.).
 Hizballah has reportedly accused Muhammad Dirani of collaborating with Israel in
 the abduction.
 The legal system is discriminatory in its handling of so-called crimes of honor. Ac-
 cording to the Penal Code, the male killer of a wife, sister, or mother may avoid
 conviction if he can demonstrate that he committed the crime in response to an ille-
 gitimate sexual relation by the victim.
 There are no known political prisoners, although the authorities often detain
 without charges political opponents of the Syrian and Lebanese Governments for
 short periods.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-While
 the authorities generally show little interest in controlling the personal lives of citi-
 zens, they are not reluctant to interfere with the privacy of persons regarded as foes
 of the Government. Laws require that prosecutors must obtain warrants before en-
 tering houses, except when the army is in hot pursuit of an armed attacker. Militias
 and non-Lebanese forces operating outside areas of central government authority
 have frequently violated rights of privacy. Various factions and the Government use
 informer networks and monitor telephones to gather information on their foes.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-An undetermined number of civilians continue to be killed in South Leb-
 anon, as Hizballah and its associated Lebanese and Palestinian militias, on the one
 hand, and Israeli forces and the SLA, on the other, engaged in a cycle of violence.
 The former attacked SEA troops deployed on Lebanese soil and in June conducted
 a rocket attack on northern Israel. Israeli forces conducted repeated air strikes and
 artillery barrages on purported guerrilla and terrorist targets inside Lebanon.
 On June 2, Israeli helicopters attacked a Hizballah military training camp east
 of Ba'albak, killing 26 persons and injuring 40. In retaliation, Lebanese resistance
 forces, principally 7Hizballah, fired 40 Katyusha rockets at settlements in northern
 
 
 1135
 Israel. On August 5, an Israeli helicopter raid targeted a residential building in the
 township of Dayr al-Zahrani. Seven persons were killed and 17 wounded.
 From July 25 to August 24, Israeli forces imposed a blockade of all vehicular traf-
 fic into and out of the southern Lebanon township of Yuhmur, permitting only pe-
 destrian access. According to international observers, the blockade led to a shortage
 of potable water and an outbreak of skin diseases among the inhabitants.
 The Government, and to a much greater extent the SLA and Hizballah, continue
 to violate international humanitarian standards with respect to the treatment of
 prisoners.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although Lebanon has a long history of freedom
 of opinion, speech, and press, in 1994 the Government seriously infringed these free-
 doms. From March to July, it prohibited the broadcast of news and political com-
 mentary by all privately owne television and radio stations. The Government im-
 posed t e ban after dissolving the former Christian militia and political party, the
 Lebanese Forces, which it accused of bombing a Maronite church in A1-Zuq in Feb-
 ruary (see Section 1.d.). Government supporters argued that the ban was necessary
 because, in the aftermath of the bombing, privately owned broadcasting stations
 might enflame sectarian tensions. However, the effect was to stifle temporarily dis-
 sent and Lebanon's tradition of cultural and religious diversity.
 The Government rescinded the ban after the Speaker ofthe Chamber of Deputies
 introduced a bill urging the ban's rescission and calling for a review of the laws on
 broadcasting. In October Parliament passed a new audiovisual law which most par-
 ties consider an adequate safeguard of freedom of expression.
 The Government has several legal tools at its disposal to control the freedom of
 expression. The Surete General, under Ministry of Interior jurisdiction, is author-
 ized to approve all foreign magazines and nonperiodical works including books,
 plays, and films before they are distributed on the market. In 1994 the Ministry
 prohibited the screening of an Egyptian film, "The Terrorist", a satire on Islamic
 fundamentalism, after some Islamic digitaries voiced complaints. In July Interior
 Ministry authorities prohibited the import of Al-Wasat, a magazine published in
 London, because it included an interview with Ghassan Tuma, a member of the dis-
 solved LF party. In June a court sentenced Tuma in absentia to 20 years for con-
 spiracy to assassinate the President.
 Lebanese law prohibits attacks on the dinity of the Head of State or foreign lead-
 ers. The Government may prosecute offending journalists and publications in a spe-
 cial court empowered to try such matters. In August the Government prosecuted a
 pro-Syrian newspaper, A-Sh, after it printed cartoons deemed insulting to the
 Peient. The Government took another newspaper, Ad-D~iyar, to court in Septem-
 ber for "attacking the dignity" of the President. At years end, both newspapers con-
 tinued to publish, but their cases were pending.
 The 1991 security agreement between Lebanon and Syria contains a provision
 that effectively prohibits the publication of any information deemed harmul to the
 security of either State. Under the risk of prosecution, Lebanese journalists censor
 themselves on matters related to Syria.
 In September the Government arrested five persons for posting wall bills urging
 a well-known siger to cancel a concert scheduled to benefit the reconstruction of
 Beirut. The psters urged the cancellation to protest the city's controversial recon-
 struction plans. The Government released them only afte tthe concert was held, but
 did not cite them for any wrongdoing.
 In 1994 the Parliament approved several amendments to the restrictive press reg-
 ulations imposed during the civil war, such as Law Decree 104 of 1977. The amend-
 ments withdrew the authority of the Minister of Interior to close a publication by
 decree and the authority of the Attorney General, or any court, to close a publication
 involved in litigation until a court renders a verdict. Other amendments prohibit the
 pretrial detention of journalists accused in press crimes and imprisonment for any
 crime not specified in the Penal Code.
 Lebanon has a strong tradition of academic freedom and a flourishing private edu-
 cational system. The Government does not usually interfere with professors, curric-
 ula, or student grups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--Citizens wishing to hold a pub-
 lic rally must obtain approval from the Ministry of Interior. The Government does
 not apply this law unifrmly. In 1994 the Ministry approved requests for rallies
 from some non-Christian political factions, including the Shi'a Muslim Ameal Move-
 ment, the mostly Druze Progressive Socialist Party, the Sunni Muslim group al-
 Ahbash, and supporters of the Prime Minister. The Ministry disapproved requests
 from some Christian groups.
 
 
 1136
 In April army troops fired shots in the air to disperse supporters of the former
 LF Commander Sanm     Jaja' who wished to protest Jagja's arrest at the residence
 of the Maronite Patriarch. In 1994 the Government did not interfere with dem-
 onstrations and marches organized by Hizballah.
 In general the Government does not interfere with the establishment of private
 organizations; however, citizens require government approval to establish political
 parties. However, the army intelligence service monitors the movement and activi-
 ties of members of opposition groups.
 The Ministry of Interior scrutinizes requests to establish political parties and to
 some extent monitors the activities of all parties.
 In 1994 the Government dissolved the Lebanese Foes as a politicalparty, accus-
 ing it of involvement in the Al-Zuq church bombing. LF supporters claim the dis-
 solution was illegal because the LF had not been found guilty of any wrongdoing.
 Nonetheless, the Government has not made similar moves to dissolve Hizballah or
 Aral. Neither Israel nor Syria allow groups openly hostile to them to operate in
 areas under their control.
 c. Freedom of Relii on.-The State does not interfere with the practice of religion,
 the activities of foreign clergy, or places of worship. The Government officially recog-
 nizes 17 religions or denominations, including Christians, Muslims, Druze, and
 Jews. Citizens have the right to convert to another religion, but converts frequently
 suffer social ostracism in this religiously differentiated society.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general the Government does not interfere with the foreign travel
 of citizens, but obstacles remain. Travel to Israel is prohibited by law, but many citi-
 zens undertake such travel via Israeli-controlled territory in South Lebanon. A
 woman is required by law to obtain her husband's or father's permission for a pass-
 port. There are no legal restrictions on the right of citizens to return. Palestinian
 refugees living in Lebanon have the right to return after foreign travel.
 Lebanese armed forces and Syrian troops maintain checkpoints in areas under
 their control. In South Lebanon, the SLA, Israeli forces, and the Lebanese Army all
 maintain tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of the
 security zone.
 After years of internal conflict, the recent spread of government authority has re-
 moved barriers that had previously hindered domestic travel. The Government has
 encouraged the return to their homes of over 600,000 persons displaced during the
 civil war. Although some people have begun to reclaim their homes abandoned dur-
 ing the war, the vast majority of displaced persons have not attempted to reclaim
 their property. The resettlement process is slowed by tight budgetary constraints,
 destryed infrastr   re, the lack of schools and ecnomic opportunities, and the
 fear that physical security is still lacking in some parts of the country.
 In June the Government issued a decree extending citizenship to an estimated
 120,000 stateless residents excluding Palestinian refugees. Some Christian leaders
 criticized the move as numerically favoring the Muslim community and contributing
 to an imbalance among the country's religions.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution states that the people have the right to change their government
 in periodic free and fair elections. However, the 1992 parliamentary election was not
 prepared or carried out impartially. There were widespread reports of irregularities
 andvote rigging, and non-Lebanese military forces exerted considerable influence
 over the preparation of lists of candidates, who were consequently assured of vic-
 tory. The majority of Christians and many Muslims boycotted the election as can-
 didates and voters to protest holding the election before Syrian military forces had
 been redeployed. Consequently, the election results did not reflect the full spectrum
 of the body litic and cast doubt on the people's ability to change their government
 According to the Constitution, elections for the Parliament must be held every 4
 years. The Parliament elects the President who serves one 6-year term. The Presi-
 dent and Parliament choose the Cabinet. According to the unwritten "National Pact"
 of 1943, the President is a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim,
 and the Speaker of Parliament a Shi'a Muslim. Until 1990, seats in Parliament
 were divided on a six-to-five ratio of Christians to Muslims.
 Under the national reconciliation agreement reached in Taif in October 1989,
 members of Parliament agreed to alter the National Pact to create a 50-50 balance
 between Christian and Muslim   members of Parliament. The Taif Accord also in-
 creased the number of seats in parliament and transfered some powers from the
 President to the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
 
 
 1137
 Women have the right to vote, and there are no legal barriers to participation by
 women in politics. Three women were elected to Parliament in 1992. Other women
 hold policy-level positions in the Government.
 Palestinian refugees have no political rights. An estimated 17 Palestinian factions
 operate in Lebanon, generally organized around prominent individuals. Most Pal-
 estinians live in refugee camps controlled by one or more factions. The leaders of
 the refugees are not elected, nor are there any democratically organized institutions
 in the camps.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights groups, including the Foundation for Humanitarian Rights,
 the Lebanese Association for Human Rights, and the Bar Association's Office for
 Human Rights, operate freely without government interference. There were no
 known requests by international human rights organizations to visit Lebanon in
 1994. The SLA has refused to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross
 and other international humanitarian groups to visit the A1-Khiyam prison in South
 Lebanon.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution calls for 'social justice and equality of duties and
 rights among all citizens without prejudice or favoritism." In practice, aspects of the
 law and traditional mores discriminate against women. Only males may confer citi-
 zenship on their spouses and children. In some cases, this means that children born
 to Lebanese mothers and stateless fathers are themselves stateless.
 The law stipulates that a woman must obtain her husband's approval to open a
 business or engage in trade. The Parliament has not yet acted on an amendment
 introduced to change this law. Women may own property but often cede effective
 control over it due to cultural reasons. The law also accords preferential treatment
 to males accused of crimes of honor (see Section 1.e.).
 Religious groups have their own family and personal status laws administered by
 religious courts. Each group differs in its treatment of marriage, family property
 rights, and inheritance. Many of these laws discriminate against women. For exam-
 ple, Sunni inheritance law gives a son twice the share of a daughter. Although Mus-
 lim men may divorce easily, Muslim women may do so only with the concurrence
 of their husbands.
 Women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law, academia,
 the arts, and, to a lesser degree, in business. Social pressure against women pursu-
 ing a career is strong in some parts of society. Males sometimes exercise consider-
 able control over female relatives, restricting their activities outside the home or
 contact with friends and relatives.
 Violence against women occurs; the press frequently reports cases of rape. How-
 ever, there are no authoritative statistics on the extent of spousal violence. Doctors
 and social workers believe most abused women do not seek medical help. The soci-
 ety's emphasis on personal privacy and honor makes it difficult for women to seek
 legal redress. The Government has not expressed an interest in the problem of vio-
 lence against women nor has it made an effort to combat it.
 Children.-The plight of children is a growing concern but the Government has
 not allocated funds specifically to protect them. An undetermined number of chil-
 dren are neglected, abused, exploited, and even sold to adoption agents. There are
 hundreds of abandoned children in the streets, begin  an  cleaning car windows;
 others are hired illegally at low wages. Juvenile delinquency is rising;, many
 delinquents wait in ordinary prisons for trial and remain there after sentencing.
 Limited financial resources have hindered efforts to build adequate facilities to re-
 habilitate delinquents.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to the United Nations, an esti-
 mated 250,000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon. The Government ended its
 practice of denying work permits to Palestinians in 1991. Nonetheless, Palestinians
 still encounter job discrimination. Palestinians and other aliens may own land of a
 limited size and only after obtaining the approval of five district offices. The law
 applies to all aliens, but for politicaL, cultural, and economic reason] it is applied
 in a manner disadvantageous to the Palestinians and, to a lesser extent, Kurds.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government. The amended Constitution of 1990 embraces the principle of abolishing
 religious affiliation as a criterion for filling all government positions, but no steps
 have been taken to accomplish this.
 
 
 1138
 People With Disabilities.-Over 100 000 people have sustained disabilities during
 the civil war. The care for the disabled is generally a function performed by families.
 Mast efforts to secure education, independence, health, and shelter for the disabled
 are made by some 100 private organizations for the handicapped. In general, these
 organizations are poorly funded.
 Lebanon's heavily damaged cities make no accommodation to the disabled. Build-
 ing codes have no requirements for ease of access.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except government employees, may es-
 tablish and join unions and have a legal right to strike. Workers have the right to
 elect their union leaders by secret ballot. About 600,000 workers are organized in
 160 labor unions and associations. Twenty-three unions, with about 250,000 work-
 ers, are affiliated with the General Confederation of Workers (CGTL). In January
 the CGTL split and a second union group was formed-the Federation of Sectoral
 Syndicates. Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations.
 In general the Government does not control or restrict unions, although some
 union leaders allege that the Government has tried to intervene in elections in favor
 of certain union officials.
 Palestinian refugees may organize their own unions, but few do so because of con-
 tinued restrictions on their right to work.
 Unions exercised their right to strike on numerous occasions. Laws prohibit ret-
 ribution against strikers and there were no known instances of such retribution dur-
 ing the year.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and bargain exists in law and practice. Most workers' groups engage in some
 form of collective bargaining with their employers. Stronger unions are able to ob-
 tain significant gains for their members; weaker unions rely on the mediation of the
 CGTL There is no government mechanism to promote voluntary labor-management
 negotiations. Workers have no statutory protection against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although forced labor is not pro-
 hibited by law. the Government does not condone it. However, employers sometimes
 force some categories of foreign workers, especially those working as domestic serv-
 ants, to remain in situations amounting to coerced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The 1946 Labor Code stipulates
 that workers between the ages of 8 and 16 may not work more than 7 hours a day,
 or between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. The Code also prohibits children from engaging in cer-
 tain types of mechanical work. There is a general prohibition against "jobs out of
 proportion with a worker's age." The Labor Ministry is tasked with enforcing these
 requirements, but it has few resources and a demoralized and sometimes corrupt
 staff. The Ministry does not rigorously apply the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Ministry sets the legal monthly
 minimum wage at $117 (197,000 Lebanese pounds), but does not enforce it in the
 private sector. The minimum wage is not sufficient to support a worker and his or
 her family. Many workers hold more than one job.
 The labor law prescribes a standard 6-day workweek of 48 hours, with a 24-hour
 rest period per week. In practice, workers in the industrial sector work an average
 of 35 hours a week, and workers in other sectors of the economy work an average
 of 30 hours a week. The law includes specific occupational health and safety regula-
 tions. Labor regulations call on employers to take adequate precautions for em-
 ployee safety. The Ministry of Labor has been lax in enforcement. There is no law
 or policy giving workers the right to remove themselves from hazardous conditions.
