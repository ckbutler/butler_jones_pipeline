 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR), created in 1990 as the demo-
 cratic successor to the Communist Czechoslovak State after the November revolu-
 tion of 1989, was dissolved at the end of 1992. The dissolution of the CSFR was
 the result of democratic elections in June, in which the victorious parties in both
 republics found that their different conceptions about the future of the structure and
 function of the CSFR were irreconcilable, and that a split into two independent
 states was the only viable alternative. Both Czech and Slovak critics of this decision
 objected that, in a democratic society, the people should have been allowed to ex-
 press their views about such a fundamental decision through a referendum. Federal
 structures, which existed until the end of 1992, were essentially charged with exe-
 cuting the dissolution of the Federation in the postelection period. On November 25,
 the Federal Assembly (Parliament) passed by a narrow margin a law dissolving the
 CSFR at midnight on December 31, 1992. On that date, the  eration was replaced
 by independent Czech and Slovak Republics.
 The Czech Republic, ruled by a parliamentary coalition led by the Civic Demo-
 cratic Party (ODS), ratified a new Constitution on December 16, which went into
 effect on January 1, 1993. The Slovak Republic, ruled by a coalition led by the
 Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), ratified a new Constitution on Sep-
 tember 1, which went into effect on October 1. The Slovak Constitution has been
 criticized as insufficiently protective of minority rights.
 By early 1992, the CSFR had effectively dismantled the repressive security appa-
 ratus of pre-1989 Czechoslovakia. The CSFR Federal Assembly exercised direct
 oversight over the Federal Security and Intelligence Service (FBIS). After the June
 1992 elections, Federal authority in security and intelligence matters devolved in
 stages to the already extant Interior Ministries of the two Republics. In the second
 half of 1992, disputes within the governing coalition over the staffing of leading
 posts in the FBIS limited its effectiveness. Total military expenditures for 1989, the
 last ear for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a
 detailed analysis, were $8.36 billion. Defense spending has decreased and should
 continue to decrease in 1993.
 Economic reforms begun in 1990 and 1991 made further progress in 1992. By the
 end of the year, the Federal Government was nearing completion of the first wave
 of large-scale privatization of state enterprises. In the Czech Republic, privatization
 of large enterprises kept pace with or even exceeded government expectations by
 midyear. Foreign investment 'accelerated, and inflation and unemployment were
 kept at low levels. In the Slovak Republic, the concentration of heavy industry and
 military production and the relative dearth of capital contributed to high regional
 unemployment and economic-'uncertainty.
 Independent institutions, such as the Helsinki Committee and the Slovak human
 rights group Human, continued to monitor human rights in the CSFR throughout
 the year and, in general, were supported by institutional guarantees of human
 rights. Nonetheless, in the course of the year, the Czech Republic experienced con-
 tinued controversy over the legal and moral basis for, and implementation of, Fed-
 eral and Republic laws screening officials for collaboration with the Communist re-
 gime's secret police. In the Slovak Republic, the Government's failure to continue
 screening collaborators was also a matter of some controversy. More important,
 however, were government attempts in Slovakia to limit the independence of some
 media. Some ethnic minorities expressed concern about the guarantee of their rights
 
 
 754
 under what they perceived to be a nationalist government in the Slovak Republic.
 Social discrrnination, sometimes resulting in violence against the Romany minority,
 and instances of police failure to protect Romany rights also remained a problem
 in both Republics.
 REsPEcr FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person. Including Freedom from
 a. Political or Other Etrqjudicial Kiliing.-No political or extrejudicial killings
 were known to have occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions, disappearances, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions.
 c. Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no evidence of any such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-ln the CSFR, Federal law required arrest
 warrants issued by courts. Persons could be held without charge for 24 hours, dur-
 ing which time the arrestee had the right to consult with counsel. A person charged
 with a crime had the right to appear before a judge for arraignment. At arraign-
 ment, if charges were formalized, the judge determined whether custody was nec-
 essary pending trial. Pretrial custody could not exceed 1 year, and in such cases
 monthly appearances before a judge were required. Counsel and family visits were
 available.
 These guidelines were followed in practice in both Republics. The new Slovak
 Constitution specifically guaranteed against unlawful or unreasonable detention.
 There was no exile either in law or in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system of the CSFR consisted of district
 courts, regional courts, and the supreme courts of the Republics or the Supreme
 Court of the Federation. In addition, a Federal Constitutional Court was established
 early in 1992. The judiciary was impartial and independent; press criticism of the
 judiciary centered on the lack of qualified judges and the ensuing backlog of cases
 under review, at times describing the situation in the courts as "  a state of col-
 lapse." This criticism reflected operational crises rather than purposeful government
 abuse of the judicial system.
 Persons charged with criminal offenses in the CSFR were entitled to fair and open
 public trials. They had the right to be informed of the charges against them and
 of their legal rights, to retain and consult with counsel, and to present a defense.
 If a defendant could not afford a lawyer, a lawyer was still provided. Defendants
 enjoyed a presumption of innocence and had the right to refuse to testify against
 themselves. Defendants could appeal any judgments against them. These rights
 were observed in practice in both Reublics.
 Early in 1992, the Federal Assembly commission charged with screening high of-
 ficeholders of the Federal Government and other key institutions for past collabora-
 tion with the pre-1989 secret police completed its work. A commission attached to
 the Czech Parlaent performed the same function for officials at the republic level.
 The law barred many former Communist party officials, members of the People's
 Militia, and secret police collaborators from holding a wide range of elective, nomi-
 native, and appointive government offices, including appointive positions in state-
 owned companies, academe, and the media, for a period of 5 years. Hundreds of per-
 sons were tired, including at least 12 journalists.
 The screening process was criticized because it was based on the records of the
 Communist secret police which many thought were incomplete, unreliable, or both.
 The version of the screening law that applied to most officials provided no mecha-
 nism for appeal, although the FBIS had a committee that reviewed cases of collabo-
 rators to assess whether they were witting or unwitting. If an accused collaborator
 was found to have been unwitting, this could contribute to his exoneration and ulti-
 mately to keeping his position. The screening process was also criticized as a viola-
 tion of human rights principles prohibiting discrimination in employment and con-
 demning collective guilt. Supporters of the screening process cited the political need
 to prevent those directly responsible for abuses of power and repression during the
 years of Communist rule from holding high public office during a 5-year transition
 period to a free society. After the Federal Constitutional Court ruled on November
 26 that one provision of the law was illegal, Federal authorities abolished screening
 under this provision. Although the 1991 law establishing the screening process was
 a Federal requirement binding on both Republics, it was, at best, carried out in a
 desultory and incomplete fashion in the Slovak Republic. In September 1992, the
 Slovak Interior Minister announced that Slovakia, when independent, would repeal
 the Federal screening law.
 
 
 755
 The Constitutions of both Republics afforded legal protection to those accused of
 a crime and created Constitutional Courts to rule on the constitutionality of deci.
 sions by lower courts.
 There was no legislation, either in the Federation or in the Republics, addressing
 political offenses. There were no political prisoners in the CSFR.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy. Family. Home, or Correspondence.-Elec-
 trnic surveilance, the tapping of telephones, and interception of mail require a
 court order. The Government complied with this requirement. Police had the right
 to conduct searches of homes only with a warrant issued by a court. There were no
 reports of arbitrary or unlawful interference with priv  in the Czech Republic.
 Sporadic complaints that the post-June Government in Slovakia engaged in tele-
 phone tapping could not be substantiated.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pruss.-Federal law, as well as those of the Republics,
 provided for freedom of s peech and press. Persons spoke out on political and other
 issues and freely criticized the governments and public figures in the CSFR. Hun-
 dreds of newspapers, magazines, and journals continued to be published in 1992.
 Newspapers were ofen associated with the interests of poitical parties, but inde-
 pendent newspapers also existed. The print media enjoyed the right to print without
 censorship or fear of government persecution.
 The new Slovak Constitution prohibits censorship and guarantees freedom of in-
 formation and right of expression. In the latter hal of 199 , however, some journal-
 ists became concerned about what they saw as government moves to restrict free-
 dom of the press. They pointed to Prime Minister Meciar's call for 'ethical self-regu-
 lation" as amounting to a demand to practice self-censrship. They were also con-
 cerned that the Government's decision not to lrivatize Danubiaprint, the large
 state-owned newsprint manufacturer, was another step toward controlling the
 media. Both the Slovak Minister of Culture and his deputy for media affairs strong-
 ly criticized newspapers that published articles unfavorable to the Prime Minister
 and the HZDS. Slovak government accusations of financial irregularities in the
 management of some newspapers critical of the Government were interpreted as a
 political ploy. The Slovak Govenent insisted it sought only to ensure the press'
 balanced coverage of Slovak news and journalists' commitment to a professional
 code of moral behalor.
 In the fall of 1992, Prime Minister Meciar called for the creation of 'journalist
 senates' that would conduct accelerated hearings on cases in which journalists were
 accused of slandering public officials. This call to establish an extraconstitutional ju-
 dicial body, as well as public statements to journalists by Slovak Cabinet-level gov-
 emrnent members that journalists not telling the truth about Slovakia would be
 punished, contributed to a very tense atmosphere by year's end, leading independ-
 ent journalists to be concerned about futurepress freedom.
 Television broadcasting facilities remainedstate owned in the CSFR in 1992, and
 plans to license private stations were postponed until after the dissolution of the
 Federation. Local television stations began operating without licenses, engaging in
 what was called "test broadcasting' in anticipation of expansion in 1993. Unti'l mid-
 year, the directors of  television channels were appointed by the Federal Govern-
 ment and exercised editorial control over programming. After the elections  dis-
 a.eement arose, especially in the Slovak Republic, about the management of tele-
 vision assets. The Parliaments of both the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic
 established television boards whlose members are appointed by the respective Re-
 public Governments. Their independence from political influence, therefore, became
 an item of debate.
 In Slovakia, Parliament passed a bill in September to transform the Television
 Council into a nonpolitical body. Some  opstion spokespersons expressed fears
 that the new law, which stipulates that the Slovak National Council(parliament)
 will elect the members of the Television Council for 6-year terms, and, on the rec-
 ommendation of the Televisibn Council, will elect the Television Director, was d-
 signed to give the Slovak Government control of Slovak television. Even before the
 new law could be enacted the Minister of Culture and his deputyr submitted a for-
 mal written appeal to the Slovak Parliament requesting the dismissal of the Slovak
 Television Director on the grounds of incompetency. The parliamentar Cultural
 Committee passed a resolution that same day recommending that the rector be
 dismissed immediately, and the following day the Parliament adopted a resolution
 replacing the Director. The new Director, in turn, removed several key subordinates
 who were critical of the Government.
 The Federal Government also supported radio broadcasting facilities whose pro-
 gram content was determined by the management of each station. Although most
 
 
 756
 radio stations were government sponsored, a number of privately owned and con-
 trolled stations existed.
 Legislation granted universities the authority to decide their internal affairs, in-
 cluding pedagogic and academic orientation and internal structure. Academic free-
 dom was guaranteed by law. In the summer and fall of 1992, controversy erupted
 over the establishment of a new university in the Slovak town of Trnava. The Slo-
 yak Minister of Education insisted that the rector of the institution had not been
 appointed according to law, but the acting rector refused to resign pending a court
 decision on the matter. Some critics interpreted the Government's action as an at-
 tempt to clean out some members of the teaching staff who were closely associated
 with the pre-June Slovak government. Toward the end of the year, efforts were
 under way to find a compromise solution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of persons to assem-
 ble peacefully was protected in Federal and Republic law. Permits for some public
 demonstrations were required by law but rarely refused. Police generally did not
 interfere with spontaneous peaceful demonstrations for which organizers lacked a
 permit.
 The right of persons to associate freely and to form jpolitical parties and move-
 ments was also protected by law and respected in practice. Some organizations, in.
 cluding political parties, were required to register, but registration was essentially
 a formality.
 c. Freedom of Re/igion.-The CSFR enjoyed religious freedom. There was no offi-
 cial religion, either in the Federation or in the Republics, and no religion was
 banned or discouraged by law. Issues relating to the restitution of church property
 remain to be resolved.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The CSFR had no restrictions on domestic or foreign travel, emigration,
 and repatriation. Passports were readily available to all wishing to travel abroad.
 Czechoslovak citizens who emigrated during the period of Communist rule were free
 to return for visits and were able to regain Czechoslovak citizenship if they wished.
 Refugees and asylum seekers were treated according to international norms. Most
 refugees in the CSFR sought to use the country as a transit point en route to other
 countries in the West. Those granted refugee status were given permission to reside
 in the CSFR for 5 years and could then apply for citizenship; in practice, however,
 most potential refugees applied for permanent settlement elsewhere.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In the CSFR, citizens had, and exercised, the right to change their government
 peacefully. Citizens over the age of 18 were eligible to vote in the Federal Republic
 and local elections. Voting was carried out by secret ballot. Opposition groups, in-
 cluding political parties, continued to function openly and participate in the political
 process.
 Simultaneous Federal and republic elections were held in the CSFR in 1990 and
 1992. The Constitutions of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic mandate
 regular elections at 4-year intervals. Federal and republic voting was based on pro-
 portional representation within 12 large electoral districts by party or movement,
 with a 5-percent threshold before parties could enter the Parliaments at both the
 Federal and Republic levels.
 There were no restrictions, in law or In practice, on women's participation in poli-
 tics and government.
 Article 260 of the Criminal Code, promulgated in 1991, outlawed the spread of
 ideologies romoting ethnic, religious, or class hostilities, specifically mentioning
 fascism and communism as examples. It did not affect Communists legally elected
 to Parliament in open elections after 1989, although there were concerns by mem-
 bers of the party that their actions could be declared illegal. The Federal Constitu-
 tional Court ruled in September 1992 that the mention of fascism and communism
 must be dropped or the law would be declared invalid.
 Czechoslovakia's two main nationalities-Czechs and Slovaks-debated questions
 of the appropriate division of power between the Federation and the Republics dur-
 inj the entire life of the CSFR. The dissolution law passed by the Federal Assembly
 in November provided for the Czech National Council (parliament) and the National
 Council of the Slovak Republic (parliament) to determine how new legislative bodies
 will be organized. It transferred the authority of the Federal Supreme Court and
 Constitutional Court to the Supreme Courts of the two Republics. It further author-
 ized the National Councils to pass laws, effective as of January 1 1993, or later,
 relating to the exercise of the authority of the new Republics. The Slovak Constitu-
 
 
 757
 tion was passed by the Slovak Parliament in September, and the Czech Constitution
 by the Czech Parliament in December.
 The largest minority in Slovakia, ethnic Hungarians, participated in the political
 process at all levels and achieved representation in the Federal and Republic Par-
 liaments. The Romany (Gypsies), also more concentrated in Slovakia, were much
 less engaged in the political process, although not because of any apparent obstacles
 put in their way by the Slovak authorities. Romany parties were splintered and un-
 able to cross the 5-percent threshold.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The CSFR, under the Presidency of former dissident Vaclav Havel, took an active
 role in encouraging human rights investigations. Human rights monitoring groups
 in the CSFR continued their work after Havel's resignation in July without appar-
 ent difficulty.
 International and local representatives of human rights organizations worked
 freely in Czechoslovakia, without government interference at the Federal or Repub-
 lic level.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Equality of citizens and prohibition of discrimination is guaranteed by law in both
 the Czech and the Slovak Republics. Health care, education, retirement, and other
 social services were provided in the CSFR without regard to race, sex, religion, lan-
 guage, or social status.
 women were equal under the law and received pay equal to that of male col-
 leagues for the same job, although median wages for women averaged just over two-
 thirds those of men. Only relatively small numbers of women were represented in
 the higher levels of professional and government employment. There was little pub-
 lic debate on violence toward women (spouse abuse), nor was there a government
 policy on the subject. The question of violence against women has received virtually
 no attention in the CSFR. Women enjoyed equal property, inheritance, and other
 legal rights with men.
 The CSFR had two sizable minorities: ethnic Hungarians and Romanies. The
 Hungarians, concentrated in southern Slovakia, numbered approximately 600,000.
 The Slovak Republic provided a separate system of elementary and secondary
 schools for its Hungaran minority as well as limited pedagogical training at the
 university level. As a practical matter, virtually all Hungarians who resided in the
 CSFR and who were of college age spoke Slovak or Czech and had access to higher
 education within the CSFR in those languages. The Slovak Government provided
 subsidies for minority language periodicals.
 Some ethnic Hungarian leaders expressed concern after the Federation's rupture.
 The new Slovak Constitution contains a preamble which begins by citing "the Slo-
 yak nation" and ends with the phrase "citizens of the Slovs"Re ublic. For some
 ethnic Hungarian citizens of Slovakia, the emphasis given the Slovak nation over
 the national minorities engendered fear of exclusion in a country very concerned
 about its national identity.
 In addition, the Hungarian community expressed misgivings about the 1990 Lan-
 guage Law, which established Slovak as the official language although it gave mi-
 norities the right to use their mother tongue in communities where they constituted
 at least 20 percent of the population. The new Slovak Constitution provides minori-
 ties the right to develop their own culture, receive information in their own lan-
 guage, and use their own langage for official business. Some Sbovaks of Hungarian
 nationality complained that their right to register names of newborn children was
 restricted. By year's end, Slovak gvernment efforts to eliminate bilingual place
 names on highway signs were largly successful, and mention of Hungarian names
 for towns in Blovakia had been bannein n both Slovakand Hungran-language tele-
 vision broadcasts. Both initiatives evinced strong protests on the part of the Hun-
 garian minority.
 The Romanies, whose numbers are estimated at between 100,000 and 400,000,
 live throughout the area of the CSFR, though a majority live in Slovakia. They suf-
 fer disproportionately from poverty, crime, and disease, which appear to stem more
 from traditional conditions and a strong popular prejudice against them than from
 conscious government policies.
 In addition to documented evidence of acts of social prejudice, such as the refusal
 to serve Romanies in shops or restaurants in both the Czech and Slovak Republics,
 there were sporadic incidents of violence against Romanies in 1992. Romany gups
 told human rights gups that they found no Slovak government office willing to
 hear their case and-so were compelled to turn to nongovernmental human rights
 
 
 758
 organizations. They cited the example of reported police overreaction to a dispute
 in the village of Lomnicka, in which a number of allegedly innocent people were in-
 jured in a plice raid on a private home.
 The Jewish community in the CSFR numbered only a few thousand. While public
 life was generally free from anti-Semitism, hostile acts did occur in some isolated
 instances. Czech, Slovak, and international Jewish groups continued to protest the
 publication and dissemination of anti-Semitic publications in both Republics during
 the year. In both the Czech and Slovak Republics, police moved against publishers
 and distributors of the classic anti-Semitic libel 'Mhe Protocols of the Elders of
 Zion.' In Bratislava, the publisher of anti-Semitic tracts was indicted for violating
 laws a inst propagating racism; his trial was not completed by year's end. In the
 Czech Republic, the editor of the anti-Semitic weekly Politika suspended publication
 pending the results of a similar suit filed against him. The Federal and both Repub-
 lic Governments publicly condemned all anti-Semitism.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Legislation in 1990 and 1991 gave workers the right
 to form and join unions of their own choosing without prior authorization. Two-
 thirds of workers are members of labor organizations, though the Czech and Slovak
 Confederation of Trade Unions (CSKOS) reported that union membership fell dur-
 ing the year. Most workers in the CSFR were members of unions affiliated with
 CnOS, a democratically oriented federal umbrella organization, which succeeded
 and assumed the assets of the previously existing Communist labor central. Some
 small independent trade unions not affiliated with CSKOS also exist, including one
 led principally by former Communist trade union officials. CSKOS and other unions
 were entirely independent of the Federal and Republic Governments, as well as
 from political parties or movements.
 Workers had the right to strike, except for those in the following professions:
 judges, prosecutors, members of the armed forces and police, air traffic controllers,
 nuclear power station workers, workers with nuclear materials, and oil or gas pipe-
 line workers. Some limitations on the right to strike of firefighting and rescue work-
 ers, telecommunications workers, and health workers existed. By Federal law
 strikes were illegal unless mediation procedures had been exhausted; mediation and
 arbitration of collective bargaining disputes were mandated for workers not per-
 mitted to strike. Strikes were rare.
 In some Slovak government institutions, there were significant turnovers in per-
 sonnel once the new Government took office in June. Some opposition leaders caim
 that mass dismissals took place for political reasons. However, Slovak trade union
 officials stress that, while the dismissals raise some ethical concerns, they were fully
 within the law. A number of ministries were amalgamated by the new Slovak Gov-
 ernment, causing a reduction in the number of state employees.
 Unions in the CSFR were free to form or join federations and confederations and
 affiliate with and participate in international bodies. This freedom was fully exer-
 cised.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The tripartite system of col-
 lective bar.aining created in 1991, in which union, government, and enterprise offi-
 cials negotiated labor agreements, functioned only until midyear. By the end of the
 summer, the tripartite system collapsed, chiefly because the Federal Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs was eliminated in September as part of the streamlining
 of Federal institutions. Collective bargaining was guaranteed by law, but by the end
 of the year such arrangements were made increasingly ad hoc, in discussion with
 local management and with political leaders at the Republic level. Wages were set
 by free negotiation.
 The Federal Labor Code provided that, when competing unions claimed to rep-
 resent the same group of workers, an employer had the obligation to deal with the
 more representative organization in the workplace. However, the Code provided no
 explicit administrative or other mechanism for making or challengng such a deter-
 mination. Charges of antiunion discrimination could be filed with the Republic's
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which could impose fires against those found
 to have violated the antiunion discrimination prohibition. Victims of such discrimi-
 nation could also institute proceedings in the courts.
 Only one export processing zone existed in the Czech Republic, and its workers
 had the same right to organize and bargain collectively as other workers in the
 CSFR. Two export processing zones in the Slovak Republic, expected to open in
 1992, were delayed until 1993.
 c. Prohibition of forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor was ex-
 pressly prohibited by the Federal Declaration on Basic Rights and Freedoms of
 991. There was no evidence that such vractices occurred.
 
 
 759
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Cenerally, persons had to be 16
 years of age before they could work in the CSFR; however, those 15 years of age
 who had completed elementary school could work. those who had completed courses
 at special schools (that is, schools for those with severe disabilities) could work at
 the age of 14. Workers younger than 16 years of age could work no more than 33
 hours per week. The Offices of Labor Safety of the two Republics enforced these pro-
 visions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Af-
 fairs set minimum wage standards until its dissolution in September. At that time,
 the task as outlined by federal law devolved to the Labor Ministries of the two Re-
 publics. The minimum wage provided an adequate standard of living for an individ-
 ual worker and, when combined with special family allowances paid to families with
 children provided an adequate standard of living for a worker and family. Republic
 Labor Ministries were responsible for enforcement of the minimum wage law. Iso-
 lated claims of underpayment, especially in the rapidly expanding services sector
 could not be substantiated, but Federa and Republic Ministry officials admitted
 that Ministry resources were not sufficient to guarantee that the law was followed
 in all instances.
 A standard workweek of 42  hours was mandated by law although collective
 bargaining agreements brought the norm closer to 40 hours. Federal law required
 paid rest of at least 30 minutes during the standard 8- to 8V-hour workday, as well
 as annual leave of 3 to 4 weeks. Overtime generally could not exceed 150 hours per
 year or 8 hours per week. Republic LaborMinistries responsible for the oversight
 of overtime supervision reported that abuses were possible in the growing private
 sector, but that enforcement was possible in most of the economy.
 The Offices of Labor Safety of the two Republics were responsible for enforcement
 of health and safety standards. Despite efforts by government and union officials to
 advance worker safety and health, conditions, especially in heavy industry, contin-
 ued to suffer from the neglect experienced during years of Communist economic
 planning, and in some cases actually deteriorated.
