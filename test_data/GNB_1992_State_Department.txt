 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau is led by General Joao Bernardo Vicira, who
 serves as Head of State, President of the Council of State, Commander-in-Chief, and
 General Secretary of Guinea-Bissau's previously sole legal political party, the Afri-
 can Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC). In elec-
 tions held in June 1989, Vieira, the only candidate was elected for a second 5-year
 term as President. Effective power and day-to-day aecisions rest in the hands of the
 
 
 President and the Council of State. Growing pressures for political reform resulted
 in the legalization of eight new opposition parties during 1992, bringing the total
 number of parties to 11. A Transitional Multiparty Commission was also established
 to organize presidential and legislative elections for 1993.
 The armed fores (FARP) are responsible for state security, both external and in-
 ternal. Persons accused of political crimes and members of the armed forces are
 tried in military tribunals. Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for
 which the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed anay-
 sis were roughly estimated to be between $1 million and $6 million. There are no
 indications that efforts will be made to reduce these expenditures in the near future.
 The police and internal security forces were respnsible for human rights abuses in
 1992.
 Guinea.Bissau's population of 1 million is engaged largely in subsistence agri-
 culture. There ar some exports of cashews, lumber and fis. Following the Govern-
 ment's failed postindependence efforts to exercise central control over the economyr
 the PAIGC started liberalizing in 1986. The International Monetary Fund and
 World Bank restructuring sgreements led to some improvement in the economic sit-
 uation. However, in 1992 the economy remained weak, as a lack of monetary and
 fiscal control fueled inflationary pressures and eroded purchasing power.
 Although some progress was made, human rights remained circumscribed in 1992.
 Implementation of legislation providing for the formation of opposition parties, free-
 dom of expression, and labor reforms moved forward   . The Government, however,
 continued its practice of arbitrary detentions, physical mistreatment, and other
 forms of harassment, targeting particularly supporters of opposition political parties.
 Police and security forces are rarely tri ed an  sed for a ibuses.
 RESPECT IFOR HUMdAN RIGHTS
 Section I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, in uding Fr'eedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-In September Usumane Quade, a
 military officer, was beaten to death after police detained him on charges of arms
 trafficking. Seven police and security officers were arrested for involvement in
 Quade's death and in October were brought before a military court. The trial had
 not concluded by year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment, and evidence obtained
 through torture or other coercion is invalid. However, these constitutional previsions
 are rarely enforced. Security authorities sometimes employ abusive interrogation
 methods, usually in the form of severe beatings, and are rarely punished (see Sec-
 tion 1.a.). Prison conditions are poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or xile.-The Guinea-Bissau legal system provides
 for procedural rights, such as the right to counsel, the right to be released if charges
 are not brought within a short period of time, and the right to a speedy trial. How-
 ever, the judicial system generally fails to provide adequate protection for these
 rights. Arrests are frequently arbitrary, and the use of arrest warrants is the excep-
 tion rather than the rule. Bail procedures are observed erratically.
 The Government frequently holds persons without charge or trial, sometimes for
 extended periods of time, and occasionally incommunicado. The security services
 continue to have the administrative power to detain suspects without reference to
 judicial authority, often through the device of house arrest. In September the Gov-
 ernment detained without charge and interrogated four soldiers for their role in
 writing a letter to the Minister of Defense protesting poor salaries and living condi-
 tions.
 e . Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas,
 many urban dwellers bring judicial disputes to traditional counselors to avoid
 the costs and hassles associated with the official legal system. With some excep-
 tions, the official judicial system is based on thpode Port model. Because of low
 salaries and a lack of training, judges are sometimes subject to political pressures.
 Defendants have the right to private counsel or may choose to be represented by
 a court-appointed attorney who generally receives no pay. Judges' determination as
 to who is given access to accusatory material and witnesses is frequently arbitrace.
 Trials involving state security are conducted by military tribunals and are usuaty
 not open to outside observers. Members of the armed forces are tried by military
 courts for all offenses. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for both civil-
 ian and military cases, except those involving national security matters. In this in-
 stance the Council of State reviews all decisions.
 
 
 There appear to be no political detainees or prisoners in Guinea-Bissau. Rumors
 have circulated that five persons are or were being kept under house arrest in the
 Bijagos Islands for political reasons, but there is no substantiating evidence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Con-
 stitutional guarantees of the inviolability of domicile, person, and correspondence
 are not always respected.
 International and domestic mail may be subject to surveillance, and police some-
 times enter homes without proper warrants. Membership in the PAIGC, while not
 required, plays a role in government appointments and promotion opportunities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Restrictions remain on freedom of speech and
 press. Freedom of the press was enhanced with the emergence of two private news.
 papers and increased access to television and radio air time. A wide range of public
 opimon was reflected in the media. However, journalists continued to practice some
 self-censorship, at times criticizing only persons who were already known to have
 lost the President's support. On two occasions, citizens' access to radio call-in shows
 discussing political themes was limited by government interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution
 guarantees freedom of assembly and association, governmental approval is required
 for all assemblies and demonstrations. Several opposition parties held legal political
 rallies in 1992, but in at least one case the Government refused to give a permit
 for a demonstration. In February five members of an opposition party were beaten
 and then refused hospital treatment. They had been detained while publicizing a
 planned opposition rally.
 With some difficulty eight new political parties and several professional associa-
 tions with no ties to the PAIGC were legalized. Several of these conducted effective
 nationwide membership campaigns. Police and security forces harassed and intimi-
 dated opposition forces with detentions and physical mistreatment.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Religious freedom is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Christians, Muslims, and animists worship freely, and pros-
 elytizing is permitted. Religious groups must be licensed by the Government, but
 there were no reports of groups being refused licenses in 1992.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are allowed to move freely throughout Guinea-Bissau, al-
 though 1992 saw a slight increase in the number of informal police checkpoints
 along major roads in the capital. Foreign travel is not restricted, nor is citizenship
 revoked for political reasons. Over the past three decades a considerable number of
 persons have emigrated for economic reasons.
 Approximately 5,000 Senegalese refugees who fled into northern Guinea-Bissau in
 1990 and 1991 remain in the area. The Government continued to work with various
 international donors to provide for the basic health and nutritional needs of the ref-
 ugees. No pressure is placed on refugees to return to Senegal; most indicate that
 they intend to remain in Guinea-Bissau indefinitely.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although citizens were not yet free to change the Government, some progress was
 made toward elections planned for 1993. Meanwhile, increasing expectations of po-
 litical liberalization outpaced actual reforms during much of 1992; opposition parties
 vied with the PAIGC to determine who would control the pace of reform, and citi-'
 zens openly debated the attributes of various presidential candidates.
 In August a multiparty commission was appointed, thus providing some hope that
 work could begin on a new electoral code and on plans for a census as precursors
 to voter registration. The first decision of the commission was to postpone elections
 until the first quarter of 1993; the President had previously suggested that the first
 round of legislative elections could be held in November 1992. Opposition leaders
 were harassed (see Section 2.b.), and continued to complain that decisions were
 being made without consultation.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Guinea-Bissau Human Rights League, formed in 1991, continued its criti-
 cisms of the Government, calling for an end to torture and for an improvement of
 prison conditions. The Government neither openly discouraged the league's activities
 nor responded to charges leveled by the group.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 While officially prohibited by law, including the Constitution, discrimination
 against women persists. Within certain ethnic groups, es p ally the Fulas and
 Mandinkas, female genital mutilation (circumcision) is stil a widespread practice
 despite official prohibition and educational campaigns. Women are responsible for
 much of the work on subsistence farms, and they have limited access to education,
 especially in rural areas. While there are some high-ranking women in the Govern-
 ment, and a Ministry for the Advancement of Women exists, governmental authority
 remains overwhelmingly in the hands of men.
 Physical violence, including wife beating, is an accepted means of settling domes-
 tic disputes in all ethnic groups. While police will intervene in domestic disputes if
 requested, the Government has not undertaken specific measures to raise the public
 consciousness of women or to reduce violence against them.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution grants workers the freedom to form
 and join independent trade unions, and legislation approved in late 1991 enumer-
 ates the rights and obligations of new unions. In 1992 two unions disassociated
 themselves from the National Trade Union Confederation (UNTG) and negotiated
 directly with government employers. The UNTG, previously the only labor entity in
 Guinea-Bissau and more of a mass party organization than an independent union,
 made initial steps in late 1992 to reorganize and more effectively represent workers'
 interests through its member unions.
 For most of 1992, as in past years, the UNTG was neither aggressive nor effective
 in promoting worker rights. However, the UNTG did officially support legal strikes
 initiated by teachers and employees of the Port Authority, the municipality of
 Bissau, and the television station. Many groups took advantage of the right to
 strike, including sanitation workers, teachers, and gravediggers. in September sev-
 eral city workers demonstrating for better salaries were beaten by local police. Pub-
 lic employees' complaints over low salaries and poor working conditions led to sev-
 eral cases of arbitrary detention and harassment.
 The UNTG is affiliated with the Communist-dominated World Federation of
 Trade Unions. Unions legally have and do exercise the right to affiliate freely with
 national confederations and international labor organizations of their choice. Guin-
 ea-Bissau unions cultivate contacts with a wide range of labor organizations world-
 wide.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution does not
 provide for nor protect the right to bargain collectively, and in practice there were
 no instances of genuine collective bargaining in 1992. In the small private sector,
 the scarcity of salaried jobs forces employees to focus on obtaining and keeping em-
 ployment and allows employers to st wages. In the public sector, the newness of
 several independent labor unions and internal problems in the UNTG allowed the
 Government to dominate discussions on public workers' salaries. The UNTG and
 two independent unions did, however, successfully engage in several direct salary
 negotiations with government employers in 1992.
 The Government's prevision for the protection of workers against antiunion dis-
 crimination has very little effect in Guinea-Bissau, where membership in labor
 unions is very low. Despite pressure from the International Labor Organization, no
 laws were adopted in 1992 to establish penal sanctions against employers practicing
 such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones in Guinea-Bissau.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 permitted by law and was not known to exist in 1992.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The General Labor Act of 1986 es-
 tablished a minimum age of 14 for general factory labor and 18 for heavy or dan-
 gerous labor, includingall labor in mines. These minimum age requirements are
 generally followed in the small wage sector, but there is minimal enforcement by
 the Ministry of Administrative Reform, Civil Service and Labor in other sectors.
 Children in rural communities do domestic and field work for no pay. The Govern-
 ment does not attempt to discourage this practice and, in fact, delays the opening
 of schools until the rice harvesting season ends.
 c. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legal standards for workers established
 through the cooperation of the Ministry of Administrative Reform, Civil Service, and
 Labor and the UNTG are adopted into law by the National Assembly. However,
 these standards are not enforced in a uniform and comprehensive manner. The max-
 imum number of hours permitted in a normal workweek is 45. Regulations which
 provide the right to compensation for job-related disabilities are not regularly en-
 orced. Although not consistently enforced. a minimum waae is mandated hv the
 
 
 118
 Ministry of Civil Service for government employees. The wage is inadequate to
 maintain even a minimum standard of living, and workers must supplement their
 income through other business, reliance on the extended family, and subsistence ag-
 riculture.
