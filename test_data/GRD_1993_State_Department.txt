 GRENADA
 Grenada has a parliamentary form of government, with a Governor General as
 titular Head of State. When no political party received a clear majority in elections
 held on March 13, 1990, the Governor General appointed Nicholas Brathwaite as
 Prime Minister, who successfully formed a majority Government around National
 Democratic Congress (NDC) parliamentarians. The next elections must be held by
 March 1995.
 The 750-member Royal Grenada Police Force (RGPF) is responsible for maintain-
 ing law and order. It is controlled by and responsive to civilian government authori-
 ties.
 Grenada has a small free market economy based upon agriculture and tourism.
 Over the past several years, economic growth dropped to 3 percent, and the country
 experienced persistent fiscal imbalances. This forced the Government to initiate a
 structural adjustment program in February 1992, aspects of which remained un-
 popular.
 Grenadians enjoy a wide range of civil and political rights. Human rights prob-
 lems included allegations of police brutality in the course of criminal investigations,
 incidents of domestic violence against women, and abuse of children.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance. -There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were no reported incidents
 of torture in 1993. The press occasionally reported individual claims of police brutal-
 ity, some of which arose following the complainants' alleged attempts to resist ar-
 rest. Officers under the supervision of the Police Commissioner investigated a few
 complaints, but no results were released. Claims deemed valid can result in discipli-
 nary action by the Police Commissioner, which can include dismissal from the force.
 No cases of police brutality were brought before the courts in 1993. Claims can also
 be pursued in the courts. The Police Commissioner has spoken out strongly against
 police use of unlawful force.
 A citizen prison visitation committee formed in 1990 to monitor conditions at Gre-
 nada's Richmond Hill Prison, especially in regard to the treatment accorded Bernard
 Coard and accomplices convicted of the 1983 murder of Prime Minister Maurice
 Bishop. It last met in March 1993 and found no evidence of inhuman treatment of
 prisoners. The committee plans no further visits.
 Flogging, a legal form of punishment, is rare but has been used recently in sex
 crime and theft cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-According to law, police have the right
 to detain persons on suspicion without a warrant, but formal charges must be
 brought within 48 hours. This time limit is adhered to in practice. If the detainee
 is not charged within this time, he must be released. In 1993 no one was detained
 for political reasons.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality of detention within
 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge. Formal arraignment or release of the ar-
 restee must be decided within 60 days. These procedures were generally followed.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged with capital offenses
 are not eligible. Persons charged with treason may be accorded bail only upon rec-
 ommendation of the Governor General.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to a fair public trial is provided for by
 law and is observed in practice. There is a presumption of innocence, and individ-
 uals are protected against self-incrimination. Police are required to explain a per-
 son's rights upon arrest, and the accused has the right to remain silent and to seek
 the advice of legal counsel. The lawyer has the right to be present during interroga-
 tion and may advise the accused how to respond or not to respond to questions. An
 accused has the right to confront his accuser.
 Those arrested on criminal charges are brought before an independent judiciary;
 the court will appoint attorneys for indigents only in cases of murder or other cap-
 ital crimes. In other criminal cases that reach the appellate stage, the court wi I
 imilarl appoint a lawyer to represent the accused if he was not previously rep-
 resented or reappoint the defendant's earlier counsel if the appellant can no longer
 afford the lawyer's services. Following a determination by a judicial hearing that
 there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a criminal charge, the defendant is re-
 manded for trial. Due to the backlog of cases caused by a shortage of judges and
 facilities, up to 6 months can pass before those charged with serious offenses are
 brought to trial before the High Court. With the exception of murder and foreign-
 born drug suspects, most defendants are granted bail while awaiting trial.
 Grenada rejoined the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) judicial
 system in 1991. By doing so, the Grenada Supreme Court, which had been insti-
 tuted in 1979 as the highest judicial authority with jurisdiction over Grenadians,
 ceased to exist for that function. It is now the Supreme Court of Grenada and the
 West Indies Associated States. Under the OECS system, appeals may be made to
 the Privy Council in London.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence. -There
 were no reports of these types of arbitrary interference. Judicially issued warrants
 for searching homes are normally required by law except in cases of hot pursuit.
 Other exceptions are contained in the Firearms Act of 1968 and the Drug Abuse
 Prevention Act No. 7 of 1992, which give the police and security units legal author-
 ity to search persons and property without warrants in certain circumstances. In
 practice, warrants are. obtained in the majority of cases before a search is conducted.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for by
 the Constitution and is freely exercised. There are four weekly newspapers and sev-
 eral newspapers which publish irregularly. One is affiliatedwith an opposition politi-
 cal party, but the three most widely circulated newspapers are independent and are
 frequently critical of the Government. The newspapers frequently carry press re-
 leases by the opposition parties, one of which regularly provided a weekly column
 expressing its views.
 Grenada has four radio stations. The main station is part of the Grenadian Broad-
 casting Corporation (GBC), a statutory body not under direct government control.
 Grenaaa's main television station is also part of the GBC. A privately owned tele-
 vision station began broadcasting in 1992, and a cable company began operating in
 the capital area with plans to expand eventually throughout the country. There is
 no formal policy on paid political broadcasts. Throughout 1993, however, the tele-
 vision news often carried reports on opposition activities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Grenadians enjoy the right to
 assemble for any peaceful purpose. Supporters of political parties meet frequently
 and hold public rallies; permits ae required for the use of a public address system
 but not for public meetings themselves.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-All groups enjoy freedom of veligioi. The Roman Catholic
 and Anglican faiths predominate.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is freedom of movement within Grenada, ane all citizens have
 the right to enter and leave the country except int special circumstances as outlined
 in and limited by the 1986 Act to Restrict the Freedom of Movement of Certain Per-
 sons. This law allows the Minister for National Security to restrict travel out of Gre-
 nada by any person whose aims, tendencies, or objectives include the overthrow of
 the democratic and parliamentary system of government; it has not b-en invoked
 in the past few years. Anyone so restricted may appeal after 3 months to an inde-
 pendent and impartial tribunal, presided over by an accredited lawyer chosen by the
 Chief Justice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government
 through free and fair elections to be held at least every 5 years. It provides that
 Parliament sit no longer than 5 years and that elections be called within 3 months
 of its dissolution. Grenadians held national elections in 1984 and 1990. The political
 system is not dominated b-" any particular ethnic group, nor are there any restric-
 tions that limit participation of any elements of the population. Two of the 15 elect-
 ed members of Parliament are women, as well as 2 of the 13 appointed Senators,
 1 of whom is Senate president. Women account for five of the nine permanent sec-
 retaries, the highest civil service position in each Ministry; in addition, a woman
 is the Cabinet secretary, the highest civil service position in Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernr.'.ental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups o crate without government restriction, and the Gov-
 ernment cooperates with visits from international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-There is no evidence of official discrimination in health care, employ-
 ment, or education. Women frequently earn less than men performing the same
 work; such wage differences are less marked for the more higly paid jobs. Knowl-
 edgeable women's rights activists report that violence against women in Grenada is
 common and that most cases of spouse abuse go unreported io police authorities.
 The police confirm that most cases of alleged abuse are not reported and others are
 settled out of court. Grenadian law stipulates a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment
 for a conviction of rape. Sentences for assault against a spouse vary according to
 the severity of the incident.
 The Department of Women's Affairs circulated for review by concerned groups
 throughout the country model legislation on equal opportunity and treatment in em-
 ployment which was proposed by the Caribbean Community Secretariat. The model
 legislation has since been submitted to the Ministry of Legal Affairs for appropriate
 redrefting. The legislation seeks to provide remedies against discrizrination on the
 grounds of sex marital status, and pregnancy in employment, education, and the
 provision of goods, services, and facilite s. It also seeks to confer obligations on
 
 
 spouses to maintain each other and on parents to maintain minor children. In addi-
 tion, the model legislation provides for attachment of earnings in cases where a re-
 spondent fails to comply with a legal maintenance order. The Department of Wom-
 en's Affairs also began a "gender education program" to better the welfare of women
 through economic and self-improvement programs.
 Children.-The Social Welfare Division within the Ministry of Labour provides
 probationary and rehabilitative services to youths; day care services and social work
 programs to families; assistance to families wishing to adopt or foster children; and
 fmancial assistance to the three children's homes in Grenada run by private organi-
 zations. In 1991 the Government passed the "Child is a Child" Act granting equal
 status under the law to children born out of wedlock. This Act is particularly impor-
 tant in cases of inheritance rights following the death of natural fathers.
 In 1992 the Ministry of Education and the Labour Ministry's Office of Social Af-
 fairs, in association with several nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), conducted
 a comprehensive children awareness program which brought to light incidents of
 child abuse in society. Grenadian laws provide for harsh penalties against those con-
 victed of child abuse and, in 1993, the Government passed a law disallowing the
 victim's alleged "consent" as a defense in cases of incest. In October the National
 Coalition on the Rights of the Child, comprised of government ministries and
 NGO's, was formed as part of a regional initiative to implement the U.N. Conven-
 tion on the Rights of the Child.
 People with Disabilities.-Job-seekers with disabilities are discriminated against,
 except for those with unique and marketable skills. The National Council for the
 Disabled, which receives a small amount of financial assistance from the Govern-
 ment, was instrumental in placing visually impaired students into community
 schools, which in some cases previously were reluctant to accept them. There are
 no accessibility ramps into public buildings for persons using wheelchairs. The
 Council has lobbied Government to pass a law requiring such access, and the Gov-
 ernment is studying draft legislation to that effect. The Grenada Society of the Blind
 sponsors a retail outlet for wicker and handicraft items produced by disabled indi-
 viduals.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers are free to organize independent labor
 unions. Labor Ministry officials estimate the percentage of the work force that is
 unionized to be between 20 and 25 percent. Union leaders play a significant role
 in the political process, and one labor leader serves in the Senate.
 While workers in the private sector are free to strike at will, workers in the public
 sector must give advance notice. There were several incidents of industrial action
 including strikes in 1993, but all were short-lived and settled with the intervention
 of the Ministry of Labour. All unions were free of government control, and none was
 given government financial support. All the major unions in Grenada belong to one
 umbrella labor federation, the Grenada Trades Union Council (GTUC), which holds
 annual conventions and determines some policies for member unions. The GTUC
 and its unions freely affiliate with regional and international trade union groups.
 b. The Ri.vht to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free to organize
 and to participate in collective bargaining. Legislation compels employers to recog-
 nize a union that represents the majority of workers in a particular business. The
 law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members and or-
 ganizers. If a complaint of discrimination arises, mechanisms exist for attempting
 to resolve it. After all avenues for resolving a complaint have been exhausted be-
 tween union representatives and employers, both sides may agree to ask for the as-
 sistance of the Labour Commissioner. If the Labour Commissioner is unable to find
 a resolution to the impasse, the Minister of Labour may appoint an arbitration tri-
 bunal if both parties agree to abide by its ruling. While employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to rehire dismissed employees, in most cases
 the employee accepts the option of compensation rather than return to work, citing
 possible further problems with the employer. No such cases took place in 1993, how-
 ever.
 Unions may organize and bargain anywhere in the country, including in the one
 export processing zone (EPZ), which is not exempted from Grenada's labor legisla-
 tion. However, no EPZ firm is presently unionized; the one firm previously union-
 ized has since shut down its Grenada-based operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and no such instances were reported in 1993.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children, 16 years, is enforced in the formal sector by periodic checks
 
 
 448
 made by inspectors from the Ministry of Labour. Enforcement efforts in the informal
 sector are lax.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislated minimum daily wage rates, most re-
 cently revised in 1990, are set for the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sec-
 tors. Minimum wages for workers vary according to profession; for farm laborers it
 is $4.80-5.20 (EC$13-14) per day and $31.50 (EC$85) per day for masons. Hotel
 worker wages vary from $148-259 (EC$400-700) per month for housekeepers to
 $444-556 (EC$1,200-1,500) per month for administrators. Most workers, including
 nonunionized ones, receive other benefits from their employers through the collec-
 tive bargaining agreements reached with that firm's unionized workers, but even
 when these benefits are added to wages from a full-time minimum wage job, it is
 barely enough to provide a decent standard of living. The law does not prescribe a
 set number of hours as the standard workweek, except for the public sector which
 is expected to work a 40-hour week Monday through Friday. However, the normal
 workweek in all sectors seldom exceeds 40 hours, although in the commercial sector
 this includes Saturday morning work. Health and safety standards set by the
 Governmentare minimal and not effectively enforced. Laws on working conditions
 and their enforcement apply equally to the EPZ.
