 CROATIA
 The Republic of Croatia is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a pow-
 erful presidency. President Franjo TudJman, elected in 1992 for a 5-year term,
 serves as head of state and commander of the armed forces. He chairs the influen-
 tial National Defense and Security Council and appoints the Prime Minister who
 leads the Government. President Tud*man's party, the Croatian Democratic Union
 (HDZ), holds the mjority of seats in both houses of Parliament and has ruled since
 independence in 1991. Government influence weakens the nominally independent
 judiciary. The enormous constitutional -powers of the presidency, the overwhelming
 dominance of one political party, and the continuing concentration of power within
 the central Government tend to stifle the expression of diverse views.
 The Ministry of Interior oversees the police, and the Ministry of Defense oversees
 the armed forces. Civilian police have no authority over military police or over uni-
 formed military personnel. The national police have primary responsibility for inter-
 nal security but, in times of disorder, the Government may call on the army to pro-
 vide security. Both the police and army are responsible for external security. While
 civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of the professional security
 forces, members of the police and armed forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is slowly changing to a market-based free enterprise system. Agri-
 culture is mostly in private hands. Family-owned small enterprises are multiplying,
 but industry is still largely state-owned. Although the Government maintained a
 strict austerity budget, inflation began to creep upward, which eroded a standard
 of living already much diminished due to the civil conflict.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor. It continued to commit or
 allow serious abuses, in particular with regard to the treatment of ethnic Serbs from
 the reclaimed areas (former sectors north, south, and west), most of whom fled to
 Serbia-Montenegro or Bosnia and Herzegovina. Military and police forces were re-
 spnsible for forced evictions and also allowed Croatian refugees to evict ethnic
 Serbs. Ethnic Serbs were largely denied the right to return to their homes in the
 reclaimed areas, and the Government was slow in reestablishing adequate civil au-
 thority in these regions. Police were unwilling or unable to take effective action
 against criminal activity directed against ethnic Serbs. Murders, looting, and,
 threats continued, although in lesser numbers than last year, and the Government
 did not make sufficient efforts to seek out, investigate, and punish those responsible
 for such abuses. Many cases of abuse from 1995, the victims of which were almost
 exclusively ethnic Serbs, also remain unresolved. Key provisions of the Law on Na-
 tional Minorities remained suspended during the year, and the Government sought
 to legalize and institutionalize the population changes resulting from its armed
 offensives of 1995, rather than engage in confidence-building measures that would
 welcome back Serb refugees. The Government infringed on press freedom and used
 the courts and administrative bodies to restrain or shut down newspapers, radio
 stations, and television programs that criticized it. The Government amended the
 Criminal Code, making it a crime to insult high government officials in the press.
 Government intimidation induced self-censorship by journalists. The judicial system
 is subject to executive influence and denies citizens fair trials. The Government par-
 tially limited the right of citizens to freely change their government. It used manip-
 ulation of laws, intimidation, harassment, control of the media, and economic pres-
 sure to control the political process. It occasionally harassed local human rights
 monitors. Societal discrimination against ethnic Serbs and other ethnic minorities
 and discrimination and domestic violence against women are problems.
 Croatia normalized relations with neighboring Serbia-Montenegro on August 23,
 which paved the way for passage in September of a comprehensive general amnesty
 for ethic Serbs who fought on the side of the Serb Rpublic of Krajina ("RSK")
 against Croatia during the previous 4 years. However, the Government allowed only
 several thousand of the approximately 180,000 Serbs who fled the Croatian military
 action in 1995 to return in 1996. Although precise figures vary, the office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees       CR estimates that approxi-
 
 
 mately 50,000 to 60,000 Croatian Serb displaced persons fled to the last remaining
 Serb enclave in Eastern Slavonia.
 With the cessation of hostilities and signing of the Basic Agreement between the
 Government and the Eastern Slavonia Serbi, the United Nations established the
 U.N. Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) on January 15 to
 supervise the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia into Croatia. A U.N.-ap-
 pointed transitional administrator had complete authority over affairs of the terri-
 tory, which was effectively outside of Croatian government control through the year.
 The region was demilitarized by mid-summer, and elections for local officials are ex-
 pected to be held sometime in the first half of 1997. UNTAES established the Tran-
 sitional Police Force (TPF), in which Serb and Croat police jointly patrolled the re-
 gion. By year's end, however, only a small number of Croats were integrated into
 the force. Although this force was supervised by a U.N. civilian police contingent,
 there were at times questions about the TPF's equal treatment of ethnic minorities.
 As a signatory of the Dayton Accords, Croatia is obliged to cooperate fully with
 the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia by turning over to
 the Tribunal persons on its territory who were indicted for war crimes. Croatia's co-
 operation with the Tribunal was uneven. It arranged for the surrender of Gen.
 Tihomir Blaskic but it has not yet turned over another indictee in Croatian custody
 Zlatko Aleksovski, and reports persisted that other persons indicted by the Tribuna
 were living or travelling in Croatia.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. There were however, several reports of ethnically moti-
 vated killings by unknown persons in the parts of Croatia reclaimed by the Govern-
 ments "Operation Storm" in August 199 . The vast majority of those killed were
 ethnic Serbs. The murders, although far fewer in number than in 1995, continue
 a pattern begun in the fall of that year of ethnically motivated killings carried out
 to intimidate Serbs who stayed behind after Croatia reclaimed these areas and dis-
 courage those Serbs who fled from returning. The authorities have made only a few
 arrests in these cases and attempts to seek out, investigate, and punish those re-
 sponsible for such murders have been inadequate.
 For example, an elderly Serb couple was murdered on February 29 in Plitvice, in
 former Seri-controlled territory, and their house destroyed by arson. In August re-
 tired Serb General Milorad Miscevic was killed when a bomb exploded in the court-
 yard of his house near Gospic, also part of former Serb-occupied territory. The Cro-
 atian Helsinki Committee called the event "a murderous and terrorist" act. In Sep-
 tember a married couple of mixed nationality, one Serb and one Croat, was mur-
 dered in Bukovica, and their house destroyed by arson. There have been no arrests
 to date in any of these cases.
 Six individuals charged with the August 1995 murders of 16 elderly Serbs in
 Varivode and Gasici (both near Knin) in the wake of Operation Storm were a'cquit-
 ted in July. A seventh man, Ivica Petrie, was sentenced to 6 years in prison for mur-
 dering a Serb civilian at Zrma la village, while an eighth man, Nikola Rasic, was
 sentenced to 18 months in jailfor armed robbery and attempted murder of a Serb
 woman in Ocestovo near Knin. Despite provision of information by U.N. personnel
 on the Grubori murders in 1995, police still have made no progress on solving the
 crime.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 As of mid-November, government figures showed 2,534 citizens still missing in
 cases unresolved from the 1991-92 war and the 1995 military actions. The Govern-
 ment estimates that about 1,250 of those people are from Vukovar, while about 500
 are thought by the Government to be buried in the formerly Serb-held areas of Cro-
 atia known as the Krajina (former sectors north and south). Steady, albeit slow,
 progress was made throughout the year in removing names from the list of those
 missing as a result of identification of corpses exhumed in the Krajina region and
 Eastern and Western Slavonia.
 Exhumations from the mass grave at Ovcara, completed by the International
 Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) under the protection of
 UNTAES, unearthed the remains of 200 people who had been missing since they
 were taken from Vukovar hospital by rebel Serbs in November 1991. Exhumations
 were conducted in some 20 villages around Petrinja, and in Pridraga, Islam Grki,
 Smilcic, and Novigrad. In the village of Skabrnja in southern Croatia, 27 bodies
 were recovered from a mass grave where 60 civilians and 20 Croatian combatants
 were killed in the summer of 1991.
 
 
 895
 Some progress was also made in efforts to exchange information on missing per-
 sons between Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia. On April 17 the two Governments
 signed a protocol on c  ration between their respective commissions on missing
 persons. All prisoners held by either psrty or in an area under their influence were
 to be immediately released, and all information exchanged. However, cooperation
 between the commissions was often stymied for political reasons. As part of the nor-
 meaization of relations agement signed by Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia on Au-
 gust 23, bth sides areed to resolve without delay the issue of missing persons. The
 International Commision on Missing Persons (ICMP) was established with the goal
 of raising the level of discussion between Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia and
 Herzegovina, and Croatia and bringing political pressure to bear on all parties in
 order to increase cooperation in resolvin cases of persons who were missin or had
 disappeared. After biing registered by the Red Cross as a prisoner of war in 1992,
 Croatian pilot Vladimir Sumanovac disappeared in December 1993. He was "found"
 and released in May.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel or degrading punishment, and there
 were no reports that officials employed such practices.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 rmits visits by human rights monitors. Jails are crowded, but not to excess, and
 aiyvits and access toIounsel are generally available. Rebel Serb detainees
 interviewed by international monitors reprted good treatment, although some as-
 sorted that they were treated less favorably than common criminals. Prisons and
 detainees in Eastern Slavonia were monitored under the auspices of UNTAES.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution contains provisions to
 protect the legal rights of all accused persons, but the Government does not always
 respect these rights in practice. Two new amnesty laws offered a framework under
 which some progress was made in resolving cases of arbitrary arrest and detention
 dat*n back as far as 1991. The first amnesty law, passed in May, covered only the
 Ia ic geographic area of Eastern Slavonia and had numerous exceptions. Despite
 tese weaknesses, however, 282 persons were amnestied under this legislation. The
 second country-wide general amnesty adopted in September incorporated many
 UNTAES recommendations. Under this amnesty, persons charged, arrested, or con-
 victed in connection with the armed rebellion on the territory of Croatia were to
 have their cases reviewed. Those in custody determined eligible for amnesty were
 to be freed, while those who had been charged or convicted in absentia were to have
 all criminal proceedings against them canceled. Only war crimes (as determined b
 internationalcnvention) and common crimes not connected with the armed rebe?-
 lion were exempted. By October 95 persons had been released from detention facili-
 ties across the country under this second amnesty, according to government figures.
 Of this number, 26 were charged again for war crimes ("crimes against civilian pop-
 ulations'). By year's end, lawyers involved with the cases claimed that, in at least
 some instances, no new evidence had been provided and that the Serbs had essen-
 tially been charged with reworded versions of the same crimes for which they had
 been amnestied; in effect double jeopardy in their view and a contradiction of the
 spirit, if not the letter, of the amnesty law. Among the persons amnestied were 15
 Serb arrested in 1995 on charges of espionage, including the prominent Croatian
 Serb judge, Radovan Jovic.
 Police normally seek arrest warrants by presenting evidence of probable cause to
 an investigative magistrate. Police may carry out arrests without a warrant if they
 believe suspects might flee, destroy evidence, or commit other crimes. Such cases
 are not uncommon. The police then have 24 hours in which to justify their decision
 before the local investigative magistrate.
 After arrest, the law states that persons must be given access to an attorney of
 their choice within 24 hours; if they have no attorney, and are charged with a crime
 for which the sentence is over 10 years' imprisonment, the investigative magistrate
 will appoint counsel from a list of public defenders. If the potential sentence is
 under 10 years, detainees can request court-appointed counsel if they so choose. The
 court will appoint counsel after charges are levied for the trial. The investigative
 judge must, within 48 hours of the arrest, decide whether sufficient cause exists to
 hold a person in custody pending further investigation. The judge must justify the
 decision in writing, including the length of detention ordered, which may not be
 longer than 1 month without review. The review by the county court may extend
 the period another 2 months if necessary. The usual period of investigative deten-
 tion varies from a few days to a few weeks, but the Supreme Court may grant the
 State an additional 3 months for a total of not more than 6 months of pretrial deten-
 tion in exceptional cases. These decisions may be appealed, either immediately or
 later in the detention period. Once the investigation is complete, detainees are usu-
 
 
 896
 ally released on their own recognizance pending trial, unless the crime is a major
 offense, the accused are considered a public danger, or the court believes that they
 may flee.
 However, those persons held under investigative detention are often denied the
 right to have an attorney present whenever they wish during the investigative stage
 and during an appeal of investigative detention. In practice detainees are almosta-
 ways bound over for investigation unless it is clear that no case exists against them.
 There are provisions for posting bail after charges are brought, but the practice is
 not common. Police will sometimes retain the passports of those released pending
 trial to prevent them from leaving the country.
 With the cessation of hostilities and the establishment of UNTAES, the situation
 in Eastern Slavonia improved. UNTAti established the Transitional Police Force
 (TPF) in July, with joint Cratian-Serb patrols and international supervision of po-
 lice activity.
 The Red Crs estimated that approximately 120-130 ethnic Serbs were still in
 detention for acts related to the conflicts in 1995.
 The Constitution pfrohibits the exile of Croatian citizens. However, Croatian Serbs
 who fled during the last 5 years have found themselves effectively exiled from Cro-
 aia. The Government's inability to create secure conditions in the formerly occupied
 regions and its slow pace in issuing identity papers to Serbs in Eastern Slavonia
 and abroad have combined to leave almost 180,000 ethnic Serb former citizens of
 Croatia effectively without citizenship. In December, however, substantial progress
 was made in talks between the U.N. Transitional Administration and the Govern-
 ment to establish a framework for expedited issuance of Croatian documents in
 preparation for the March elections.
 Some 30,000 non-Croats (mostly Serbs) have applied to return from Serbia-
 Montenegro, but to date only approximately 1,000 to 1,500 have, in fact, been able
 to do so. Ethnic Muslims and Serbs who are currently living in Croatia have also
 been denied citizenship or residency permits, regardless of their previous residence,
 and are subject to exclusion and even deportation from Croatia (see Section 5).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Government influence weakens the nominally
 independent judiciary.
 The judicial system  onsists of municipal and district ourts, a Constitutional
 Court, a Supreme Court, an Administrative Court, and a State Judicial Council. A
 parallel commercial court system handles all commercial and contractual disputes.
 The State Judicial Council (with a president and 14 members from all parts of the
 legal community) appoints judges and public prosecutors. The upper house of Par-
 liament nominates persons for membership on the State Judicial Council, and the
 lower house elects members to 8-year terms. The 11 judges of the Constitutional
 Court are elected to 8.year terms in the same manner.
 The Provisional Court for Human Rights called for under the 1992 Constitutional
 Law on Minorities was never created. The Government cited a possible clash of ju-
 risdiction between this court and the European Court of Human Rights because of
 Croatia's accession in November to the Council of Europe. In November the Par-
 liament abolished the military court system which had functioned throughout the
 war. However, these military courts are to continue to function until all cases under
 way are resolved.
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial  a variety of
 due process rights in bth civilian and military courts, in practice the prosecuting
 attorney has leeway in deciding whether to bring a case against an individual. Fur-
 ther, in cases considered *political", both the indictment and the conduct of trials
 are sometimes subject to outside influence. For example, in May charges were
 brought against the editor and one journalist of the satirical weekly, Feral Triune,
 for articles that allegedly impugned the honor and dignity of the President (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.). The pubic prosecutor initiated charges on his own authority (with the
 consent of the President) and, when the journalists were acquitted, appealed the ac-
 quittal.
 Nor is the judicial process free of ethnic bias. Numerous cases throughout the
 year dealing with residency and property claims were arbitrarily decided against
 ethnic Serbs and Muslims, often with litte or no explanation for the decision. For
 example, in one extended ethnic Muslim family (resident in Croatia for 19 years)
 which applied for Croatian citizenship, the father and two of his siblings had their
 requests granted; a third sibling was granted permanent residency; while the two
 adult children were both denied legal status and face deportation (see Section 5).
 Following the general amnesty in September, there were repeated credible allega-
 tions that the Government rearrested several amnestied Serbs and charged them
 with war crimes, despite the lack of new evidence (see Section 1.d.).
 
 
 897
 The judicial system in Eastern Slavonia was put under the control of the U.N.
 ransitional Administrator in the summer. Although the local Serb entity continued
 to function with the same personnel and systems as previously, UNTAES asserted
 the right to review all cases and rescind or revise judgments as necessary.
 There were no reports that the Government held political prisoners. At least one
 Croat was still being held as a political prisoner by Serb authorities in Eastern
 Slavonia.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution declares the home inviolable. Only a court may issue a search warrant,
 stating the justification for the search of a home or other premises. Police may enter
 a home without a warrant or the owner's consent only if necessary to enforce an
 arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent serious danger to life or important
 property. In practice the authorities generally complied with these norms although
 there were some notable exceptions. F or example, in October an ethnic Serb Mem-
 ber of Parliament alleged that  lice searched his apartment and interrogated his
 wife without any warrant or stated cause.
 The incidence of looting in the former sectors, while lower than last year, re-
 mained substantial. International organizations such as the European Community
 Monitoring Mission (ECMM) noted at least several incidents per week of looting
 robbery, and intimidation, particularly in the Krajina. Indigenous nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's) claimed that the treatment of the small Serb populations in
 the Krajina region actually deteriorated with the normalization of relations between
 Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro in September. With the notable exception of Pakrac
 (former sector west), police in the formerly Serb-held areas were often ineffective in
 either responding to incidents or in resolving cases where the victim was an ethnic
 Serb. According to a report issued by the Government in June, numerous judicial
 proceedings have been initiated to prosecute crimes committed again3t the indige-
 nous Serb population after the military actions in 1995. However, the U.N. Special
 Rapporteur for Human Rights pointed out that, of those cases opned, a large num-
 ber were for charges such as embezzlement and endangering tric safety. In addi-
 tion, a significant number of the cases were undertaken against Serbs for rebellion
 or war crimes.
 Military and civil police continued to carry out forced evictions, involving numer-
 ous families of all nationalities. Croatian refugees, with at least the appearance of
 official countenance, forcibly entered the homes of ethnic Serbs and other minorities
 who had lived for years in family apartments, but who were themselves not listed
 as the official tenant. Although such evictions were often declared illegal in court,
 the authorities forbade the police to remove the intruders on the basis of a law re-
 quiring that a new home be found for a displaced or refugee family before it can
 be removed from any form of housing, whether legally occupied or not.
 Forced evictions of ethnic Serbs, Croats and others from former Yugoslav Na-
 tional Army (JNA) apartments continued throughout the year. The Ministry of De-
 fense arbitrarily revoked the tenancy rights of individuals who had lived in apart-
 ments for decades, and soldiers frequently took residences by force of arms, either
 evicting current tenants or forcing them to share quarters. They justified their ac-
 tions on the basis of property laws that remove tenancy rights as a result of any
 6-month absence or if the tenant was ruled to "have acted against the interests of
 the Republic of Croatia." The courts increasingly used this legislation to deny ten-
 ancy rights to former JNA members, whether they had actually participated in ac-
 tivities against Croatia or not. Membership in the JNA at any time was deemed suf-
 ficient to brand them as "enemies of the state." Often court action was initiated to
 terminate tenancy rights when the tenant sought to purchase the residence under
 the rules for privatization ado pted in 1995. In a positive development, the Constitu-
 tional Court in November abolished Articles 70 and 94 of the Law on Housing Rela-
 tions, removing the right of administrative housing councils to evict tenants and re-
 serving that right exclusively for the courts.
 The Constitution provides for the secrecy and safety of personal data, but it was
 unclear if such provisions were observed in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of
 thought and expression, specifically including freedom of the press and other media
 of communication, speech and public expression, and free establishment of institu-
 tions of public communication. In practie, governm en       ence on the media
 through state ownership of most print and broadcast outlets limits these freedoms.
 Government intimidation through the courts and other means also induces self-cen-
 srship. Journalists were increasingly reluctant to criticize the Government in pub-
 lic forums for fear of harassment, job loss, intimidation, criminal prosecution, or
 
 
 898
 being branded as disloyal. A campaign of harassment of the independent media con-
 tinu-d throughout the year.
 After much delay, Parliament passed in October a comprehensive Law on Public
 Information to regulate the media. This law was adopted with input from both local
 and international organizations and had the general support of all parties. A con-
 troversial article requiring publishers to purchase mandatory insurance in case of
 libel suits (the expense of which would have effectively shut down many small publi-
 cations) was removed after pressure from the Council of Europe.
 More problematic were the amendments to the Penal Code adopted by the Par-
 liament in March authorizing criminal prosecution of journalists who insult the
 honor or dignity of the President, Supreme Court judges, or parliamentary figures
 and also of those who publish "state secrets." The law was used to suppress system-
 atically several independent publications including the satirical weekly Feral Trib-
 une, the independent daily Novi List, and the week y Nacional. While Feral Tribune
 was eventuall      itted in September of slandering the President, the state pros-
 ecutor      aledthe  acquittal. In addition, charges under yet another statute,
 brought by the ruling HDZ party are still pending against Nacional and Novi List,
 beth charged with damaging the honor and reputation of the HDZ party.
 In addition to legal action against unfriendly media coverag, the Government fre-
 quently used administrative means to control the media. Radio 101, the best known
 and one of last remaining independent radio stations, lost its broadcast license after
 a costly legal battle with administrative authorities in which the State Broadcasting
 Council reallocated its frequency to those more favorably inclined towards the Gov-
 ernment. After extensive public criticism, including two mass demonstrations in Za-
 greb in which tens of thousands of persons took part, the new owners of the fre-
 quency declined to accept it, and the Council announced that it would reconsider
 the issue. Radio 101 remained on the air with a temporary license pending final res-
 olution of the issue. Another radio station, Radio North-Northwest in Varazdin lost
 its frequency in September. This station was similar in style to Radio 101, but
 lacked the outside attention the latter received. In April the newspaper Novi List
 was ordered to pay a $2.5 million fine for allegedly using printing equipment im-
 ported tax and duty free for the sole use of the Italian-language press. The fine was
 suspended in May by the Ministry of Finance, although technically it is still out-
 standing against the paper. Also in April, the financial police raided the offices of
 the independent weeyPanor, cha          g the newspaper with violations of "eco-
 logical standards." The newspaper wassut down for a month and reopened in May
 only after substantial international criticism. The popular television news program
 "Slikom na Sliku" (frame by frame) was taken off state-run television station HTV
 without explanation in July, soon after its coverage of the Feral Tribune trial.
 Government influence over the distribution network for print media, coupled with
 stiff value added taxes levied at several points during the production process also
 has an impact on press freedom. Certain independent newspapers an magazines
 claim that they must pay out more than 50 percent of their gross revenues for taxes
 and distribution costa alone. While the high circulation of some popular independent
 journals such as Globus has given them enough financial independence to survive
 despite these high taxes and high costs, other journals would likely shut down with-
 out support from international organizations like the Sors Foundation.
 Foreign papers and journals were available throughout Croatia, including Serbian
 periodicals which subscribers continued to receive by mail.
 Both public and private radio and television broadcasting coexist, although the
 Government controls all national broadcasting. Opposition figures and human rights
 activists uniformly  charge that state-owned media outlets have       a  strong
 progevernment bias. Regulations governing access to the state-owned broadcast
 media restrict the ability of opposition parties to criticize government policies (see
 Section 3). Croatian state radio-television (HRT), broadcasts on three national tele-
 vision channels and three national radio channels. Technically under the super-
 vision of the Parliament, HRT is in practice run by the ruling HDZ party, and its
 head has a seat on the National Security Council. HRT has its headquarters in Za-
 greb and also has radio and television studios in the country's major provincial
 cities. Its regional television studios broadcast 2 hour of local news daily; its re-
 gional radio stations offer more extensive local progaming. Private local television
 stations operate in most major Croatian cities, and private local radio stations exist
 throughout the country, in cities large and small. However, these local outlets large-
 ly lac their own news and public    airs programs; most repeat HRTs news, while
 some also rebroadcast the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion.
 In the U.N.-administered region of Eastern Slavonia, the local Serb authorities
 control a radio and television station in the town of Beli Manastir and a radio sta-
 
 
 tion in the city of Vukovar. There is no private broadcasting or local press in this
 region. UNTAES broadcasts a daily program over the Vukovar radio station. In this
 area (as elsewhere in Eastern Croatia) people receive radio and television broad-
 casts from neighboring Serbia; Serbian publications also circulate freely in the re-
 gion.
 While academic freedom is generally respected, some ethnic Serb professors and
 intellectuals have reported increasing pressure within academia to conform with the
 norms and opinions of the ru   HDZ party.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides that
 all citizens have the right to peaceful assembly and association for the protection
 of their interests or the promotion of social, economic, political, national, cultural,
 and other objectives, and the Government respects these provisions in practice.
 There were demonstrations during the year in severai major cities, often related
 to the desire of internally displaced persons to return to their homes or to labor dis-
 putes (see Section 6.a.). In November two peaceful mass rallies were held in support
 of the best known and one of the last remaining independent radio station when
 the State Broadcasting Council awarded its* frequency to a competitor (see Section
 2.a.). In the area under UNTAES control, there were a number of demonstrations.
 Demonstrators in Baranja and also in Vukovar expressed their interest in autonomy
 and other grievances.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of conscience and
 religion and free public profession of religious convictions, and the Government re-
 spects these rights in practice. There is no state religion. All religious communities
 are free to conduct public services and to open and run social and charitable institu-
 tions. Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Islam are the major
 faiths in Croatia, and there is also a small, though active, Jewish community. The
 majority of Croats are Roman Catholic, and the Government provides optional
 Catholic religious training in schools.
 There are no formal restrictions on religious groups. The main mosque is in Za-
 grb where it serves not only as a religious center but also as a social aid office
 or ihe large Bosnian Muslim refugee population. Croatian Protestants from a num-
 ber of denominations as well as foreign clergy, actively practice and proselytize, as
 do representatives of eastern-based religions. Some foreign religious organizations
 seeking to provide social services reported bureaucratic obstacles to their establish-
 ment, but it was unclear if this had any connection with their religious character.
 A health care center in the main mosque in Zagreb was closed by Ministry of
 Health officials in September. The official reason given was that all health-related
 activity should be conducted only under the auspices of the Ministry, although other
 private clinics continued to operate.
 Most Catholic churches in the formerly Serb-held areas were destroyed. In East-
 ern Slavonia, only one active Croatian Catholic priest remains.
 The Government discriminates against Muslims in the issuance of citizenship doc-
 uments. The Interior Ministry frequently uses Article 26 of the Law on Citizenship
 to deny citizenship papers to persons otherwise qualified to be citizens (see Section
 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution generally provides for these rights, with certain re-
 strictions. All persons legally in the country must register their residence with the
 local authorities. Under exceptional circumstances, the Government may legally re-
 strict the right to enter or leave the country if necessary to protect the "legal order,
 health, rights or freedoms of others."
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. De-
 spite the absence of domestic implementing legislation, relevant U.N. acts in the ref-
 ugee field have in practice been observed. The UNHCR estimates that the Govern-
 ment was providing first asylum to approximately 170,000 people from various parts
 of the former Yugoslavia as of August, and the Government stated that it was finan-
 cially supporting another 160,000 internally displaced persons. The Government has
 resettle some of the refugees, almost exclusively ethnic Croats, but has stated that
 Bosnian Croat refugees from 'safe," Federation-held portions of Bosnia as well as
 Bosnian Muslim refugees (some 43,000) must return home and has removed their
 refugee status.
 The Government continued to relocate refugees from coastal tourist facilities to
 inland areas in an effort to rehabilitate those facilities for the slowly reviving tourist
 trade. The Kupljensko refugee camp was officially closed in August, its inhabitants
 either repatriated to Bosnia, transferred to other sites in Croatia, or resettled in
 third countries. There was one significant incident of forced return of refugees to
 Bosnia and Herzegovina in February, when 46 Bosnian Muslim refugees were fore-
 
 
 ibly repatriated to the Bihac area after the Government arrested them on charges
 of Lack market activities in the Kupjensko camp.
 Serbs who fled the military operations in 1995 found their right to travel freely,
 particularly to the former sectors, difficult and at times impossible to exercise. Inci-
 dents of intimidation and beatings by local Croats of ethnic Serbs who attempted
 to visit their former homes were common and frequently went uninvestigated and
 unpunished. The Government actively encouraged the resettlement of Bosnian Croat
 refugees in the Krajina, further complicating any eventual return by the former
 Serb residents. Although reports vary, by some estimates as many as 55,000 Croats
 had been housed there by November. In Eastern Slavonia, all access was strictly
 controlled by UNTAES, with neither Serbs nor Croats moving freely across the
 boundaries of the sector without U.N. approval or escort.
 The process of Serb return progressed only slowly during the year. While the Gov-
 ernment was publicly committed to the return of all persons to their homes, regard-
 less of ethnicity, in practice it did not fulfill this commitment. Between 20,000 and
 30,000 Serbs iled applications to return, based almost exclusively on the principle
 of family reunification, and over 12,000 of these requests had been granted by Au-
 gust. The UNHCR estimated that 61 percent of those applications approved were
 for persons over the age of 60. The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human
 Ri      estimated that as many as 3,000 Serbs had actually returned to Croatia, and
 that the majority of these had joined family members who were living outside of the
 former occupied areas. There were no group returns of Serbs to Croatia (see Section
 3). On November 1, UNTAES opened the five villages south of the Bosut river in
 the U.N.-administered area to unlimited Croatian return. This affected up to 10,000
 former residents of the region.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government partially limited the right of citizens to change their govern-
 ment. Croatia is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens 18 years of age and
 older have the right to vote by secret ballot. The President, elected for 5 years, exer-
 cises substantial power, authority, and influence but is constitutionally limited to
 two terms. Parliament comprises the House of Representatives and the House of
 Counties (Zupanije). The Croatian Democratic Union holds a majo       in both
 houses and President Franjo Tudiman was reelected in 1992. The Cabinet is a one-
 party (HDZ) body. According to law, presidential elections must be held in mid-
 summer 1997, and elections for all local governing bodies as well as the House of
 Counties must be held no later than the spring of 1997.
 Presidential powers include approving the mayor of Zagreb, who is elected by the
 city assembly. Opposition parties won control of the Zagreb city assembly in fall
 1995 local elections. President Tudjman had refused to confirm four mayoral can-
 didates by year's end, and the opposition parties in late 1996 began a boycott of the
 city assembly in protest. In November opposition Members of Parliament staged a
 30-day walkout from Parliament to protest the HDZ decision not to debate the Za-
 greb situation in Parliament. Neither the boycott nor the walkout proved successful,
 and in December the opposition city assembly members submitted their resigna-
 tions. However, further splits among the opposition parties led to the increased like-
 lihood that new elections could be held in order to resolve the issue.
 The  Zagreb City Council crisis," as it came to be known, was a visible example
 of the ruling party's manipulation of politics. In addition to liberal interpretation
 and implementation of laws to suit the Government's agenda, the ruling party used
 intimidation and harassment as well as control of the media and government, to
 control the political process. Economic pressure was one of the most effective tools,
 and government agencies selectively issued or denied permits for businesses based
 on political affiliation. In at least a dozen towns and cities where the ruling party
 was not in power, it allegedly managed to coopt the local leader into joining the
 HDZ.
 The HDZ used its control of Parliament to push through legislative changes that
 favored it. In addition to changes in the election law made in 1995, in July addi-
 tional amendments were passed, which included changing the ratio of proportionally
 to directly elected seats from 2/3:1/3 to 3/4:1/4. (The last local elections were held
 with a 50:50 ratio; 1995 changes to the law put the ratio at 23:1/3.) The July
 amendments allow a party to put someone's name on its list as its "bearer" even
 if that person was not a candidate on the list. Also in July, the Parliament began
 discussions on redistricting which, if' legislation is passed, could inhibit minority
 parties from achieving a 5 percent threshold. Changes to the electoral law were
 often done in "emergency parliamentary sessions" and pushed through hastily, with
 little debate.
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 Rules for access to state-owned electronic media restricted the ability of opposition
 parties to criticize government policies and activities and limited their ability to
 fully engage the Government in an open political dialog(see Section 2.a.).
 The   Government   maintained  rigid  policies  throughout the  year  that
 disenfranchised the Croatian Serb ppulation. A nationwide census scheduled for
 April was not held. Consequently, Articles 21 and 22 (and all other relevant articles)
 of the 1992 Constitutional Law on Human Right and Freedoms, rescinded in 1995,
 remained suspended throughout the year. These laws had established self-governing
 special status districts in areas where minorities made up more than 50 percent of
 the population, namely municipalities in the Knin and Glina regions. This repeal
 of the special districts law combined with the unwillingness of the Government to
 facilitate the return of Serb refugees contributed to charges that the Government
 sought to legalize and institutionalize the population changes resulting from the
 1995 military actions in order to create a homogenous country with no significant
 minorities.
 In preparation for elections in sector east as called for under the Basic Agreement
 between the Government and the Eastern Slavonia Serbs, by years end the Govern-
 ment increased the pace of residency document (domovmca) issuance for Serbs
 thereby enabling them to participate in the political process. Elections were agreed
 upon or March 16, 1997, and, in a major positive development the Government in
 December dropped its long-held opposition to voting rights in Eastern Slavonia for
 Serb citizens from other parts of Croatia who had fled to Eastern Slavonia after the
 fall of the Krajina. While some modalities remained to be worked out, one of the
 major impediments to peaceful reintegration was thus removed.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on participation by women or minorities
 in the political process, they are represented in only small numbers in Parliament
 the executive branch, and courts. In the 206-member Parliament, 13 women hold
 seats; 1 is the President of the House of Counties. Election law requires representa-
 tion for minorities in Parliament, with proportional representation for any minority
 that makes up more than 8 percent of he population. Currently no minority meets
 that criteria. Representation for Croatia's Serb minority is based, however, on gov-
 ernment estimates of the number of Serbs who fled Croatia between 1991-95 and
 the assumption that they will not return. There were no Muslim representatives in
 Parliament despite that fact that the Muslim minority was the next largest after
 Serbs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups in the capital, Zagreb and throughout the country worked
 to prevent human rights abuses and brought their concerns to the attention of local
 andnational authorities as well as to that of domestic and international media.
 Most of these groups focused on legal advocacy programs and social services support
 for the remaining people in the former Serb-held areas. A coalition of groups called
 the Antiwar Campaign, formed in 1991, expanded its outlook and became a nation-
 wide network of NGO's, dealing with issues as diverse as peace education and wom-
 en's and minority rights, as welw as lobbying Parliament for effective and fair legis-
 lation. Throughout the year, indigenous human rights groups were highly critical
 of the Government's human rights record.
 International organizations worked freely throughout Croatia. These organiza-
 tions usually reoed an adequate level of cooperation with government authorities
 in Zagreb although, at times, government follow-through in the field was less than
 adequate. UNTAES reported that government cooperation was generally good, with
 demilitarization of Eastern Slavona completed in June and establishment of the
 transitional poie force with some joint Croat/Serb patrols in the summer. However,
 UNTAES complained that, at times, agreements made in Zagreb with ranking offi-
 cials were openly ignored by local officials. For example, orders to the Osijek police
 to allow passage of documented Serbs across the sector boundary were counter-
 manded by the local chief of police. The issuance of identity papers to Serbs desiring
 Croatian citizenship was slow and often marred by incomplete cooperation by the
 various ministries involved (see Section 5). There were also isolated incidents of
 threats and assaults against U.N. personnel in Eastern Slavonia.
 The Government, after substantial delay, signed a memorandum of understanding
 that established a resident presence of the Organization for Cooperation and Secu-
 rity in Europe (OSCE). The agreement limited OSCE offices outside Zagreb to two
 (Knin and Vukovar) and the overall staff to 14 (8 in Zagreb, 3 in each field office),
 which did not allow for extensive operations throughout the country. OSCE officials
 reported instances of lack of cooperation by local government officials, especially in
 the Knin area, where it took local representatives almost 2 months to secure an ini-
 
 
 902
 tial appointment with the mayor. The ECMM and the United Nations Special
 Rapporteur for Human Rights moved freely throughout the country, reporting on
 human "lhts problems.
 Domestic human rights groups reported that their activity was largel I ored by
 the Government. Unless a case received international attention through the media
 or an international organization, the Government took little or no action to address
 the problem cited. Increasingly, local NGO's and their staff were the target of gov-
 ernment harassment such as 'informal" interviews at the Ministry of Interior or
 apartment searches. In the last quarter of the year a tougher, less tolerant attitude
 toward foreign NGO's became evident, in particular toward the Sors Foundation
 whose activities included promotion of a free press. In December the Open Society
 (the local Soros affiliate) was charged with tax evasion, and three of its representa-
 tives were indicted for falsifying documents in relation to that charge. The Govern-
 ment's charges, coming soon after several hardline speeches by the President, were
 widely viewed as plitcaly motivated.
 The NGO's also found themselves the targets of violence. The office of the NGO
 Homo in Lika was attacked three times during the year. First the office was set
 on fire; then two staff members were beaten and a vehicle damaged, allegedly by
 a Bosnian Croat refugee living in the area who opposed the organization's work pro-
 moting the rights of Serbs in the area; a second fire at the office was reported in
 November. In December a staff member of the human rights NGO "Otvorene Oci"
 (Open Eyes) was beaten in her apartment in Split. All of these incidents were still
 under investigation, but no suspects were in custody. In yet another incident, a
 small explosive device was thrown into the yard of the summer home of the Presi-
 dent of the Croatian Helsinki Committee, a vocal advocate for human rights who
 was often critical of government policies.
 The Government pledged its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal
 for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague and passed legislation to facilitate
 that cooperation in April. However, the President of the Tribunal noted in October
 that the level of cooperation had been more verbal than actual and was cause to
 question the Government's commitment to work with that body. By year's end, the
 Government had arrested only two of seven indicted Croats, only one of whom had
 been turned over to the Tribunal. In several instances during the year, indicted war
 criminals were allegedly spotted on Croatian territory, but the Government appar-
 ently took little or no serious action to arrest them. The Government in July dis-
 banded its war crimes commission, the main avenue for the flow of information to
 the Tribunal in the Hague, putting in its place a government panel which had yet
 to take effective shape by year's end, leading to increased dissatisfaction with the
 Government's performance. The Government repudiated its earlier pledge not to ar-
 rest war criminals absent prior review of the charges by the ICTY (the so-called
 rules of the road).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifies that all citizens shall enjoy all rights and freedoms, re-
 gardless of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
 social origin, property, birth, education, social status, or other attributes. It adds
 that me   ers of all national groups and minorities shall have equal rights. With
 the exceptions noted below, these rights are observed in practice. The Constitution
 provides for special "wartime measures" but states that restrictions shall be appro-
 priate to the nature of the danger and may not result in the inequality of citizenship
 with respect to race, color, sex, language, religion, or national or social origin. Under
 these measures, these rights have been observed in practice.
 . Women.-Although the Government does not collect statistics on the issue, in-
 formed observers state that violence against women, including spousal abuse is
 common and that the number of incidents has increased in the last few years. One
 NGO estimates that abuse or harassment affect as many as 30 percent of women.
 Alcohol abuse is commonly cited as a contributing factor. Centers for the psycho-
 logical and medical care of abused women are open in several cities, and hot lines
 have been established in Zagreb (24-hour), Puls, and Osijek. A number of local insti-
 tutions and voluntary agencies offer social, meical, and other assistance to abused
 women and to those traumatized by war experiences. Family crisis associations are
 also active.
 The law does not discriminate by gender. In practice, however, women generally
 hold lower paying positions in the work force. According to government figures, 75
 rent of elementary teachers and 33 percent of high school teachers are women.
 e majority of nurses and clerical work ers are female as well. While there is no
 one national organization devoted solely to the protection of women's rights, many
 
 
 903
 small, indepndent groups were active in the capital and larger cities. These groups
 together established a national Coordination Council of Women's Organizations. A
 nationwide organization established during tHe Communist era, "rvatska Zena"
 (Croatian Woman), also sought to remake itself into a more genuine advocacy group.
 Children.-The Government is strongly committed to the welfare of children. Ma-
 ternity leave was increased to 3 years under the new Labor Code that went into
 effect on January 1. Schools provide free meals for children, day care facilities are
 available in most communities even for infants, and medical care for children is
 free. Education is compulsory up to 14 years of age.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse or discrimination against children.
 People With Disabilities.-No specific legislation mandates access to buildings or
 government services for people with disabilities; access to such facilities is often dif-
 ficult. While people with disabilities face no open discriminatory measures, job op-
 portunities generally are limited. Special education is also limited and poorly fun-
 ed.
 Religious Minorities.-The Muslim community suffered from discrimination, and
 Croatian Muslims and Bosnian refugees continue to report widespread discrimina-
 tion in many areas such as citizenship (see Section 2.c.) and employment rights. Re-
 ligion as a reflection of ethnicity was frequently used to identify non-Croats and as
 another way of sigling them out for discr iinatory practices.
 The close identification of religion with ethnicity previously caused religious insti-
 tutions to be targets of violence. The Serbian Orthodox Church in downtown Zagreb
 nevertheless remained o pn, and several other Orthodox churches and monasteries
 operate freely. Despite being guarded by security forces, two Orthodox churches
 were bombed by unknown persons: one near Zadar on August 23 and another in
 Dubrovnik on September 5. There were no casualties. On December 24, UNTAES
 reported that the Catholic church in the town of ]bok (sector east) was attacked by
 a Serbian mob during its Christmas services, which were attended by a group of
 ethnic Croats from Croatia proper.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Constitutionally, Croatian Serbs and other
 minority groups enjoy the same protection as other self-identified ethnic and reli-
 gious groups. Schools with a sig  icant number of minority students often have
 their own special curriculum in addition to standard ones, designed to teach history,
 geography, art, and music to students in their native language. In practice, however,
 a pattern of ever-present and often open discrimination continues against ethnic
 Serb~s in such areas as the administration of justie, employment, housing, and the
 free exercise of cultural rights. A plan for the development of a school curriculum
 for srbs remains incomplete due to the Government's requirement that all students
 in Eastern Slavonia be tested in Croatian to receive credit for course work com-
 pleted under the Serb curriculum. Istrian Italians complained that access to Italian-
 schools was limited by a government requirement that parents designate
 the ethnicity of their children at birth. Serbs continue to be particularly vulnerable
 to attack because of government reluctance to protect their rights rigorously. Al-
 though the rate declined from previous years, attacks against property owned by
 Serbs continued, particularly in the areas formerly under Serb control. Serbs contin-
 ued to leave Croatia, and many who had fled did not return as a result of the com-
 bination of economic discrimination and physical threats and the lack of interest
 shown by the Government in restoring confidence among Serbs remaining in the for-
 merly occupied areas.
 The makeup of the police force, which consists almost exclusively of ethnic
 Croats-some with little or no previous experience or training in po lice work--con-
 tributed to the problem. Police responsiveness to complaints filed by Serb residents
 of the former sectors was mixed; in sectors north and west, adeuate at best, and
 in sector south, uniformly poor. The Un . Special Rapporteur on Huma   Rights re-
 inrted that "the principal responsibility for the continued insecurity lies with the
 hocal police, who are either unable or unwilling to take effective action against the
 ongoing wave of criminal activity against Croatian Serbs." The ECMM, the Inter-
 national Federation of the Red ross and Red Crescent Societies, and the ICRC all
 confirm that police action to stop the threats, theft, and violence is inadequate, par-
 ticularly in former sector south, where a "climate of fear" still prevails. On the other
 hand, the situation is reported to have improved markedly in the town of Pakrsc,
 in former sector west, largely due to the efforts of the local chief o police.
 Serbs and other minorities also suffered from economic discrimination. While the
 difficult economic situation continued to cause high unemployment for all sectors of
 society, the rate of Serb unemployment is much higher than that of any other ethnic
 group, and a disproportionate number of layoffs and firings involve ethnic Serbs. In
 the Krajina (former sectors north and south), for example, one NGO estimated that
 unemployment for Serbs was as high as 80 percent and that the few jobs that ex-
 
 
 904
 isted went to Croats rather than Serbs. There are numerous documented cases of
 the inability of ethnic Serbs to obtain reconstruction assistance and loans to rebuild
 homes damaged in the war. In a positive development, 60 ethnic Serbs were rehired
 by the government-owned oil refinery INA in Djelotovci, Eastern Slavonia.
 The Law on Citizenship distinguishes between those with a claim to Croatian eth-
 nicity and those without. The 'Croatian people" are eligible to become citizens of
 Croatia even if they were not citizens of the former Socialist Republic of Croatia,
 as long as they submit a written statement that they consider themselves Croatian
 citizens. Others must satisfy mere stringent requirements through naturalization in
 order to obtain citizenship, even if they were previously lawful residents of Croatia
 as citizens of the former Yugoslavia. While an application for citizenship is pending,
 the applicant is considered an alien and is denied rights such as social allowances,
 including medical care, pensions, free education, and employment in the civil serv-
 ice. The Government's practice of discriminating against ethnic and religious mi-
 norities, Jarticularly Serbs and Muslims, in the issuance of citizenship papers, drew
 harsh criticism. Human rights organizations reported numerous documented cases
 in which the Interior Ministry denied citizenship papers to long-term residents of
 Croatia (that is, resident in Croatia long before the country declared its independ-
 ence). For example, residents of several ethnic Muslim villages near Sluiqj (a total
 of some 500 people) were unable to obtain Croatian citizenship, and in some cases
 entire villages were rendered stateless. Human rights groups complain that the In-
 terior Ministry frequently based its denials on Article 26 of the Law on Citizenship,
 which permits it to deny citizenship papers to persons otherwise qualified to be citi-
 zens of Croatia for reasons of national interest. The law does not require the reasons
 to be explained, and human rights organizations reported that the police continued
 to refuse citizenship aplications without full explanation.
 The situation for Ser a in sector east and for those outside the country desiring
 to return to their homes in Croatia was particularly difficult. At the urging of
 UNTA S, the Government established document centers in several cities in Eastern
 Slavonia to facilitate provision of identity papers to Serbs who claimed Croatian citi-
 zenship. Due to government requirements for lengthy background checks and docu-
 ment verification, however, these centers initially issued identity documents only
 slowly. UNTAES and international pressure helped to speed up the process, an,
 byyear's end, approximately 20,000 (or 10 percent of the population of the sector)
 hadbeen issued their domovnica with a further credible prmise from the Govern-
 ment that the remaining backlog of persons desiring Croatian citizenship would be
 processed in time to vote in local elections scheduled for March 16, 1997.
 While, overall, Rma continued to face societal discrimination and official inaction
 when complaints were filed, some progress was made in education and cultural
 awareness. In its June report to the Council of Europe, the Government noted the
 publication of sveral studies on the subject of Romani education, and the Ministry
 of Education establsed a summer school for Romani children.
 Other minority groups-Slovaks, Czechs, Italians, and Hungarians-did not re-
 port significant discrimination to the same extent as the Serb community. As power
 became increasingly centralized in Zagreb, the Istrian region (with a large Itaan
 minority who had traditionally enjoyed a 'significant amount of autonomy) became
 increasingly disaffected. Agreements were signed with Hungary and Italy for the
 mutual protection of minority poulations. The return of ethnic Hungarians to Cro-
 atia was much less controversia than that of Sers and proceeded unhindered, if
 somewhat slowly.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-AI workers are entitled to form or join unions of
 their own choosing without prior authorization. There is an active labor movement
 with three major and three minor national labor federations and independent asso-
 ciations of both blue- and white-collar members. More than 80 percent of wokers
 are members of unions of one sort or another. In general, unions are independent
 of the Government and political parties. The law prohibits retaliation against strik-
 ers participating in legal strikes. Workers may only strike at the end of a contract
 or in sEctific circumstances mentioned in the contract. Most importantly they can-
 not strike for nonpayment of wages, currently a serious problem. The only recourse
 in the event of nonpayment is to go to court, a process that may take several years.
 If a strike is found to be illegal, any participant can be dismissed, and the union
 held liable for damages.
 When negotiating a new contract, workers are required to go through mediation
 before they can ste. Labor and management choose the mediator together. If they
 cannot agree, the Labor Law which went into effect on January 1 calls for a tri-
 partite commission of labor, business, and government representatives to appoint
 
 
 905
 
 one. Arbitration is never mandatory, but can be used if both sides agree. Only after
 submitting to mediation and formally filing a statement that negotiations are at an
 impasse is a strike legal.
 The right to strike is provided for in the Constitution with the above-mentioned
 limitations and with additional limits on the members of the armed forces, police,
 government administration, and public services. Even though salaries are very low
 relative to the cost of living, and wage increases have been minimal, there is little
 strike activity. The stringent requirements for calling a strike, the high rate of un-
 employment, and the Government's insistence on adhering to its austerity program
 of October 1993 all discourage strikes. However, despite these deterrents, there
 were several labor disputes, including some successful strikes and protests, of vary-
 ing severity, daring the year as the quest for a living wage clashed with government
 austerity measures.
 Transportation workers, seeking a 100 percent wage increase, went on strike in
 February. Despite a demonstration of support by approximately 6,000 members of
 one of the largest trade unions in the capital, a general strike did not materialize.
 After 7 days, workers settled for a 19.75 percent increase. However, railway workers
 again went on strike for 2 weeks late in the year. When this strike was deemed
 illegal by the courts, the workers duly reported back to work, only to announce their
 intention to strike again when the proper procedures had been observed. This sec-
 ond strike lasted only several days  ore a compromise wage package was agreed
 upon.
 A general strike planned for November 11 over labor-government negotiations on
 tax policy was called off when the talks began to make progress. In October ship-
 building workers struck in Karlovac over low wages and high unemployment.
 Unions may freely affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law and practiced freely. The new Labor Code governs collective bargain-
 ing contracts, protection for striking workers, and legal limitations on the ability of
 employers to conduct 'lockouts" during labor disputes. The process of "transforming"
 previously "socially owned" enterprises continues, albeit slowly, as the first step to-
 wards their eventual privatization. The current transition to private enterprise and
 a free market economy has put unions under pressure at the same time that they
 are trying to establish themselves as genuine trade unions. General unemployment
 is the most significant hurdle. Unions and foreign observers claim that unemploy-
 ment was 22 percent throughout the year, and would be much higher except it did
 not include workers on 'waiting lists"-employees at government-owned firms on
 partial pay but not working. International organizations working in the Krajina
 (former sectors north and south) estimated unemployment in these areas was 80
 percent.
 The Labor Code deals directly with antiunion discrimination issues. It allows
 unions to challenge firings in court and eliminated provisions under which illness
 had been a valid reason for employers to fire workers. However, the Government
 often employs coercion against employees, including government employees, in-
 valved in labor disputes and strikes to force them back to work. But no instances
 of severe coercion, such as physical attacks or destruction of workers' property, were
 re rted.
 Thre are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is con-
 stitutionally forbidden, and there were no documented instances of it. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Welfare is the agency charged with enforcing the ban on coerced
 or forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for youth em-
 ployment is 15 years old, and it is enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Wel-
 fare. Under the Constitution, children may not be employed before reaching the le-
 gally determined age, nor may they be forced or allowed to do work that is harmful
 to their health or morality. Workers under the age of 18 are entitled to special pro-
 tection at work and are prohibited from heavy manual labor. Education is manda-
 tory to the age of 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are national minimum wage standards.
 As of October the minimum gross monthly wage was approximately $150 (800
 kuna), which does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 Government policy toward its employees is a major factor in setting wage standards.
 There is a large public sector, and the Government manages, through the privatiza-
 tion fund, employees of companies waiting to be privatized.
 In January the Government announed a zero percent wage increase policy for all
 state employees as part of its austerity program. The policy was enforced only spo-
 radically, however, and the Government signed a contract granting public sector em-
 
 
 ployees a 5 percent raise effective July 1. (Public service wages are very low, and
 therefore public service unions have been very aggressive.) The Government then
 failed to pay the increase, claiming that the contract was not binding. Both sides
 initially agreed to mediation, but in the end rejected the compromise decision. The
 matter was finally resolved in November, when another less remunerative agree-
 ment was reached after collective bargaining.
 National regulations provide for a 42-hour workweek with a  2-hour daily break,
 a 24-hour rest period during the week, and a minimum of 18 days of paid vacation
 annually. Workers receive time-and-a-half pay for any hours worked over 42.
 H       and safety standards are set by the Government and are enforced by the
 Ministry of Health. In practice, industries are not diligent in meeting standards for
 worker protection-a visit to any construction site reveals workers without hard
 hats anaequipment with safety devices removed. Workers can in theory remove
 themselves from hazardous conditions of work. A worker would have redress to the
 courts in a situation where he felt that he had been wrongfully dismissed for doing
 so.
