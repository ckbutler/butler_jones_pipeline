 MOZAMBIQUE
 In 1990 the Government of Mozambique made a transition from a
 one-party state under strict control of the Front for the
 Liberation of Mozambique, or FRELIMO, to a multiparty system.
 This change was formalized in a new democratic constitution,
 which went into effect on November 30. The change was a
 response to growing public pressures for political and
 economic reform and part of a strategy to end the civil
 conflict with RENAMO.
 The new Constitution commits the state to political pluralism
 and direct multiparty elections of the President and
 legislature in 1991. To this end, new political parties were
 already beginning to form-by the end of 1990, although the law
 governing parties had not yet been promulgated. Under the
 Constitution, effective power will continue to be concentrated
 in the hands of the President and top government officials,
 but the National Assembly and the Supreme Court are to be
 given greater responsibilities. A number of individual rights
 are provided for, including freedom of speech, assembly,
 religion, and the press. FRELIMO will no longer share power
 with the Government or serve as the leading party, although it
 will be allowed to retain its influence until elections.
 Since the late 1970's, the Government has been under attack
 from an insurgent group, the Mozambican National Resistance,
 or RENAMO. While direct peace talks between the Government
 and RENAMO began in June, fighting continued to take place in
 all 10 provinces throughout 1990. On December 1, the two
 sides signed a partial cease-fire dealing with two rail
 corridors. Most Mozambican policymakers now agree that the
 South African Government has ceased all support to RENAMO,
 although some nongovernmental groups may still continue to
 supply RENAMO from South African territory.
 The security forces include the Armed Forces of Mozambique
 (FPLM), numbering about 60,009 soldiers, a people's militia,
 and the Mozambican National Security Service (SNASP) which has
 frequently committed human rights abuses. By far, the largest
 number of abuses, and the most severe cases, come from RENAMO,
 which claims to have 25,000 men under arms and an additional
 3,000 trainees. These forces have been the major source of
 human rights abuses. Troops from Zimbabwe and Malawi are
 assisting government forces, primarily to keep open
 transportation corridors. The stationing of these foreign
 troops in Mozambique is one of the most important issues in
 the peace talks. In 1990 the Soviet Union withdrew most of
 its military advisers.
 Approximately 80 percent of the population is employed in
 agriculture, mostly on the small-scale, semisubsistence
 level. Major sources of foreign exchange are agricultural
 products, especially cashews, tea, sugar, and cotton. The new
 Constitution endorses a market-oriented economy. The
 Government has continued to adhere to a strict economic reform
 plan, divesting itself of failed state farms, privatizing
 virtually all small enterprises, and radically altering price
 and regulatory incentives to encourage private enterprise.
 Growth projections have been revised downward to 3.3 percent,
 partly because of the damage caused by the civil conflict.
 RENAMO deliberately attacks economic targets. In some areas,
 the prevailing anarchy has led to the total breakdown of
 
 
 250
 MOZAMBIQUE
 internal trade. A combination of war and unfavorable weather
 has disrupted food production to the point that a third of the
 nation's population--approximately 5 million people--is
 thought to be dependent on international food aid.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in 1990, although the
 constitutional changes provided the potential for significant
 improvements. The most blatant abuses of basic human rights
 occurred as a direct result of the continuing civil conflict.
 Widespread reports of massacres directed against civilians,
 kidnapings, torture, and looting continued throughout the
 year. The vast majority of these atrocities were attributed
 to RENAMO, but some were also attributed to government
 forces. Other major human rights concerns included: harsh
 prison conditions; the use of arbitrary, incomunicado
 detention, especially by the SNASP (the security police);
 incidents of military indiscipline and bullying of civilians;
 and apparent government crackdowns on journalists early in the
 year. Restrictions on the rights of assembly and association
 and on the right of citizens to change their government
 remained in effect through the end of November.
 While the new Constitution represented a major step forward
 toward safeguarding basic rights, it also contains a number of
 qualifying clauses which subordinate the new freedoms to
 "national security" and "foreign policy interests." Hence,
 future progress will depend on the willingness of the
 Government to implement fully these reforms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known or suspected cases of government targeting
 persons for political killings in 1990. Both sides were
 responsible for the deaths of civilians in the course of their
 conflict, with the great majority of the killings attributed
 to RENAMO forces (see Section l.g.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of government-perpetrated
 disappearances. However, there are thousands missing due to
 the conflict, often as a result of kidnapings in areas
 affected by the war. RENAMO, in particular, regularly holds
 civilians against their will, often employing them as porters
 or forcibly impressing them.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both government and RENAMO forces tortured prisoners and
 civilians, although most reports were of RENAMO abuses. There
 were numerous reports that government troops and security
 personnel beat and extorted money from civilians in
 prosecuting the war. Several soldiers were convicted in 1990
 for abuses. Citizens complained about this during nationwide
 debates. There were other beatings not related to the war.
 In November a Beira journalist wrote that he saw policemen
 beating two robbery suspects and that he too, was briefly
 detained when he protested.
 
 
 MOZAMBIQUE
 RENAMO'S attacks on civilians continued unabated in 1990.
 According to many reports, RENAMO beat and mutilated people
 and forced family members to witness or participate in the
 tortures of their relatives. Former RENAMO soldiers claimed
 that threats of beating and torture were used to keep coerced
 recruits from escaping.
 Prison conditions remained very poor. The prison system
 continues to operate with very limited resources, as do most
 government entities. Since 1988 the Government has allowed
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to
 the prisons where national security prisoners, both those
 already convicted and those awaiting trial, are held. During
 most of 1990, RENAMO permitted ICRC sporadic access to areas
 under its control.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The law requires that in most cases detainees be charged or
 released within 30 days- However, persons accused of the most
 serious crimes may be detained for up to 84 days without being
 formally charged or investigated. With court approval, such
 detainees may then be held for two additional periods of 84
 days while the police complete their investigation. While
 detained, persons have the constitutional right to counsel and
 to contact relatives and friends. In some cases detainees may
 be released from prison while the investigation proceeds, but
 the bail system in Mozambique remains ill-defined. The law
 provides that if the prescribed period for investigation has
 been completed and no charges have been brought, the detainee
 must be released. In practice, however, this is often
 overlooked, in part because of the severe lack of
 administrative resources and trained lawyers.
 The SNASP organized under the Ministry of National Security
 has the power to arrest persons accused of political and
 economic crimes against the State, such as espionage or
 sabotage. Security detainees have the same rights as other
 prisoners: to contact a lawyer and to be charged or released
 within a set period of time. In practice, these guarantees
 are also often overlooked, although reliable sources report
 that the Government is making a strong effort to reduce the
 backlog of prisoners awaiting trial. The SNASP can order
 detention for indefinite periods; under this system, many
 prisoners are never brought before a court. While lawyers'
 access to security prisoners is much improved since it was
 first allowed in 1987, these detainees are often denied
 contact with family and friends- for long periods of time and
 did not have the right to challenge the legality of their
 detention under the old constitution which remained in effect
 through November.
 The SNASP's legal authority is reduced under the new
 Constitution, which mandates that preventive detention be
 limited for all prisoners, and specifies that only a judge may
 determine the validity and the continuation of a detainee's
 imprisonment. All citizens, including security prisoners, are
 to have the right to challenge the legality of their
 imprisonment.
 Nobody has ever been formally exiled from Mozambique, although
 the effect of the rigid one-party State drove many persons
 into exile. The new Constitution expressly prohibits the
 expulsion of any Mozambican citizen. The Government has
 publicly invited self-exiled Mozambicans to return and
 
 
 252
 MOZAMBIQUE
 participate in the developing multiparty system. By the end
 of the year only a few had done so.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mozambique has two complementary justice systems: the
 civil/criminal, composed of the judiciary under the Ministry
 of Interior; and the military justice system, which includes
 the SNASP, under the Ministry of National Security. The
 latter has jurisdiction over most cases involving crimes
 committed by military personnel and crimes by civilians that
 adversely affect the military. The Minister of Justice
 appoints judges at the district and provincial level, while
 the President appoints judges to the Supreme Court.
 Since the 1988 establishment of the Supreme Court and the
 abolition of the revolutionary military tribunal, persons
 accused of crimes against the security of the people and the
 State (i.e., the majority of political prisoners) have been
 tried by provincial courts under standard criminal judicial
 procedures. All accused persons, whether they are arrested on
 security or criminal charges, have the right of appeal. Under
 the new Constitution, defendants enjoy the presumption of
 innocence and the right to be represented by legal counsel
 regardless of their ability to pay for a lawyer. Trials in
 the regular civil and criminal court system are generally
 public and fair, but a large backlog of cases, combined with a
 severe shortage of trained lawyers, has resulted in long
 waiting periods before cases are brought to trial. A judge
 may order a trial closed because of national security
 interests or to protect the privacy of the plaintiff in cases
 concerning rape.
 In addition to the regular people's courts at the provincial
 and district levels, there are, at the local level, customary
 courts which handle matters such as estate and divorce cases.
 The proceedings are usually-conducted in public by a trained
 representative of the Ministry of Justice, assisted by two or
 four popularly elected lay judges instructed to exercise
 common sense and to apply locally accepted principles.
 The military crimes and military tribunal law which took
 effect in 1988 established a nationwide system of brigade
 courts and provincial military courts and specified
 military-related crimes. The program is not yet fully
 implemented, owing to the lack of qualified personnel.
 The number of political and security detainees awaiting trial
 as distinguished from those who had been convicted was unknown
 at year's end. There were an estimated 700 security prisoners
 at the end of 1990. It is unknown how many of these were
 awaiting trial. Most of these persons are suspected of
 sympathizing with, or committing crimes on behalf of, RENAMO.
 There are no known prominent prisoners awaiting trial, and no
 prominent prisoners were released in 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In areas of active insurgency, homes are entered at will by
 security and police forces. Civilians living in these areas
 are often moved to government-protected villages. The new
 Constitution provides citizens the right to have "their honor,
 good name and reputation respected... and to shelter their
 private life." The new Constitution specifies further that
 
 
 253
 MOZAMBIQUE
 membership in any association is to be voluntary; there were
 no known cases of coerced membership in political or other
 organizations. It has been widely assumed that surveillance
 devices are employed to monitor local and international
 telecommunications systems and that mail is periodically
 inspected. The new Constitution, however, expressly prohibits
 such surveillance.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Lawin Internal. Conflicts
 Despite the initiation of direct peace talks in midyear, all
 10 provinces suffered RENAMO attacks in 1990, the 15th year of
 the civil war. Both government (FPLM) and RENAMO forces were
 again responsible for violations of humanitarian law in 1990,
 although RENAMO abuses continued to be much more widespread
 and systematic. Attacks against civilians were reported
 frequently, and, given the remoteness of much of the
 countryside, many more attacks undoubtedly went unreported.
 The conflict has cost an estimated 500,000 lives and left
 millions homeless and living on the edge of starvation.
 There is no estimate of the number of killings in 1990 by
 government forces, but there have been credible reports,
 including allegations by refugees, of abuses by government
 forces. In March credible reports indicated that an FPLM unit
 based in Zambezia Province in central Mozambique abducted an
 influencial pro-RENAMO chief from his home and later killed
 him at the military barracks. In June a group of FPLK
 soldiers rioted in a Maputo neighborhood, looting and
 vandalizing several businesses and beating a dozen civilians.
 In the wake of a September- November offensive in Zambezia
 Province, civilian victims and humanitarian organizations
 reported that government forces required civilians to either
 leave their homes or be treated as suspected guerrillas.
 Civilians were then herded into camps, which often did not
 have adequate provisions for feeding large numbers of people.
 In some instances, government forces reportedly burned houses,
 intimidated, and killed some of the civilians who resisted.
 The President and other senior officials publicly and
 repeatedly emphasized the need for the security and military
 forces to respect the population. Many citizens took
 advantage of the nationwide, grassroots debate about the new
 Constitution to complain publicly that FPLM soldiers often
 bully and abuse civilians. Many civilians complained that
 abusive acts went unpunished. However, the local media
 publicized several accounts of legal charges being brought
 against undisciplined soldiers. Since 1988, about 30 FPLM
 officers have participated in ICRC-sponsored courses in
 humanitarian law.
 Atrocities by RENAMO against defenseless civilians have been
 well documented by governmental and nongovernmental sources.
 In 1990 there were numerous credible reports that RENAMO still
 executes noncombatants after attacks on villages, often
 hacking or burning people to death, apparently to intimidate
 would-be resisters. Such assassinations are especially aimed
 at any representative of the Government, including party
 officials, schoolteachers, and health workers. In one
 February attack on a village in Gaza Province, 21 civilians
 were killed, and several survivors were mutilated, one
 sexually. An additional 11 civilians were hacked to death in
 
 
 254
 MOZAMBIQUE
 a Maputo Province massacre in August. RENAMO attacked trains
 carrying migrant mineworkers from South Africa three times in
 1990, killing 66, 16, and 4 people respectively.
 Numerous other victims' accounts accuse RENAMO of
 systematically kidnaping civilians, including children, some
 in their early teens, who are then forced to bear arms for
 RENAMO. RENAMO also compels civilians, after an attack on
 their settlement, to carry confiscated items back to RENAMO
 camps; prisoners too weak to keep up are sometimes killed.
 Prisoners allegedly are forced to cultivate food for the
 insurgents, and violence against women, including rape, is
 common. RENAMO's policy of deliberate destruction of economic
 targets, including factories, food crops, and transportation
 networks, has worsened famine conditions in some areas,
 particularly in Zambezia Province. Industry was particularly
 hard hit by frequent sabotage against the electric power grid
 during the first half of the year. Relief convoys, health
 workers, and clinics were frequently targets of attack.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The new Constitution provides for freedom of expression and
 the press, but these freedoms may be restricted for reasons of
 respect for the Constitution and for human dignity, and for
 foreign policy and national defense considerations. The
 extent of the restrictions remains undetermined pending the
 approval of additional implementing legislation.
 In 1990 the Government encouraged citizens to speak freely on
 political issues, particularly in the forums discussing the
 new Constitution. Some citizens voiced harsh criticism of the
 political system, and their comments frequently, if
 selectively, were reported verbatim in the press. There was
 no evidence that anyone was penalized for his or her comments.
 Despite a vigorous debate about press freedom in public and
 party forums, and despite a specific reference to press
 freedom in the new Constitution, this freedom remained
 restricted in 1990. The print media are largely owned by
 private entities. There is no formal prior censorship in
 Mozambique, and the media occasionally run hard-hitting
 stories on topics including corruption, official incompetence,
 and even incidents of military indiscipline.
 Nonetheless, journalists are held to an unwritten and
 sometimes fluid set of guidelines. According to well-informed
 sources, disagreements between the Government and the press on
 editorial policy led to the dismissal of a newspaper editor
 and the resignation of the broadcast news director early in
 1990. In addition, a Voice of America (VOA) stringer was
 expelled for refusing to reveal sources in a story aired by
 VOA about anticipated public protests. Journalists,
 complaining that the ill-defined restrictions will result in
 self-censorship, petitioned forcefully in 1990 for legislation
 and constitutional guarantees protecting the press.
 Given the problems of poverty, illiteracy, and the shortage of
 hard currency, the market for books and publications is
 small. However, some foreign publications, including
 independent Western news magazines, do occasionally appear in
 bookstores. Church groups circulate newsletters and pastoral
 
 
 255
 MOZAMBIQUE
 letters. Western journalists (including Americans) are
 welcome in Mozambique, and the Government assists in their
 visits. Regular foreign and radio broadcasts and South
 African and Swazi television are received without interference
 or restrictions.
 Academic freedom is not formally circumscribed, but there are
 tacitly accepted limits to academic discussions and
 publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Unless held under the FRELIMO banner, organized demonstrations
 were still comparatively rare in 1990. However, in January
 and February, wildcat strikers were allowed to form ad hoc
 committees and present their demands as long as they remained
 nonviolent (see Section 6.a.).
 Freedom of assembly and association, provided for under both
 the original and the new Constitutions, have been restricted
 in practice through 1990. These restrictions, however,
 appeared to be easing significantly in the final months of the
 year. While FRELIMO remained the only legal political
 organization in 1990, opponents took the first organizational
 steps to form new parties, with no apparent interference from
 the Government. Two new political parties, UNAMO and PALMO,
 have full-time party representatives in the capital. At the
 end of the year, "mass democratic organizations," including
 the Mozambican Women's Organization and the sole labor union.
 confederation, severed their formal ties to FRELIMO.
 Political parties must register with the Government. However,
 nonpolitical association appears to be increasing. A major
 initiative began in 1990 to establish a "Foundation for
 Community Development," which would support the growth of
 indigenous Mozambican nongovernmental organizations. There is
 also a strong new interest in business and professional
 organizations; a businesswomen's association and a Maputo
 Province private farmers' association held founding meetings
 in 1990.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Both the original and the new Constitutions mandate strict
 separation of church and state, and provide for the freedom to
 "practice or not practice a religion." Both, however, also
 specify that all acts of religious institutions should conform
 to the laws of the State. The new Constitution gives
 religious institutions the right to own property and allows
 private entities, including presumably religious institutions,
 to operate schools. The Government does not require religious
 organizations or missionaries to register, and foreign
 missionaries are readily granted visas.
 Relations between the Government and religious organizations,
 tense in the early years after independence, continued to
 improve in 1990. The Government encouraged leaders of the
 major Christian and Moslem organizations to participate in all
 levels of the nationwide debate on the new Constitution.
 Numerous leaders did participate in those debates. There was
 no movement, however, toward drafting th long-promised law on
 religious liberty. The Government has agreed in principle to
 return many properties expropriated from religious
 organizations in the postindependence period. While some
 
 
 256
 MOZAMBIQUE
 properties have been returned to their original owners, such
 as the Maputo synagogue late in 1989, others, such as the
 Catholic seminary in Maputo, are still in government hands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As an emergency security measure and to prevent evasion of
 conscription, the Government still requires all citizens to
 obtain travel permits from the local authorities. Such
 directives, often little enforced in practice because of
 limited administrative control and resources in the
 countryside, are in conflict with the new Constitution, which
 guarantees freedom to travel within the country and abroad.
 Moreover, the Government still required people to move from
 areas designated as security zones. Human rights monitors are
 concerned that large numbers of people are kept in government-
 protected villages for excessive periods of time, even though
 such villages are frequently not equipped'to sustain their
 population.
 There is no exile or revocation of Mozambican citizenship for
 political reasons under the new Constitution.
 Given the civil conflict, there are few refugees from other
 countries in Mozambique. At the end of 1990, only 358
 refugees received material aid from the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with the full cooperation of
 the Government. There were no reported cases in which
 refugees have been forced to return to countries where they
 have a well-founded fear of persecution.
 In contrast, security conditions have forced over 1.4 million
 Mozambicans to leave their homes for refuge in neighboring
 countries. According to recent estimates, 900,000 Mozambican
 refugees are in Malawi. Other receiving countries include
 Zimbabwe, with 175,000 refugees; Tanzania, 72,000; Zambia,
 20,000; and Swaziland, 20,000. Another 300,000 are thought to
 be in South Africa, although this is only an approximation,
 and does not distinguish between economic migrants, displaced
 persons, and refugees.
 An estimated 1.4 million are internal refugees, living mainly
 in displaced persons camps scattered throughout the country.
 In these camps, they receive emergency aid from the Government
 and from the international community.
 The Government readily accepts and aids repatriates. An
 estimated 234,000 refugees have returned to Mozambique, the
 majority on their own initiative, and the balance through
 UNHCR voluntary repatriation programs coordinated with
 neighboring governments. South Africa routinely repatriates
 undocumented Mozambicans, although they have occasionally
 allowed the temporary entry of villagers who are fleeing
 RENAMO attack. Zimbabwe has forcibly repatriated refugees in
 the past, but this practice seems to be easing; there are
 indications that Zimbabwe has also turned back some asylum
 seekers at the point of entry. The Government protested these
 involuntary repatriations but was unable to prevent them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens did not have the right to change their government in
 1990. However, while the new Constitution has yet to be
 
 
 MOZAMBIQUE
 tested, and the implementing legislation, such as the law on
 political parties and the electoral law, has yet to be
 completed and ratified, the groundwork was being laid for
 competitive multiparty elections in 1991.
 The original, postindependence constitution established a
 system that effectively allowed the President, the FRELIMO
 Politburo, and the Council of Ministers to control
 policymaking and implementation. The President had extensive
 appointive powers in both his government and party roles. He
 set policy guidelines in consultation with the 12-person
 Politburo and the 164-member Central Committee of FRELIMO,
 whose members were elected at party congresses at 5-year
 intervals. The new Constitution mandates elimination of the
 leading role of the FRELIMO party, although the FRELIMO-
 dominated Government remained in office pending new
 elections. The President no longer need be a FRELIMO member
 and will not be selected by the party Central Committee.
 Instead, the President and legislature are to be selected by
 direct, universal adult suffrage by secret ballot in elections
 scheduled at 5-year intervals, starting in 1991.
 The new Constitution calls for a strong Presidency, but it
 also enhances the legislature's strength by allowing a
 two-thirds majority to override what is essentially a
 presidential veto. It also provides for constitutional review
 for the first time in history by the Supreme Court, pending
 establishment of a separate Constitutional Tribunal.
 The status of new political parties remained unclear at the
 end of 1990. The Constitution provides for an unlimited
 number of political parties. In order to register as a
 legally recognized political party, an organization would have
 to demonstrate that it would have no regional, racial, ethnic
 or religious exclusiveness. A law on political parties was
 approved, but not promulgated at year's end. Reportedly, this
 law requires a party to demonstrate that it has a certain
 minimal number of supporters distributed throughout the
 country, and mandates central budget financing of all
 registered parties proportional to each party's representation
 in the legislature. Late in the year several small opposition
 groups indicated they plan to form political parties and had
 initiated preliminary organizational work with no apparent
 systematic interference from the Government. However, some
 reported minor harassment by local officials prior to the
 formal implementation of the new Constitution.
 The success of the new Constitution and a multiparty system
 will depend heavily on RENAMO intentions. While RENAMO has
 long demanded the establishment of a multiparty system in
 Mozambique, it denounces the Government's unilateral
 implementation of the new Constitution and legislation on
 political parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 NonGovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations which monitor human rights
 abuses. The Government is receptive, however, to
 international human rights monitoring groups. In particular,
 the Government has cooperated closely with the ICRC, which
 maintains an office in Maputo. During a September visit to
 Switzerland, President Chissano met with the President of the
 
 
 258
 MOZAMBIQUE
 ICRC. The ICRC has access to security prisons nationwide, and
 in 1990 it also gained access to security prisoners held in
 civilian prisons. High-level military and government
 officials participated in ICRC-sponsored courses on
 humanitarian law during 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 According to official government policy and pronouncements,
 Mozambique is a multiracial, nondiscriminatory society. There
 does not appear to be any systematic persecution on the basis
 of ethnicity or race. Nonetheless, the FRELIMO Government
 tends to-include a disproportionate number of southerners,
 mostly from the Shangaan ethnic group, at all levels. Members
 of the northern Makonde tribe are well represented. White,
 Asian, and mixed-race Mozambicans are also heavily represented
 relative to their numbers in the population, but they are not
 allowed in the military. Most observers, both Mozambican and
 foreign, believe that ethnic imbalance results from the
 greater educational opportunities available to southerners and
 nonblacks under the former colonial administration, and not
 from deliberate government policies. The Government has been
 undertaking a little-publicized "Africanization" program of
 moving black Africans into positions formerly occupied by
 whites. Other personnel changes seem intended to redress
 regional imbalances.
 The leadership of the RENAMO insurgents is predominantly from
 the Shona-speaking ethnic groups who live near the Zimbabwean
 border. There is no indication, however, that the conflict
 between the Government and RENAMO is primarily motivated by
 ethnicity, although ethnic and regional factors may play a
 role. Historical accident appears to be responsible for the
 ethnic composition of the RENAMO leadership; the Shona was the
 group culturally and geographically most accessible to the
 Rhodesian intelligence organization, which established the
 forerunner to RENAMO in the late 1970's. Since then, RENAMO
 has recruited from all ethnic groups. The leadership has not
 emphasized ethnic issues in its communiques or its negotiating
 points. Instead, the leadership says it is fighting for
 political democratization and economic liberalization.
 Both the current and the new Constitutions forbid
 discrimination on the basis of sex and mandate equal rights
 and responsibilities for women. Family law requires that
 women have equal property rights and rights over the children
 in any marriage. In practice, women are underrepresented in
 the professions and in educational institutions at all
 levels. The Organization of Mozambican Women (OMM) has made a
 long-term project of studying the traditional practices of the
 various ethnic groups and challenging, through grassroots
 education programs, those practices that they determine are
 detrimental to women.
 According to medical and other sources, violence against
 women, especially wife beating, is fairly widespread in
 Mozambique, especially in the rural areas. The police do not
 normally intervene in domestic disputes, and cases are rarely
 brought before the courts. The Government has not addressed
 the issue specifically, and its influence is weak, especially
 in many rural areas affected by the war. The OMM is
 campaigning to change public attitudes on violence against
 women and other practices, such as female genital mutilation
 (circumcision) and bride-price payments, which continue in
 
 
 259
 MOZAMBIQUE
 some rural areas. Female circumcision is found most
 frequently in coastal areas, particularly among Muslim groups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The new Constitution specifies that all workers are free to
 join or not join a trade union. However, at the end of 1990,
 all trade unions were still incorporated into a central labor
 union confederation, the Organization of Mozambican Workers
 (OTM), which was loosely affiliated with the FRELIMO party
 until November. The new Constitution is ambiguous about the
 right to form trade unions that are independent of the
 Government and party. The OTM formally ended its affiliation
 with FRELIMO in November and selected new leadership by secret
 ballot.
 For the first time, the new Constitution explicitly provides
 for the right to strike. In the past, the Government quickly
 repressed the few strikes. that occurred. In the early months
 of 1990, however, Mozambique experienced-an unprecedented wave
 of wildcat strikes, with over 150 walkouts eventually
 affecting ports, railroads, state and private factories,
 hospitals, and schools throughout the country.
 The Government responded to these strikes by introducing a set
 of provisional guidelines which have the effect of delaying
 strikes, but which nevertheless conferred de facto recognition
 of the right to strike and of the ad hoc committees that
 evolved to negotiate many settlements. These guidelines
 require prior notice of strikr activity, exhaustion of other
 alternatives, presentation of a list of demands, and
 appointment of a negotiating committee. According to
 government reports, strikers-in several subsequent walkouts
 adhered to the guidelines. The authorities made a number of
 arrests in some cases where vandalism or violence accompanied
 strike activity.
 The OTM considers its relations with international trade union
 organizations to be an important element of its mission, and
 it frequently serves as a conduit for foreign assistance to
 Mozambican trade unions. The OTM is not affiliated with any
 non-African international trade union organization. It is a
 member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Council.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under cUrrent legislation, which was superseded by the new
 Constitution, workers are only allowed to organize and
 negotiate with employers within the OTM structure. The
 Government sets most wage rates, thus limiting the scope for
 collective bargaining as such. Traditionally, the OTM has
 been responsible primarily for representing workers at
 disciplinary action hearings and during labor disputes.
 During 1990, however, the OTM faced increasing criticism
 because it was widely perceived to be out of touch with worker
 concerns, and ad hoc committees became the focal point for
 union grievances.
 Many of the legal restrictions affecting collective bargaining
 were virtually set aside during the 1990 strikes. Ad hoc
 committees operating independently of OTM leadership, and with
 a combination of union and nonunion members, negotiated

 numerous settlements in 1990. Many strikers circumvented the
 wage rates established by the Government by focusing their
 demands on negotiable items, such as food and transportation
 subsidies, bonuses, and payment of back wages. The cumulative
 pressure of so many strikes evidently led the Government to
 reassess the wage scales and implement across-the-board
 increases for employees of the Government and government-owned
 enterprises. Legislation permitting collective bargaining has
 been drafted but had not been presented to the Legislature by
 year's end.
 There are no export processing zones in Mozambique.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law; there have
 been no reports of such labor practices by the Government.
 RENAMO reportedly forces kidnaped civilians to perform various
 support functions, including portering arms and supplies and
 growing food for combatants.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor is regulated, and in the wage economy the minimum
 working age is 16. Because of high. adult unemployment, there
 are few children in regular wage positions. However, minor
 children commonly work on family farms or in the urban
 informal sector, where they perform such tasks as watching
 cars or collecting scrap metal.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage is set at about $27 per month at the current
 official exchange rate, although it is less than half that
 amount in dollar terms at the black market rate of exchange.
 This amount is not adequate to sustain an average worker's
 family in the city of Maputo. The cost of living is lower in
 Beira and Nampula, but minimum wages still cannot be
 considered "adequate." Given the 40-percent unemployment rate
 and the occasional lack of effective government enforcement,
 many salaried workers are probably receiving less than the
 minimum, and workers must turn to second jobs, if available,
 or more likely to subsistence agriculture to survive. An
 estimated 80 percent of the work force is engaged in
 semisubsistence agriculture, which is not covered by minimum
 wage legislation. The standard legal workweek is 44 hours.
 In the small, modern sector, the Government has enacted health
 and environmental laws to protect workers. On occasion, the
 Government has closed firms for noncompliance with these laws,
 but enforcement is sporadic particularly under current
 economic conditions.
