AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a multi-party parliamentary democracy operating
 within a federal system of government. Voting is compulsory
 for those over the age of 18. Federal elections held in March
 1983 resulted in a change in government.
 Australia has an advanced industrial economy with a high per
 capita income and government programs that provide economic
 support for the relatively disadvantaged elements of the
 population. Individuals are free to hold private property, to
 pursue their private economic interests, and to organize trade
 unions.
 The Australian Government has actively supported immigration
 into Australia and has also taken a very large number of
 refugees in proportion to its population. As a result, the
 Australian population now includes a significant mixture of
 ethnic groups, both European and Asian.
 Protection of the rights of Australia's 180,000 aboriginals is
 a demonstrated concern of the Government. Racial
 discrimination is prohibited by law. The Government recognizes
 that aboriginals are the most disadvantaged group in Australia
 and has provided special programs and assistance. During
 1982-83 the Federal Government provided more than $249 million
 for aboriginal advancement programs. Land rights for
 aboriginals and protection of aboriginal sacred sites remain
 issues of controversy. The Federal Government has announced
 its intention to introduce legislation on these two matters at
 the national level.
 Australia has been in the forefront of those countries
 promoting human rights both domestically and internationally.
 Fundamental human rights are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The Government makes a major effort to investigate
 reports of discrimination and to implement fully laws
 protecting the individual. In 1983 Australia ratified the U.N.
 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women.
 Internationally, Australia has played an active role in
 promoting human rights in the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the
 U.N. Working Group on Indigenous Populations, the Second World
 Racism Conference, and other fora.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were in 1983 no known instances of politically motivated
 killings in Australia by either the Government or by domestic
 opposition groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated
 disappearance in Australia.

 c. Torture and Cruei, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is neither condoned nor practiced in Australia.
 Australian law prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment, and this prohibition is respected in practice.
 Abuse of prisoners and use of excessive force by police are not
 condoned, and there are adequate procedures to deal with
 offenders. Prison and detention facilities provide adequate
 shelter, food, and medical care. Prisoners' families and
 lawyers are allowed freely to visit them.
 In 1983 the Australian Human Rights Commission investigated
 complaints that, at the Immigration Detention Center at
 Villawood, there were infringements of human rights as defined
 in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
 the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, of which Australia
 is a signatory. The report made a number of recommendations to
 improve privacy, access to legal advice, contact with visitors,
 communication with the outside world, and general welfare
 conditions of the illegal immigrants detained at the center.
 The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has responded
 that a number of measures have been and will be taken to
 address the report's concerns.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and
 this prohibition is respected in practice. Arrested
 individuals must be brought before a magistrate without undue
 delay. Writs of habeas corpus are available to ensure that
 persons are not arrested without charges being brought against
 them promptly and to guarantee their right to apply to the
 courts for release pending trial. Preventive detention is not
 practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law guarantees the right to a fair hearing, the
 right to a fair public trial and the unimpeded right of
 counsel. These guarantees are observed in practice. Public
 assistance is available for those unable to pay for legal
 counsel. Defendants are promptly informed of charges and have
 pre-trial access to evidence against them. By law defendants
 are entitled to call and cross-examine witnesses and are
 protected against self-incrimination and double jeopardy.
 Australians are protected by law against ex post facto criminal
 prosecutions. The Australian judiciary is independent. Judges
 remain in office until retirement or resignation. Civilians
 are tried in civil courts and have the right of appeal to
 higher courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. The Australian
 federal police may make use of listening devices in national
 security and narcotics investigations, with authorization from
 the judiciary. Australia is a nation of liberal political
 traditions and common law, and the Government does not
 interfere in the private lives of individuals.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Both freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in law and
 respected in practice. While there is a government-owned
 television and radio network administered by the recently
 restructured independent Australian Broadcasting Corporation,
 private enterprise plays the dominant role in the media. There
 is no press censorship. Opposition parties are completely free
 to express their viewpoints. Parliamentary debates are
 broadcast in full on the radio. There is no political
 censorship of books or artistic works. There is full academic
 freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed in Australia, but some state
 laws provide for limitations in cases where public safety may
 be imperiled. For example, in Western Australia, the Police
 Act, as amended, requires that advance permission be obtained
 from the Commissioner of Police or an authorized officer before
 a procession or a public meeting can be held in a public
 place. The Commissioner may not withhold permission unless he
 has reasonable grounds to believe the meeting will imperil
 public safety. Only infrequently has permission to hold a
 meeting at a specific place been denied because of concern
 about public safety. In Queensland, laws governing street
 marches have led to occasional confrontations between the
 police and civil rights activists.
 About half of the Australian work force belongs to Australia's
 more than two hundred eighty unions. Unions are a powerful
 element in the economic and industrial scene as well as in
 politics. The governing Australian Labor Party is a "child" of
 Australia's trade union movement. In state conventions of the
 Labor Party, sixty percent of the delegates come from
 party-affiliated unions. Despite the unions' close association
 with the Australian Labor Party, they retain their autonomy and
 independence. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is an
 umbrella organization of labor unions.
 The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration System is posited
 on the existence and autonomy of both employer and employee
 groups. The Confederation of Australian Industry (roughly the
 national counterpart to the Australian Council of Trade Unions)
 is an umbrella organization of employer groups. The rights of
 unions and employer associations to affiliate with
 international associations are unchallenged. Scores of
 Australian unions belong to one or more of the international
 trade secretariats. Both the Australian Council of Trade
 Unions and Confederation of Australian Industry furnish worker
 and manager representatives to the International Labor
 Organization, and both play an active role in ILO proceedings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion in Australia. There is
 no established church. There are no restrictions on religious
 activities or membership nor restrictions on missionaries or
 conversion. While Christianity predominates in Australia,
 there is a small but growing Islamic community of about 77,000
 and a Jewish community of about 62,000 according to the 1981
 census. Religious affiliation does not affect civil,
 political, economic, or other secular status.
 
 
 726
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside of
 Australia including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Australia has been in the forefront of countries accepting
 refugees for resettlement, and Australia has resettled more
 than 80,600 refugees from Indochina. In addition, Australia
 has welcomed significant numbers of refugees from elsewhere in
 the world, including eastern Europe, and the Middle East.
 Amendments to the Migration Act were proposed in 1983 which
 would remove a distinction between commonwealth and
 non-commonwealth non-Australian citizens in matters of
 deportation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As a multi-party parliamentary democracy, Australians
 participate in their government by electing a two-chamber
 parliament. Voting is compulsory for Australians 18 and over.
 Australians exercised their right to change their government in
 March 1983, electing a Labor Government to replace the
 Liberal/National Party coalition Government. State electoral
 procedures are set by each individual state.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Australia has ratified the International Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The
 Government submitted its fourth periodic report to the U.N.
 Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in March
 1983. It is the Government of Australia's policy to respond to
 any communication it might receive from the United Nations
 Secretary General alleging violations of human rights in
 Australia. The Government has also replied to cases raised by
 the London-based Anti-Slavery Society and the minority rights
 group regarding complaints by aboriginals.
 The Federal Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits all
 forms of racial discrimination based on color, race, ethnic
 background, or place of birth. The Australian Human Rights
 Commission established in 1981, investigates complaints of
 infringements of the Racial Discrimination Act. The Commission
 is charged with promoting the observance of human rights by
 monitoring commonwealth laws and regulations, hearing
 complaints, and making recommendations to the Government. The
 Commission is authorized to cooperate with state governments on
 human rights matters under state jurisdiction. The Human
 Rights Commission actively investigates reports of social
 discrimination in Australia. In 1983 Amnesty International did
 not report on Australia. Freedom House rates Australia "free".
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Australia is an affluent country, enjoying one of the highest
 living standards in the world. In 1981 the per capita gross
 national product was $11,118  In 1983 the infant mortality rate
 was 9.9 per thousand live births. Life expectancy at birth was
 73.7 years in 1980. Australia's 1983 population of 15,265
 million was growing at the rate of 1.3 percent a year. Adult
 literacy is effectively 100 percent. In 1977 calorie supply as
 a percent of total requirements was 126.5 percent. About 28.7
 percent of the 1982-83 budget was devoted to social security
 
 
 and welfare. Basic food, shelter, health care, and social
 security benefits are guaranteed for the entire population,
 including recent immigrants.
 In 1983 Australia ratified the United Nations Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In
 ratifying the convention Australia made two reservations: the
 Goverment put on record its inability to provide, within a
 reasonable period of time, maternity leave with pay or
 comparable benefits for women in all areas of employment, as
 called for under Article 11 (2) (B). The Government also
 exempted service in the defense forces in "combat and
 combat-related duties" from articles 11 and 7 (B) which call
 for equal employment opportunities for women and the right to
 hold public office and perform public functions at all levels.
 In order to bring into effect major obligations under the
 convention, the Government has introduced into parliament the
 Sex Discrimination Bill of 1983.
 In the 1983 federal elections more women were elected than ever
 before:  six in the 125-member House of Representatives and 13
 in the 64-member Senate.
 The Government acknowledges that the aboriginal population of
 about 180,000 is the most disadvantaged group in such areas as
 education, housing, health, and employment. The Government has
 a broad range of programs aimed at providing services to
 aboriginals available to other Australian, plus additional
 services to improve their socio-economic conditions.
 Australia came under harsh criticism by some aboriginal groups
 at the U.N. Working Group on Indigenous Populations meeting in
 Geneva in August 1983. They charged that some sites sacred to
 the aboriginals were being endangered. There have been
 confrontations between aboriginal groups and mining and tourism
 development companies over the protection of sacred sites. The
 Federal Government has stated its intention to introduce
 national legislation to strengthen protection of sacred sites.
 The aboriginals also claimed that they lacked effective land
 rights in several Australian states. The question of land
 rights on aboriginal reserves has been of continuing
 controversy in Australia. The Federal Government is committed
 to a consistent national approach to land rights and is
 developing a set of principles to apply in all states and
 territories.
