 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a federal system of government and a long history as a multiparty
 parliamentary democracy. The judiciary is independent.
 Federal, state, and local police are under the firm control of civilian authorities
 and carry out their functions in accordance with the law.
 A highly develop d economy, which includes manufacturing, mining, agriculture,
 and services, provides most people with a high per capita income. A wide range of
 government programs offers assistance for disadvantaged citizens.
 The Government respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judi-
 ciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse. The Gov-
 ernment administers many programs to improve the socioeconomic conditions of
 Aboriginals and Torres Straits Islanders, who together form about 2 percent of the
 population, and to address longstanding discrimination against them. Societal dis-
 crimination and violence against women are problems, that are being actively ad-
 dressed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits all such practices.
 Human rights observers allege a pattern of mistreatment and abuse of indigenous
 people by police (see Section 5).
 Prison conditions meet international standards, and the Government permits vis-"
 its by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the executive and legislative branches respect its provisions. There is a
 well-developd system of federal and state courts, wit hthe High Court at its apex.
 Almost all criminal trials are conducted by courts established under state and terri-
 torial legislation. The Federal Court and the High Court have very limited roles to
 play. When trials are conducted in local courts, the magistrates sit alone. In the
 higher courts, namely the state district or county courts and the state or territory
 supreme courts, trials are usually conducted by judge and jury. The jury decides on
 the facts and verdict after a trial conducted by a judge. The law provides for the
 right to a fair trial, and the judiciary vigorously enforces this right. There were no
 reports of political prisoners.
 f.Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Australia does not have a bill of rights. In two
 decisions, the High Court has indicated that freedom of political discourse is implied
 in the Constitution. The Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 ent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system com-
 bine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although these rights are not
 codified in law, citzens exercise them without government restriction.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Citizens have complete freedom of religion. A provision
 of the Constitution precludes the adoption of a state religion.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There is no provi-
 sion for frst asylum. The Government either grants a protection visa with fuU resi-
 dence and employment rights in Australia, or refuses it, with no in-between meas-
 ures. The Government has continued to forcibly expel persons who it has deter-
 mined do not have a valid claim to refugee status. Human rights and refugee lobby
 groups maintain that the Government's refugee and asylum adjudication process is
 applied inconsistently.
 Under the Migration Reform Act of 1994, asylum seekers who arrive at the border
 without prior authorization to enter the country are automatically detained, but
 may be released from detention if they meet certain criteria-including age, ill-
 health, and experiences of torture or other trauma. The majority of asylum seekers
 are detained for the duration of the often-prolonged review process. The detention
 policy has led to extensive litigation initiated byhuman rights and refugee lobbies
 charging that the sometimes lengthy detentions violate the human rights of the asy-
 lum seekers. In 1994-95, Australia accepted 13,362 migrants under the humani-
 tarian program, which accepts refugees and those in refugee-like situations in ur-
 gent need of resettlement. In addition, 1,407 persons (out of 8,802 applicants) al-
 ready in Australia were granted refugee status in the same period. Regular migra-
 tion figures for this period were 44,500 in the family category and 30,400 in the
 skills category.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and mandatory voting. On March
 2, 13 years of Labor Party government at the federal level ended when voters re-
 turned a Liberal-National Party coalition Government to power in the House of Rep-
 resentatives.
 No legal impediments prevent women and indigenous people from holding public
 office. However, historical patterns of bias against women and the deleterious effects
 of poor educational achievement and a generally inferior socioeconomic status for in-
 digenous people have contributed to their underrepresentation among political lead-
 ers. Approximately 22 percent of Members of Parliament (M.P.'s) are women. The
 percentage increased from 14 percent as a result of the 1996 election. There are no
 Aboriginas serving as M.P.'s.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction
 (and in some instances with government funding), investigating and publishing
 their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are cooperative and re-
 sponsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on the above listed factors, and the Gov-
 ernment and an independent judiciary vigorously enforce the prohibition.
 Women.-Social analysts and commentators estimate that domestic violence may
 affect as many as one family in three or four. The Government recoguizes that do-
 mestic violence and economic discrimination are serious problems, and the statu-
 torily independent Sex Discrimination Commissioner actively addresses these prob-
 lems and other areas of discrimination. Government statisticians state that, because
 of underreporting and the lack of an agreed method for collecting statistics, it is im-
 possible to provide an accurate national profile of the number of women who are
 victims of domestic violence.
 Women have equal status under the law, and the law provides for pay equity.
 There are highly organized and effective private and public women's rights
 organisations at the federal, state, and local levels. There is a federal-level Office
 of the Status of Women which monitors women's rights. The Federal Sex Discrimi-
 nation Commissioner receives complaints and attempts to resolve those that are
 deemed valid. A 1994 U.N. report estimated that women receive approximately 90
 percent of wages paid to men for substantially similar work.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education, day care,
 
 
 and medical care. The Federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
 receives complaints and attempts to resolve those it finds vaid. Similarily, the six
 states and two territories investigate complaints of neglect or child abuse and insti-
 tute practical measures aimed at protecting the child when such complaints prove
 founded. The Government has enacted strict new legislation aimed at restricting the
 trade in, and possession of, child pornography and which further allows suspected
 eophiles to be tried in Australia regardless of where the crime was committed.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-Legislation prohibits discrimination against disabled
 persons in employment, education, or other state services. The Disability Discrimi-
 nation Commissioner promotes compliance with federal laws prohibiting discrimina-
 tion against disabled persons. The Commissioner also promotes energetic implemen-
 tation and enforcement of state laws that require equal access and otherwise protect
 the rights of disabled persons.
 There is no federal legislation mandating the uniform provision of accessibility for
 the disabled. It is lawful to deny employment or services to those with disabilities
 if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the disabled person would be un-
 able to carry out the work or would require the employer or service provider to fur-
 nish services or facilities which could not reasonably be provided.
 Indigenous People.-The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin. The Ministry
 for Aboriginal Affairs, in conjunction with the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander
 Commission (ATSIC), has the main responsibility for initiating, coordinating, and
 monitoring all governmental efforts to improve the quality of life of indigenous peo-
 ple. A wide variety of government initiatives and programs seek to improve all as-
 pects of Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander life.
 In practice, however, indigenous Australians continue to experience significantly
 higher rates of imprisonment, inferior access to medical and educational infrastruc-
 tures, greatly reduced life expectancy rates, elevated levels of unemployment, and
 general discrimination which contribute to an overwhelming feeling of disenfran-
 chisement.
 Nationally, indigenous people are imprisoned at over 15 times the rate of non-
 indigenous people. Over 45 percent of Aboriginal men between the ages of 20 and
 30 have been arrested at some time in their lives. The incarceration rate for indige-
 nous juvenile offenders is 21 times that of nonindigenous juveniles. Indigenous
 groups claim that the Government's lack of response to a series of recommendations
 by the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody contributes to
 these disturbing statistics. Human rights observers claim that socioeconomic condi-
 tions ive rise to the common precursors of indigenous crime, e.g., unemployment,
 homelesaness, and boredom.
 During a 12-month reporting period ending in July, 21 Aboriginal people were re-
 ported to have died in custody or during police operations. The five Aborigines who
 died "under the custodial authority of the police" all died of injuries which were not
 inflicted by the police. Injuries were suffered in fights or accidents before the pris-
 oners were taken into custody. The 16 Aborigines who died in prison died of hanging
 (7), natural causes (7), and injuries (2). Of the seven who died of natural causes,
 five died of cardiovascular disease. This s the highest number of Aboriginal deaths
 in custody in a single 12-month period since records were first collected in 1980.
 Each death in custody is subject to a full and complete coroner's inquiiy, no police
 have been charged with causing deaths in custody since 1980. Although indigenous
 people make up only 1.3 percent of the total adult population over 14 years of age,
 they account or almost 14 percent of the prison population and approximately a
 quarter of custody-related deaths. During the same time frame, 65 non-Aborigines
 died in police custody or during police o pe rations.
 Indigenous groups charge that police harassment of indigenous people is pervasive
 and that racial discriiation among poie and prison custodians persists. A
 human rights delegation that visited Australia in March alleged a pattern of ill-
 treatment and arbitrary arrests occurring against a backdrop of systematic discrimi-
 nation. In one study, 85 percent of juvenile indigenous suspects reported being hit,
 punched, kicked, or slapped by police. Most of the juveniles interviewed had com-
 plained about violence occurring after apprehension and during questioning about
 alleged offenses. Government statistics confirm the common perception among indig-
 enous people that they are systematically ill-treated by police. Government reports
 have suggested that the pursuit of economic self-determination for indigenous peo-
 ple would greatly assist in solving the crime problems in indigenous communities
 and the inequitites in rates of imprisonment.
 The average life expectancy of an indigenous person is 17 years less than that
 of a nonindigenous person. The infant mortality rate for indigenous children is 3
 
 
 592
 times that of nonindigenous children. The maternal mortality rate for indigenous
 women is 5 times that of nonindigenous women. The incidence of illnesses such as
 tuberculosis, leprosy, hepatitis, and of sexually transmitted diseases is 10 times
 greater among indigenous people than nonindigenous people. Data indicate that
 22.5 percent of indigenous children complete secondary education versus 76.2 per-
 cent of nonindigenous children. Calendar year 1995 figures from the Department of
 Education, Employment and Training show that the participation rate in university
 education for Aborigines is 2.4 percent (up from 1.8 percent in 1991) compared to
 2.7 percent for non-Aborigines.
 Government programs, including a $750 million Indigenous Land Fund and a
 Federal Social Justice Package, aim at ameliorating the real challenges faced by in-
 digenous Australians. The Government is also seeking ways to improve upon 1993
 Native Title Legislation which has been largely unsuccesful in assisting Aborigines
 to establish and pursue title to land.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law and practice provide workers, including
 public servants, freedom of association domestically and internationally. Approxi-
 mately 35 percent of the work force is unionized.
 Unions carry out their functions free from government or political control, but
 most local affiliates belong to state branches of the Australian Labor Party (ALP).
 Union members must make up at least 50 percent of the delegates to ALP con-
 greases, but unions do not participate or vote as a bloc.
 There are no restrictions on the right to strike. Legislation that went into force
 on March 30, 1994, for the first time legalized what had always been a de facto
 right to strike.
 Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers and labor leaders, and
 they are effectively enforced. In practice, employers tend to avoid legal remedies
 (e.g., secondary boycott injunctions) available to them in order to preserve a long-
 term relationship with their unions.
 Unions may freely form and join federations or confederations, and they actively
 participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law and practice provide
 workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively, and the law protects
 them from antiunion discrimination.
 Federal and state governments administer centralized minimum-wage awards and
 provide quasi-judicial arbitration, supplemented by industrywide or company-by-
 company collective bargaining.
 Legislation has aimed to facilitate decentralized collective bargaining, keyed to in-
 dividual enterprises, in order to relate wage increases more directly to gains in pro-
 ductivity. Workers can trade fringe benefits for greater wage increases but must
 register their agreement with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission,
 which insures that they suffer no net disadvantage. Legislation also provides for an
 industrial relations court to adjudicate disputes, especially the failure to bargain in
 good faith, arising from the increased use of enterprise bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there are no laws pro-
 hibiting it, forced labor is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no federally mandated
 minimum age for employment, but state-imposed compulsory education require-
 ments, monitored and enforced by state educational authorities, effectively prevent
 most children from joining the work force until they are 15 or 16 years of age. Fed-
 eral and state governments monitor and enforce a network of laws, which vary from
 state to state, governing minimum school-leaving age, minimum age to claim unem-
 ployment benefits, and minimum age to engage in specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-Although a formal minimum wage exists, it
 has not been relevant in wage agreements since the 1960's. Instead, 80 percent of
 workers are covered by differing minimum wage rates for individual trades and pro-
 fessions, all of which are sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a work-
 er and family.
 Most workers are employees of incorporated organizations. For them, a complex
 body of government regulations, as well as decisions of applicable federal or state
 industrial relations commissions, prescribe a 40-hour or shorter workweek, paid va-
 cations, sick leave, and other benefits, including at least one 24-hour rest period per
 week.
 Federal or state safety laws apply to every workplace.
 The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act of 1991
 provides federal employees with the legal right to cease work if they believe that
 
 
 particular work activities pose an immediate threat to individual health or safety.
 Most states and territories have laws that grant similar rights to their employees.
 At a minimum, private sector employees have recourse to state health and safety
 commissions, which will investigate complaints and demand remedial action.
