 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a tradition of democratic parliamen-
 tary rule. Queen Margrethe II is Head of State. The Cabinet, accountable to the uni-
 cameral Folketing (parliament), leads the Government. A majority coalition led by
 Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen took office in January 1993.
 Denmark has a unified national police. Its higher ranks are often filled with law-
 yers on internal rotation from the civil serviceIt is fully controlled by and respon-
 sible to civilian authorities. Personal freedoms and the right to pursue private inter-
 ests and to hold private property are protected by law and respected in practice.
 An advanced industrial state, Denmark has an economy with limited public own-
 ership, except in utilities and public transportation. The Government continues to
 seek ways to reduce the public sector's share of the economy. In 1993, for example
 the Government sold 51 percent of the Giro Bank, Denmark's fifth largest bank, and
 also privatized parts of the Copenhagen regional bus system.
 Deeply rooted democratic principles, an egalitarian tradition, a lively press, and
 highly developed educational and social we fare systems have made Denmark a
 leading defen er of human rights domestically and in the world. Anyone may pro-
 test to the Ombudsman, established by the Folketing as mandated by the Constitu-
 tion, if he or she feels wrongly treated by any national authority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--Such killings did not occur.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law. Torture does not occur. Allegations of inhuman
 treatment are rare, and there are legal means of redress if it occurs. Two cases al-
 leging excessive use of police force against two African tourists were investigated;
 the result was a 1992 fimding by a judicial inquiry that the force used was excessive,
 but that it was the result of individual action of one officer, not the result of govern-
 ment policy. While the Danish Government considers the case closed, it resurfaced
 in the Danish press in 1993, as some, including Amnesty International (Al), were
 unhappy with the result. Al expressed concern that the report of the inquiry had
 not accepted that force used against a detainee can qualify as cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading punishment, whether or not that treatment is deliberate or intended to
 frighten or coerce the detainee.
 An innovative center for torture victims (from abroad) at a Copenhagen hospital,
 supported by the Foreign Ministry, treats patients, assists torture victims, and stud-
 ies ways to counter the use of torture worldwide.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-No person may be deprived of personal
 liberty without due process of law. Those arrested must appear before a judge with-
 in 24 hours. A judge may order that they be held in pretrial detention, including
 detention in isolation, for a period up to the length of the prison sentence for the
 crime for which they were arrested. All accused have the right to obtain their own
 attorney or a public attorney. Bail is allowed. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Danish judicial system consists of a series of
 local and regional courts, and the Supreme Court at the apex. Trials are usually
 ublic; however, judges may make exceptions, e.g., in paternity and divorce cases.
 n criminal cases, trials are closed when necessary to protect a victim's privacy, such
 as in rape cases, or to safeg ard a witness' identity.
 The rights of the accused are carefully protected. Defendants have the right to be
 present, to confront witnesses, and to present evidence. They are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty. Both the defendant and the prosecution may appeal a sentence.
 The judiciary is fully independent. Judges appointed by the Minister of Justice serve
 until age 70. They may not be dismissed but may be impeached for negligence or
 criminal acts. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 constitutional prohibition against searching homes, seizing papers, and breaching
 the secrecy of communications without a court order is respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, an effective judiciary,
 and a democratic political system ensure freedom of speech and press. There is one
 large state-owned radio and television company. Editorial control is exercised by a
 board independent of the Government. A second national television channel is one-
 third government subsidized. In both cases, management decides programming con-
 
 
 857
 tent, but operational decisions are restricted by the television-radio law, which lim-
 its, for example, broadcast time reserved for commercials. Programs critical of the
 Government appear on both channels. Cable television and satellite dishes, which
 are now common, have greatly increased access to foreign news broadcasts.
 Private stations are restricted to transmitters of 10 watts for radio or 100 watts
 for television. Direct relay transmission of foreign radio broadcasts is prohibited, al-
 though they may be carried on the cable net. Publications, including books and
 newspapers, reflect a wide variety of political opinion. Academic freedom is re-
 spected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Danes may freely assemble
 and form associations. Public meetings require permits, which are routinely given.
 Any organization ma y affiliate with international bodies in its field.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom. The
 Evangelical Lutheran Church is the state church and is state supported. There is
 religious instruction in the schools in the state religion, but any student may with-
 out sanction be excused from religion classes with parental permission. No religion
 is banned or discouraged and conversion is unrestricted. No one may be discrimi-
 nated against for one's religious beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement 14ithin the Countfry, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Danes have full freedom of travel and movement. People determined to
 be refugees are never repatriated against their will. However, there is a growing
 popular desire to repatriate those who have been unsuccessful in establishing a le-
 gitimate claim to pelitica asylum. A 1991 decision by the Folketing made clear that,
 following due process, those denied asylum would be returned to their homelands.
 Meanwhile, asylum seekers who arrive in Denmark via another safe country are re-
 turned directly to that country,pursuant to the Dublin Convention.
 A large influx of asylum seekers from the former Yugoslavia began in September
 1992 and continued in 1993. Denmark's financial and logistical resources were
 stretched to help absorb the new arrivals. In 1992, 14,000 new asylum seekers en-
 tered Denmark. This was more than three times as many as came in 1991, and sig-
 nificantly more than came in the previous record years of the mid-1980's (the era
 of the IranyIraq war). In 1993 more than 15,000 asylum seekers arrived in Den-
 mark, more than 10,000 of whom came from the former Yugoslavia. As a result of
 this influx, the Government modified the countrys liberal asylum rules effective Oc-
 tober 10, 1992, and again on June 24, 1993. The first change revamped asylum
 claims processing to make it easier to determine a case to be "obviously groundless."
 The latter change imposed a requirement that would-be asylum seekers from the
 former Yugoslavia had to be prescreened by Danish authorities resident in Zagreb.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the former Yugoslavia can
 also refer needy cases to the Danish refugee adjudication center in Zagreb. These
 changes ptermitted Denmark to ontrol the inflow of asylum seekers from the former
 Yugoslavia in order to select refugees from the most troubled areas. After a slow
 startup and initial criticism from the Human Rights Center, the program has met
 with brad support in Denmark.
 The Government of Prime Minister Poul Schlueter fell in January as a result of
 the "Tamilgate" scandal. An investigation led by an independent prosecutor con-
 cluded that Schlueter knew of the illegal activities of a justice minister who had or-
 dered his ministry to slow its processing of family reunification petitions from Tamil
 refugees living in Denmark, with a view to pressuring the Tamils to return home.
 Although the investigation's conclusions were contested and denied, including by
 SIhlueter himself (who nevertheless announced his intention to resign the day the
 report was released), the scandal indicated that there was at least some high-level
 tolerance of, if not active support for, actions to limit the number of refugees in Den-
 mark. This scandal led to the first impeachment in 83 years by the Foketing. The
 case is now before a special court for trials of cabinet ministers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Danes have the right to change their government peacefully. Ministers are re-
 spe nsible to the Folketing and may be removed by a vote of no confidence. The
 Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen after consultation with parties in the
 Folketing. Parliamentary elections must take place every 4 years or earlier by deci-
 sion of the Prime Minister.
 The Folketing's 179 members are chosen in free and open elections under a com-
 plex system of proportional representation designed to help small parties and to re-
 fleet the popular vote. Twelve parties ran in the 1990 election; eight, with a wide
 range of political views, achieved the minimum 2 percent of the vote needed to ob-
 tain seats. The current Government is a four-party majority coalition. Danes 18
 
 
 years of age or over may vote. Foreigners who are permanent residents may both
 vote and run in local elections; such persons hold 13 city council seats nationwide.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on the participation of women in
 government or politics. Women head 7 ministries in the new Government, compared
 to 4 under the former Government, and hold 59 seats in the Parliament.
 The territories of Greenland (which has a primarily Inuit population) and the
 Faroe Islands (whose inhabitants have their own language) have democratically
 elected home rule governments with broad powers encompassing all but foreign and
 security affairs. Greenlanders and Faroese are Danish citizens and enjoy the same
 human rights as people in the rest of Denmark. Each territory elects two represent-
 atives to the Folketing.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights organizations operate freely. The Danish Center for
 Human Rights, a government-funded institution, conducts research and provides in-
 formation on human rights. Denmark is party to various international human rights
 conventions that promote and protect human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The extensive state welfare system ensures that every member of Danish society
 regardless of race, religion, sex, age, disability, or ethnic background is provided
 with food, shelter, health care, education, and training. The rights of indigenous
 people are carefully protected. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohib-
 ited.
 Women.-Denmark places no restrictions on the participation of women in the ci-
 vilian work force. Women hold positions of authority throughout society, including
 in politics, though they are less well represented at the top of the business world.
 Some 75 percent of all women between the ages of 16 and 66 belong to the work
 force; 46 percent of the work force is female, while 23 percent of all supervisors are
 women. Wage inequality exists, but wages are generally high for both men and
 women. Denmark has laws that guarantee equal pay for equal work and that pro-
 hibit job discrimination on the basis of sex. Women have and use the legal recourses
 available to them when they feel discriminated against.
 Danish authorities do not tolerate, in law or in practice, violence or abuse against
 women or children. Crimes against women and children are considered serious;
 cases are investigated promptly by the State, and appropriate action is taken swift-
 ly. However, according to the Danish National Institute of Social Research, less than
 10 percent of cases involving domestic violence are reported. Denmark has no spe-
 cific programs for the prevention of rape and domestic violence, although the Coun-
 cil for Prevention of Crime publishes a pamphlet entitled "Rape Can Be Prevented."
 There are 34 crisis centers for counseling and housing victims (plus a number of
 counseling centers without overnight facilities) which are supported by local govern-
 ments, volunteer workers, and donations. In addition, Denmark has centers for
 abused men, women, and families.
 Children.-Children in Denmark are protected by law; parents are required to
 protect children from physical and psychological abuse. The authorities act quickly
 to protect children from actually or potentially abusive or neglectful parents. Par-
 ents regardless of income, receive the equivalent of about $1,300 per year for each
 child younger than 7 years old and about $1,000 per year for children from 7 to 17
 years old. At least 20 percent of the total Danish social welfare budget is allocated
 to children and youths younger than 18 years.
 Indigenous People.-The rights of the people in Greenland and the Farce Islands
 are fully protected. Greenlandic law is specially designed for Inuit customs. It pro-
 vides for the use of lay people, rather than experts, as judges. Most prisoners are
 sent to holding centers-rather than prisons-where they are encouraged to work,
 hunt, or fish during the day. The Greenlandic Government again in 1993 rejected
 suggestions that the treatment of criminals be made more severe. This rejection was
 based partly on the experience of Greenlandic prisoners in Danish jails (they have
 a very difficult time adapting to confinement) and partly on the expense of building
 a prison. In Greenland, education is provided to the native population in the Inuit
 language.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-The inflow of ethnically and racially diverse
 refugees and immigrants (mostly Iranians, Palestinians, and Sri Lankans, but since
 late 1992, overwhelmingly former Yugoslavs) has provoked a degree of tension be-
 tween Danes and immigrants. Incidents of random, racially motivated violence do
 
 
 859
 occur, but are rare. The Government effectively investigates and deals with all cases
 of racially motivated violence.
 Overtly racist or neo-Nazi groups are few and small in size, and monitored closely
 by police. Swastikas and antiforeigner graffiti do exist in certain areas. Violent acts
 against refugees are rare. A woman active on behalf of refugees was beaten in Co-
 penhagen, and two Albanian asylum seekers were attacked by three young Danish
 men. The case against the woman's assailant remains unresolved, but in the other
 case, the three men were prosecuted. Several politicians who have openly called for
 greater tolerance towards refugees have received hate mail and telephone calls. The
 former Turkish-born deputy mayor of Farum, the first immigrant ever to be elected
 to so high a post in Denmark, received telephone threats within the first week of
 taking office, The authorities investigated the threats, but did not find those respon-
 sible or the calls.
 Refugees and asylum seekers can apply for Danish citizenship upon completing
 6 years residence and passing a language examination. Foreign-born, non-Nordic
 Danish citizens and legal permanent residents, however, suffer from significantly
 higher unemployment rates than Nordic residents and citizens. Some naturalized
 citizens have complained of job discrimination on the basis of race but have so far
 been unable to prove that they were discriminated against. Legislation prohibits job
 discrimination on the basis of race and provides for legal remedies.
 In 1991 the Supreme Court rejected discriminatory racial and ethnic quotas in
 public housing which had been imposed by some towns to limit the number of immi-
 grants who can live in a building. As a result, the quota system was dropped. Pro-
 ponents claimed such limitation prevented ghettos. In 1993 about 5 municipalities
 refused to accept their share of the recent arrivals, despite rules and directives that
 they do so, because they objected to the cost and did not want the ethnic mix of
 the communities to be upset. The Government responded by forcing the municipali-
 ties to accept the refugees. In one case, the dissenting city councilors were found
 in contempt, and fines were imposed. The fines were never collected as the city
 council eventually accepted the Government's position and took the refugees.
 People with Disabilities.-The extensive social safety net ensures that the special
 needs of the disabled are addressed. Danish building regulations provide for special
 installations for the handicapped in public buildings built or renovated after 1977.
 Older buildings which change the nature of their use also must meet the regulations
 for public access. The code calls for easy access for the handicapped, defined as
 level-free access to the ground floor and at least one restroom equipped for use by
 the handicapped. The Danish Act on Social Welfare includes the provision of finan-
 cial assistance for the alteration of private dwellings to accommodate the special
 needs of those in wheelchairs or needing other special equipment and for assistance
 in purchasing vehicles with special accessories for the disabled. The Center for
 Equal Treatment of the Handicapped was launched in August 1993. The Center is
 a consultative body that assists communities and individuals to ensure that existing
 regulations concerning the handicapped are followed. There is no Danish anti-
 discrimination legislation in connection with equal employment for the handicapped.
 However, a written rule on hiring in the civil service states that preference should
 be given to the handicapped individual when other factors are the same.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law states that all workers, including military
 personnel and the police, may form or join unions of their choosing. Approximately
 80 percent of Danish wage earners belong to unions, which are independent of the
 Government and politicar parties. The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO)
 which includes about half of the country's work force, remains closely associated
 with the Social Democratic Party. Over the years (but not in 1993) there have been
 a few-but widely reported-incidents in which workers who joined trade unions not
 affiliated with the LO were harassed or rejected by members of the mainstream
 unions in the workplace. All but civil servants and the military have the right to
 strike. The number of days not worked due to labor conflicts in 1992 was 62,800
 (down from 101,000 in 1991). Unions may affiliate freely with international organi-
 zations and do so actively. Worker rights, including full freedom of association, have
 the same respect in Greenland and the Faroe Islands as in the rest of Denmark.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers and employers ac-
 knowledge each other's right to organize. Collective bargaining is widespread. The
 law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members and or-
 ganizers, and there are mechanisms to resolve disputes. Employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 In the private sector, salaries, benefits, and working conditions are agreed upon in
 biennial negotiations between the various employers' associations and the union
 
 
 860
 counterparts. In the event of a stalemate, the Confederation of Danish Employers'
 Associations and the LO conduct these negotiations. If the negotiations fail, a na-
 tional conciliation board mediates, and its proposal is voted on by management and
 labor. If the proposal is turned down, the Government may force a legislated solu-
 tion on the parties (usually based upon the mediators' proposal). The agreements,
 in turn, are used as guidelines by the rest of the labor market, including the public
 sector. Collective bargaining in the public sector is conducted between the public
 sector employees' unions and government representatives, led by the Finance Min-
 istry.
 Labor relations in Greenland are conducted in the same manner as in Denmark.
 Working conditions are negotiated through collective bargaining, usually led by the
 largest Greenlandic union, SIK, which has about 8,000 members, about one-half of
 the indigenous work force. In disputes, Gree~ilandic courts are the first recourse, but
 Danish mediation services or the Danish Labor Court may also be used.
 In the Fares, there are unions but no umbrella labor organization. Labor rela-
 tions in principle are a matter between management and labor. Between them, they
 decide on salaries, wages, and terms of employment. Should the parties not be able
 to reach an agreement, a mediator is called in to resolve the dispute. Faroese legis-
 lation regulates conditions of apprenticeship, cost-of-living adjustments to nego-
 tiated wages, minimum wages in the fisheries sector, length of the workweek, and
 annual vacations.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for full-time
 employment is 15. The law prescribes specific limitations on the employment of
 those between 15 and 18 years of age, and it is enforced by the Agency for Super-
 vision of Labor Standards, an autonomous arm of the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage, but the lowest wage in any national la or agreement is sufficient for
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The law provides for 5 weeks
 of paid vacation, and a 37-hour workweek is generally observed. The law prescribes
 conditions of work, including safety and health; duties of employers, supervisors,
 and employees; work performance; rest periods and days off- and medical examina-
 tions. The Labor Inspection Service ensures compliance with labor legislation. Work-
 ers may remove themselves from hazardous situations without jeopardizing their
 employment, and there are legal protections for workers who file complaints about
 unsafe or unhealthy conditions.
 Similar conditions of work are found in Greenland and the Faroes, except that
 their workweek is 40 hours. Unemployment benefits in Greenland are either con-
 tained in labor contract agreements or come from the general social security system.
 A general unemployment insurance system in the Faroe Islands was established in
 August 1992, replacing former unemployment compensation covered by the social
 security system. Sick pay and maternity pay, as in Denmark, fall under the social
 security system.
