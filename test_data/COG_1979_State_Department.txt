 CONGO
 Although there has been an encouraging net improvement in
 human rights conditions and practices in 1979, there re-
 mains considerable room for improvement. For example,
 strong government emphasis on ideology and propaganda
 affects freedom of information, expression and assembly.
 Ethnic and regional rivalries, traditionally an impediment
 to national unity and serious economic development, are a
 source of government concern, attention and action. The
 government and the Congolese Worker's Party (PCT) took
 significant measures in 1979 toward attaining the regional-
 ethnic reconciliation and internal stability which have
 eluded the Congo since the assassinations of President
 Marien Ngouabi and Cardinal Bayenda in March 1977. These
 actions included single list national, regional, and com-
 munal elections, as well as a constitutional referendum in
 July; a general amnesty of more than 80 political prisoners
 in August; the doubling of party membership in the same
 period; and reintegration into the civil service of a
 majority of persons who were earlier in the year excluded,
 suspended, or reprimanded by the Congolese Workers' Party.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no legal prohibition on the use of torture.
 However, the new constitution contains a provision which
 guarantees the inviolability of the person. There have
 been no allegations of torture in the Congo during 1979.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment in the Congo during 1979. While
 neither permitted by law nor officially condoned, the use
 of torture in interrogations has been reported occasionally
 in the past. Prison conditions are poor and prisoners lack
 adequate diet and health care. Where conditions of inade-
 quate diet and health care occur in prisons, they apparently
 are due more to the depressed state of the economy than to
 policies or actions of the regime.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Following the general amnesty of political detainees in
 August 1979, there is neither government acknowledgement
 nor independent evidence that other political prisoners are
 being held, with the exception of former President Yhomby-
 Opango. Yhomby-Opango has been under house arrest since
 March in accordance with a resolution passed at the time by
 the Third Extraordinary Congress of the PCT. The resolution
 demanded Yhomby-Opango's "immediate exclusion from the PCT,
 the confiscation of all his possessions for the benefit of
 the people and of the revolution, his immediate arrest
 together with his acolytes, and his placement before a
 
 
 53
 popular authority for the crime of high treason." Yhomby-
 Opango has not yet been tried in the courts.
 The new constitution of July 1979 provides that no one may
 be indicted, arrested or detained except in cases determin-
 ed by laws promulgated prior to the infraction in question.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Congolese court system, generally based on the Napoleonic
 code, includes a Supreme Court which rules on the constitu-
 tionality of laws passed and can overrule Apellate Court
 decisions; a Court of Appeals; local tribunals; and an
 Accounting Court with responsibility for matters pertaining
 to the financial transactions of the State and those of
 parastatal enterprises. The Revolutionary Military Tribunal
 and the military courts function apart from the civilian
 court system. At present, the Revolutionary Military
 Tribunal focusses largely on cases involving diversion,
 fraud and embezzlement of public funds.
 There is a right to public trial in all circumstances,
 except in cases of court martial by military courts under
 the new constitution. The right to counsel is guaranteed
 in all circumstances including cases litigated in the
 military courts. Trial procedures are similar to those in
 other states with a Napoleonic code tradition. A fairly
 large corps of professional lawyers is assisted by judges
 elected by the communal assemblies. Apart from the ad hoc
 nature of the military tribunals, which fall outside of the
 normal judicial system in the Congo, the Congo appears to
 provide a reasonably fair judicial process.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 According to the new constitution, the home is inviolable.
 The law requires a warrant for search of a house. How-
 ever, in times of severe political crises, this require-
 ment has been violated in practice, as occurred in 1977
 following the assassination of President Marien Ngouabi.
 Houses and belongings of persons convicted or accused of
 serious crimes against the State may be subject to confis-
 cation by the State, as in the case of former President
 Yhomby-Opango.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Congolese economy consists of state, parastatal and
 private enterprises. High underemployment, over re-
 liance on the petroleum sector, high inflation and poor
 management have impeded sustained economic growth. None-
 theless, the government places high priority on the fulfill-
 ment of basic human needs. The greater part of both the
 national budget and foreign assistance is directed toward
 improving agriculture, education, health and housing. The
 Congo has a literacy rate in excess of 90 percent; almost a
 third of the annual budget is devoted to education. None-
 theless, the quality of life has generally deteriorated as
 the result of prolonged economic difficulty. For example,
 national health care is suffering during the current eco-
 nomic crisis. There are significant shortages of medicines
 and limited funds available for preventive medicine.
 
 
 The government states that the Congo produced fewer goods
 and services in 1978 and 1977 than in 1976. Payments, trade
 and current account balances show deficits and are expected
 to worsen. Productivity of state enterprises is lagging
 even while government and parastatal employment rolls swell,
 and there is a significant time lag in payment of salaries.
 However, the current Congolese government has stated its
 determination to stabilize the economic situation. As
 a first step, the Congo and the IMF signed a standby
 agreement in April 1979. Austerity steps have also been
 announced aimed at economic recovery within the performance
 targets of the IMF standby arrangement.
 The Third Extraordinary Congress of the Congolese Workers'
 Party in March 1979 identified agriculture as the country's
 number one priority. The President on a number of occasions
 has publicly supported and encouraged foreign private
 investment. There is a liberal investment code. Increased
 gasoline and property taxes have made the tax structure more
 progressive. Receipts expected to accrue from increased
 income taxes are intended to benefit agricultural develop-
 ment.
 The government is taking measures to stamp out corruption
 -- one of the principal accusations against the previous
 regime -- by imposing stiff fines and prison terms.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The constitution makes specific provision for "freedom
 of expression, press, association, processions and dem-
 onstrations under conditions prescribed by law." As a
 matter of official policy and practice, these individual
 liberties are restricted in conformity with what the govern-
 ment considers to be the interests of state security and its
 Marxist-Leninist orientation. Considerable political
 indoctrination exists in the schools, the village hierar-
 chies, the various party and mass organizations and the
 government media. Some articles, books and journals whose
 political views are considered inimical to the party and
 government are censored or banned.
 The new constitution guarantees "freedom of religion in the
 context foreseen by the law" and prohibits the use of
 religion for political ends. Catholic and protestant
 churches are active throughout the Congo. The government,
 usually the Interior Ministry, sends a representative to
 major church conferences and other large religious gather-
 ings.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Congolese government does not restrict internal movement.
 A Congolese citizen who desires to travel abroad, however,
 must apply for an exit visa through the Office of State
 Security.   Medium to senior level government officials
 generally require official orders approved at the highest
 levels of government for foreign trips. Exit visas are
 sometimes denied when there is a concern about the numbers
 
 
 55
 of Congolese who, for economic reasons, are emigrating to
 such neighboring countries as Gabon.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The People's Republic of the Congo is a one-party Marxist-
 Leninist State, governed by a president who as chief of
 state is also president of the Council of Ministers, the
 supreme administrative and executive organ of the Congo,
 and of the Congolese Workers' Party.
 The one-party system and traditional regional and ethnic
 divisions, including the dominance in the government
 of northerners, restrict opportunities to participate in
 the political process.
 Congolese Labor Party membership is highly controlled on
 the bases of loyalty and performance. In August 1979,
 the government expelled, suspended or reprimanded approxi-
 mately 70 dissidents from the Congolese Workers' Party.
 Nonetheless, some weeks later, a large number of these same
 persons, along with others granted amnesty by the President
 for alleged political actions against the State, were
 authorized to assume designated civil service positions in
 various ministries and localities. In announcing the
 general amnesty in August, the President stated that no
 legal action had been taken against exiled political oppo-
 nents, none was being envisaged, and these persons were
 welcome to return in peace to the Congo to contribute to
 the country's development.
 While full equality of the sexes has not been obtained,
 there has been significant progress during 1979 in
 the condition of Congolese women. In this Afro-Marxist
 state, the government and its sole political party emphasize
 publicly the importance they attach to the liberation of
 women and to promotion of non-traditional roles women need
 to play in a developing country. The new constitution
 stipulates that women have the same rights as men in the
 private, political and social domains, and that they are to
 receive equal pay for equal work and to enjoy the same
 social insurance rights.
 The government from the President downward supports women's
 activities. Although there are no women ministers at
 present, a number of women occupy senior positions in the
 national government and party structure.  (In September a
 woman Appellate Court counselor presided over ceremonies
 installing another woman as president of the highest
 tribunal at Pointe Noire.)
 The women's organization, the Revolutionary Union of Congo-
 lese Women (URFC), is one of the most important of the PCT's
 mass organizations and commands a particular attention among
 government leaders. Polygamy continues to occur, but
 economic and social pressures from unremitting urbanization
 and modernization have contributed to a marked tendency
 toward monogamy. In secondary schools increasing numbers of
 young women are enrolled in agricultural, mechanical and
 technical courses, and university attendance is on the rise.
 Young women writers and poets are beginning to figure
 importantly in the Congo's rich and flourishing literary
 tradition. A number of television and radio newscasters
 are women, and prime time media programs are devoted to,
 and run by, women concerning their interests and careers.

 The Congolese Confederation of Trade Unionists, as an
 appendage of the state, represents workers, but the right
 to strike, bargain collectively and lobby is severely
 restricted.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Congolese Government has demonstrated its willingness
 to listen and respond to human rights inquiries on a case-
 by-case basis. Several political detainees cited by Amnesty
 International in its 1978 and 1979 reports on the Conqo, includinq the
 celebrated case of Dr. Pascal Lissouba, are among those
 granted clemency this year.
