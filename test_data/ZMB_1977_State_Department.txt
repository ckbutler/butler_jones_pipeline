 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state with a strong presidency
 and extensive constitutional guarantees of human
 rights. To some extent,-these guarantees have been
 impaired or suspended by the continuing existence of a
 state of emergency in Zambia, which is deemed necess-
 ary by the government due to the external pressures
 resulting from the armed struggles for majority rule
 and self-determination in neighboring Rhodesia and
 Namibia.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includ-
 ing Freedom fromt
 a. Torture
 We have no evidence of torture practiced by the
 Zambian authorities, although beatings and other
 maltreatment were alleged-in the case of-Rhodesian.-
 nationalists detained following-a period of interne-
 cine violence in'1975.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is
 not practiced to our knowledge in Zambia, although
 Zambian prisons are acknowledged to be crowded and
 unsanitary. Health care for prisoners may not always
 be adequate, although it is available in emergencies.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under the State of Emergency which is considered to
 have been in effect since independence, the President
 of Zambia has wide discretion to detain or restrict
 the movements of individuals. Those so detained enjoy
 certain rights, among them the right to receive notice
 of the reason for detention, publication of the fact
 of detention, access to counsel, and the right to seek
 judicial review of the detention order after one year.
 However, habeas corgus is not available to persons
 detained under presidential order, and the detaining
 authority is not obliged to accept the recommendations
 of the Judicial Review Tribunal. The Zambian courts
 have consistently upheld the presidential detention
 authority.

 The President's detention powers have been used
 in recent years against political opponents, unruly
 Rhodesian nationalists and dissident Namibians, common
 criminals, striking university students and profess-
 ors, and violators of currency control regulations.
 In most cases, detainees are either released or
 formally charged once investigation of their cases
 has been completed, but a few have been continuously
 detained for years. There is no reliable estimate of
 the number of persons currently under presidential
 detention order in Zambia, but it is probably somewhat
 below the 200 thought to have been detained as of
 mid-1976.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The citizen's right to a fair public trial is general-
 ly observed in Zambia, although this is not true ih
 the case of presidential detainees, In cases coming
 to court, the familiar safeguards of English common
 law are provided, and lawyers handling even sensitive
 political cases have expressed their continuing
 confidence in the independence of the Zambian judic-
 iary. Individuals who consider that their rights have
 been or are likely to be contravened through unlawful
 arrest or detention may apply to the high court for
 redress; in 1972 several former political detainees
 successfully collected damages for assault and false
 imprisonment.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Except in extraordinary political cases, the sanctity
 of the home is observed in Zambia.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 In times of high copper prices, Zambia is one of the
 more fortunate African countries, with the resources
 to permit delivery of substantial medical, educational
 
 
 133
 and social services to the public. The government's
 policies are heavily weighted toward the welfare of
 the citizen.
 Zambia's dependence on copper has meant thatzwhen
 the world price is depressed (as it has been since
 1975), the Zambian Government's ability to provide
 basic services is substantially impaired. President
 Kaunda has recently thrown his full prestige behind
 efforts to diversify the Zambian economy, putting
 particular emphasis on developing Zambia's significant
 agricultural potential.
 There is no evidence that official corruption diverts
 significant resources away from development efforts or
 from the poor majority. President Kaunda has actively
 sought to communicate his own personal honesty to
 government officials, and has acted forcefully against
 violators of'the public trust.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought,,'expression and assembly are.-
 circumscribed by the constitutional ban-on all
 political activity outside the one-party structure
 (see paragraph 3c below).
 Although both Lusaka newspapers are controlled, one by
 the government and the other by the sole legal polit-
 ical party, "constructive" media criticism of govern-
 ment performance is permitted, and has been sharp and
 widespread for the past year, particularly in refer-
 ence to the government's economic policies. Criticism
 of the head of state and of the basic national philos-
 ophy, Humanism, is not allowed. Criticism of the
 President is punishable by fine or imprisonment.
 Censorship of foreign publications exists but is not*
 stringent.
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and
 
 
 134
 strongly supported by President Kaunda. The excep-
 tions have been'the Lumpa sect, which was banned in
 1964 following a series of bloody anti-government
 riots, and another small sect banned for alleged*
 sexual immorality. No systematic persecution of the
 controversial Jehovah's Witnesses has been reported in
 Zambia, although Zambian Witnesses have been subject
 to considerable public criticism by Zambian political
 leaders, and some localized harassment has undoubtedly
 occurred.
 The Zambia Council of Trade Unions is a relative-
 ly militant and independent organization whose member
 unions take a strong stand in defense of workers'
 interests.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 As noted above, the President may, under his emergency
 powers, restrict the movements of individuals within
 Zambia. The government also reserves the right to
 refuse or withdraw passports as a means of preventing
 foreign travel by individuals whose activities
 abroad are considered not in the best interests of.
 Zambia. Freedom to emigrate, however, has not been
 impaired by the Government.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Under the 1973 constitution, the United National
 Independence Party (UNIP) is designated the sole legal
 party in Zambia. Candidates for political office at
 any level must be members of UNIP, and are subject to
 "vetting" for suitability as candidates by higher
 party authority. In Zambia, this system is described
 as *one-party participatory democracy,O and the
 government maintains that competition within the
 one-party framework (including elections with uni-
 versal suffrage in which secrecy of the ballot is
 protected) gives adequate expression to the will of
 the citizenry.
 In 1971 Simon Kapwepwe, a former close associate
 
 
 135
 of President Kaunda, broke away from UNIP to form his
 own United Progressive Party (UPP). The UPP was
 banned and Kapwepwe rusticated in February 1972, when
 President Kaunda announced that Zambia would becone a
 one-party state. Kapwepwe and several of his senior
 followers rejoined UNIP in September, 1977, formally
 ending the UPP schism.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Zambian Government's human rights record has
 not been the target of intensive investigation in
 recent years, and there have been no requests for
 outside investigations of alleged violations. Amnesty
 International has criticized Zambian treatment of some
 Rhodesian detainees. The Government has not responded
 publicly to AI's criticism.
