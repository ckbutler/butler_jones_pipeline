 LEBANON
 The nature of the human rights situation is complex, because
 Lebanon has been beset by civil strife for several years and
 because foreign armies have occupied parts of the country. The
 Government's effective control is confined to greater Beirut, an
 area in which there also are challenges to central authority. Since
 its independence in 1943, Lebanon has been a parliamentary
 democracy modeled on the French system of a centralized government
 with a popularly-elected Chamber of Deputies. This is combined
 with the tradition of confessionalism: the roughly proportional
 representation of the country's different religious communities in
 government and the armed forces. The Lebanese system of government
 permits a wide range of political activity. Elections for the
 Chamber of Deputies (National Assembly) have traditionally been
 free, and competition is genuine. The last election, however, was
 in 1972 (deputies have a three-year term of office), and the
 Chamber has extended its own mandate four times, most recently from
 June 1983 to the end of 1984, because of continuing instability and
 the occupation of more than 80 percent of the country by rival
 domestic irregular forces and foreign armies.
 Political party activity and partisanship in Lebanon's civil
 conflict since 1975 has been largely organized along sectarian
 lines with most parties having well-armed militias. Lebanon's
 present government is headed by President Amin Gemayel, whose
 father is the founder and long-time leader of the Phalange Party.
 The Phalange has historically provided much of the manpower for the
 Lebanese Forces, one of the most important of Lebanon's rival
 militias. In the course of time, the Lebanese Forces has become
 substantially independent of the Phalange Party leadership.
 Political realignment currently is being discussed among Lebanese
 leaders. It is an attempt, in light of demographic changes since
 Lebanon gained independence, to reconcile differing perceptions of
 equality within the confessionalist framework. The basic principle
 of confessionalism is not in dispute by the majority of prominent
 Lebanese politicians.
 Lebanon has traditionally shown a high regard for human
 rights--former Foreign Minister Charles Malik played a leading role
 in the drafting of the United Nations Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights--but its ability to enforce respect for these rights
 has been greatly diminished by nine years of internecine warfare.
 Human rights since 1975 have been violated routinely on a massive
 scale by private militias and foreign forces throughout Lebanon
 although conditions have improved in most of the country since last
 year. Human rights have fared best in greater Beirut. Recent
 government decrees constricting press freedom and political
 activity, however, suggest that the Government is striving to put
 a cap on divisive forces in Lebanese society. Government
 restrictions of this type are new to Lebanon, and it should be
 noted that the special powers the National Assembly granted the
 Government to rule by decree lapsed in late October.
 During 1983, human rights in Lebanon were significantly affected
 by: 1) the continuing occupation of northern and eastern Lebanon
 by the Syrian army, numerous armed Palestinians, and 400-800
 Iranian Revolutionary Guards and of southern Lebanon by the Israel
 Defense Forces; 2) the Government's efforts to solidify its
 authority in greater Beirut; and 3) the Israeli withdrawal to the
 south bank of the Awali river in September and the subsequent
 month-long war involving the Lebanese army, various Lebanese
 militias, and, to an unclear extent, Syrian and Palestinian forces.

 Prospects for an improvement in human rights in Beirut as well as
 in the rest of Lebanon hinge on the forging of an intra-Lebanese
 consensus strong enough to permit the reestablishment of government
 authority throughout the country and the parallel demilitarization
 of Lebanese politics.
 The Lebanese economy, where it is able to function, remains one of
 the freest in the world. Many of the services normally provided by
 governments elsewhere are offered by private institutions. Average
 income is relatively high. A large middle class profits from
 commerce and service industries as well as substantial remittances
 from Lebanese working abroad. There is a wide disparity between
 urban and rural incomes. Even in Beirut, the influx of Lebanese
 and Palestinian displaced persons has led to the expansion of urban
 poverty, particularly among the Shi'a Muslims. As a result of
 recent fighting and uncertainty over the future, the economy is
 presently in deep recession.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 It is impossible to estimate accurately the number of civilian
 fatalities suffered during the periodic interfactional clashes
 throughout Lebanon and the sustained hostilities in September. In
 the latter, anywhere from 800 to 1,300 civilians may have died. No
 reliable sources have had complete access to all the contested
 areas to count the bodies, many of which have already been buried.
 It is also hard to differentiate between combatant and civilian
 when so many of the fighters are only part-time militiamen and
 virtually every household is armed. The Lebanese government's
 official published estimate of the number of people killed in
 fighting in Lebanon in 1983 was 3,240.
 The September fighting in the Shuf and Alayh districts resulted in
 numerous rumors of massacres of Christian and Druze villagers
 alike. Available evidence suggests that some of these reports are
 true. Many Druze civilians were killed in the village of Kafr
 Matta, but the exact number will probably never be known.
 Christians in Bhamdun were also murdered, and there are indications
 that similar killings took place in other Christian villages in the
 area. Hundreds of militiamen and civilians were killed before
 September during the intermittent clashes in the Shuf and Alayh
 between the Lebanese forces and the Druze Progressive Socialist
 Party that began in the Fall of 1982. There was also serious
 periodic internal fighting in Tripoli (often involving pro- and
 anti-Syrian groups); one unusually bloody two-day battle in October
 claimed the lives of 78 persons. Late in the year, heavy fighting
 between pro- and anti-Arafat forces in the Tripoli area claimed the
 lives of 450 and wounded 1,050. Between 700-1,000 persons are
 believed to have died in countless terrorist incidents throughout
 Lebanon, both in areas occupied by foreign forces and those
 nominally under Government control. In Beirut, a car bomb in front
 of the Palestinian Research Center on February 5 killed 20 persons
 and wounded 100, and during one weekend in August, over 52 persons
 were killed by car bombs in Tripoli and Ba'albak. Seven persons
 died July 15 (including two soldiers in the Lebanese army) during
 an armed protest against the eviction of Shi'a squatters in West
 Beirut. The first fatality arising from a confrontation between
 Israelis soldiers and violent demonstrators occurred on May 6 when
 Israeli soldiers fired on schoolchildren in Tyre and killed one.
 On October 16 there was a confrontation between Israeli soldiers
 
 
 1327
 and a large crowd of Lebanese civilians engaged in a religious
 demonstration. It resulted in one Lebanese killed and six wounded
 when Israeli soldiers opened fire on the crowd. Subsequent Israeli
 conflicts with demonstrators have raised the total to perhaps a
 dozen. For the first time this year a significant number of
 foreigners in Lebanon were victimized by the massive car bombings
 that have claimed the lives of hundreds of Lebanese over the past
 few years. At least 78 Americans and Lebanese were killed by the
 bombing of the U.S. Embassy on April 18, and some 300 American and
 French Multinational Force soldiers died in separate bombings on
 October 23. Some 29 Israelis died in a bombing in Sidon on
 November 4. No definitive conclusions have been reached as to the
 perpetrators of these bombings, although most most of the evidence
 points to Iranians and Iranian-backed Lebanese, with Syrian
 acquiescence.
 At least 20 persons were killed in East Beirut and as far north as
 Jubayl during periodic shelling in the spring and summer from
 Syrian and Druze batteries in the mountains.
 Several dozen Palestinians have been murdered, mostly in southern
 Lebanon, but it is impossible to determine how many deaths were the
 culmination of threats to vacate their homes and how many were the
 victims of intra-Palestinian disputes. (Palestinians suspected of
 collaborating with the Israelis or the Lebanese Government are
 often assassinated.) It is possible that some of the deaths were
 engineered by landlords eager to eliminate their tenants to be able
 to raise the rent for the next tenants.
 There is no evidence that the Lebanese Government participates in
 or condones the arbitrary killing of civilians. There have been
 allegations from surviving family members in 1983 of killings in
 government detention centers, but none have been verified by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has been
 permitted by the Government to visit some of the prisons and
 detention centers. Arbitrary killing of civilians is, however,
 endemic to the militias, including those backed by the Syrians and
 the Israelis.
 There is always the fear of assassination for any prominent
 Lebanese. Prime Minister Wazzan escaped an attempt on his life on
 July 7 when a car bomb detonated near his office in West Beirut
 several minutes before his own car passed by.
 Shelling has emerged as a means of signaling dissatisfaction with a
 party or applying immediate political pressure. During 1983, Druze
 artillery and mortars four times closed Beirut International
 Airport, only once as part of a military campaign. Similarly, the
 shelling of East Beirut suburbs and adjacent areas in May was
 generally interpreted as an indication of Syrian displeasure over
 the Israeli-Lebanese Agreement.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances following abductions are common in Lebanon.
 Responsibility is usually attributed to the various militias and
 foreign forces, but government security forces regularly detain
 persons without complying with legal procedures. The number of
 persons detained by the Government is about 350. Detention
 normally does not exceed several months.
 Kidnapping, sometimes with a view to an exchange of hostages but
 often followed by murder, has been a consistent characteristic of
 the Druze-Christian rivalry in the Shuf mountains. There is some
 
 
 1328
 evidence to support accusations from Amal, the Shi'a organization,
 that through the summer the Christian Lebanese Forces, with the
 acquiescence of the Government, abducted Amal members from
 streetcorners in West Beirut. Also, about 15 Palestinians,
 including schoolgirls as well as young men, disappeared from
 Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut and are believed to have been
 abducted by the Christian Lebanese Forces. There are also
 widespread allegations of abductions of West Beirut Muslims by the
 Christian Lebanese Forces during the early months of 1983. At
 least some of these reports probably are true.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Government officials publicly state that they do not permit
 torture, but accusations to the contrary by most opposition groups
 are common. There are reliable reports that both the Surete
 Generale (security police) and the Lebanese Army systematically use
 the threat of torture in the interrogation of suspects and security
 prisoners. Further, some detainees in army prisons, who were
 transferred there after having been held by the Phalange-dominated
 Lebanese Forces, bore signs of ill treatment upon their arrival.
 Nonetheless, torture in Lebanese jails is not widespread and prison
 conditions are relatively good. Palestinians who have been
 detained for up to six weeks have not shown ill-treatment upon
 their release. Prisons in Beirut (less so outside the city) are
 still overcrowded, but sanitation and diet are satisfactory. In
 principle, families are accorded visitation privileges, but, since
 the Government does not always acknowledge having detained security
 suspects, some detainees cannot receive visitors in practice.
 The treatment of prisoners held by militias, the Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO), the Syrians and the Israelis varies,
 but frequently is not good. Rough treatment and torture by the
 militias are common and sometimes lead to summary executions. The
 mutilated corpses found on the sides of highways are normally
 presumed to be the work of militias.
 Treatment of prisoners by the Israelis is better known than in
 other cases. Approximately 4,500 (mostly Palestinian) detainees
 held by the Israelis in Ansar Camp in southern Lebanon were
 released on November 24 as part of a prisoner exchange arranged by
 the ICRC between Israel and the PLO. Living conditions at the camp
 were poor. Some prisoners protesting the conditions burned their
 tents, and consequently the only shelter available was
 strung-together blankets. Latrines were primitive since the
 detainees destroyed a sewage trench, and only cold water outside
 showers were available. Diet was sparse, and there were no planned
 activities; the Israelis neither hindered nor assisted the
 prisoners' organization of classes, such as English. Medical care
 was rudimentary; one prisoner died of hepatitis shortly after being
 released on June 3, and the ICRC, which had regular access to
 Ansar, succeeded in securing the release of the majority of sick
 and wounded detainees. Psychologically disturbed prisoners
 reportedly remained unsupervised among the other detainees. Family
 visits were rarely permitted, and although detainees had personal
 possessions, they had no place to store them.
 
 
 1329
 Temporarily closed after the prisoner exchange, the Ansar Camp was
 reopened later in the year. At year's end, there were reportedly
 about 80 prisoners (mostly Lebanese) at Ansar, and approximately 50
 prisoners, also predominantly Lebanese, detained in a facility at
 Nabatiyah.
 There was no evidence of torture at Ansar. Twenty-seven detainees
 are believed to have died since the Camp's inception. Of these, at
 least six were shot by camp guards, the last one on June 13,
 allegedly for trying to escape. Six more detainees were crushed to
 death when an Israeli bulldozer broke through into an escape tunnel
 in which they were hiding. There are persistent but
 unsubstantiated reports that members of Sa'ad Haddad's militia,
 with Israeli knowledge, operate jails where torture and brutal
 treatment are employed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no way to estimate accurately the number of persons held
 by militias and foreign forces in Lebanon. The Lebanese Army has
 picked up at checkpoints and elsewhere thousands of security
 suspects since September 1982, but most are released within several
 months. The number of detainees has recently remained fixed at
 about 350, about half of whom are believed to be Palestinians. The
 Lebanese Army conducted only one broad security sweep in 1983, when
 42 persons were arrested in February.
 Of the prisoners formerly held by Israel at Ansar, some were
 arrested in wide, indiscriminate sweeps and some were detained
 after heeding an Israeli call to assemble in town squares following
 attacks on Israeli army personnel. The Israelis and the Syrians
 continue to detain large numbers of persons in extensive security
 sweeps following guerrilla attacks against their positions. No
 Ansar detainees had access to lawyers or the Lebanese legal system
 nor do detainees held elsewhere in Lebanon by Israel, Syria, or the
 PLO. The ICRC eventually gained access to and registered Ansar
 prisoners.
 With respect to the Lebanese Government, under Lebanese law, a
 suspect must be arraigned before an accusation committee (a panel
 of three judges) and the prosecutor within 48 hours, but in
 practice prosecutors sometimes hold a suspect for interrogation
 indefinitely without reference to a judge. Lebanese lawyers are
 presently lobbying to end this practice. Every prisoner has the
 right to legal counsel, but there is no public defenders office in
 Lebanon. In most cases, bail is permitted by the committee. In
 February, the Lebanese Army was given expanded powers to maintain
 public order in Beirut. Even these powers, however, require a
 suspect to be charged within five days and require the equivalent
 of a warrant before entering a private building. These provisions
 are nonetheless often ignored in dealings with persons suspected of
 having engaged in a military attack or an association with a
 paramilitary group viewed as hostile to the Government, such as the
 PLO. Although it is difficult in Lebanon to distinguish between
 political and military dissent, no one has'been detained by the
 Government for peacefully expressing his political views, such as
 publicly advocating the resignation of the Government.
 The Government does not exile political opponents, but non-Lebanese
 security prisoners, including Palestinians resident in Lebanon,
 have been summarily deported. The fear of assassination by one of
 the militias or foreign forces in Lebanon has driven several
 prominent Lebanese into voluntary exile.
 
 
 1330
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In Lebanon today, the disposition of a criminal case ultimately
 depends upon the group in power in the particular district rather
 than the independent court system. Law, practice, and custom
 provide the right of a suspect to a fair trial by an independent
 judiciary, but judges on some occasions have been unwilling to pass
 judgment or impose sentences for fear of personal reprisal. This,
 as well as a shortage of judges and the difficulty of conducting an
 investigation in most of the country, can delay trials. The
 Government continues to try to resume operation of its court system
 in some areas outside its military control, like Tripoli, and the
 number of civil and criminal cases has increased accordingly. The
 Government court in Ba'albak, however, is not now functioning. New
 investigations have commenced, resulting in arrests for crimes
 committed since the civil war, like the 1976 assassination of U.S.
 Ambassador Francis Meloy.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under conditions of civil strife, foreign occupation, and anarchy,
 invasion of privacy is endemic throughout Lebanon, but the
 Government has no particular interest in controlling personal
 life. Lebanese law requires the Government to obtain the
 equivalent of a warrant before entering homes, except when the
 Lebanese Army is pursuing an armed attacker. In the large areas
 outside government control, homes are routinely invaded by militias
 and foreign forces. In the September fighting, houses of rival
 religionists in Beirut's southern suburbs and entire villages in
 the Shuf were burned by militias to discourage the return of their
 owners. Other dwellers were expelled from their homes to make them
 available to the militias' supporters. There was an outcry in 1982
 over the Lebanese Army's search of residences for weapons without
 warrants but few if any similar incidents have occurred in 1983.
 A contentious issue remains the future of structures illegally
 erected and occupied by Palestinian and Lebanese squatters on
 property now being reclaimed by their owners. In 1982, the
 Government bulldozed some of the illegal shantytowns near the
 airport but has halted this program following strong protests from
 the Muslim community.
 According to the American Friends Service Committee, more than
 3,000 Palestinians, renters as well as squatters, have abandoned
 their homes in and around Sidon in the wake of threats, some made
 openly by members of the Lebanese Forces, to leave their homes and
 enter a refugee camp. Similar problems are not believed to have
 arisen in Tyre or Nabatiyah, which also have large Palestinian
 populations.
 The Israelis have, on occasion, blown up the homes of people
 accused of being terrorists. On September 29, for example, Israeli
 radio announced that they had blown up a "terrorist's home" in the
 Palestinian refugee camp Ayn al-Hulwah, near Sidon.
 Checkpoints are a way of life in Lebanon, manned by private
 militias and foreign armies as well as Lebanese Government forces.
 Motorists are subject to searches of their persons and vehicles.
 Crime is a serious problem in Lebanon. Stores have been dynamited
 by competing merchants or someone wanting to settle a personal
 score. Those responsible sometimes spuriously claim political
 motivation in an effort at justification or to discourage
 investigation.
 
 
 1331
 with so many competing foreign and domestic, governmental and
 non-governmental, intelligence services in Lebanon, there are
 crisscrossing networks of informers in Lebanon. Some militias are
 organized sufficiently to employ conscription, and there were
 reports last spring that the Lebanese Forces were operating press
 gangs in East Beirut to replenish their ranks in the fighting
 against the Druze in the Shuf mountains. The Israelis have brought
 pressure on village and religious leaders in southern Lebanon to
 provide recruits for a Shi'a militia designed to complement the
 Israeli Army.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Censorship legislation was enacted in 1977 and implemented by the
 Government in September 1983, when all publications were required
 to submit their copy to the Surete Generale prior to publication.
 Previously, the Communist daily, an-Nida, was suspended for five
 days in February for allegedly slanderous criticism of the Lebanese
 Army, and an issue of The Economist newsmagazine which dealt with
 the Palestinians in Lebanon was not passed through customs. Other
 international newsmagazines have reached the newsstands with
 passages deemed offensive blacked out by a felt pen. Under the
 censorship legislation, a French-language newsweekly sympathetic to
 the Government, Nouveau Magazine, had an entire edition confiscated
 because of an article on the alleged massacre at Kafr Matta; the
 article charged that the Lebanese Army had coordinated its actions
 in Kafr Matta with the Phalangist Lebanese Forces, who are widely
 believed to have perpetrated the massacre.
 Throughout the ypar, foreign journalists have complained of the
 difficulty in obtaining visas (a problem shared by all visitors)
 and of picayune requirements such as, on one occasion, having each
 inch of blank videotape examined before being cleared from
 customs. Many of these practices, like censorship itself, are
 haphazard and unevenly applied; an item blacked out from one
 newspaper sometimes appears in another. During a Lebanese Army
 operation in West Beirut in July, which involved clashes with Shi'a
 militiamen, some soldiers manhandled a few foreign journalists, to
 the embarrassment of their superiors and the Government.
 Publications seldom print material objectionable to political
 groups able to exact retribution, but most are freely distributed
 and available, even in areas hostile to their editorial viewpoint.
 The press is diverse and, as long as it avoids issues considered
 contentious by the Lebanese Army, can still criticize the
 Government. Several extralegal radio stations operated by rival
 militias broadcast without serious interference, although the
 Government has hinted that it was contemplating bringing these
 under its control as well. There are no government-owned
 newspapers. Opposition groups complain that the
 government-controlled television and radio stations present news
 with a pro-government bias. The Syrians control Lebanon's
 satellite earth station and on occasion, like President Gemayel's
 first trip to the United States in 1982, deny the Lebanese newstape.
 Newspaper deliveries to Israeli-controlled southern Lebanon
 sometimes encounter delays at checkpoints. As-Safir, a leftist
 daily, has been banned from Sidon several times, and its reporters
 have been urged by the Israelis to delete references to the Israeli
 Army as an occupying force. Lebanese television has reported that
 its crews covering Israeli clashes with Shi'a demonstrators have
 been harassed. The media is heavily censored in areas under Syrian
 control.
 
 
 1332
 The Lebanese Army in February prohibited putting up posters in
 greater Beirut without its approval. It also outlawed the
 spreading of rumors likely to incite popular unrest. Violators are
 subject to prosecution before a military court. The poster
 regulation was designed to counter the proliferation of
 pro-Khomeini posters in some Shi'a neighborhoods, and in practice
 is universally ignored. There seems to be a gentlemen's agreement
 among government propagandists and Shi'a militiamen not to obscure
 each other's posters; many exist side by side.
 There is little government restriction on academic freedom at the
 country's four main universities. However, universities are not
 always permitted to import the books they select, particularly if
 they contain a Palestinian theme. American and other foreign
 professors deemed too sympathetic to the Palestinians have
 experienced exceptional delays in renewing their residence
 permits. Under a decree promulgated in October restricting the
 freedom of both political and nonpolitical associations, students
 are forbidden from participating in political activity at their
 places of learning.
 Journalists in the past have been threatened and even killed, but
 there is no known instance in 1983 of anything comparable.
 Publications normally avoid antagonizing groups able to exact
 retribution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government places no restrictions on the right of free
 assembly, as long as, under the new Army regulations, such an
 assembly does not incite popular unrest. The Government is
 presently not in a position to enforce this restriction, and in
 reality it is the militias and foreign forces who control public
 assembly.
 A new decree promulgated in late October requires existing and
 future associations, political and non-political, to apply for a
 license from the Ministry of the Interior, which also has the
 authority to review their financial records. A failure to grant a
 license within three.months constitutes a denial. No military or
 paramilitary branch independent of or subordinate to a parent
 organization is permitted. Also banned are groups with a "racist"
 or "sectarian" character. Government employees are denied the
 right to join a political party, or to join an association with a
 foreign connection. Lebanese societies abroad must also be
 licensed to open a branch office in Lebanon, and no foreigner may
 join a political association in Lebanon.
 In practice, the decree extends only as far as the Government's
 authority. The criteria the Government has adopted, if faithfully
 applied, would preclude the licensing of nearly every prominent
 association in Lebanon.
 The trade union movement is protected by laws permitting the right
 to organize, strike, and bargain collectively. There are also
 provisions for mediation and arbitration. Except for about five
 percent of the workforce, all workers belong to one of the 150
 unions and 18 labor federations comprising the Confederation of
 Lebanese Trade Unions. In theory, unions should exercise
 considerable influence, but in reality workers and the unions
 themselves are subject to pressure by militias and foreign forces.
 Economic strikes are rare, and even in Beirut, the unions
 concentrate on promoting policies designed to revive the depressed
 economy and to cut the high unemployment rate.
 
 
 1333
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In general, Lebanese can practice their religions freely. This is
 facilitated by the de facto segregation of most religionists,
 either at a regional, municipal, or neighborhood level.
 Accommodation among Lebanon's 14 recognized faiths was a
 cornerstone of the unwritten 1943 covenant delimiting government
 positions, but the civil war and subsequent fighting have had
 strong religious undertones. Members of one faith are often
 reluctant to travel into areas controlled by another, and, in many
 cases, religion and politics have become so intertwined that an
 individual's religion is taken as an indication of his political
 leanings. During inter-confessional clashes, like this year's
 Druze-Christian fighting, kidnappings and killings occur solely on
 the basis of religion.
 Religious distinctions historically are sharply drawn and are
 reinforced by the confessional system of government.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over matters of personal status;
 marriage, divorce, inheritance, and guardianship/adoption.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country has traditionally been free, subject to
 the practical consideration that large areas controlled by various
 militias, the Israelis, the Syrians, and the Palestinians are
 unsafe for members of some political and confessional groups.
 Foreign travel is not restricted. Beirut International Airport is
 used by members of every group and is an important national
 institution. Emigration and dual citizenship are allowed. There
 is no impediment to voluntary repatriation, although Lebanese who
 have been abroad and return home with forgery-prone old-style
 passports have had their passports invalidated at the airport
 pending verification of their entitlement to Lebanese citizenship.
 During this time, the bearers are effectively prevented from
 leaving the country legally.
 Throughout its history Lebanon has been a land of asylum.
 Approximately 200,000 Palestinians are registered with the United
 Nations Refugee and Works Administration, and perhaps 100,000 more
 reside without legal status in Lebanon. Many communities in
 Lebanon would like the Palestinians to leave. They fear one day a
 Palestinian state will be carved out of Lebanon, and they remember
 the harsh treatment inflicted on Lebanese by the Palestine
 Liberation Organization when it was powerful in West Beirut and
 much of southern Lebanon. This attitude is reflected in the
 numerous attacks on Palestinian homes and businesses in Beirut and
 Sidon, and the almost total absence of genuine sympathy for
 Palestinians in the wake of the 1982 massacres at Sabra and
 Shatilla.
 The Government is deeply suspicious of Palestinians, but seems
 presently resigned to accept some as refugees. Palestinians have
 no powerful advocate in Lebanon and have little recourse when they
 believe they are mistreated. There are indications of government
 discrimination against Palestinians. Syria took drastic action
 against Palestinians loyal to PLO Chairman Arafat, driving them out
 of Lebanon in December through force of arms.
 
 
 1334
 About half the persons arrested by the Government's security forces
 are Palestinians. Thousands of Palestinians who work in the
 Persian Gulf on Lebanese travel documents have difficulty renewing
 their documents. The delay may stem from a tremendous backlog of
 work at the Surete Generals, but several Palestinians have had
 their documents renewed with the provision that they not use them
 to return to Lebanon. Palestinians applying for renewal in Lebanon
 have an easier time.
 The Lebanese Government is engaged in a determined effort to deport
 all undocumented aliens, not just Palestinians. Some longtime
 Syrian residents have not had their residence permits renewed.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Lebanon's central government was unable to exercise authority in
 most of the country during the year due to the presence of two
 occupation armies, the PLO, and Iranian fighters and because of the
 continuing power of a variety of Lebanese militias. These
 circumstances hindered the exercise of popular political
 participation through constitutional structures; it was exercised
 instead largely by force of arms, and simultaneously hindered by
 coercion from the same source.
 The Government has not formally banned any political party in
 Lebanon, although a number of parties are operating without the
 government authorization required by the October decree.
 Parliamentary seats, although distributed confessionally, are
 contested on a party list basis. There has not been an election,
 however, since 1972 because of the security situation, and most
 parties can function openly only in areas controlled by their
 adherents or the Government. Many of the parties are dominated by
 individual families, who pass down the leadership mantle from
 generation to generation, but the proliferation of militarized
 associations in recent years has greatly diminished the authority
 and influence of the more traditional politicians in all religious
 communities.
 The President of the Republic, always a Maronite under the terms of
 the 1943 National Pact, is elected by the Chamber of Deputies. In
 the presidential elections since the civil war began in 1975, the
 vote, as on many important issues, has been heavily influenced by
 foreign forces in Lebanon; the occupying power of a region is able
 to exercise considerable influence on the deputies representing
 that area. Particularly in areas controlled by Syria, Deputies
 have been threatened, some have had their homes destroyed as a
 warning of punishment, and many others are in exile from their
 regions, either in the relative safety of Beirut or overseas.
 Syria, Israel, Iraq, Iran, and Libya also subsidize militias
 presently active in Lebanon.
 Government officials, including one minister, were threatened in
 1983 in an attempt to force a resignation or an alteration of
 policy. Deputies and Lebanese Army officers resident outside of
 Beirut have had their homes burned or bombed by militias or the
 Syrians unhappy with their performance for one reason or another.
 Three ministers trying to facilitate a Government-Druze
 understanding Were detained overnight in the Shuf by Druze forces.
 They were released unharmed.
 
 
 1335
 Party offices and buildings with political significance are
 frequent terrorist targets. In addition to bombings directed
 against the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. and French Multinational
 Force contingents, the Palestine Research Center was bombed in
 February. In early September another car bomb exploded at a
 building housing the first aid/medical services section of
 Murabitun, a Nasserist organization.
 Women enjoy the same legal rights as men regarding political
 participation, but as a result of cultural traditions, most women
 refrain from political activity. For this reason, there are very
 few women holding responsible positions in government.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The view of most agencies concerned with human rights in Lebanon is
 that it is premature to gauge Government attitudes toward their
 activities. Government officials often proclaim themselves
 supportive of human rights initiatives, but promised action, even
 from high officials, has not always been forthcoming. The ICRC has
 been able to visit some detainees in government prisons and has
 submitted to the Lebanese Government two surveys on human rights in
 the Beirut area. The ICRC devotes much of its time to areas
 outside government control. The neutral reputation of the ICRC,
 the International Catholic Relief Services, and other groups, has
 permitted them to locate missing persons, deliver relief supplies,
 and, most recently, collect bodies in disputed areas not easily
 accessible.
 The American Friends Service Committee published a detailed human
 rights report covering the summer of 1982 to August 1983. The
 report, which is divided into sections on the parts of Lebanon
 controlled by Syria, Israel, and the Lebanese Government,
 concentrates on the vulnerability of civilians to violent abuses
 and dislocation, the welfare of prisoners, and the attempts of
 occupying forces to interfere with the Lebanese economy and
 administration.
 Several European-based human rights groups, like OXPAM, maintain an
 interest in Lebanon but do not staff regular offices. There are
 several Lebanese groups, including one associated with the Prime
 Minister's office, dedicated to locating missing persons from a
 given area, but three attempts in 1983 to form a Lebanese umbrella
 human rights group failed.
 Amnesty International, in its 1983 report, expressed its concern
 about the massacre of hundreds of civilians at the Sabra and
 Shatila refugee camps during the summer of 1982, as well as about
 the extralegal detention of "more than 1,000 individuals, mostly
 Palestinians, by Lebanese security forces," and of the detention of
 "thousands of people" by the Israel Defense Forces captured
 following the Israeli "invasion in June 1982...," and of
 allegations that some of these detainees were being mistreated.
 Freedom House rates Lebanon "partly free".
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Lebanon, a country of some 2.6 million people with an almost equal
 number overseas, traditionally operates one of the freest economies
 in the world. Services often provided'by governments elsewhere are
 offered by private institutions, although there is some movement
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 85
 
 
 1336
 toward increased central control as the Government attempts to
 grapple with a depressed economy and rival armed forces. The
 Government is going further into debt to finance reconstruction and
 the expansion and modernization of the Armed Forces. This will
 have a growing impact on an already distressed financial situation.
 The main economic and social problems stem from the absence of a
 political consensus and, concomitantly, a secure society. The
 no-war, no-peace situation in Beirut, combined with the closure of
 some vital Arab markets abroad in response to the May 17
 Lebanon-Israel Agreement, has brought new investment in the economy
 to a near halt. Many Lebanese profited during the presence in
 Beirut of mostly Palestinian militiamen who spent freely the
 subventions of their generous foreign patrons. The flood into
 southern Lebanon of Israeli produce and goods has caused great
 hardship to Lebanese businessmen throughout the Israeli-occupied
 area.
 Income is high for the Middle East but unevenly distributed between
 city and country, and, to a lesser extent, between Christian and
 Muslim. The Shi'a community in particular considers itself
 economically discriminated against and has demanded better access
 to jobs in industries located in predominantly Shi'a parts of
 Lebanon.
 Urban poverty has also increased as the result of massive
 immigration of Lebanese and Palestinian refugees to Beirut, but
 there is also a large and active middle class involved in commerce
 and services. The tax system is progressive, but collection of
 direct taxes is presently difficult and indirect taxes like import
 duties are unreliable. Per capita income figures for Lebanon in
 1983 are not available from government sources, but economic
 consultants agree that $2,500-$3,000 per annum is within reason.
 Official estimates on per capita gross national product for 1982
 was Lebanese pounds 8,300 or presently about $1,660. The
 population growth rate for 1983 is estimated at one tenth of one
 percent.
 Employment and educational opportunities for women, as well as
 their right to own or inherit property or to operate a business,
 are limited in some regions by religion and custom. Women attend
 professional and liberal arts colleges in large numbers--no major
 university is sexually segrated--and, while many find responsible
 jobs in the private sector in Beirut, many must seek employment
 abroad or accept jobs outside their fields.
 Property is privately owned, but militias and foreign forces have
 often seized property. Shelter is a problem for displaced persons
 and their occupation of buildings and the erection of shanty towns
 has made squatting a volatile issue in Lebanon. The eviction of
 Shi'a squatters in West Beirut in July led to seven deaths and an
 armed protest. Ninety persons were arrested and eventually
 released.
 Food, water, and electricity supplies are generally available in
 urban and rural areas, but prolonged periods of fighting interrupt
 those supplies. Public water systems have suffered from years of
 neglect, and bottled water is commonly used for drinking throughout
 the country.
 Adequate health care is generally available in urban areas from a
 well-developed but privately-funded health sector. Many public
 facilities have been damaged during the years of fighting, and the
 Government is attempting to improve existing government-run
 
 
 1337
 facilities. The American University of Beirut hospital accepts a
 small number of patients who are unable to pay for medical
 attention and several international organizations are working with
 the Ministry of Health to improve facilities in Beirut and southern
 Lebanon. The infant mortality rate (1983) is 36.60 per 1,000 live
 births and the life expectancy at birth is (1980) 65.04 years.
 Overall literacy, at 68 percent, is high for the region, although
 within Lebanon this varies from about 93 percent among Christians
 and Palestinians to as low as 30 percent among Shi'a Muslims.
 Virtually all school-age children are in primary school. If they
 can afford the steep tuition, Lebanese educate their children in
 private schools at all levels, and over 50 percent of
 pre-university level students attend private schools. Many private
 elementary schools enjoy substantial government subsidies. Public
 education, however, exists through the university level. The
 Government also supports vocational programs in various technical
 fields. Palestinians, like all foreigners, may not attend
 government schools.
 The emaciated condition of government bureaucracies hinders
 government efforts to broaden welfare services and to improve the
 general economic infrastructure. The Government is adhering to its
 ambitious reconstruction programs with the help of the
 international community and private Lebanese philanthropists. The
 Council for Development and Reconstruction, established in 1977,
 has responsibility for drawing up and implementing Lebanon's
 program of economic and social recovery.
