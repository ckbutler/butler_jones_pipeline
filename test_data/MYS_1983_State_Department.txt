 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a multiethnic society. Malays dominate political
 affairs while ethnic Chinese and the smaller community of
 ethnic Indians continue to play leading roles in the economy.
 The Malaysian parliamentary system of government is based on
 free elections, contested by a number of parties. Although the
 ruling National Front (composed of parties representing the
 major ethnic communities) has consistently won a two-thirds or
 better majority in the federal Parliament, opposition parties
 are active participants in the political system. A strong free
 enterprise economy has helped Malaysia become one of the most
 prosperous of the developing countries.
 Among the Government's highest priorities is avoidance of a
 repetition of the severe violence between ethnic communities
 which followed the May 1969 elections, when several hundred
 persons were reported to have died. The Communist Party of
 Malaya has been engaged in an armed struggle with the
 Government since 1948 and, though the insurrection is well
 under control, a small number of Malaysian police and military
 personnel are killed or maimed annually.
 This insurgency and the possibility of renewed communal
 conflict are cited by the Malaysian Government as justification
 for legislation which allows detention without trial of persons
 suspected of subversive activity or of other activities that
 threaten general civic order.
 Prime Minister Mahathir's administration has made an effort to
 confine the use of Malaysia's security legislation to a few
 cases that it believes threaten the security of the country.
 The Government has now released more than half the individuals
 held in detention when Prime Minister Mahathir took office in
 1981. Amnesty International in its 1983 report covering 1982
 commented on the growing rate of releases while expressing
 concern about the number still detained without trial. The
 Malaysian Government has aserted consistently that it will
 maintain the framework of security legislation for the
 foreseeable future and has warned that Malaysia's laws
 restricting individual rights will be enforced when the
 government believes it necessary to do so.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There are no known reports that the government has summarily
 executed any persons or killed anyone for political reasons
 although some Communist insurgents were killed in combat with
 government forces. Malaysian police and military personnel
 have been killed by Communist insurgents.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention attributed to the government.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Federal Constitution of Malaysia prohibits torture or
 (835)
 
 
 836
 cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.
 There have been no reported instances of torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Malaysian Constitution provides for the proclamation of a
 state of emergency during which individual rights may be
 limited by law. A state of emergency has existed since it was
 proclaimed in May 1969 during communal rioting. Legislation
 granting extraordinary powers to the Government enables arrest
 and imprisonment without benefits of trial or judicial review.
 The Deputy Home Affairs Minister, in reply to a parliamentary
 question, said on March 1983 that the number of detainees had
 dropped from 540 when Prime Minister Mahathir took power in
 1981 to 266, and additional detainees have since been
 released. Most of the unreleased detainees are alleged members
 or supporters of the Communist Party of Malaya, with the bulk
 of the remainder characterized by the Government as "religious
 extremists." Government leaders have repeatedly warned the
 country about Muslim "religious extremists," with the
 implication that security legislation could be employed more
 extensively against these alleged extremists in the future.
 The Malaysian Government considers the Communist threat and
 continuing communal tensions to be adequate justification for
 the use of emergency powers, first embodied in regulations by
 the British and later extended and made more comprehensive by
 Malaysian legislation. These regulations permit arrest and
 detention without trial of persons suspected of subversive
 activity and other actions contributing to domestic
 instability. They provide for initial preventive detention for
 up to two years, extendable indefinitely. A person detained
 under the emergency laws has no recourse to the courts but must
 be told the reason and given an opportunity to challenge the
 detention order as soon as possible after arrest. The
 Government reserves the right to refuse requests for
 information on specific individuals detained under security
 legislation and some detainees have reported not knowing where
 they were held during periods of confinement.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malaysian judiciary is generally regarded by the public and
 the legal community as committed to the rule of law. Although
 the courts have usually accepted the philosophy that it is not
 their place to overturn parliamentary legislation, they have
 not hesitated to rule against government prosecutors in
 specific cases, both civil and criminal.
 With the exception of security cases not brought to trial,
 defendants have the right to counsel, and lawyers are able to
 represent clients without penalty to themselves. Most civil
 and criminal cases are tried under the regular judicial system,
 derived from British jurisprudence, and thus public trial and a
 fair hearing occur in all but the small minority of cases which
 are security related. In all other cases the courts apply
 criminal law and procedures, including strict rules of
 evidence. Charges must be levied against a defendant within 24
 hours of arrest, and police must decide within 14 days whether
 to bring the case to court. Defendants may appeal lower court
 decisions to the federal courts and, in criminal cases, may
 also appeal for royal clemency to the King or to local state
 rulers, as appropriate.
 
 
 837
 Persons detained for security reasons and certain classes of
 crimes, however, may be held and given hearing under special
 procedures outside the ordinary court system. Tnese procedures
 allow suspects to be detained without charge for a period which
 may, in practice, be extended indefinitely. In the limited
 number of cases where the accused is brought to trial under the
 internal security regulations, the accused does not receive a
 statement of the evidence, trial is by a single judge without a
 jury, and witnesses may be examined in the absence of the
 accused. Admissible evidence includes hearsay and secondary
 evidence, testimony of children and spouses, self-incriminating
 statements; to police, and information from seized records or
 communicatons. If the accused is found guilty, the judge must
 impose the maximum penalty. The Malaysian federal court has
 upheld the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty for
 Internal Security Act crimes. Eighteen prisoners convicted of
 crimes under the security legislation were executed in 1983,
 and there were reports that as many as 30 Internal Security Act
 prisoners were awaiting execution. However, the government now
 appears to be moving toward trying new cases involving capital
 crimes, including the illegal posession of firearms, in the
 ordinary courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 The bulk of the citizenry is free from governmental inter-
 ference in private affairs. In its counter-insurgency efforts
 against the Communist Party, the Government uses its power
 under the Internal Security Act to enter and search the homes
 of suspects. In nonsecurity cases, police of inspector rank or
 higher may search homes without a warrant if they have reason
 to believe a crime has occurred.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is circumscribed, but criticism of government
 policies in the media does occur. Following the 1969 communal
 disturbances, and the consequent suspension of parliamentary
 democracy for two years, laws were passed to reduce the risk of
 communal violence by forbidding any public exacerbation of
 racial tensions. Since then, under the Constitution (Amend-
 ment) Act of 1971, certain .sensitive" issues touching on
 ethnic origins or on privileges the government affords to
 ethnic Malays may not be questioned in public or in Parliament.
 Radio and television are government controlled. There is no
 formal prior restraint of the press, which is mostly owned by
 groups in or closely connected with the Government. Although
 the media does criticize government policies, other than those
 involving "sensitive issues," restaint is exercised because the
 Government can refuse to issue new publishing licenses. After
 several warnings from the Government, the publication permit
 for the monthly magazine Nadi Insan was suspended from October
 1 through the end of the year. The permit was apparently
 suspended because the government believed that one of the
 magazine's articles could damage relations with one of
 Malaysia's neighbors. The Government has also confiscated
 issues of a newspaper published, without the required permit,
 by a political party. Concern has been expressed in both
 government and private circles about the potential censorship
 which might result if a proposal is approved to have Bernama,
 
 
 838
 the national news agency, become the sole distributor of news
 from abroad.
 On the other hand, except for the sensitive issues mentioned
 above, there are no formal restrictions on what may be
 printed. The activities and statements of opposition political
 figures and domestic political developments are covered, though
 not as completely as those of the ruling party. The press
 reports violations of legal standards in nonsensitive issues
 and acts as an informal ombudsman, as does the parliamentary
 opposition and the active bar association. The press has
 broadened its critical reporting on public policies in the past
 year.
 Although there are no independent student or academic bodies on
 the campuses, and professors are proscribed from public
 comments on controversial issues, there appears to be a trend
 towards easing the enforcement of restrictive legislation.
 This year the press has reported on two academic seminars
 dealing with controversial government policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malaysian Constitution guarantees the rights of freedom of
 peaceful assembly and association, although the Constitution
 also grants the Government extensive powers to limit those
 rights by legislation in the interest of security and public
 order. In the wake of the 1969 riots, the Government passed
 laws greatly limiting the rights to public assembly by large
 groups. In 1981, Parliament amended the Societies Act to
 permit the Minister of Home Affairs to regulate more strictly
 all organizations attempting to influence Government policy.
 However, in 1983 the Government "liberalized" this
 act,including permitting appeal to the courts of decisions by
 the Home Minister.
 The 1967 Industrial Relations Act protects workers rights to
 organize and participate in trade unions and to bargain
 collectively. The Malaysian trade union movement consists of
 366 separate unions representing approximately 600,000
 workers, or 15 percent of salaried workers. The unions are
 most active in the plantation, transport, and education
 sectors. Unions exercise considerable freedom in pushing
 economic issues. The Government of Malaysia is quite sensitive
 to possible political actions by the labor movement and plays
 an active role in labor relations to "ensure that the security
 and economic life of the nation are protected," and this
 attitude was reflected in 1980 amendments to the Industrial
 Relations Act which placed tighter controls on labor
 activities. The International Labor Organization has been
 critical of these amendments as running counter to the
 principles of freedom of association. While strikes are
 allowed in Malaysia, the Government rapidly refers most
 industrial disputes to binding arbitration in labor courts, at
 which points strikes must cease.
 The Malaysian Trade Union Congress is the umbrella organization
 for private unions in Malaysia, with affiliates representing
 about half the union members. The Malaysian Trade Union
 Congress maintains close relations with the International Labor
 Organization, the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions, and foreign labor organizations. The Congress of
 Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services is now
 
 
 839
 Malaysia's second largest trade union federation. It consists
 of unions which represent workers in the public sector.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While the official religion of Malaysia is Islam, and Malaysian
 Muslims are legally bound by Islamic religious laws, the
 Federal Government itself does not discriminate against
 practitioners of other religious faiths. In Malaysia, these
 include Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese religions, and
 Christianity. Conversion is permitted, but attempts by Muslim
 fundamentalists to extend the enforcement of Islamic laws
 against non-Muslims have been resisted by the Government,
 which has regularly declared in Parliament that it would not
 accede to demands for wider enforcement of Islamic Law,
 pointing out that Malaysia is a multireligious country. The
 judiciary has also spoken out against replacing common law with
 Islamic law.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 Persons wishing to travel abroad must obtain passports, which
 have been denied in a few cases on what the government terms
 security grounds. The government also restricts travel to
 China by ethnic Chinese citizens below the age of 65.
 Malaysia has played a key role in providing first asylum to
 almost 190,000 Vietnamese refugees since 1975 and has
 cooperated fully with international organizations and
 resettlement countries in facilitating the eventual movement of
 the refugees to those countries. Malaysia itself has resettled
 over 5,000 Khmer Muslim refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system based on the British model,
 with a Prime Minister and Cabinet responsible to Parliament.
 The King, the Head of State, is a constitutional monarch
 elected for a five-year term by the sultans of the nine
 Malaysian states which are sultanates. The bicameral
 Parliament consists of a Senate (with both appointed and
 elected members) and an elected House of Representatives. A
 small but vocal opposition in the House criticizes the
 Government regularly. Legislative power is further divided
 between federal and state legislatures. State executive
 administrations attend to matters of local concern. Elections
 on the basis of universal suffage are held every five years or
 more frequently   The last national parliamentary elections
 were held in April 1982, when the ruling National Front
 coalition won 132 of 154 seats in the House of Representatives.
 In parliamentary and state assembly elections, the National
 Front takes full advantage of its governing position, and in
 recent elections it has prohibited open air public rallies,
 thereby making it more difficult for the opposition to win
 puclic support. The opposition concedes, however, that popular
 votes are cast freely and secretly and are recorded
 accurately.
 Political parties representing both Chinese and Indian
 minorities are part of the ruling National Front. There are
 six Chinese and one Indian serving as cabinet ministers and
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 54
 
 
 840
 eight Chinese and two Indians as deputy ministers.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Malaysian Government is not a member of any international
 or regional human rights bodies. The Government was not the
 subject of resolutions, investigations, or other human rights
 actions by human rights organizations in 1983. The Government
 of Malaysia has been criticized by human rights organizations,
 most particularly Amnesty International, for continued
 detention without trial under the Internal Security Act and for
 the fact that the death sentence is the mandatory penalty for
 certain Internal Security Act crimes, including ones not
 involving actual commission of violent acts. Amnesty
 International in its 1983 report also expressed concern that
 the death penalty had been increasingly imposed in 1982 for
 drug trafficking offenses. Amnesty also commented, however,
 that detainees under the Act had been released at a growing
 rate in 1982. The European Parliament, in its world survey of
 human rights in 1983, also criticized detention without trial.
 The Government has taken the position that Malaysia is the best
 and sole judge of its security needs and that the Act will
 remain in effect.
 At the same time, the Government has been willing at the
 highest level to explain its human rights policies to outside
 visitors. In August 1982, for example, the Prime Minister,
 Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney General, and Lord Chief Justice
 met with a visiting delegation of attorneys representing
 various international human rights groups. The Prime Minister
 has also publicly stated that Amnesty International wculd be
 free to send representatives to Malaysia. Amnesty
 International in its 1983 report noted that the Government had
 accepted its 1982 request to send a delegation, but the
 organization did not send a delegation in 1982 or 1983
 There are no government or private organizations in Malaysia
 which deal specifically with protection of individual
 liberties. The bar association, a Muslim youth movement, and a
 social reform group all devote some time to the subject,
 usually in reacting to Government actions that they believe
 endanger civil liberties. The bar association also
 investigated some cases of possible violation of human rights
 but more on an ad hoc basis than through set procedures.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government practices "affirmative action" on an extensive
 scale in favor of the politically dominant but economically
 weaker ethnic Malays. Many non-Malays consider this policy
 discriminatory. As a result of these government programs and
 policies, non-Malays' opportunities for education, government
 employment, and ownership of new homesteads are limited.
 Institutions of higher learning are generally not permitted to
 use a language other than Malay as the medium of instruction.
 The government does not restrict the role of women in Malaysian
 -society. Women have full voting rights. Malaysia now has two
 women cabinet ministers. The position of women is, however,
 somewhat limited by cultural and religious traditions of the
 major ethnic groups. The population of Malaysia is approxi-
 
 
 841
 mately 14.8 million, and the population growth rate is 2.3
 percent. The health and nutrition situation is relatively
 good. Life expectancy at birth is 68 years and infant
 mortality runs at about 25 deaths per 1,000 live births.
 Sixty-two percent of the population has access to safe drinking
 water, and the calorie supply per person meets 116 percent of
 nutritional requirements. Elementary education is available to
 all, with the Government providing scholarships for the
 children of the poor, particularly Malays. The adjusted
 primary school enrollment also is 96.5 percent. The adult
 literacy rate is 60 percent with the rate of the entire
 population probably around 75 percent.
 The per capita income was estimated at $1,740 for 1982. About
 38 percent of the rural population and 13 percent of the urban
 is considered to be below the poverty line. In 1980, there was
 an average of 1.1 household per occupied private living
 quarters.
