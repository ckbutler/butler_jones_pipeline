 JORDAN
 Jordan, with few natural resources, has assumed the greatest
 relative burden in sheltering two major waves of Palestinian
 refugees in 1948-49 and in 1967. Despite the problem of
 integrating these people into its economy and--on more
 limited scale--into its political and social life, Jordan
 had considerable success over the years in improving the
 conditions of life of all its inhabitants. During periods
 of internal instability and inter-Arab disputes, such as the
 Baghdad Pact riots of 1956 and the virtual civil war with
 the Palestinian Fedayeen in 1970, there have been curtailments
 of political rights and occasional detentions without trial.
 These restrictions were relaxed with the return of calmer
 times.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The use of torture is rare and is not condoned by the government.
 No accusations of torture have come to the attention of the State
 Department in 1979.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 while persons taken into custody occasionally may be subjected
 to rough treatment by the security services, cruel or degrading
 treatment or punishment is not condoned by the Jordanian Govern-
 ment. Prison conditions are adequate but spartan. Prisoners are
 not segregated into political and criminal groups. Visits from
 family members and attorneys are permitted. The State Department
 knows of no confirmed reports of prisoner mistreatment in 1979.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The government has not used arbitrary arrest or imprisonment
 except in periods of war or major internal turmoil. Those
 arrested are usually arraigned within 24 hours; however,
 Jordanian law does not specifically provide for the right of
 habeas corpus. Under Jordan's 1955 defense law, the country
 may be ruled by military edict in times of emergency. Such a
 state of emergency was last proclaimed in 1973 and is still in
 force. Under this edict, regular civilian courts continue to
 operate. However, provincial governors have broad powers to
 arrest or detain persons considered to be a "threat to public
 order or the general security." Although the time a person
 may be detained is not limited by law, those arrested or
 detained may take their cases to the high court of justice (an
 administrative tribunal), which may rule on whether proper
 procedures were followed in their cases. In some recent
 instances, the high court ruled that arrested persons could
 not be held under martial law provisions because their alleged
 crimes did not endanger public order or security
 A 1973 decree provided for the release of all political
 prisoners except those convicted of espionage. Additional
 amnesties have since been declared, including two in 1977.
 Such amnesties have been applied to both those convicted and
 to those held without trial. Amnestied individuals are often
 
 (770)
 
 
 771
 fully reinstated in their previous occupations, even within
 the government and armed forces, as part of their rehabili-
 tation and as a means to assure their loyalty. A few,
 including leaders of an abortive coup attempt, have been
 given positions of high responsibility and trust. In 1979 the
 government released at least thirteen prisoners held since
 the civil disorders of 1970,and the Department believes others
 also have been released this year. Amnesty International
 alleged last year that between 100 and 200 political prisoners,
 mostly Palestinians, were held in Jordan. The Government
 maintains it no longer holds "political" prisoners (meaning
 those held without trial), but acknowledges people are
 serving sentences for subversion.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the 1955 defense law, certain civil crimes, such as
 embezzlement by government employees, black marketeering,
 trafficking in narcotics or weapons, security offenses and
 espionage, may be tried by military courts when martial law
 is in effect, as it has been since 1973. Judgments handed
 down by military courts cannot be appealed.
 Under a 1973 law it is illegal to sell land to Israeli
 citizens, to persons residing in Israel, to Israeli entities,
 or to persons acting on the behalf of Israel. A special court
 tries such cases. Over the years an undetermined number of
 landholders, many of them not resident in the West Bank, have
 been tried in absentia (reportedly these land holders have
 never presented themselves to contest their cases) and, if
 convicted, have been sentenced to prison or death. Death
 sentences under this law must be confirmed by the cabinet.
 The majority of offenses and suits in Jordan are settled in
 civil courts in fair and public trials with a full appeals
 process and an independent judiciary. There is a third set
 of generally fair and impartial courts with an independently
 certified judiciary which handles domestic relations within
 the framework of traditional Muslim and Christian religious
 laws. The purview of these latter courts has been shrinking
 over the years and presently includes only such matters as
 marriage, divorce, adoption, custody of minors and inheritance
 matters.
 Defendants in felony cases have the right to counsel, and
 prisons have established dates and hours for attorneys to
 visit their clients. Consultations between lawyers and
 defendants may take place in private, although this right is
 not always respected. Defendants are informed of the charges
 against them, but their lawyers are not always given access to
 the evidence against them before the trial. The State
 Department is not aware of any instances of governmental
 harassment of defense counsel.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary entry of private homes by Jordanian authorities
 is against the law and has not occurred to our knowledge.
 Arrests are made in homes only with the equivalent of legal
 warrants.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Jordan has an essentially free enterprise economy and the
 government of Jordan prefers to rely as much as possible on
 the private sector for the country's economic development;
 it assists only in those projects, generally those requiring
 large amounts of capital, which private investors can not
 or will not finance. The right to own private property is
 protected by the government. Jordan has not ignored
 problems of income distribution. It has a progressive
 income tax and is currently seeking ways of applying it more
 effectively, a measure which will have its greatest impact
 on the upper-income brackets. Nevertheless, achieving an
 equitable distribution of wealth remains a goal for the
 future.
 Despite its scarcity of natural resources, Jordan has since
 1958 pursued economic and social development programs aimed
 at improving the welfare of its populace and attaining an
 economy which by the 1980s would not be dependent on foreign
 assistance to balance its budget or feed its people. These
 plans suffered a severe setback in 1967, when Jordan lost the
 West Bank, its most productive land, to Israeli occupation.
 Within a few days, it received a flow to the East Bank of
 nearly 200,000 refugees native to the West Bank, plus nearly
 300,000 people who were pre-1967 refugees living on the West
 Bank.
 In 1970 the internal conflict with the Palestinian fedayeen
 again forced postponement of long-range development plans
 in favor of short-term recovery measures. The momentum
 of development has been regained, however, and Jordan has
 registered impressive gains, although it continues to depend
 heavily on external financial assistance.
 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
 reports that life expectancy has risen from 47 years in 1960
 to 56 years in 1977, largely due to improvements in child
 health. Adult literacy during the period 1960 to 1975 rose
 from 32 percent to 59 percent. The percentage of primary
 school-aged children increased from 77 percent to 84 percent
 by 1976, with the percentage of females enrolled showing
 the largest gains, from 59 percent to 79 percent.
 Basic education is compulsory through the equivalent of
 the eighth grade. Free elementary and secondary or voca-
 tional education is available to all Jordanian citizens.
 Most qualified Jordanian citizens have access to university
 or other advanced training. These programs have benefitted
 not only East Bank Jordanians but also, particularly since
 1967, large numbers of Palestinian refugees who have been
 assimilated into the Jordanian economy and society. Such
 corruption as exists does not divert significant
 resources from the fulfillment of vital human needs.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The 1952 constitution guarantees the liberties of speech,
 press, religion and assembly. Jordan is a party to the
 International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights and the
 International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights. There
 are no restrictions on beliefs or the right to worship.
 
 
 773
 People in Jordan are free to express their opinions privately
 and, to a certain extent, in print. However, the state-con-
 trolled radio and television system, and private newspapers
 and periodicals, which are all subject to government influence,
 practice a form of self-censorship on important national issues.
 Media criticism of the government's domestic policies occurs
 frequently but is rarely vehement. The press generally
 adheres to the government's position on major foreign policy
 and security issues. Newspapers are occasionally closed down
 for varying periods for printing articles of which the govern-
 ment strongly disapproves. In 1979 one newspaper was closed
 for two weeks and a member of its editorial staff detained for
 a similar period for "spreading enemy propaganda" when the
 newspaper reprinted an article from a western press which
 alleged that there had been secret Jordanian-Israeli peace
 negotiations.
 The government restricts the right of assembly. Those who
 attempt to demonstrate without first obtaining a permit are
 likely to be dispersed by police action.The police dispersed
 a series of demonstrations mounted by Jordan university
 students to protest the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and
 several students were detained by the police;they have since
 been released. As a result of these demonstrations, the
 government has this year monitored the university more
 closely, thus discouraging professors from propounding views
 with which the government does not agree. Six professors
 recently were dismissed by the university after reports on
 their activities by security authorities. This action
 reportedly was based on political activism which the security
 authorities believed might lead to renewed demonstrations.
 The six are seeking redress through the courts.
 Most associations require government license; these are
 routinely granted for groups which are not overtly political.
 Labor unions and professional associations are permitted to
 defend the interests of their members. Officers of these
 associations are freely elected by their members.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel
 and Emigration
 It is the policy of the government of Jordan to permit its
 citizens to move freely. There are no significant obstacles
 to emigration and no restrictions on travel within the country
 outside certain narrowly defined military zones.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Organized political parties are not permitted to operate,
 although only one, the Communist Party, is formally prohibited.
 Although there is a parliament which includes both elected
 members and appointees of the Crown, the current Parliament
 was adjourned sine die by the King in 1974. The Senate's
 members are appointed; the sixty members of the Chamber of
 Deputies are elected by universal suffrage.  Parliamentary
 elections have been postponed to the indefinite future
 because of the impossibility of conducting Jordanian elections
 in the occupied West Bank.
 In 1978 King Hussein established a National Consultative
 Council (NCC) with appointed members carefully selected
 
 
 774
 to represent the various geographic regions and social,
 ethnic, and tribal groups in Jordan.  Legislation is submitted to
 the NCC for review; it does not have veto power,
 but it has provided a forum for useful dialogue between
 the government and the public. The government has generally
 not promulgated legislation with which the NCC is in strong
 disagreement. In accord with ancient Arab, and particularly
 Bedouin, traditions, any citizen can petition for redress of
 grievances directly to the King, the Crown Prince and other
 senior government officials. Written petitions are often
 thrust into the hands of the King when he appears in public.
 The halls of government are filled daily with ordinary citi-
 zens seeking assistance or redress. Many receive satisfaction.
 Although many people of Palestinian origin hold important
 governmental posts, the government of Jordan still favors
 those of East Bank origin for positions in the civil service
 and armed forces.
 There is no official discrimination against women. Educational,
 social and economic opportunities are open to them, and with
 the present labor shortage the government has increased its
 efforts to encourage women to enter the labor force. Although
 Jordan's society retains its traditional character of male
 predominance, a significant percentage of college students are
 female (52 percent at Jordan University). Public and private
 sector efforts to attract women into the labor force are slowly
 making progress. About 14 percent of Jordan's non-agricultural
 work force is female as opposed to 4 percent in 1975.
 Jordan's labor movement is officially sanctioned by the-govern-
 ment. Strikes are possible, and have recently occurred, although
 the government attempts to avoid strikes by active intervention.
 The unions are oriented by the government to concentrate their
 efforts on improving the worker's living and working conditions
 rather than putting their major efforts primarily into winning
 pay raises. The union movement, for example, sponsored health
 clinics open to non-union as well as union members. A new
 labor law is currently being drafted in consultation with both
 labor and management.  Although Amnesty International has charged that
 one member of the executive committee of a union was jailed
 because of political activities, information obtained by the Depart-
 ment of State indicates that the individual in question was
 not on the executive committee of a union but, rather, was
 on the executive committee of the banned Communist Party.
 He was sentenced to three years imprisonment for his activ-
 ities. The establishment of a social security corporation
 which provides retirement and disability benefits represents
 the most important gain for the Jordanian worker in 1979.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged violations of
 Human Rights:
 The Jordanian government regards human rights as an internal
 matter. It has not, however, made any special effort to
 inhibit outside inquiries or studies of its policies.
 Amnesty International has made inquiries from time to time,
 most recently in January 1979 when it inquired into the
 death while in detention of a Palestinian accused of
 conspiring to bomb an airline office. The Jordanian government
 maintains that the prisoner's death was not the result of treat-
 ment received while in custody. In February and March of 1979 a
 delegation of the international Red Cross was permitted to
 inspect most of Jordan's prisons. The delegation reported
 favorably on prison conditions.
