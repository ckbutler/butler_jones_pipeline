 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is nominally a constitutional monarchy but Prime
 Minister Leabua Jonathan holds all political power and
 decision-making authority. Seats in the National Assembly are
 appointive, with the majority going to members of Jonathan's
 Basutoland National Party. Cabinet portfolios are similarly re-
 served for experienced and long-term Basutoland National Party
 members, although representatives of two opposition parties are
 serving in minor posts. A constitution adopted in 1967 was sus-
 pended after elections in 1970 were declared void by Jonathan4
 The Government asserts that its rule preserves traditional demo-
 cratic practices such as "pitsos," public meetings where policy
 is adopted by consensus, but the reality is that political
 dissent is rarely aired in government-controlled meetings or
 media. Respect for the chieftaincy system, hierarchically
 ascending from village chiefs to chiefs and the King, is also
 emphasized, although its members are rarely important on the
 national level.
 A sporadic insurgency waged against the Government since an
 abortive coup by supporters of Basutoland Congress Party leader
 Ntsu Mokhehle in 1974 increased in intensity during 1981 and
 1982. A shift from bombings against public buildings and other
 facilities to armed attacks on political figures and military
 targets, including assassination attempts against cabinet
 officials by Mokhehle's Lesotho Liberation Army, stimulated two
 new laws in June 1981 widening government authority to act
 against subversion. Repeated incidents along the northwestern
 border with South Africa have led to government charges that
 South Africa permits or encourages terrorism on the part of the
 Lesotho Liberation Army, the military wing of the Basutoland
 Congress Party. The Lesotho Liberation Army has also claimed
 responsibility for the August 7, 1982 assassination of Works
 Minister Rampeta. A number of Lesotho's diplomatic missions
 oveiseas have also received threatening letters, purportedly
 from the Lesotho Liberation Army, warning against providing
 assistance to visiting government officials.
 Lesotho's economy is primarily based on subsistence agriculture
 and migrant worker remittances from South Africa. Substantial
 aid is provided by Western donors in agriculture for road con-
 struction, rural health improvements, manpower advisors, per-
 sonnel training, and other basic needs.
 Although human rights in Lesotho are circumscribed by the
 Government, the rights to life and liberty are not systematic-
 ally violated. The integrity of the person tends to be
 jeopardized most by undisciplined police or military forces.
 Two murders and an attack on a well-known opposition figure
 in 1981 led to charges that a "death squad" within the Lesotho
 Paramilitary Force was responsible. Political participation in
 the Government is limited to Basutoland National Party members
 and a few appointed members of opposition parties, excluding
 persons believed to be supporters of Mokhehle. The refusal of
 the Government to hold elections since 1970 is a principal
 contributing cause to political discontent, and provides the
 Lesotho Liberation Army with a rationale for its aggressions.
 Freedom of press and of association do not appear to be widely
 threatened, notwithstanding the intimidating effect of an
 
 
 163
 editor's murder and arrests of suspected Lesotho Liberation
 Army adherents. The Government does require permits for almost
 all meetings and has been known to harass political organization
 efforts by opposition parties.
 There has been no major change during 1982 in the status of
 human rights in Lesotho, although an International Security Law
 and an Emergency Powers Act passed in June provide stiffer
 penalties for subversion, sabotage and other political offenses.
 A major contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights is the Security Law's provision that accused persons must
 prove themselves innocent of subversion and other offenses. No
 prosecutions have yet occurred under the law, however. The
 last-minute withdrawal of implementing regulations for the
 Emergency Powers Bill left the Prime Minister the widest pos-
 sible authority to deal with opposition should he declare a
 state of emergency.
 The short-term trend in Lesotho is toward heightened security
 measures to counter Lesotho Liberation Army activity. The
 detention of a student among approximately 50 persons in
 October 1981 following a bomb blast at an opposition hideout,
 for example, sparked a protest at the national university.
 The death of Mr. Setipa Mathba, in early January 1982, while a
 detainee in police custody has still not been publicly explained,
 and poorly trained and disciplined soldiers and police have
 caused innocent people to be injured. Lesotho Liberation Army
 murders have just as clearly contributed to a climate of fear
 and insecurity. The long-term outlook is for a continuing
 stalemate between the Government and its armed opposition, with
 the risk this creates for continuing respect for human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The disappearance and subsequent murders of educator Seheri and
 opposition newspaperman Motuba in the third quarter of 1981 have
 been cited as political killings by opponents of the Government,
 but no evidence has been provided to substantiate the claims.
 Lesotho Evangelical Church leader Masilo alleges that an attack
 on his house which left a grandchild dead was carried out by
 government forces. He is presently in exile and actively
 campaigning against the Government. An assassination attempt in
 late May 1982 against a cabinet minister was followed by the
 murder of a Basutoland Congress Party dissident leader and the
 murder of the Minister of Works. The Lesotho Liberation Army
 claimed responsibility for all three incidents. A Lesotho
 Liberation Army member killed in the recent ministerial assassi-
 nation has been identified as the murderer of the dissident.
 Several persons were also killed near Mokhotlong by Lesotho
 Liberation Army forces in retaliation for having notified the
 armed forces of the Lesotho Liberation Army presence. Lesotho
 Liberation Army terrorism appears to be carried out as part of a
 struggle for power rather than for ideological motives. There
 has been no convincing evidence that any other government is
 supporting it, although most attacks are probably conceived in
 and launched from South Africa. A number of African National
 Congress members have also died in circumstances suggesting both
 political and personal motives, but the perpetrators do not seem
 likely to be Basotho.
 
 
 164
 b. Disappearance
 The results of an April 1982 habeas corpus proceeding estab-
 lished that a man arrested by police in November 1981 was never
 seen again. As noted above, two persons who disappeared in June
 and September of 1981 were later found dead. Thus far no actual
 link with official forces has been established.
 c. Torture
 South African press reports in August 1982 stated that a farm
 laborer had been killed and another kidnapped in South Africa
 and taken to Lesotho by members of the Lesotho Paramilitary
 Force. The latter was allegedly tortured by having his hands
 burned with hot irons. The incident probably did occur, but
 there is no way to determine whether Lesotho military forces
 were in fact involved. Beatings by both military and police
 members have been reported. Abuse generally takes place during
 the arrest and interrogation phases, and is widely accepted as
 part of the punishment for the crimes alleged to have been
 committed. A member of the principal opposition party committed
 suicide in August 1982 after being informed that he was to be
 detained again on suspicion of subversion.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Physical punishment is not prescribed ordinarily as a form of
 punishment, although caning is legally sanctioned Conditions
 in places of detentions are extremely poor, but are viewed as a
 form of punishment. Further, given the very real financial
 constraints on government spending, any improvement in detention
 facility conditions appears highly unlikely. Access to lawyers
 by those of means is the principal reason for different treatment
 of similar offenders.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are very few prisoners held outside legal norms and estab-
 lished principles, apart from any picked up during sporadic
 military operations along the frontiers. Habeas corpus is
 applied to ordinary arrests under the Criminal Procedure and
 Evidence Act of 1981, but the Internal Security (General) Act of
 1982 specifically exempts persons arrested for investigation of
 subversion from the former's provisions. Preventive detention
 under an interim custody order is authorized for an initial 14
 days, after which a detention order must be issued or custody
 lapses. The detention order is valid for 14 days and may be ex-
 tended an additional 14 days, after which the detainee must be
 charged or released.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary in Lesotho is independent of the executive and
 military establishments, and has acted to limit police or mili-
 tary infringements of law on a number of occasions. Civil suits
 alleging maltreatment are accepted and adjudicated. The trial
 and conviction of a security service official for murder of an
 arrested person in 1981 illustrates the importance of the
 judicial system in curbing abuses. Verdicts of civil courts may
 be appealed to the High Court. In military cases, if the
 offense is one which can be dealt with summarily, the decision
 may be reversed by any officer of higher rank. If the offense
 is one for which a court-martial is convened, the sentence can
 
 
 165
 be petitioned to the Lesotho Paramilitary Force commander. In
 neither case may a finding be appealed to a court of law.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Under the Internal Security (General) Act of 1982, warrants are
 not required for any police official to enter private homes.
 Forced entry of the home by Government or military units has
 been credibly alleged, but due to indiscipline rather than the
 result of any deliberate policy.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Includingt
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Explicit safeguards in the 1967 Internal Security Act for free-
 dom of speech and association, including the right to criticize
 public officials, were repealed by the Internal Security
 (General) Act which does not include such provisions. Opposi-
 tion viewpoints are nonetheless freely expressed in Sesotho-
 language newspapers, including statements by the Lesotho
 Liberation Army commander Mokhehle. Although criticism of the
 government is tolerated, it often stimulates heated responses
 from government-controlled radio and newspapers. There is no
 known censorship of publications, although subversive statements
 would be prosecutable under the Internal Security Act. Academic
 freedom has not been interfered with, but a number of staff and
 students at the national university have reportedly received
 anonymous death threats. These incidents are seen as a reflec-
 tion of a continuing Basutoland National Party/Basutoland
 Congress Party rivalry among the student body. The Government
 owns the only radio station in Lesotho, Radio Lesotho, as well
 as the only English newspaper, "The Lesotho Weekly." An opposi-
 tion newspaper editor was murdered allegedly by the Lesotho
 Paramilitary Force, in 1981, but no other evidence of intimida-
 tion by either the Government or its opponents has come to light.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Permits are required for public and private meetings involving
 more than a few people. Groups intending to hold political
 rallies or organizing sessions encounter the most harassment,
 generally in the form of denial of permits or of investigatory
 arrests of persons attending. A member of the police generally
 attends such meetings. Two labor confederations exist, along
 with a number of independent unions. All have and exercise the
 right to organize, negotiate, and strike. Government control
 does not appear to be characteristic of the labor movement, in
 part due to the relatively small proportion of the Lesotho
 economy devoted to manufacturing and retail activities. Unions
 and the labor confederations have participated in delegations
 to the International Labor Organization annual meetings,
 together with government and employer representatives.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-organized or favored religion in Lesotho, but
 Christianity is the predominant faith. Open religious practice
 is permitted, and few, if any, restrictions are actually en-
 forced.. The predominant denomination is Roman Catholic, with a
 significant Protestant minority composed of the Lesotho
 Evangelical Church, Anglican Church, and a variety of other
 denominations. Conversion from one religion to another is per-
 
 
 166
 mitted, and there is no indication that members of a given
 religion are persecuted or discriminated against solely on that
 basis. Although some of the Government's principal opponents
 are Lesotho Evangelical Church members, many government
 officials also belong to that faith. No particular advantage
 accrues to members of one denomination as opposed to others in
 day-to-day life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is impeded in strategic areas or principal
 highways by a regular pattern of roadblocks throughout the
 country to counter increasingly serious incursion by the
 Lesotho Liberation Army, but not for lengthy periods of time.
 Travel to countries other than South Africa and neighboring
 states is made more difficult by the cost of a security deposit
 for a passport, which can be as high as $1,250 for visits to the
 United States. The deposit is intended to cover the cost of
 repatriation. Emigration is not impeded, given the long tradi-
 tion of Basotho working in South Africa, and the limited employ-
 ment opportunities outside agriculture in Lesotho itself.
 Intending repatriates are not discouraged, and an amnesty act
 passed in 1980 allows political exiles to return after signing
 statements concerning any criminal acts they may have committed.
 A number of South African refugees were forced to return to
 South Africa in August 1981 after being accused by the Lesotho
 Government of being common criminals and "spies." Factional
 fighting may have been responsible for several deaths and
 attacks within the refugee community in mid-1981. Abuses of
 refugees in general are not ordinarily encountered. However,
 refugees from South Africa are constantly faced with the possi-
 bility of cross-border attacks from South African military
 forces as evidenced by the December 9, 1982 attack on Maseru
 which resulted in the death of approximately 47 persons, mostly
 African National Congress members.
 *e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Lesotho is ruled by Prime Minister Jonathan, in association
 with a number of experienced Basotho National Party and govern-
 ment officials. Opposition parties are either divided into
 factions (such as the Basutoland Congress Party/Lesotho
 Liberation Army or are comparatively weak, though struggling
 to build popular appeal (Marematlou Freedom Party, United
 Democratic Party). The Ministers of Health and Justice and
 Prisons are opposition party leaders, but a former Minister of
 Water, Energy and Mining resigned after encountering continued
 obstacles to political organization for his party. The
 National Assembly, to which representatives of all parties
 except factions supporting guerrilla leader Mokhehle are
 appointed, usually passes without amendment Government-proposed
 laws. Elections for parliament have not been held since 1970,
 when Jonathan suspended the tally on security grounds as his
 party came close to being upset by the Basutoland Congress
 Party. Opposition groups that do not come under Mokhehle's
 control are allowed to exist openly, but public activities are
 restricted. Although there are no women cabinet ministers, at
 least one woman is a Permanent Secretary (the ranking civil
 servant in a ministry) and three are Deputy Permanent Secre-.
 taries. The Government has encouraged the formation of
 "Lesotho Women in Self-Help," and has a coordinator in the
 Prime Minister's Office for Women's Affairs. Both institu-
 tions contribute to rural development programs aimed at women.

 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Lesotho has been named by the 1981 Working Group on Enforced or
 Involuntary Disappearances of the UN Human Rights Commission
 as one of 22 countries where disappearances have occurred for
 political reasons. The most recent disappearance, in November
 1981, was the subject of an opinion dated April 1982 of the
 High Court of Lesotho in which the police were scathingly criti-
 cized for violations of human rights. Two visits by Amnesty
 International delegations were permitted in late 1981 to gather
 information about the murders of Seheri and Motuba, the attack
 on Ben Masilo, and detainee conditions. According to its 1982
 report, Amnesty visits and subsequent correspondence with the
 Government drew attention to such issues as alleged evidence of
 "brutal and potentially fatal systems of interrogation," and
 "cruel and inhuman" detention conditions. The Institute for
 Southern African Studies at the National University of Lesotho*
 has recently, established a human rights research program which
 is monitoring human rights in Lesotho as well as Botswana and
 Swaziland.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Lesotho is one of the countries designated by the United Nations
 as "least developed," with a per capita GNP of $385 in 1980.
 Over 45 percent of this amount was made up from remittances from
 migrant workers in the Republic of South Africa. About 90
 percent of the country's imports and tourist traffic come from
 South Africa. In addition, Lesotho is also economically tied to
 South Africa through a common customs union and an interchange-
 able'currency. Customs union receipts .in recent years have
 averaged about 70 percent of the total government revenues.
 These funds, coupled with donor support programs, have managed
 to prop up a shaky and apparently unstable fiscal program. In
 addition, the South African economic tie has resulted in the
 latter's nearly complete domination over Lesotho pricing and
 tariff policies. The ability to produce food in South Africa at
 lower costs has detracted from developing Lesotho's agriculture
 sector. In addition, the potential of well-paying jobs, by
 Lesotho standards, has attracted the cream of the Lesotho labor
 force to South Africa at the expense of local agriculture and
 other development. Only about 10 percent of the Lesotho labor
 force is employed outside traditional agriculture.
 Lesotho's economic plight is further complicated by its general
 lack of natural resources, its mountainous terrain, most of
 which lies between one and two miles high, and its generally low
 rainfall. However, development of water resources, including
 potential hydropower, appears the best long-range hope for
 economic development.
 The 1981 population was estimated to be 1,370,000, with an
 annual growth rate of 2.4 percent. Life expectancy was estimated
 to be 51.1 years in 1980. This unusually high life expectancy
 standard for a poor country results from the general lack of
 tropical diseases in the country, again a function of the high
 altitude and cold winter climate. The infant mortality rate was
 114.4 per 1,000 live births in 1981.
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 12
 
 
 168
 Nutritional standards are also high, with the ratio of calorie
 supply available for consumption to nutritional requirements
 estimated in 1977 to be 99 percent. In 1975, only 17 percent
 of the population was estimated to have access to safe water.
 Major efforts by both the Government and donors since then
 have greatly increased this percentage, although exact figures
 are not available.
 Lesotho has a long history of church-sponsored primary schools
 located throughout the country which have resulted in a com-
 paratively high adult literacy rate--estimated at 55 percent
 in 1979. The primary school enrollment ratio was estimated to
 be 104 percent in 1979. Refugees from South Africa account
 for this increased ratio beyond 100 percent. Although a basic
 church-sponsored education system is in place, both the Govern-
 ment and the churches lack the funds to standardize training,
 improve standards, and replace and develop needed facilities.
 Generally, the education provided is highly academic and pro-
 vides little or no vocational skills to the students, even
 though they are probably destined to remain in the rural areas,
 where currently 90 percent of the population engages in subsis-
 tence agriculture. Of this group, 55 percent were considered
 below absolute poverty standards in 1979, while 50 percent of
 their urban counterparts were estimated to be in this bracket.
 In summary, the picture for Lesotho is not prosperous or one
 with any immediate hope for major change. However, there is
 no blatant sexual, racial or religious discrimination, and all
 Basotho have fairly equal opportunity within the confines im-
 posed by political reality. The role of women within Basotho
 society has traditionally been that of a stabilizing force,
 due to the absence of hundreds of thousands of men working in
 South Africa. Whether their talents and abilities will be
 used to a fuller extent in years to come will depend heavily
 on the progress Lesotho makes in providing education, health
 and other social services to the rural areas where the over-
 whelming majority of its citizens live. Many women are forced
 to rely upon subsistence farming for food. The 1979 Land Act
 has generally improved land tenure conditions as well as in-
 creasing opportunities to obtain building sites, partially
 assisting women in this condition. However, all lands still
 remain under the title of the Kingdom and local land committees
 have been given considerable power over allocating land outside
 urban areas. It remains to be seen whether women's interests
 will be adequately protected under these arrangements.
