 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines retains the multiparty
 parliamentary system of government which it inherited upon
 independence from the United Kingdom in 1979. Democratic
 traditions and respect for the rights of the individual have
 continued since independence. In July 1984, the New
 Democratic Party led by James F. Mitchell defeated the ruling
 St. Vincent Labor Party led by incumbent Prime Minister Milton
 Cato in peaceful, democratic elections.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police is the only security force in the
 country. A small Special Service Unit with some paramilitary
 training has been established within the police force, and a
 Marine Wing created under police command to serve as St.
 Vincent's coast guard. Some members of the Marine Wing are
 not police officers. The St. Vincent police maintain
 traditions of professionalism which place a high value on
 respect for human rights.
 A poor country with a very young population, (half under 15
 years of age), St. Vincent's most serious problem is
 unemployment. The nation's economy remained sluggish in 1985
 mainly because of a slow recovery from the world-wide
 recession and exchange rate reductions which affected the
 vital banana industry.
 The country's human rights record remained good during 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment in 1985.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that persons detained for criminal
 offenses be provided legal representation and that their cases
 be reviewed periodically. The Government assiduously follows
 these provisions. There were no reports of arbitrary arrests,
 or summary exile in 1985.
 Although there is no known legal prohibition against forced or
 compulsory labor, such practices are not known to take place
 in St. Vincent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials before an
 independent and impartial court. Criminal defendants have the

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 right to legal counsel, are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty, and have the right of appeal, ultimately to the Privy
 Council in London.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and
 seizure; this prohibition is honored in practice by law
 enforcement authorities. There were no reports of arbitrary
 search and seizure, or other government intrusions into the
 private life of individual citizens in 1985.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the
 press, and the Government respects these rights. The
 Government neither censors nor interferes in the operation of
 newspapers, which openly and freely criticize it.
 b Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to assemble peaceably is respected in practice.
 The Government has adhered to the International Labor
 Organization's Convention on Freedom of Association. Unions
 enjoy the right of collective bargaining and the right to
 strike; they represent approximately 7,000 workers (slightly
 more than 10 percent of the labor force).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are free to practice and proselytize in St.
 Vincent and the Grenadines.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Vincent has a parliamentary system of government in which
 citizens have a genuine choice of parties. In the 1984
 general elections, the opposition New Democratic Party won an
 overwhelming electoral victory, winning 9 of the 13 seats in
 Parliament.
 In August 1985, the Speaker of the House of Assembly excluded
 opposition parliamentarians from a debate on the budget. The
 following month, both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker resigned
 from their positions after a vote of no confidence. Prime
 Minister Mitchell asked the Speaker to resign because of
 alleged malfeasance.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international human rights organizations maintain offices
 in St. Vincent. Although there is no local body which
 
 
 681
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 publicly monitors human rights violations, opposition
 political groups occasionally comment on human rights
 practices. The Government is responsive to public and private
 inquiries on its human rights practices. Amnesty
 International did not comment on St. Vincent in its 1985
 report. Freedom House rated the country as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With a population of 101,000 inhabitants, St. Vincent and the
 Grenadines is a small, poor country with a moderately growing
 population (.9 percent growth in 1985). Per capita gross
 national product (GNP) in 1982 was estimated at $616. The
 nation's economy relies heavily on an ailing agricultural
 sector; bananas are the principal export crop.
 The Government has identified several programs essential to
 economic progress, including development of basic
 infrastructure, assistance to the outlying Grenadine islands,
 development of tourism, and implementation of a land reform
 program (including public sector divestiture of parastatal
 enterprises in the agricultural sector.
 The Government's development policies emphasize education:
 education is compulsory for 10 years. The adult literacy rate
 is about 95.6 percent.
 Health care is hampered by the shortage of funds, facilities,
 and personnel. Health care facilities have improved in recent
 years, but many of St. Vincent's best-trained personnel
 migrate each year, chiefly to earn higher wages. St.
 Vincent's infant mortality rate is 40 per 1,000 live births.
 The minimum working age is 15. The workweek is 40 hours in 5
 days, and workers are guaranteed a minimum annual vacation of
 2 weeks. The Government is currently endeavoring to convert
 loose arrangements covering occupational safety and health
 into statutes. The minimum wage established by law is
 arguably not enough on which a person can be reasonably
 expected to live.
 The role of women in society is not restricted by law, but
 custom dictates that most Vincentian women center their lives
 around the home. As women take greater advantage of public
 education programs, health facilities, and family planning,
 many observers expect the women of St. Vincent and the
 Grenadines to participate in larger numbers in the nation's
 economic, professional, and political life.
