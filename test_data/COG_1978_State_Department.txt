 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo is a one-party
 Marxist-Leninist state, governed by a President who
 heads an eleven-person military committee. A well-
 established state security apparatus monitors the
 foreign community, censors the press, and restricts
 freedom of speech and assembly. Ethnic conflict
 between the northern and southern regions continues. A
 former French colony, the Congo has a Constitution, laws
 and judicial system based on the Napoleonic Code. The
 Congo is impoverished but has significant growth
 potential. Government leaders listen and sometimes
 respond positively to representations regarding human
 rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no legal prohibition on the use of torture,
 and no recent evidence of torture of Congolese citizens
 or foreign nationals. However, during the January 1978
 trial of suspected assassins of President Marien Ngouabi,
 killed in 1977, there were credible allegations that
 torture was used during the interrogations of the
 suspects.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 While not permitted by law or officially condoned, such
 treatment is occasionally reported in the Congo. Three
 of fifteen prisoners being detained in a very small
 cell are reported to have died from suffocation in
 August 1978. The Department of State does not know
 if the officials responsible for this mistreatment
 were held accountable.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 
 
 In 1977 several thousand Malian, Senegalese, Ghanaian,
 Beninese and Nigerian businessmen and their families
 were arrested, dispossessed of their belongings,
 detained under very harsh conditions and then deported.
 There were no similar incidents in 1978. However, a
 British television team was temporarily prohibited from
 leaving the country in January 1978. Former Prime
 Minister Pascal Lissouba was detained in March 1977 for
 the alleged implication in the assassination of President
 Ngouabi and was imprisoned following sentencing by a
 court martial.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The trial of those accused of assassinating President
 Ngouabi was characterized as "open and free" by the
 International Federation of Jurists, but Amnesty
 International criticized the denial of the right of
 appeal. The United States Embassy concluded after
 following the trial closely that it was fair and
 impartial, although the Congolese investigation was
 limited to those suspects immediately at hand.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Homes are subject to search and the houses themselves
 to confiscation by the Government.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government places high priority on the fulfillment
 of these needs. The greater part of both the national
 budget and assistance from foreign governments is
 directed toward improving health, education and housing.
 Nonetheless, the quality of life has generally deterio-
 rated as the result of economic difficulty. Managerial
 problems in state management of most economic sectors
 has hindered realization of the Government's goals.
 Inflation and unemployment have increased over the past
 several years. However, the Government recently made
 its tax structure more progressive by raising gasoline
 
 
 46
 taxes and property taxes for those owning more than one
 piece of unimproved property. As part of the Government's
 economic austerity program, taxes on salaries are to be
 progressively raised. The resulting revenues are
 intended to revitalize the agricultural sector.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 As a matter of official policy and practice, all
 individual liberties are restricted in conformity
 with what the Government considers to be interests of
 state security and its Marxist-Leninist orientation.
 Considerable political indoctrination is evident in the
 schools, the village hierarchies, the various party
 organizations and the controlled media. Freedom
 of expression and assembly is quite limited.
 Foreign missionaries of the Baptist, Pentecostal and
 Seventh Day Adventist churches, once well received in
 the-Congo, were expelled after the January 1978
 assassination trial, having been accused of prompting
 the assassination through their influence over their
 congregations. About 25 church-affiliated schools were
 nationalized and goods were confiscated. The Government
 sought to circumscribe church-attendance by scheduling
 political meetings on Sunday mornings and relegating
 church services to hours before sunrise. However,
 Roman Catholic church services, as well as those of the
 Salvation Army and other Protestant groups have not
 been affected.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Congolese Government does not restrict internal
 movement or emigration. A Congolese citizen who
 desires to travel abroad, however, must apply for an
 exit visa through the Office of State Security. The
 Government is concerned about the number of Congolese
 
 
 who, for economic reasons, are emigrating to neighboring
 Gabon, and exit visas are being denied.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The one-party system and traditional regional and
 ethnic cleavages, including the current dominance of
 northerners, tend to restrict the opportunity to
 participate in the political process. Congolese Labor
 Party membership is limited to those trusted by the
 Government.
 The Congolese woman occupies a generally subservient
 role. She performs most of the manual labor, and
 although permitted to own property, suffers from
 employment discrimination. While women are accepted in
 nontraditional roles, in recent years they have grown
 dissatisfied with their situation, and have begun to
 voice their objections to the official press.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Congolese Government has demonstrated its willing-
 ness to listen and respond to human rights inquiries on
 a case-by-case basis. The Department of State does not
 know whether the Congolese responded to a May 1977
 letter from Amnesty International.
