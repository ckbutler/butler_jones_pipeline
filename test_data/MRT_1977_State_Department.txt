 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania's overriding concern at present is to defend
 itself against attacks on its economic and urban centers
 by guerrillas of the Polisario Front, operating out of
 Algeria. Despite this preoccupation, the government of
 Mauritania respects generally in word and fundamentally
 in deed the human rights of its citizens. Its constitu-
 tion reflects both the French Declaration of the Rights
 of Man and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture and there
 are no reports that it has been practiced in Mauritania.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 These types of treatment or punishment are not practiced.
 There are no reports of arbitrary deprivation of life.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 This is prohibited by law and generally is not practiced
 in Mauritania. Some persons, however, have been arrested
 and detained in the past for participating in illegal
 political activities in contravention of the Mauritanian
 Constitution which recognizes only one political party.
 Thirty persons detained for such illegal political activ-
 ities were adopted by Amnesty International, which in its
 1975-76 Report noted that all had benefited from a general
 amnesty declared by the Mauritanian Government in September,
 1975. We have no information on when these persons were
 detained, or whether they were granted fair, public trials
 at the time. The ongoing Polisario attacks on Mauritania's
 urban and economic centers prompted internal security meas-
 ures such as questioning of suspected Polisario supporters
 by the authorities. Some 100-200 suspects were brought in
 for interrogation following the first attack on the capital
 city of Nouakchott in July, 1976. They were released with-
 in four or five days. There are no reports of any political
 prisoners or detainees in Mauritania at this time.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair, public trials are provided.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 This is prohibited by law and is not practiced.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Mauritanian Government economic development policies are.
 designed to respond directly to the needs of the poor--
 the sedentary agricultural and widely dispersed nomadic
 peoples which make up 75% the population. -The national
 goals adopted by the Government of Mauritania are economic-
 development and social welfare. The Third Economic Develop-
 ment Plan (1976-81) emphasizes growth in the rural sector.
 Present government concentration is on increased agricul-
 tural production, and eventual food self-sufficiency,
 through emphasis on food crops and better cultivation
 techniques, improved rural infrastructure, training, and
 extension of existing livestock programs. The Government
 also seeks to improve health services to the rural poor.
 The result of this policy is allocation of an increasing
 proportion of government, expenditures to the rural sector.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are protected. Although the Mauritanian
 constitution proclaims Islam to be the religion of the
 Mauritanian people, (and the formal national name of the
 country is The Islamic Republic of Mauritania), the con-
 stitution guarantees "freedom of conscience and the right
 to practice one's religion." These do exist in fact, and
 non-Moslems have not experienced difficulty exercising their
 religion in Mauritania. There is a Roman Catholic Bishop,
 several Catholic congregations, and there are no restric-
 tions in fact on any religious expression or practice.
 Ninety-nine percent of the population is Moslem. Mauri-
 tania has one union, the Union of Mauritanian Workers,
 which is closely allied to the government. The one daily
 newspaper is published by the government and there is one
 government radio station. These are indications of the
 
 
 80
 state of national development rather than an effort to
 control the media. International shortwave broadcasts
 and television broadcasts from nearby Dakar, Senegal, are
 received without interference. Foreign newspapers, maga-
 zines, journals, and books freely circulate and are readily
 available to all without any government restriction, even
 when containing information or commentary critical of the
 government. The government makes no attempt to enforce
 ideological conformity, and the average Mauritanian citizen
 freely expresses his views on national issues.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement is allowed within Mauritania, subject
 to control over travel to some areas because of the
 Polisario guerrilla military activity. Foreign travel
 and emigration are not restricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Mauritanian Constitution assures equality to all in
 the political process, regardless of race, religion, or
 sex--but only within the framework of the Mauritanian
 Peoples Party, the sole legal political party in Mauri-
 tania. The National Assembly and the President are elected
 by universal adult suffrage.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 We are aware of no outstanding requests for outside inves-
 tigation of human rights conditions in Mauritania, but
 believe that the government would respond favorably should
 such requests be made by responsible organizations.
