 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBRIA
 The German Democratic Republic (GDR) was created in 1949 as a
 Communist state out of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany.
 Approximately 350,000 Soviet troops are still stationed on its
 soil. The country has been ruled by the Communist Party,
 known as the Socialist Unity Party (SED). Its General
 Secretary since.19.71, Erich Honecker, was replaced in October
 by Egon Krenz as a result of the crisis caused, in part, by
 large-scale popular demonstrations in East German cities and
 the flight of East Germans to the Federal Republic of Germany
 (FRG)._yia Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Krenz was replaced by
 Gregor Gysi on December 3, 1989, following the resignation of
 the party leadership. Until November, the SED made all
 important political decisions; the.other.four political
 parties, whose existence was tolerated, had no power or
 independence. In December, however, the Parliament eliminated
 the constitutional provision granting-the-SED the "leading
 roleY in the State.
 Despite such formidable barriers as the Berlin Wall, deep
 historicl, cultural, linguistic,'and. family ties remained
 between the people of the GDR 4nd those of the FRG. Concern
 that such ties and constant exposure to Western values could
 undermine, support for the Communist system was a central
 reason for the Government's tight control over its
 population, Control was maintained with an efficient and
 pervasive security apparatus-admfiinistered by the Ministries of
 the Interior and State Security, which together employed
 Sapproximately 300,000 people. Nevertheless, in the process of
 sanptioing' inckeased glasnost (Openness) and responding.to
 the pb'pular d mand for the right to"travel, the Communist
 leadership, in oNovember opened gates in the Berlin Wall
 allowing millions of East Germans to visit West Berlin with a
 minimum 6f formality. The Berlin Wall thereby lost its
 significance as a barrier to the free movement of East Germans
 intb an&'0ut of West Berlin.
 The GDR has had a highly industrialized, centrally planned
 .economy in which the bulk of industry and agricultural
 property has been state Qwned. 41though private Eroperty has
 been permitted,-controW were placed on its acquisition,
 inheritance, and the income derived from it. .Small private
 busineisses,' which may have up to 10-employees, are-being
 licensed in increasing numbers.
 Until November, the.GDRcotibtued to restrict the fundamental
 fredoms of speech, press, religion, assembly, and travel.
 owever, it'.pqrmitted .record numbers of East Germans to -,
 emigrate and'makd-short-term visits to the FRG. Other areas
 of human rights concern included arbitrary arrest and
 detention, the-absence of fairtri-als for political prisoners,
 and arbitrdry interference with privacy, family, home, and
 correspondence.
 Beginning in October, the authorities allowed increased
 freedoft of, peech and press, tolerated large street
 demonstrations, and did not interfere with the establishment
 of new political and other organizations. In December, they
 disbanded the Ministry for State Security and promised the
 release of the last political prisoners. Travel regulations
 for East Germans have been simplified. The new Prime
 Minister, Hans Modrow, named a cabinet with 11 non-Communist
 members among the 28 ministers, and free elections have been
 scheduled for May 6, -1990.

 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The following report primarily describes the human rights
 situation as it existed before the peaceful revolution in
 October which is now transforming the GDR. Some of the
 institutions and practices that led to widespread human rights
 abuses apparently were being changed at year's end, and the
 next annual report is likely to include a significantly
 different assessment of human rights practices.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 A 1982 law instructed border guards that they should open fire
 only as a last resort to prevent a person from leaving the
 country without permission. By mid-1987, there were reports
 that the practice of opening fire on would-be escapees had
 been virtually duspended, except in cases of military or
 police deserters or self-defense. Though GDR leaders
 repeatedly stated in 1989 that there is no shoot-to-kill
 order, there was an increase in shooting incidents at the Wall
 early in 1989, and one civilian was killed. There have been
 no verified instances of shooting since 'April when border
 guards reportedly were ordered not to shoot at civilians
 except in self-defense.
 Several years ago, the regime removed lethal barriers, such as
 automatic shooting devices and minefields, which had existed
 on the GDR-FRG border (but never within Berlin). However, it
 expanded its system of barriers on the inner-German border to
 a depth of approximately 20 kilometers, and within Berlin
 increased the height of the border fence to 3 meters. The
 opening of the Berlin Wall and simplified travel regulations
 have rendered these measures obsolete.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of permanent disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Specific laws state that the life, health, and ability to work
 of arrestees and prisoners must not be jeopardized. A law
 promulgated in December 1988 makes it a crime, with penalties
 up to 10 years, imprisonment, for an official performing state
 functions to mishandle a person psychologically or physically.
 There were no known instances in 1989 of this law being
 applied; previously, punishment of officials for abusing
 prisoners or detainees was rare.
 In the past, prisoners have complained of cruel treatment and
 have reported excessively harsh conditions and psychological
 strain in prisons. Recently emigrated prisoners reported the
 selective easing of conditions within prisons. In particular,
 they noted an improvement in the guards' behavior. No report
 of physical abuse by prison officials came to light in 1989.
 In September, the GDR ratified the U.N. Convention Against
 Torture.

 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Until November, security agencies-had blanket authority to
 detain and interrogate persons on:suspicion alone; People who
 became-:particularly active in officially disapproved ways were
 sometimes subjected to repeated harassment, such as recurrent
 police-interrogations, despite the absence of formal charges.
 They might be arrested with or without warrants, merely for
 xedpfesging dissenting-views. A person held in detention has
 the-rIght to a judicial review of continued detention, but in
 political cased this right might not have been effectively
 observed.., Beginiiin In Nov-ember, the authorities generally
 avoided actions directed at dissidents.
 Althbugh-the Criminal Procedure Code sets a limit of 3 months
 on investigatory proceedings, prosecuting authorities appear
 to have no difficulty in extending this period. Under the old
 regime, inmost political cases, it often took many weeks
 before interested parties were notified of the arrest.
 Charges filed in clearly political cases were often based on
 laws which were wfitten in vague and general language. The
 penal code provides, for instance, that the transmission of
 -information"detrimental to the interests of the German
 Ddmocratic Republic,"'even if it is not classified, may be
 considered.treason. Laws against "antistate agitation" and
 asocial behavior" (parasitism) were often applied selectively
 againstpeople who become politically active. -The broad and
 vague -wotding severely restrictedthe possibility for
 defense. .'East German-attorneys report that prisoners brought
 to-trial under these laws were only occasionally acquitted.
 No effort to enforce these laws has been evident since
 October, and a revision of the penal code can be expected in
 1990.,
 Until-November, the authorities in selected cases issued
 passports and exit visas to dissidents and exiled them to the
 FRG;    .        -"
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the old system the public'was usually excludeo*from
 trials involving security and political issues. Although the
 Criiminal:Procedure Code guarantees a defendant access to a
 defense~attorney, and this right exists fiom the'beginning of
 the investigative proceeding, the authorities were not
 required to inform a detainee of this provision, and the right
 was not always exercised in a timely manner. Prisoners are
 allowed to select their own attorneys. However, until
 investigatory proceedings were completed, prisoners were
 permitted to see their lawyers only in the presence of the:
 police and to discuss only matters not related to the case. -
 The prosecutor could restrict contacts between the defense
 attorney and:his- client. :The number of instances in which
 such restrictions were applied reportedly has been declining,
 atleast in-nonsensitive cases. Discussion of a'case itself
 often took place in a brief interview shortly before the
 trial. Attorneys could not make photocopies of their clients,
 files. Files could be reviewed only in court, and notes had
 to be taken in longhand or with the aid of a dictaphone.
 GOR-attitudes regarding the Criminal Procedure Code are
 changing. A 1987 official commentary to the Criminal Code and
 
 
 1118
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 the Criminal Procedure Code stated a presumption against
 restrictions forbidding a defense attorney from discussing the
 case with his client. Another official commentary advanced
 the defense attorney's ability to gain more and earlier access
 to investigative documents. A court handed down a decision
 which freed a person from pretrial detention, and a Supreme
 Court justice published an article critical of. excessive use
 of pretrial detention by many prosecutors and lower courts.
 The plenum of the Supreme Court has established new evidentiary
 rules which require prosecutors to meet a higher standard of
 proof in criminal cases. More changes to the GDR criminal
 justice system may occur due to the reforms which have
 occurred since October.
 Trials in sensitive cases had been short and perfunctory.
 Constitutionally, the courts were under the control of the
 Council of State. In reality, they were controlled by the
 SED, which in effect appointed the judges. Military courts
 try civilians only in military espionage cases.
 Until November,-the Government did not admit to holding
 political prisoners. It did not publish statistics which
 would assist in determining the number of political
 prisoners. However, the FRG Ministry for Inner-German
 Relations has announced that it bought freedom for some 1,247
 political prisoners from the GDR in 1987 and for some 1,200 in
 1988. The Ministry continued this practice in 1989, but cited
 no figures. The Salzgitter Center, an FRG government office
 which monitors GDR human rights abuses, has registered some
 25,000 prosecutions for political offenses in the GDR over the
 past 25 years. Such prosecutions have generally resulted in
 prison sentences of 18-24 months.
 Estimates of the number of political prisoners vary widely,
 both because of the difficulty in obtaining information and
 the use of different definitional criteria. Official West
 German sources speak of more than 1,000 who were being held.
 The private West German-based August 13 Work Group estimated
 there were some 3,000 political prisoners, while other human
 rights groups' estimates ranged as high as 7,000. Most
 persons who fell into the political category were imprisoned
 as a result of pursuing their right of emigration by what the
 GDR considered extra-legal means, such as attempts to cross
 the Berlin Wall or the FRG-GDR border or to demonstrate
 publicly for emigration. Following the December 19 meeting
 between FRG Chancellor Kohl and GDR Premier Modrow, the GDR
 agreed to release all political prisoners before Christmas
 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Until November, the secret police, assisted by informers,
 opened mail, installed listening devices, placed people under
 surveillance, subjected them to interrogation and intimidation,
 and arrested them without due process. By law, the police
 need court authorization to enter and search a house. They
 sometimes authorized entry themselves, however, and the courts
 retroactively gave approval. Evidence thus obtained could be
 used in court.
 Young people are not forced to join the SED's youth movement,
 the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend--FDJ), but school
 and government authorities made it clear that failure to do so
 would limit educational and job opportunities. Boys aged 15

 increasingly less-important in the GDR.

 populae';-and tie State.does not, try to jam or otherwise

 Section 2 -Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Until IJovember, freedom of speech remained severely
 circumscribed.--  There were testrictite laws relating to-free
 expression,.and ublic dissent could result in prison
 sentences;- Perhaps out of a conscious effort to seem less
 .repressive, abroad; however, theauthorities-appeaied
 increasingly reluctant-to punish dissenting speech publicly.

 common:for the State to fine rather-than imprison individuals
 wbo .qttempted to exercise their right ,to freedom of
 expression.. Fmor-example, some activists staging an

 fined -amount*,xaqging from $256 to $769. After November, free
 speech was increasingly tolerated although the restrictive
 laws w@restll.in,effect.
 Wegtern journalists' ability-to report on events in the-.GDR is
 olimited by.laws rest -cting--their.ability tbo.travel without
 Pxjor pei;ission-and to contact .potential sources directly.
 Some East Germans considered contact with foreign-journalists
 disadvantageous and tried to avoid it.-
 Until ,November, the Government controlled all media and
 licensed all publications prior to distribution. The media's
 bpsic.functon was to support and strengthen the Socialist
 order,.-Over the past:several years, articles have appeared in
 estabished journals on previously taboo social subjects, such
 .as.alqohgli-smhomosexuality, child abuse, and juvenile
 delinquency. -tLate in 1989, the authorities encouraged
 increased openness in the media, which was reflected in part
 in detailed descriptions of the corruption of ousted SED
 leaders.    -  --
 Government censorship of church newspapers, which began in
 1988, continued into early.-1989. Particularly.affected was
 the coverage of church convocations which discussed subjects
 -such,'.as educationpolicy, environmental protection; military
 service, And conscientious-objection. In March, however,
 possibly as a go-odwill-gesture, the State stopped this
 practice. There has been no censorship of church publications
 since then.
 There was little underground literature circulated by
 dissidents, in part because church-connected groups could
 circulate materials with considerable freedom within church
 confines, in part because of the small size of the GDR
 
 
 1120
 OPPRiAN DRfKOCR&TIC RE~PUBLIC
 dissident community, and in part because of the pervasiveness
 of the security apparatus. From time to time, however,
 unofficial activist groups produced, independently of both the
 church and the State, underground newspapers in limited
 quantities. One example is the monthly bulletin, Grenzfall,
 which covers peace, ecology, human rights, and independent
 activities in the GDR. Monthly publication of Grenzfall was
 suspended in January 1988 after sonme members of the group were
 arrested in the wake of a human rights demonstration and
 subsequently emigrated to the FRG. An issue appeared in
 February 1989 after a year's hiatus.
 Circulation or importation of most printed materials required
 an official permit. Since former SED General Secretary
 Honecker's September 1987 visit to the FRG, however, East
 Germany relaxed somewhat the stringent controls governing
 importation of printed materials from the West. Private
 persons could import certain specialized publications, even if
 the publications did not have a special postal license.
 However, the regulation elastically excluded literature
 "directed against the preservation of peace and containing
 other agitation" or "contravening the interests of the
 Socialist State and its citizens."
 The GDR also controlled the distribution of Soviet
 publications. Until November, it was often difficult for East
 Germans to open new subscriptions to Soviet periodicals. The
 State banned single issues of several Soviet publications, for
 example, an issue of a German-language Soviet newspaper, Neue
 Zeit, containing an interview with Polish activist Lech Walesa
 in February 1989. After November, East Germans were permitted
 to subscribe to Soviet periodicals without restriction.
 Western newspapers and magazines were generally unavailable to
 the public at large. Small quantities of Western journals
 were for sale for hard currency in international hotels upon
 request. Some libraries, university departments, and official
 institutes also received Western journals, but circulation was
 highly restricted. Until November, GDR and Western travelers
 could be interrogated or arrested simply for possessing
 unlicensed printed material.
 The SED conceived of art and literature as a means of
 promoting political goals. The value of works was judged on
 whether they ultimately conveyed a positive view of Communist
 society and goals, though they could be quite critical of
 individual aspects. Overly critical views or perceptions were
 discouraged or censored. Publishing houses practiced
 self-censorship, and works had to receive official clearance
 before they were published, performed or exhibited. Even
 before the November events, some previously banned books
 appeared in East German editions and a number of plays were
 staged on overtly political themes sharply critical of
 practices and positions inherent in Socialist societies.
 Until November, academic freedom was severely limited and even
 formally restricted by law. The State viewed education as an
 instrument for "building socialism." All areas of academic
 inquiry were strictly controlled. Teachers who allowed open
 classroom discussion of unapproved themes or topics or who
 deviate from the party line were disciplined. Many books were
 prohibited totally; others permitted only in university
 libraries to which carefully screened and authorized personnel
 were allowed access.

 GERM DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly,
 only the churches maintained the ability to organize meetings
 without prior state approval. The Government made no move to
 interfe;e, with events held on church property, including
 protest gatherings in June over the events in China and an
 August,,13, meeting calling for the destruction of the Berlin
 In ,contrast,- an independent organization, Neues Forum, which
 wanted to work outside the church to create a broad-based
 independent dialogue and a more attractive Socialist State,
 was refused, permission to assemble in September. The
 auth6rities .overturned this decision in November, however, and
 legalized Neues Forum.
 The formation of private organizations or clubs also required
 government permission. Professional associations for writers
 and artists wert headed by party members and ultimately
 controlled Jby the State. Dissidents and critics had been
 expelled and deprived of important professional privileges.
 After the street demonstrations in Leipzig in September and
 October which spread to other cities, the opening of the
 Berlin Wall, and the discussions between representatives of
 the Government and of dissident groups, freedom of assembly
 and association have expanded in fact although -xot yet in
 law. For a discuislon of freedom ofassociation as it applies
 to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c.  Freedoi of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief and
 worship. The State officially promotes atheism but in
 practice tolerates and even provides some financial subsidies
 for religious activity. Until late in 1989, overt adherence
 to religious beliefs could result in disqualification for
 preferred jobs and educational oppqrtunities, although the
 "largest religious.community, the Evangelical (Lutheran)
 Chufch, had some success in pleading the cases of its members
 who suffered such discrimination.
 New churches continue to be built, and old ones restored, in
 limited numbers with government approval, The Greifswald
 Cathedral was recently reconsecrated after extensive
 renoy.atiops funded by both West and East German Lutheran
 churches and the-GDR.
 Clergy are trained in both state universities and church-run
 seminaries. The Government has demonstrated some flexibility
 in its treatment of minority religions. Relations with the
 Catholic Church and the small Jewish community remain stable.
 The State is encouraging the first kosher cafe to open in East
 Berlin and recently promised to increase its financial support
 for the'restoration of Berlin's largest synagogue and the
 establishment ofa,,Jewish'cultural center and museum.
 While the Government has not rescinded a ban on organized
 activities by Christian Scientists, it has made no effort to
 interfere with those activities. Members of the Church of
 Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints continue to practice their
 faith relatively unimpeded. Under a special program beginning
 in March, young East German members of the church may go/on
 
 
 1122
 
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 mission to the West for 2 years, while Mormon missionaries
 from the West may proselytize in the GDR.
 Until November, the churches remained under continuing
 government pressure to watch their words and deeds, and the
 secret police continued to monitor church-sponsored events
 closely. Nonetheless, the Evangelical (Lutheran) Church
 remained the only institutional forum in which divergent
 opinions could be expressed with relative freedom. With the
 exception of church-sponsored events held on church grounds,
 groups were not allowed to organize events without official
 approval.
 The church-state dialogue on issues such as freedom of
 religion and thought, conditions of military service,
 conscientious objection, and compulsory military training in
 the schools, was postponed by the State in the fall of 1987.
 Due to the reforms which have occurred, this dialogue may now
 be resumed.
 Western cletgy were permitted to attend the important
 Europe-wide ecumenical convocation in the GDR in 1989, and
 more than 300 East Germans, selected by the East German
 Evangelical (Lutheran) Church, were permitted to attend the
 massive church meeting (Kirchentag) in West Berlin.
 For many years, young men subject to universal conscription
 who are religious conscientious objectors have been able to
 choose alternative service in unarmed construction units.
 However, those opposed to any military service whatever were
 incarcerated. In the past 3 years, the Government has
 followed a policy of ignoring such persons, i.e., neither
 drafting nor prosecuting them. Conscientious objectors may
 still face discrimination in schools and jobs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Most East Germans can travel freely within the country, except
 within special border zones or near military installations.
 Technically, they are not free to change their place of
 residence without government approval, but normally this
 amounts only to a requirement to register with the police.
 All East Germans must carry identification cards which the
 police have the right to check at will. Because of their
 criminal or political records, including the filing of
 emigration applications, approximately 60,000 East Germans
 carry a special identification card called PM-12, which in
 many but not all cases restricts domestic as well as foreign
 travel. Until November, foreign travel was tightly
 controlled, and exit visas were required.
 A new law on short-term visits and permanent emigration to the
 West came into effect on January 1, 1989. Under this law, the
 categories of persons eligible to submit applications for
 travel and the circumstances under which applications could be
 made were somewhat broader and more clearly defined, though
 private travel remained limited to persons visiting relatives
 in the West. The new law also more clearly defined--though it
 did not greatly expand--the categories of persons who could
 apply for family reunification and created a new category of
 emigration for humanitarian reasons. One provision of the new
 law permitted emigration by minors so that they could be
 reunited with their parents.
 
 
 1123
 GERMAN Q=4OCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The bureaucracy was required tq accept applications, reach
 decisions within fixed time periods, and provide clear legal
 statements, for rejections. After July 1, people had the right
 to appeal decisions to the courts, which, however, could
 review cases only for procedural errors. Additional
 amendments enacted in mid-March, in an attempt to respond to
 popular criticism that the new law wag proving more
 restrictive than the relatively ad hoc liberal practices of
 the past several years, broadened the categories of persons
 who could make private visits to the West. The grounds for
 refusal,'howeveA, included some flexible clauses reserving for
 the'authorities, considerable discretionary power.
 A crSis began in the summer when would-be emigrants staged
 sit-ins,.at the FRG's permaneht mission in East Berlin and in
 the FRG embassies in' Budapest, Prague, and Warsaw. Many
 additional peoplp sought to escape via the Austrian-Hungarian
 border. By mid-September, uoxe than 20,000 had crossed the
 border without proper GDR documentation. After the Hungarian
 Government opendd its border to Austria in September, more
 than 100,000 East Germans succeeded in reaching the FRG
 without GDR permission   In addition, more than 15,000 East
 Germans were transported from Prague to the FRG by East German
 trains after special.arrangements were reached to resolve ,the
 Prague and Warsaw embassy situations. Subsequently the GDR
 impqsed qont.rols on the travel of East Germans to
 Czechoslovakia. In November,GDR authorities opened gates -in
 the ,perlin wall and along the.inner-Germah bQrder to enable
 East Germans to visit West Berlin and the FRG by simply
 showing thiV papsports. billions have'now done so.
 Until late in the year, most emigrants could return to the GDR
 only with great difficulty. In general, only East Germans in
 binational-marr,.age cases-.were permitted to keep their GDR
 passports and travel freely between East and West. Other
 emigrants usually had to wait 5 years before they could return
 for family visitts, persons .who received permission for an
 extqnded 'tay 4n.the West but who :made no attempt to change-'
 their citizenship, such as writeraJurek Becker and Monika
 Maron,:apparently were allowed to return at any time for a
 visit. Those who left the country illegally before January 1,
 1981, were.eligible to apply'for permission to visit, but
 reportedly only half of those who-had applied had obtained
 permission. Persons who fled after 1980 faced possible
 criminalprosecution if they'returned to the GDR.
 .Repatriation was eveil more tortuous and seldom occurred. The
 GDR.,authorities deliberated such cases carefully. When
 persons were permitted to return, they were treated by the
 State as regular East Germans, though they often faced
 siipicion and hostility from fellow East Germans who knew.of
 their circumstances.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to .ChangeTheir-Government
 until-November, East Germans were not free to change the
 system of government. The SED leadership made.all important
 decisions, controlled the Government and its,.operations,
 determined who would-fill-executive positions in the
 government apparatus, and ensured that its party members
 occupied a majority of them.- Although four other parties were
 represented in the Government, they were not permitted to
 challenge Communist leadership or control. In the first
 indications of change in this situation, the unicameral
 
 
 1124
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 legislature, the Volkskammer, in November elected the chairman
 of the Democratic Peasants Party as its presiding officer and
 in December elected the chairman of the Liberal Democratic
 Party to succeed Egon Krenz as chairman of the Council of
 State (chief of state). Furthermore, the Volkskammer in
 December voted to amend the Constitution eliminating the SED's
 "leading role" in the State.
 All parties and mass organizations (such as trade unions) were
 represented in the National Front, which was controlled by the
 SED. For election purposes, the National Front prepared lists
 of approved candidates according to a formula which ensured
 the SED's domination. Candidates exceeded the number of
 available seats, and a candidate high on the list could be
 rejected on election day if more than 50 percent of the voters
 crossed his name off the ballot. In such a case, a candidate
 lower on the list could be elected. This was, however,
 extremely rare. For the first time in 20 years during the May
 elections, two candidates lost. In December 1989, the
 National Front vias dissolved.
 Charges of fraud during the May 7 local elections raised
 questions about how far the East Germans' right to
 self-determination extends. Although there is no question
 that the majority of people voted for the'official ballot,
 unofficial poll watchers maintain, and most people believe,
 that the official count showed many fewer "no" votes and a
 higher participation rate than was actually the case. The
 Government dismissed such allegations. Officially, 98.7
 percent of those eligible to vote participated, and 99.91
 percent of the voters "approved" the ballot.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although the GDR is a signatory of the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), it
 had generally taken the position that inquiries into its human
 rights policies constituted interference in its internal
 affairs. Requests by private human rights groups in the West
 for information on human rights conditions went unanswered,
 and the Government discouraged visits by such groups. Within
 the GDR, members of unofficial human rights groups, such as
 the Peace and Human Rights Initiative and the Solidarity
 church working group, faced surveillance and harassment by the
 secret police and could have been arrested if their activities
 were deemed threatening to the Government. Such groups were
 often the only source of Current information available to
 outside observers on human rights developments in the GDR.
 Until November, their ability to disseminate information was
 restricted by official harassment.
 The Vienna Concluding Document of the CSCE permits signatory
 states to question human rights implementation in other member
 countries. Spain, in its capacity as president of the
 European Community, invoked the-human rights issue against the
 GDR in the spring of 1989 in a case in which an escaping East
 German was arrested by GDR river police just after reaching
 West Berlin. The GDR responded to the note but insisted that
 the matter lay entirely within its sovereign competence and
 did not immediately resolve or otherwise provide information
 about the case. The person in question was ultimately allowed
 to emigrate to the FRG.

 Right'd.oes'noe attempt to safeguard the human rights of East
 Germans," Instead, it criticizew human rights conditions in
 oths countries while claiming there are no problems in the
 GDR. -ast German refusal? until recently, to recognize human
 rights problems has also meant that there were few effective
 executi~e,'egisiativei judicial,-'or administrative riemedies
 for addressing human rights violations.

 beating, is not condoned either legally or in practice.
 Although it occurs, no statistics or reliable information is
 available as to:its ektent. In the-'event-of such abuse, women
 have the right to seek redress in the courts.
 The Democratic Women's Federation of Germany officially
 represents gomeh's interests within the SED. -Its fvndtions,
 however; are nominal.-
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association -
 Workers ao not~liave the-right to -establish, and join unions and
 federations'of-their dwn choosing. The Free German Trade
 Union. (FDGB) islan appendage of the SED. It consists of 16
 unions covering all workers and professionals and represents
 some 90 percent of the work force. 'All. large'industriaI and
 retailienterprises, which employ some 85 percent bf the labor
 force, areowned by the State.- The'FDGB'srble has'been to
 enforce'and promote official government andparty policies,'"
 which were considered to-correspond with the interests'of-the
 masses, rather than to promote members' interests, which -might
 conflict-bith- those policies. -The  FDGB is affiliated with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation-6f Trade Unions.
 Following the upheaval which began in October 1989, labor
 entered a period of transition, I nthe intervening period,
 -independent trade union groups have emerged demanding respect
 for freedom of association and the right to strike, and
 scattered wildcat strikes have occurred. However, neither
 these groups nor the rights they demand have thus far achieved
 any basis in law. Meanwhile, the FDGB has experienced a
 dramatic loss of membership and two spontaneous changes of
 leadership under the pressure of mass demonstrations and
 accusations of corruption. The former president of the
 organization remains in detention on corruption charges. The
 FDGB has scheduled an extraordinary convention for January
 1990 in an apparent attempt at reform intended to make the
 organization more responsive to workers' interests.
 Except as noted above, workers do not have the constitutional
 right to.strike. There were no published reports of strikes
 in 1989.
 In its 1989 report, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Experts (COE) reiterated its rejection of the
 trade union monopoly granted to the FDGB. The Committee found

 GERUAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 that the situation in the GDR was not compatible with ILO
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association and called on the
 Government to provide legislation granting the workers,
 including members of collective farms, freedom to establish
 organizations of their own choosing.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legal provision for collective bargaining, nor
 does it exist in practice. Although worker representatives
 are allowed to sit on the enterprises' boards, in reality they
 rubberstamp the boards, policies. There are no export
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is not legally prohibited but it is not practiced
 in the GDR.
 d. Minimurd Age for Employment of Children
 Children from age 14 may work part time during vacations and
 to further their education. Children can work full time with
 parental permission between ages 14 and 18. Youths under the
 age of 18 may not work between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Youth
 commissions within the FDGB effectively enforce the child
 labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Under the law, a full-time worker is entitled,to a minimum
 wage of-approximately $216 per month. This provides
 subsistence-level living for workers and their families.
 The maximum workweek is 43 3/4 hours, with a maximum of an
 additional 120 hours overtime per year permissible by law,
 except under extraordinary conditions. A 2-day weekend is
 common. The GDR guarantees persons the right-to a job, and
 there is essentially no unemployment.
 Labor law obliges enterprises to protect their employees,
 health and safety in the workplace. In reality, working-
 conditions are often difficult, especially in mining and heavy
 industry. The Government has had some success, however, in
 reducing the relatively high rate of accidents in the
 workplace.
