 ALBANIA*
 Albania is a one-party state ruled by a harsh Marxist-Leninist
 dictatorship. The Government proclaims itself a People's
 Socialist Republic. Enver Hoxha, the party leader since World
 War II, exercises personal leadership through the
 125,000-member Albanian Workers' Party. A large, effective
 security service assists the party in maintaining repressive
 controls over the Albanian people who enjoy only very limited
 civil and political rights.
 Human rights conditions in Albania appear to be exceptionally
 bad. There is substantial evidence, corroborated by private
 international organizations, of significant human rights
 violations. The Government has repeatedly refused to
 cooperate with any of the international organizations which
 investigate human rights complaints. The situation has not
 improved in 1984.
 Living in a mountainous and remote land, Albanians have
 traditionally been isolated from their neighbors. The Hoxha
 regime has used this isolation as a tool to shield the
 populace from foreign influences. Nevertheless, the
 Government has recently shown signs of moving tentatively
 toward increasing its ties to Balkan and Western European
 states. Albania is a member of the United Nations, but has
 not signed the Final Act of the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although Albania is shrouded in secrecy, it appears that the
 Hoxha regime has used political killing against its
 opponents. Hoxha has periodically purged the leadership and
 executed deposed rivals in order to eliminate challenges to
 his personal rule from within the party and the Government.
 In 1981, former Prime Minister and long-time Hoxha associate
 Mehmet Shehu was reported to have committed *suicide' in
 suspicious circumstances after policy disagreements with
 Hoxha. Four of Shehu's supporters were subsequently executed
 for conspiring with him, and many other supporters, including
 family members, were jailed.
 b. Disappearance
 Persons who have escaped from Albania report that
 disappearances occur, but specific corroboration is not
 available.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and police brutality are reportedly used in Albania,
 particularly against persons accused of anti-state or
 * The United States has not had diplomatic relations with or
 official representation in Albania since World War II. It is
 difficult therefore to comment authoritatively on conditions
 in Albania.

 religious activity. Because of insufficient evidence,
 however, it is difficult to corroborate such reports.
 Private international humanitarian organizations have reported
 extremely harsh prison conditions in Albania, including a
 severe hard labor regime with inadequate food and clothing,
 long-term solitary confinement, cramped cells without room to
 lie down, and unheated, unfurnished cells lacking any sanitary
 facilities. The Burelli prison has been singled out for
 special mention in this regard.
 Eyewitnesses have reported the exhibition of bodies of dead
 prisoners as a means of intimidating the populace. It is
 impossible to say how widespread this practice may be.
 The Albanian Criminal Code lists 34 crimes, a number of which
 are political offenses, for which the death sentence may be
 imposed. Among them are agitation and propaganda against the
 state (Article 55), incitement of hatred or quarrels between
 nationalities and races (Article 56), creation of a
 counterrevolutionary organization or participation therein
 (Article 57), activity against the revolutionary movement of
 the working class (Article 60), and refusal to carry out a
 duty or coercing others to refuse (Article 144).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no one may be arrested without
 court or prosecutorial approval or be sentenced to jail
 without a court verdict or for an act which is not a crime.
 The Criminal Code however, provides that banishment or
 internment may be administratively imposed, without trial, for
 up to 5 years on persons whom the authorities consider a
 threat to the social system and on the families of fugitives.
 There are numerous reports that families of escapees from
 Albania are imprisoned as a deterrent to other potential
 illegal emigrants. In its 1984 report, Amnesty International
 notes a number of such cases in 1983.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system in Albania includes the Supreme Court and
 regional and district courts. Like all organs of government
 and state authority, it appears to be under the total control
 of Hoxha and the Albanian Workers' Party. There is virtually
 no chance a court would render an independent verdict in
 conflict with the wishes or policies of the regime. Some
 trials are said to be held behind closed doors when it suits
 the purposes of the regime.
 Reports of the number of persons in prison range from 4,000 to
 40,000, including 300 members of the pre-World War II elite,
 as well as pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese, and other political
 prisoners. Many persons are serving sentences for expressing
 dissatisfaction with conditions in Albania or for trying to
 flee the country. Although an amnesty was approved in
 November 1982, there is no independent confirmation of the
 number of persons amnestied.
 Amnesty International reports that political detainees have
 been held for up to 6 months in solitary confinement without
 access to lawyers or relatives. Defendants at political
 trials have usually been denied defense counsel and have had
 to conduct their own defense.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution proclaims the inviolability of the home and
 the privacy of correspondence, but at the same time provides
 that these and other civil rights are subordinate to the
 general interest and cannot be exercised in opposition to the
 socialist order. It is generally accepted that the
 authorities can and do violate the privacy of the home
 whenever and to the extent necessary to achieve their ends.
 The Government uses its pervasive informer network to report
 on, among other things, the private lives of its citizens.
 Children are taught to report on their parents' activities in
 the home, such as whether they practice religion or speak
 against the Government. Contact with the outside world is
 carefully monitored. Members of the Greek minority who have
 escaped report that they had difficulty in receiving mail or
 telephone calls from relatives in Greece. Packages of food,
 medicine, and clothing sent to them were returned by the
 Albanian authorities to Greece without their knowledge.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Albanian Constitution states that citizens enjoy
 freedom of speech and freedom of the press, it provides that
 these rights cannot be exercized in opposition to the
 socialist order. Consequently, the Government has imposed
 rigid restrictions on the people's freedom of speech and
 press. The government-controlled press never criticizes the
 leadership or its policies, and any citizen who does so
 publicly is subject to swift and severe reprisals. Persons
 found listening to foreign radio broadcasts or exhibiting
 'alien manifestations' have in the past been reprimanded or
 jailed, although there is some indication that these
 restrictions may have been relaxed lately. Information from
 abroad is carefully controlled. Art and literature are deemed
 to be weapons of revolutionary change and are subject to rigid
 state control and censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The security police deals severely with group activities that
 do not have government sanction or that might appear to be in
 opposition to the leadership. There are no independent
 associations or organizations. Nearly all Albanians belong to
 trade unions that are part of the United Trade Unions of
 Albania, an arm of the party. The unions have no significant
 voice in the field of labor relations, although they do play a
 key role in indoctrinating and propagandizing the workers, in
 maintaining labor discipline, and in organizing the periods of
 so-called "voluntary* manual labor in which all Albanians are
 expected to take part.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religious activity in Albania is expressly prohibited by
 the Constitution and by government policy. Historically,
 about 70 percent of all Albanians were Muslim, 20 percent were
 Orthodox, and 10 percent were Roman Catholic. However, in
 1967 the Government abrogated all laws dealing with
 church-state relations and began an active campaign to banish
 all vestiges of religion. More than 2,000 mosques, churches,
 
 
 913
 ALBANIA
 monasteries, and other institutions were closed, and many
 religious leaders were imprisoned or executed. All religious
 literature was banned, as were any personal manifestations of
 religious belief or practice. The regime proudly proclaimed
 Albania to be the world's first atheist state.
 The regime continues to suppress religious activity by
 threatening harsh penalties for believers who practice their
 faith and by obliging citizens to inform on believers.
 Nevertheless, there are some recent signs that the shrill
 anti-religious campaign was quietly toned down as the regime
 tried to improve its relations with Italy, Greece, and
 Turkey. Enver Hoxha has been quoted as saying that religious
 belief 'is each person's right,' but there has been no
 official assertion that religious practice is once again
 allowed. In spite of years of anti-religious pressure, it is
 reported that some Albanians have continued to practice their
 faith in the privacy of their homes. Tourists have also
 recently reported seeing Muslim Albanians faithfully kneeling
 in prayer along the roadside with apparent impunity.
 In November 1983, the Vatican publicly condemned religious
 persecution in Albania and claimed that a number of priests,
 members of holy orders, and seminarians had died in prison.
 It also reported that two priests had been executed for
 administering baptisms to children. The official press denies
 that believers have been persecuted and maintains that
 religious belief is opposed only by argument.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country and travel abroad are controlled
 very strictly, and transgressors against the laws are severely
 punished. The Criminal Code states that "flight from the
 state and refusal to return to the fatherland on the part of a
 person sent on service or allowed to leave the state is
 punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 years or by
 death." The Criminal Code makes "illegal border crossing'
 punishable by up to 5 years' imprisonment. Despite this, both
 Greece and Yugoslavia have recently experienced a sizable
 increase in the number of Albanian refugees who have risked
 their lives to cross the border. Albanians reportedly are
 allowed to leave the country legally only on official business
 or, very rarely, for family reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No such right exists in theory or in practice. The country is
 governed by a totalitarian dictatorship, headed by Enver Hoxha
 in his capacity as First Secretary of the Albanian Workers'
 Party. The Constitution establishes the Albanian Workers'
 Party as the sole political entity and Marxism-Leninism as the
 dominant political ideology. Any attempt by individual
 citizens to criticize or change the form of government or its
 leaders is dealt with severely. Elections are rigged in
 advance. During the last quadrennial election for the
 People's Assembly (Parliament) in 1982, the Government
 announced that 100 percent of eligible voters had
 participated, and that the official slate of candidates had
 been elected with only one negative vote from the entire
 electorate.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government denies any violations of human rights and
 refuses to cooperate in any investigation of allegations to
 the contrary. Amnesty International's 1984 report detailed
 numerous concerns about the human rights situation in
 Albania. Freedom House rates Albania "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With a population of 2.9 million and limited natural
 resources, Albania is the poorest country in Europe and has
 the least amount of arable land per capita. Given the poverty
 of the country and its self-imposed isolation, including the
 refusal to accept foreign credits to finance trade
 transactions, the regime has achieved significant economic
 development since World War II. Per capita gross income in
 1984, the lowest in Europe, is estimated at about $850, but no
 current figures are available.
 The food supply is adequate, and there are no reports of
 chronic food shortages or rationing. The population receives
 more than the minimum daily per capita calorie intake,
 altnough the level (110 percent in 1977) is one of the lowest
 in Europe. Life expectancy is estimated at 71.7 years, and
 the infant mortality rate is about 42.3 per 1,000 births.
 Nearly all children are educated, but the overall literacy
 rate for all ages is estimated at about 75 percent.
 All land is the property of the state, and individual citizens
 may own only such personal property as permitted by law.
 Housing rent is low, but there is a housing shortage,
 particularly for newly-wed couples. The economy is based on
 agriculture and the production of raw materials, especially
 minerals.
 The Constitution states that women shall enjoy 'equal rights
 with men in work, pay, holidays, social security, education,
 in all social-political activity, as well as in the family."
 Information on the extent to which these rights are exercised
 is not available, but there are indications that the regime
 has advanced the status of women. Women are said to
 participate equally in the obligatory labor and military
 service programs. There are several women in the party and
 government leadership. Albania is party to the International
 Convention of the Political Rights of Women and the Convention
 on the Nationality of Married Women.
