 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a strong tradition
 of democratic parliamentary rule. Queen Margrethe II is
 titular Head of State. A cabinet led by a prime minister and
 accountable to the unicameral Folketing (parliament) leads the
 government. A minority coalition government led by the
 Conservative Party has ruled since 1982.
 Denmark has a unified national police force. Its higher ranks
 tend to be lawyers on rotation from the civil service. There
 is a small intelligence service, operated as a section of the
 police. Its director is a civil service lawyer, and it is
 subject to an intelligence oversight committee of the
 Folketing.
 An advanced industrial state, Denmark has a mixed economy
 corabining private and public ownership. The Government is
 seeking ways to reduce the public sector's share of the
 economy. Personal freedoms and the right to pursue private
 interests and to hold private property are protected by law
 and respected in practice.
 Deeply rooted democratic principles, an egalitarian tradition,
 a lively press, and highly developed educational and social
 welfare systems have made Denmark a leading defender of human
 rights in the world. The Constitution establishes the
 Folketing's "Ombudsman," to whom anyone may protest if he or
 she feels wrongly or unreasonably treated by any national or
 municipal authority. Internationally, Denmark participates
 actively in a number of groups that protect and preserve human
 rights. In 1990 it hosted the Human Dimension meeting of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions, disappearances, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detentions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no torture or inhuman treatment. An innovative
 Center for Torture Victims at Copenhagen's City Hospital,
 supported by the Foreign Ministry, treats patients in the
 refugee community, assists torture victims, and studies ways
 to hinder the use of torture around the globe. In 1990 one of
 the Center's doctors obtained the first doctorate with a
 dissertation on torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 No person may be deprived of personal liberty without due
 process of law. Arrestees must appear before a judge within
 24 hours. There is no time limit on preventive detention, and
 Detainees may be held for long periods in isolation,

 DENMARK
 although a judge must periodically review and approve such
 detention. In a few cases, detainees have been in isolation
 for years. All have a right to counsel, at government expense
 if necessary. Bail is permitted; There are no exiles.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 The Danish legal system consists of a series of courts, local
 and regional, up to the Supreme Court. Trials are usually
 public; judges may make exceptions in some circumstances, such
 as paternity and divorce cases. In criminal cases, trials are
 closed when necessary to protect a victim's privacy, such as
 in rape cases, or to protect a witness' identity.
 The rights of the accused are carefully protected. Defendants
 have the right to be present, to confront witnesses, and to
 present evidence. They enjoy the presumption of innocence.
 Defendants are not required to tell the truth; however, they
 may not falsely accuse someone else. The judiciary is fully
 independent. Judges are appointed by the Minister of Justice
 to serve until age 7G. They may not be dismissed but may be
 impeached for negligence or criminal acts. There are no
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 A constitutional prohibition against searching homes, seizing
 and examining papers, and breaching the secrecy of
 communications without a judicial order is respected in
 practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press. There is one large state-owned
 radio and television company. Editorial control is exercised
 by a board independent of the Government. A second television
 channel, one-third government subsidized, opened in 1988. In
 both cases, management decides programming content, but
 operational decisions are restricted by government mandate.
 Programs critical of the Government-appear on both channels.
 The state radio company operates the only normal wattage radio
 stations in Denmark. However, in 1990, the first application
 was made for a nationwide independent radio station. The
 Government indicated it would favorably consider the request.
 Private stations were restricted heretofore to transmitters of
 10 watts for radio or 100 watts for television and could not
 carry commercial advertising.
 Publications, including books and newspapers, reflect a wide
 variety of political opinion. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danes may freely assemble and form associations. Public
 meetings require permits, which are routinely given. Police
 may by law be present at any event which may endanger the
 peace. Any organization may affiliate with international
 bodies in its field.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, the state church is the Evangelical
 Lutheran Church, and it receives a large subsidy. However,
 religious freedom is guaranteed to all. No religion is banned
 or discouraged; conversion is unrestricted. Discrimination on
 the basis of religion is prohibited and seldom, if ever,
 occurs. Missionaries get visas easily; a number of them serve
 expatriate and Danish congregations. A 2-year limit on
 missionary visas was abolished in 1990.
 Danes, accustomed to a monocultural society, are clearly
 uneasy with the 57,000 Muslims, primarily immigrants from the
 Middle East, in their midst. Construction of a new mosque in
 Copenhagen on government-owned land offered at minimal cost
 was a source of controversy during the year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have full freedom of travel and movement. Persons
 determined to be refugees are never repatriated against their
 will.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Danes have the right to change their government peacefully.
 The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen after
 consultation with parties in the Folketing. The Folketing's
 179 members are chosen in free and open elections under a
 complex system of proportional representation designed to help
 small parties and to reflect the popular vote. only 2
 percent of the vote is needed to obtain seats. Eleven parties
 ran in the 1990 election. Since Danish governments tend to be
 minority coalitions, most important decisions require
 extensive negotiations with the opposition.
 Danes over 18 years of age may vote. Resident foreigners may
 vote or run in local elections, and they hold 13 city council
 seats nationwide. Parliamentary elections must occur at least
 every 4 years, or by a decision of the Prime Minister, a
 parliamentary vote of no confidence, or the Government's
 resignation. There are no restrictions, in law or in
 practice, on the participation of women in government or
 politics.
 The territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands have
 democratically elected home rule governments with broad powers
 encompassing all but foreign and security affairs. There are
 strong proindependence parties in the Faroes but none in
 Greenland. Denmark is ready to grant independence to both
 territories on request. Greenlanders and Faroes are full
 Danish citizens and enjoy the same human rights as other
 Danes. Each territory has two seats in the Folketing.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights organizations operate freely. The Danish Human
 Rights Center is a private government-funded institution
 conducting research and providing information on human rights.
 
 
 1135
 
 DENMARK
 Denmark has never been subject to an investigation for human
 rights abuses. ,Denmark is party to various international
 human rights conventions that promote and protect human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Denmark provides food, shelter, health care, and education to
 all inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, or ethnic
 background.
 The rights of the people in Greenland and the Faroe Islands
 are well protected. Greenlandic law is specially designed for-
 local Inuit customs. It includes local untrained judges
 rather than outside professionals, and there are holding
 centers, rather than prisons, whose inmates are encouraged to
 work, hunt, or fish during the day. Despite a wave of
 violence and murders, the Government has turned down.
 suggestions that treatment of criminals be made more severe.
 The inflow of ethnically and racially dissimilar refugees
 (mostly Iranians, Palestinians, Lebanese, and Sri Lankans)
 requiring public assistance has provoked heightened tensions
 between Danes and immigrants. The number of racial incidents
 reported by the press increased in 1990, and there was greater
 public discussion of the topic. The Government took no
 specific steps to combat the growth of r'acism in 1990.
 Several political parties advocate restricting the inflow of
 foreigners, and there is a movement to oust foreigners from
 Denmark. In several instances, access by immigrants to public
 housing is determined by a percentage ceiling or quota.
 PropoDents say this stops the creation of ghettoes, while
 opponents assert it is racial discrimination. At year-'s end,
 this issue was still undecided.
 Denmark has eliminated laws with sex discrimination
 provisions. Women hold positions of authority throughout
 society, though they are much less represented at the top of
 the business world. Some 73 .percent of all women work, and 46
 percent of the work force is female. Inequality in overall
 wage rates is mitigated by the generally high wage
 rates--women earn an average $11 an hour, men $12.75.
 Danish authorities do not tolerate, in law or in practice,
 violence or abuse against women. Crimes against women are
 considered serious and are investigated with increasing
 vigor. Experts estimate, however, that under 2 percent of all
 domestic violence is reported to authorities. Denmark has no
 rape and domestic violence prevention programs. Nationwide,
 30 special crisis centers--supported by municipal governments,
 voluntary workers, and donations--counsel and house victims.
 In 1989 Denmark became the first nation ever to grant
 homosexual partnerships a legal standing and to give
 homosexual partners most of the same legal rights as
 heterosexuals. The first case .involving a 1987 law
 prohibiting discrimination due to sexual orientation was tried
 in 1990. In this case, the author of a published letter to a
 daily newspaper was charged with "inciting racism or hatred"
 after she wrote that homosexuals deserve AIDS and cited the
 Bible as the authority for terming homosexuality immoral.
 Though vigorously prosecuted, she was acquitted.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The law states that all workers, including military personnel
 and the police, may form or join unions of their choosing.
 Ninety percent of Danish wage earners belong to unions, which
 are independent of the Government. The Danish Federation of
 Trade Unions (LO), which includes about half of the country's
 work force, has long been linked with the Social Democratic
 Party, and the two organizations have mutual representation on
 each other's executive boards. Unions affiliated with the LO
 resist the establishment of rival, independent unions, and
 there were widely publicized cases in 1990 in which workers
 went on strike because a colleague joined a non-LO affiliated
 trade union. All but public sector employees have the right
 to strike. The number of man-days lost to the public sector
 was higher in 1990 than in 1989, due to a large transit
 workers' strike. Unions freely form federations and affiliate
 with international organizations. Greenland and the Faroes
 have the same respect for worker rights, including full
 freedom of association, as does Denmark.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers and employers acknowledge each other's right to
 organize. Collective bargaining is widespread. In the
 private sector, salaries, benefits, and working conditions are
 agreed upon in biennial negotiations between the various
 employers' associations and their union counterparts, or, in
 the event of a deadlock, between the Federation of Danish
 Employers Associations and the LO. The agreements are in turn
 used as guidelines by the rest of the labor market, including
 the public sector. Collective bargaining in the public sector
 is conducted between public sector employees' unions and
 representatives of the government, led by the Finance
 Ministry. Disagreements are referred to a labor court, made
 up of management, labor, and an independent member, whose
 decisions are binding. There are no export processing zones
 in Denmark or its territories, and labor laws are implemented
 uniformly throughout the country.
 Labor relations in Greenland are conducted in the same manner
 as in Denmark. Working conditions are negotiated through
 collective bargaining, usually led by the largest Greenlandic
 union, SIK, which has 8,000 members, virtually the entire
 indigenous work force. In disputes, Greenlandic courts are
 the first recourse, but Danish mediation services or the
 Danish labor court may also be used.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 15 years. Danish
 law describes in detail the specific limitations on the
 employment of those between 15 and 18 years of age, and it is
 enforced by the Agency for Supervision of Labor Standards, an
 autonomous arm of the Ministry of Labor.
 
 
 1137
 DENMARK
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legally mandated national minimum wage. The
 lowest hourly wage in any national labor agreement is $10, and
 it provides an acceptable standard of living. Danes are
 guaranteed 5 weeks' paid vacation and a 38-hour workweek.
 Danish law prescribes conditions of work, including safety and
 health; the duties of employers, supervisors, and employees;
 work performance; rest periods and days off; and medical
 examinations. The Labor Inspection Service, also established
 by law, effectively ensures compliance with labor legislation.
 Similarly, work conditions in Greenland are negotiated by
 collective bargaining, with variations due to differing levels
 of development. One'is the wage differential between
 indigenous and Danish workers due to the need to attract
 skilled workers from Denmark. This differential will end in
 1991. Another difference is that no unemployment compensati6n
 is paid unless it is included in a collective bargaining
 agreement. The tradition of spending part of a year hunting
 and fishing has slowed the evolution of a concept of
 unemployment. Due to this phenomenon and the lack of
 resources, Greenland has no unemployment �compensation system.
