 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a republic governed by a president, a unicameral national assembly,
 and a constitutionally independent judiciary. Free and fair multiparty elections in
 October 1991 resulted in the victory of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy
 (MMD) and the election of President Frederick J.T. Chiluba. With one exception, the
 more than 30 opposition parties generally operated without government interference
 in 1993.
 On March 4, President Chiluba invoked his constitutional powers to declare a
 state of emergency in response to a purported plot by members of the former ruling
 p arty, the United National Independence Party (UNIP), to destabilize the country.
 The security forces detained without charge and interrogated 26 persons, most nf
 them UNIP members. The Government revoked the state of emergency on May 25
 and charged eight detainees with offenses ranging from treason to possession of se-
 ditious documents. It released all other detainees without charge. By late 1993, a
 Lusaka magistrate had convicted one of the eight of possession of a seditious docu-
 ment and sentenced him to 9 months in prison. He remained free on ball pending
 the outcome of an appeal to the High Court. The remaining detainees were also free
 on bail as their cases were tried in the courts.
 In May the Government established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate
 human rights abuses under both the current and the previous governments.
 The Zambian police, divided into regular and paramilitary units and operating
 under the Ministry of Home Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining
 law and order. Police often ignore procedural requirements and engage in abusive
 and brutal behavior, including beating and at times killing criminal suspects and
 detainees.
 After steady declines in per capita gross domestic product, Zambia in 1992 was
 redesignated a least developed country by the United Nations. The Chiluba Govern-
 ment remained committed to a free market economic reform program, but high in-
 flation had a serious impact on the poor the middle class, and business, eroding
 public su pport for the reform  policies. Beginning in August, the inflation rate
 dropped dramatically, the first sign that tight monetary and fIal policies were be-
 ginning to have an effect. After the drought of 1992, agricultural production re-
 bounded with record harvests of many crops, but the Government's tight cash budg-
 et policy limited its capacity to purchase the crops. The key copper industry main-
 tained production levels, but depressed world prices kept revenues at lower levels.
 Zambia's major human rights problem, police brutality, continued unchecked in
 1993, resulting in extrajudicial killings of persons in police custody and torture, as
 exemplified by the torture of three detained UNIP leaders at the hands of security
 forces. Other significant human rights abuses occurred, including arbitrary deten-
 tions under the State of Emergency and government efforts to curb press freedom
 with a cncomitant increase in self-censorhip by the press. The Government's com-
 mitment to constitutional and legal reform remained unfulfilled, abysmal prison

 conditions continued to threaten health and life of inmates, and women continued
 to experience both de jure and de facto discrimination. Wife beating and rape re-
 mained common.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings during the year, but police brutality and use of excessive force continued
 to result in extrajudicial killings. According to reports in the Zambian press, the po-
 lice killed at least 19 criminal suspects between January 1 and September 15. So
 far as is known, the police undertook no serious investigations to determine possible
 police use of excessive force in attempting to apprehend the suspects. In November
 a Chingla High Court judge convicted a police officer of manslaughter and sen-
 tenced him to 3 years' imprisonment for the accidental shooting death of a man dur-
 ing a melee in a town market.
 At least two criminal suspects died in police custody. In one case in January, two
 police officers reportedly beat the victim to death. In the other, police alleged that
 a young suspect in apparent good health died suddenly of pneumonia. The authori-
 ties investigated neither case to determine possible police culpability. In another
 case, a police officer was arrested in connection with the December 1992 death of
 a suspect while in custody. No information on the disposition of the case was made
 known during 1993. Responding to public concern about police treatment of sus-
 pects, Home Affairs Minister Newstead Zimba said in January that officers guilty
 of abuses would be subject to legal action, but there were no reports that offenders
 were prosecuted.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of government-inspired disappear-
 ance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1991 Constitution prohibits torture but members of the police and security
 forces regularly used excessive force when apprehending, interrogating, and holding
 criminal suspects or illegal aliens. Beatings and other mistreatment by police were
 in most instances not subject to serious investigation, and offenders were rarely dis-
 ciplined or prosecuted.
 There were credible reports that during March and April police, security service,
 and military interrogators severely mistreated three of the persons detained under
 the State of Emergency. In the course of interrogation between March 13 and 16,
 one detainee was repeatedly struck, required to perform exhausting physical exer-
 cises, and forced to kneel on small stones that caused pain and swelling. Interroga-
 tors also reportedly pulled his hair and dunked his head in a dirty toilet. Interroga-
 tors systematically abused a second detainee during interrogation by forcing him to
 sit in a chair with his hands tied behind him and his buttocks raised off the seat,
 striking him when he tired and lowered his body to the seat of the chair. This per-
 son became ill during interrogation, was hospitalized, and then was returned to
 prison for further interrogation. A third detainee was observed to have marks on
 is back from beatings.
 In response to the allegations of torture and to growing public criticism, the Gov-
 ernment stated that it opposed torture and claimed that any mistreatment of the
 detainees was not the result of policy but rather, of the actions of individuals. The
 Government permitted delegations from the Foundation for Democratic Process
 (FODEP) to visit 10 of the detainees at 2 separate prisons on April 5. None of the
 10-who did not include the 3 reported torture victims--alleged mistreatment. On
 March 22, Legal Affairs Minister Chongwe said that law enforcement officers found
 to have abused detainees should be fired and prosecuted. There were no reports,
 however, of disciplinary or legal action against any of the security force personnel
 involved. The Government continued to sponsor a series of human rights training
 seminars for police and other officials, but there were no signs of an impact on ac-
 tual conditions.
 In further response to the allegations of torture, the Government on May 5 an-
 nounced the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry to investigate human rights
 abuse under both the current Government and the previous one. The terms of ref-
 erence of the Commission, chaired by an eminent lawyer, included recommending
 measures to the Government to prevent human rights abuses by government per-
 sonnel. For several months the Commission toured the country taking witnesses'
 testimony, most of which detailed abuses under the previous Government, but which
 also produced allegations that torture and "torture chambers" continued to exist
 under the MMD Government. As the year ended, the Commission continued to hold
 
 
 hearings. It was to submit its findings and recommendations to the Government
 early in 1994.
 Conditions in Zambian prisons continue to be harsh and life threatening. Tuber-
 culosis, anemia, dysentery, malaria, chest infections, and other maladies are ramp-
 ant due to low protein diets, lack of clean water, severe overcrowding, and poor sani-
 tation and medical facilities. In June, for example, a Zambia prison services official
 confirmed that a food shortage at prisons had forced inmates to live on one meal
 per day. Similar conditions are found in police holding cells. According to the Law
 Association of Zambia (LAZ), three prisoners at Singogo Remand Prison in Ndola
 died within a 6-week period in July and August. Because of the poor conditions in
 the prison, an Ndola magistrate subsequently ordered the release on bail of many
 prisoners awaiting trial. In January the LAZ petitioned the Home Affairs Minister
 to permit access to prisons and police cells, but the Government denied the request.
 However, the Human Rights Commission of Inquiry toured provincial prisons and
 police cells, including juvenile facilities pursuant to its terms of reference. The Gov-
 ernment did not allocate nearly enough resources to ameliorate the poor conditions
 in most prisons and police cells.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-On March 5, President Chiluba invoked
 powers granted to him under the Constitution to declare a 90-day state of emer-
 gency in response to the so-called Zero Option Plan involving members of UNIP.
 The plan, which had circulated among UNIP leaders for weeks, advocated fomenting
 widespread civil unrest in order to make the country ungovernable, thereby paving
 the way for UNIP's return to power. President Chiluba and his Government were
 concerned that the plan represented an immediate threat to national security. The
 National Assembly ratified the President's declaration on March 12 by a vote of
 114-23.
 Imposition of the state of emergency automatically activated the provisions of the
 1960 Preservation of Public Security Act (PSA), under which the President and law
 enforcement authorities have wide powers to curtail civil liberties. In particular, the
 PSA permits the Government to arrest persons without a warrant and to detain
 them without charge. After declaring the state of emergency, the Chiluba Govern-
 ment amended some sections of the PSA to restrict its scope and limit the potential
 for abuses. For example, the period for which a detainee could initially be held with-
 out charge was reduced from 28 to 7 days.
 Authorities detained 26 UNIP members and suprrs in March under the provi-
 sions of the PSA. The President signed orders authorizing the detentions after con-
 sultation with the Attorney General and other legal advisers. Family members and
 attorneys were usually given access to the detainees, except during interrogation.
 When questioned about the right of detainees to have attorneys present during in-
 terrogation, government officials gave conflicting legal opinions, but in most cases
 attorneys were not permitted to be present. Despite the 7-day time limit on deten-
 tions specified in the amended PSA, the Zero Option detainees were held without
 charge appreciably longer, some for 77 days. The Government never convened the
 special tribunal called for under the PSA to review and authorize additional periods
 of detention of up to 6 months.
 During March and April, most of the detainees were released from custody with-
 out being charged. On May 21, the Government revoked the presidential detention
 order against the remaining eight detainees and charged them with offenses under
 the criminal statutes ranging from treason to possession of seditious documents. All
 eight were released on bail, and their trials, which began in August, were continu-
 ing as the year ended. The first verdict came in October, when a Lusaka magistrate
 convicted UNIP leader Bwendo Mulengela of possession of a seditious document and
 sentenced him to 9 months's imprisonment. Mulengela appealed the judgment to the
 Hig Court.
 In March, 13 of the detainees petitioned the courts to review the legality of their
 detentions. Hearings before two Lusaka High Court judges began on April 6 and
 continued intermittently until the state of emergency was revoked by the President
 on May 25. The courts pursued the cases evenhandedly and took steps to safeguard
 the detainees' rights. High Court Justice James Mutale, for example, ordered the
 state to hold the detainees in the Lusaka area during the hearings (previously they
 had been held at various prisons around the country) and demanded that all mis-
 treatment be halted. Ultimately, the detainees were released before the courts could
 rule on their petitions.
 In regular criminal cases, the law requires that a detainee be charged and
 brought before a magistrate within 24 hours, but there are delays at each step of
 the process, and deadlines are frequently missed due to police inefficiency or lack
 of transportation to bring a suspect before a magistrate. According to the LAZ,
 many persons are held in police cells and prisons for weeks and even months before
 
 
 328
 being charged and brought before a magistrate. No statistics on the number of these
 detainees were available to the public. Foreigners, principally from neighboring
 countries, are regularly apprehended as illegal aliens and detained until they can
 be deported. At times these detentions last months or years. In February a high-
 ranking prison officiLv told a Lusaka judge that 51 "prohibited immigrants" were
 then detained in Lusaka prisons, some of them since 1991. The official also admitted
 that Lusaka prisons held many Zambians who had been detained for long periods
 without trial. One of these, according to the official, had been detained since 1987.
 Katiza Cebekhulu, a South African national detained at Lusaka Central Prison
 in 1991, was released from custody on December 15. At year's end he was residing
 at the Maheba refugee camp near Solwezi.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The MMD Government respects the independence
 of the judiciary. At the apex of the judicial system is a nine-member Supreme Court
 headed by the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice and members of the Court are nomi-
 nated by the President and confirmed by Parliament. The Supreme Ceurt has appel-
 late jurisdiction for all legal and constitutional disputes. The High Courts have au-
 thority to hear all criminal and civil cases and appeals from lower courts. The 55
 magistrate courts have original jurisdiction in criminal and some civil cases, while
 431 local, or customary courts handle most civil cases at the local level. These local
 corrts employ the principles of customary law, which vary widely throughout the
 country. Lawyers are barred from participating, and there are few formal rules of
 procedure. Facilities are often rudimentary. Presiding judges, who are usually
 Prominent local citizens, have great power to invoke customary law in rendering
 judgments regarding weddings, divorces, inheritances, other civil proceedings, and
 minor criminal matters. Judgments are often not in accordance with the Legal Code-
 for example, they tend to discriminate against women in matters of inheritance and
 other issues (see Section 5).
 In ordinary criminal cases, the law provides a number of protections for defend-
 ants, including protection during interrogations. Trials are public and defendants
 have the opportunity to confront accusers and present witnesses. Members of the
 legal community maintain that if a lawyer can be obtained, defendants can expect
 to receive a fair trial. However, many defendants are either too poor to retain a law-
 yer or unaware of the few nongovernmental citizen advocacy groups that might help
 them. The Government's Legal Aid Department is severely understaffed, and
 Zambians entitled to legal aid often find that it is unavailable.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Respect
 for privacy and the inviolability of the home is provided for in the Constitution and
 is generally respected in practice. During the state of emergency, however, the
 homes and offices of dozens of UNIP member and supporters were searched. All of
 these searches took place without a warrant, under the provisions of the Public Se-
 curity Act, and in some cases authorities forcibly entered premises. Roundups of
 suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplace continued during 1993. According
 to the Government Commissioner for Refugees, immigration officials are empowered
 under the law to conduct these roundups without a warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The broad public debate of issues that charac-
 terized the first year of the MMD Government continued during 1993. Public discus-
 sion regarding the state of emergency and other controversial government actions
 was vigorous and constituted a significant change from public reaction to similar
 events under the previous government. However, the press and other media contin-
 ued to run afoul of legal restraints on freedom of expression and suffered political
 reprisals for expressing independent views.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression and of the press, but these
 rights can be circumscribed by laws deemed to be in the interest of defense, public
 safety, public order, public morality, or public health. In practice, the MMD Govern-
 ment generally respected freedom of expression during 1993, but in a few cases indi-
 viduals were either denied this right or arrested for expressing views deemed to be
 contrary to the law. The Penal Code lists various prohibited activities that restrict
 freedom of expression and the press, including defamation of the President, express-
 ing or showing hatred or ridicule, publication of false news with intent to cause fear
 and alarm to the public publishing a seditious document, uttering words with in-
 tent to wound religious feelings, and trafficking in obscene publications. In May au-
 thorities prevented former Finance Minister Emmanuel Kasonde and others from
 addressing a rally because the authorities believed speakers would make defama-
 tory comments about President Chiluba (see Section 2.b.). In another instance, au-
 thorities arrested and convicted a UNIP supporter for having "defamed" the Presi-
 
 
 329
 dent, and in a separate case arrested a businessman for allegedly making comments
 critical of Mrs. Chiluba.
 The appearance of three additional nongovernment weekly newspapers, the an-
 nouncement of a process for licensing private television and radio stations, and the
 publication of a set of recommendations for media reform that endorse democratic
 ree press ideals, all marked appreciable if tentative progress toward real freedom
 of the press during 1993. The Government continued to refrain from enforcing the
 more draconian of the press restrictions in the Legal Code, but made no perceptible
 move to amend or repeal them. Such laws include the President's power under the
 PSA, which came into force during the state of emergency, to prohibit the publica-
 tion, sale, supply, distribution, and possession of information deemed prejudicial to
 public security. In addition, under the State Security Act, journalists are subject to
 prison terms of up to 20 years for receiving leakedgovernment documents and infor-
 mation. The Media Reform Committee made specific recommendations to reform the
 Legal Code, but as the year ended these recommendations had not been approved
 y the Cabinet or enacted into law.
 Despite indications of progress towards genuine press freedom, government offi-
 cials continued to distrust the press and often attempted to control the dissemina-
 tion of stories critical of government poicies or high-raaning officials. Reporters and
 editors, especially in the government-owned media, reported receiving calls from
 senior officls threatening their ivelihood over critical stories the ha d run or that
 were being written. Police briefly detained the managing editor of The Weekly Post,
 the most prominent independent newspaper, following publication of a story linking
 a Cabinet minister with drug trafficking. Also, the President sued The Weekly Post
 for libel an a result of its reprint of a story, originally appearing in the South Afri-
 can press that alleged that Chiluba had benefitted financlly from an arrangement
 to allow outh African conservationists to conduct studies in Zambia. The Govern-
 ment's dismissal of the much-respected Director General of the Zambia National
 Broadcasting     oror      ess t    or irregularities in his hiring, but in reality
 for exrcisnin dependence in programming- demonstrated the limits of press free-
 dom in 1993. The firing left its mark on reporters, editors, and managers of all gov-
 ernment-owned media, who became less willing to investigate, write, or publish sto-
 ries critical of the Government.
 The Government took no action to restrain academic freedom during the year.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assocation.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association but on occasion the Government ig-
 nored these provisions. Under the Public Oraer Act of 1955, persons or organiza-
 tions wishing to hold an assembly, public meeting, or proession must first apply
 for a  rmit. In almost all cases during 1993, authorities routinely issued such per-
 t     ormally, grounds for denial of a permit involve concerns over a threat to vub-
 lic order and security, which is provided for bth in the Public Order Act andthe
 1991 Constitution. On May 24, however, Northern Province Deputy Minister Daniel
 Kapapa ordered police to revoke a permit for a political rally organized by two
 former cabinet ministers, because, Kapapa told thepress, the ministers had not paid
 a courtesy call on him and because they were likely to make insulting remarks
 about the President.
 On August 18, the Home Affairs Minister ordered police not to issue permits to
 MMD) Members of Parliament who had resigned to form the National Party (NP).
 He warned that the former MMD members would be arrested if they attempted to
 address public gatherings in their constituencies. Three days later Vice President
 Mwanawasa announced that the Government had reversed the Minister's decision.
 During several parliamentary election campaigns late in the year the NP experi-
 enced no significant difficulties in holding campaign rallies and other public meet-
 in.1organizations must apply formally for registration to the Registrar of Societies.
 In most caes these applications are routinely approved. For example, there are now
 more than 30 registered political parties. The National Party, led by prominent
 breakaway MMD leaders, wan registered within days of having filed its application
 in early September. In April, however, the Government refused to register an Is-
 lamic party formed by the youth and student wing of the Islamic Council of Zambia.
 When the Registrar of Societies rejected the application, the group appealed to
 Home Affairs Minister Zimba to intercede. The Minister responded that the Reg-
 istrar had made the correct decision, as the Constitution did not allow for the forma-
 tion of religious parties. However, Article 21 of the Constitution provides that "no
 person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of his freedom of assembly and associa-
 tion.,  and in particular to form or belong to any political party. .. S" The same
 Article provides or the registration of political parties but says that only "reason-
 able conditions" may be established for the registration of parties and that it is un-
 
 
 330
 
 constitutional to impose conditions "shown not to be reasonably justifiable in a
 democratic society." During the state of emergency, the Government took no action
 to curtail the rights of political parties, including UNIP and other groups, to hold
 public meetings and assemblies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and is respected in practice. Although President Chiluba has declared Zambia to be
 a Christian nation, other religions are practiced without interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution guarantees citizens the right to move freely through-
 out Zambia, to reside in any part of the country, and to depart from and return to
 the country without restriction. The authorities generally respected these rights
 during 1993, but police roadblocks to control criminal activity continued and police
 often extorted money and goods from motorists.
 According to UNIP, the Government seized the passports of 39 party leaders in
 connection with the state of emergency and the subsequent investigation. By year's
 end all of these passports had been returned to their holders.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that
 there were approximately 142,000 refugees in Zambia in 1993, up slightly from
 1992. The majority were Angolans, with significant numbers of Mozambicans,
 Zairians, Somalis, and South Africans. The repatriation of the approximately 15,000
 Mozambicans proceeded slowly, while repatriation of approximately 125,000 Ango-
 lans stalled due to the renewed fighting in that country. In July approximately
 1,500 minority Kasai from Shaba Province in Zaire fled into Zambia and requested
 refugee status. They were fleeing both attempts by the Shaba Government to re-
 move them forcibly from the province and restrictions that made it impossible for
 them to earn a living there. After some hesitation, the Zambian Government agreed
 to let the Zairians proceed to a UNHCR refugee settlement in the northwest. A
 steady trickle of Zairians continued to cross into Zambia during the year. The al-
 leged criminal activities of many Zairians in the border region was of considerable
 concern to the Government, and roundups, arrests, and deportations of Zairians and
 other illegal aliens continued throughout the year. With respect to illegal aliens,
 these actions are lawful. However, Zairians and others who have been accorded ref-
 ugee status by the UNHCR are sometimes picked up and held for varying lengths
 of time before being released.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Zambian citizens exercised the right to change their government in free and fair
 multiparty elections in 1991 following years of one-party rule by the UNIP. How-
 ever, under the 1991 Constitution the President wields broad authority. Although
 Parliament ratifies major appointments and has other powers, in practice it is an
 ineffectual check on executive authority. While President Chiluba kept his promise
 to limit the scope and duration of the state of emergency, coming so soon after the
 advent of multiparty democracy, it constituted an ominous precedent. Constitutional
 reform to increase the power of Parliament, a prominent plank in the MMD election
 platform, continued to proceed at an extremely slow pace, although in September
 the Government announced the formation of a constitutional commission to draft a
 new constitution. The 24-member commission represents a broad spectrum of Zam-
 bian society. It is expected to complete its work in 1994.
 The ruling MMD controls the executive branch and the Parliament. With one ex-
 ception, noted in Section 2.b., the MMD Government allowed opposition parties to
 operate freely. Several parliamentary byelections were hotly contested. These elec-
 tions, using the secret ballot, were generally free and fair. In many constituencies
 turnout was low, continuing the pattern of 1992, but in others a considerable per-
 centage of registered voters participated. Though adult suffrage is universal, an out-
 dated voter register requires revision in order to enfranchise new voters. In August
 prominent MMD members, including former cabinet ministers, resigned from the
 party to form the National Party (NP). After a brief delay, the Government per-
 mitted these politicians to operate freely and approved the registration of the new
 party
 The number of influential women in politics and government is increasing; it in-
 cludes cabinet ministers, deputy ministers, Members of Parliament, the Interim
 Chairman of the opposition National Party, ministerial permanent secretaries, and
 numerous elected local government officials.
 
 
 331
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights and civic organizations operate without hindrance.
 These include the LAZ and FODEP. The latter, along with the Young Women's
 Christian Association (YWCA), the Nongovernmental Organization Coordinating
 Committee (NGOCC), and other groups was active in promoting women's civil and
 political ights. In general, the Government continued to be receptive to criticism
 from   such   organizations,  but  individual  ministers  sometimes  became
 confrontational. In September, for example, the Home Affairs Minister said that
 human rights advocates critical of government policies should "shut their mouths."
 In September the Inspector General of Police complained that the actions of human
 rights monitors led to an increase in crime.
 The Government was receptive to inquiries or visits by international human
 rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The population of about 8 million comprises more than 70 Bantu-speaking tribal
 groupings. Economic and social needs are met on a generally nondiscriminatory
 basis. The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, tribe, sex, place of
 origin, marital status, political opinion, color, or creed. Members of the Asian com-
 munity, which includes many shopowners, continued to complain in 1993 of hostility
 from other Zambians.
 Women.-Under civil and constitutional law, women are entitled to full equality
 with men in most areas. In practice, Zambian women are severely disadvantaged
 compared to men in formal employment and education. Married women who are em-
 ployed often suffer from discriminatory conditions of service; allowances for housing
 and children and tax rebates to which they as employees are entitled often accrue
 to their husbands. Similarly, women have little independent access to credit facili-
 ties; in most cases, they remain dependent on husbands, who are required to sign
 for loans. As a result, few women own their own homes.
 Under the citizenship laws, a Zambian man who marries a non-Zambian woman
 can transfer "resident rights" to his wife, but a Zambian woman who marries a non-
 Zambian man has no right to have her husband reside in Zambia.
 Customary law and practice also place women in subordinate status with respect
 to property, inheritance, and marriage, despite various constitutional and legislated
 provisions. In some areas, women are not a lowed to hold land under customary ten-
 ure, and what they produce on land can be appropriated by the "rightful" holder,
 usually a male relative. Under traditional customs, all rights to in erit property
 rested with the deceased man's family. The Intestate Succession Act, passed in
 1989, guarantees widows a 20-perrent share and children a 50-percent share in the
 inheritance of a deceased man's property. Despite increasing efforts by nongovern-
 mental organizations during 1993 to publicize the law, it remained generally ineffec-
 tual because of ignorance, apathy, fear, and lax enforcement by the police and the
 courts. According to the YWCA, however, there were indications that increasing
 numbers of widows in urban areas were aware of their rights under the law and
 sought assistance and protection from NGO's or legal authorities.
 Violence against women remained a serious problem. Wife beating and rape were
 commonplace, although there were no statistics available to document the precise
 extent of these abuses. Domestic assault is a criminal offense, but in practice police
 are often reluctant to pursue reports of wife beating or other forms of abuse. The
 Government mounted a publicity campaign to discourage wife beating, but there
 was no information about the campaign's effectiveness. Authorities evinced serious
 concern in an apparent increase in rape, and offenders have been arrested, pros-
 ecuted, and sentenced to jail terms.
 Children.-There was no pattern of discrimination or societal abuse against chil-
 dren, but scarce government resources and ineffective implementation of social pro-
 grams adversely affected the welfare of children and adults alike.
 People with Disabilities.-Persons with disabilities face significant societal dis-
 crimination in employment and education. The basic law covering the disabled is
 the Handicapped Persons Act (HPA). It established the Zambia Council for the
 Handicapped, a government organization, which provides rehabilitative and social
 service to the disabled. There are no legal provisions prohibiting discrimination or
 mandating accessibility for the disabled. In 1993 the Minister of Community Devel-
 opment and Social Services named a task force to study the problems of the disabled
 with a view to drafting a new law to replace the HPA and better safeguard the
 rights of the disabled.
 
 
 332
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to
 form trade unions, and Zambia has a history of/strong labor union organizations
 dating from the establishment of the copper mines in the 1930's. Approximately 60
 percent of the 300,000 formal sector workers are unionized. The country's 19 large
 national unions are organized by indust  or profession. All are affiliated with the
 Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). The ZCTU is democratically organized;
 it regularly conducts open elections to select its leadership. Like its constituent
 unions, it is independent of any political party and the Government. The ZCTU and
 other unions operated freely throughout the year and frequently criticized the MMD
 Government on such issues as economicIpolicy wages, and conditions of service. The
 ZCTU is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 On April 26, Parliament passed a new Industrial and Labor Relations Act (ILRA)
 which superseded the controversial Industrial Relations Act of 1991. With the broad
 backing of labor, business, and government leaders, the new Act reestablished the
 principle of "one industry, one union" that had been abolished under the 1991 ILRA.
 While acknowledging that the one industry, one union rule restricts the right of in-
 dividuals to freely associate, union leaders successfully argued that a proliferation
 of unions would weaken organized labor. Under the 1993 ILRA, therefore, a new
 union may be registered only if the Government determines that it represents a spe-
 cific trade, profession, or category of employees who are qualified to form a union.
 A group representing a trade, profession, or category of employees already rep-
 resente by an existing trade union will not be registered. Under the 1991 Act, a
 number of new unions sought registration, including those purporting to represent
 bankers, miners, secondary school teachers, technical college staff, and civl serv-
 ants. Depending on the Government's interpretation of the new law, some of these
 new unions may be recognized as legal entities. The 1993 ILRA also abolished the
 provision in the 1991 law disaffiliating unions from the ZCTU. The new law auto-
 matically reaffiliated the unions with the ZCTU but also allows unions to leave the
 ZCTU through a simple majority vote of their members.
 All workers have the right to strike except those engaged in essential services,
 the Zambia Defense Force, judicial service, police force, prison service, and security
 intelligence service. Essential services are defined in the 1993 ILRA as power, medi-
 cal, water, sewerage, firefighting, and certain mining occupations essential to safety.
 Strikes and work stoppages were commonplace throughout the year as workers' sal-
 aries and conditions of service were undercut by harsh economic conditions and,
 until the last half of the year, sharp increases in the cost of living. Strikes are per-
 mitted only after all other legal recourse has been exhausted, and in practice all
 work stoppages during the year were illegal. At various times from May through
 August, many teachers and civil servants went on strike to protest the slow pace
 of negotiations with the Government on a new contract. After a series of meetings
 between Government and union negotiators, the unions agreed in August to accept
 the Government's offer of a 50 percent salary increase. The ZCTU and individual
 unions may affiliate with a trade union or organization outside Zambia by a simple
 majority vote of the membership. Labor leaders travel without restriction to inter-
 national conferences and to visit counterparts abroad.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1993 ILRA prohibits
 antiunion discrimination by em plyers against union members and organizers. An
 employee who believes he has been penalized for union activities may, after ex-
 hausting any existing administrative channels for relief, file a complaint with the
 Industrial Relations Oourt. This court has the power to order appropriate redress
 for the aggrieved worker. The complainant may appeal a judgment of the Industrial
 Relations Court to the Supreme Court. The Industrial Relations Court has the
 power to order employers to reinstate a worker fired for union activity.
 Employers and unions in each industry negotiate collective bargaining agreements
 through joint councils in which there is no overnment involvement. Collective dis-
 putes are first referred to a conciliator or a board of conciliation. If conciliation fails
 to resolve the dispute the parties may refer the case to the Industrial Relations
 Court or, in the case of employees, vote to strike. In practice, the industry joint
 councils function effectively as collective bargaining mechanisms.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Slavery and involuntary servitude
 are prohibited by the Constitution. Forced labor is prohibited, except in the conduct
 of communal or civic obligations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-By legislation, the minimum age
 for employment of children is 16. The Labor Commissioner effectively enforces this
 law in the industrial sector, where, because of adult unemployment, there are al-
 most no jobs available to children under the age of 16. However, the law is not en-

 forced for the vast majority of Zambians who work in the subsistence agricultural,
 domestic service, and informal sectors, where persons under age 16 are often em-
 ployed. In urban areas children commonly engage in street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1991 the Government established a mini-
 mum monthly wage rate for all employees, except professionals, plus housing and
 transportation allowances. As of December 1993, according to the Labor Commis-
 sioner, this rate was approximately $7.50 or 4,500 Zambian kwacha. However, each
 industry may through collective baraining set its own minimum wage rates above
 the legal floor, and in practice most formal sector workers receive salaries consider-
 ably higher than the minimum wage. As of March 1993, for example, miners gen-
 erally received a monthly salary of at least $50 (30,000 kwacha), and construction
 and engineering workers received between $20 and $75 (13,000 and 45,000 kwacha),
 depending on position and seniority. In nonunionized industries and trades, how-
 ever, the minimum wage is applied. This would include such positions as delivery
 assistants, general workers, and office orderlies. The minimum wage is insufficient
 to provide an adequate standard of living, and most minimum wage earners must
 supplement their incomes through second jobs, subsistence farming, or reliance on
 the extended family.
 The legal maximum workweek for nonunionized workers is 48 hours. Maximum
 limits for unionized workers vary. For example, the legal maximum for unionized
 guards is 72 hours per week. The minimum workweek for full-time employment is
 40 hours and is, in practice, the normal workweek. Two days of annual leave per
 month of service are required by law.
 Zambian law regulates minimum health and safety standards in any industrial
 undertaking. Enforcement of industrial safety in the mines is the responsibility of
 the Department of Mines. Factory safety is handled by the Inspector of Factories
 under the Minister of Labor, but staffing problems chronically limit enforcement ef-
 fectiveness.
