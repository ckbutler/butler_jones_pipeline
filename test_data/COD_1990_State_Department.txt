 ZAIRE
 President Mobutu Sese Seko has for 25 years ruled Zaire, a
 huge, poor country with widely disparate ethnic, cultural, and
 linguistic groups, whose transition to independence in 1960
 was marked by extensive civil strife. The President has the
 constitutional power to promulgate laws by decree and over the
 years has molded a highly personalized and centralized party/
 government system. From 1974 until mid-1990, the Popular
 Movement of the Revolution (MPR) was the sole legal party, and
 all government institutions were considered its organs.
 Faced with growing domestic criticism of one-party rule and
 influenced by political liberalization in other parts of the
 world, President Mobutu began to introduce changes in this
 structure in 1990. After extensive consultations, he
 announced on April 24 that a three-party political system
 would replace the one-party state and that government
 institutions, formerly organs of the MPR, would be
 "revitalized." He also announced that a transitional
 government would be named and the existing constitution
 amended until an entirely new constitution could be drafted
 within a year. Resigning as president of the MPR, he
 stipulated that he would remain Chief of State and national
 arbiter and stressed that the Chief of State "cannot undergo
 criticism from or be under the control of" Parliament. At a
 press conference the same day, Mobutu added that, as Chief of
 State, he would retain powers over defense, territorial
 security, and foreign affairs in a "semipresidential" system
 and called for 1991 elections in five stages.
 On May 3, he amended his proposals by announcing a two-phase
 transition through early 1992, including adoption of a new
 constitution in the first phase and elections in the second.
 He clarified, however, that public political meetings would
 not be permitted until party legislation had been adopted and
 aspiring parties registered under its terms.. On June 30,
 Mobutu elaborated further on the transition, including on
 plans to choose the three parties to be permitted in a January
 1991 primary election. By early July, the Constitution had
 been amended to allow three parties and to formalize the
 separation of the Government from the MPR, and legislation
 governing the registration and conduct of political parties
 had been adopted by the Parliament. On October 6, however, it
 was announced that a full multiparty system would be allowed,
 thus eliminating the three-party limit and the need for a
 party primary. Once registered, parties are to be given
 access to official media. A second revision of the
 Constitution and amendment of the party law to allow multiple
 parties was completed by mid-December. Since April 24, more
 than 100 political groups have formed and sought legalization
 to compete in future elections. At the end of 1990, it
 remained unclear when aspiring parties would be recognized
 under the newly amended party legislation. The President
 repeatedly rejected widespread demands for a national
 conference of Zaire's political, economic, religious,
 military, labor, and other leadership, designed to determine
 t'he country's political future.
 Zaire has several security agencies, with overlapping powers
 and jurisdictions, all in practice directly responsible to the
 President. These include: the National Service for
 Intelligence and Protection (SNIP), which was established in
 September by combining the former National Documentation
 Agency (A.N.D.) and the National Immigration Agency (A.N.I.);
 
 
 447
 ZAIRE
 the Military Intelligence Security Service (SARM); and the
 Civil Guard. The gendarmerie and its special investigation
 and surveillance brigade are part of the armed forces but play
 a prominent role in the investigation of crimes. All these
 organs, and the Special Presidential Division (DSP), have at
 times been used to check internal dissent and have been
 responsible for arbitrary harassment, physical mistreatment,
 and unauthorized detention of ordinary citizens as well as
 opposition activists. The President's National Security
 Council in May issued guidelines to the security forces to
 respect human rights and in August gave SNIP, now the primary
 internal intelligence service, the mission of safeguarding
 citizen rights.
 Zaire has a mixed economy involving an active private sector
 and an extensive number of state enterprises, e.g., in
 mining. Export earnings are concentrated in primary products
 and thus are vulnerable to changes in world market prices.
 About 70 percent of the population is rural and engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. Per capita income is approximately
 $180 per year and is declining further as the population
 increases at 3 percent per year, while economic growth is
 stagnant. Zaire's communications and transportation
 infrastructure are greatly eroded, making communications
 between institutions of government in the capital and outlying
 regions exceedingly difficult. In early 1990, the Government
 abandoned the structural adjustment program sponsored by the
 International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The budget
 deficit soared, causing an increase in the rate of inflation
 (expected to be about 240 percent for 1990) and an
 acceleration in the depreciation of the currency. The
 deterioration in the economy was an important stimulant to
 public dissatisfaction and political reform.
 Press freedom improved significantly in 1990, with several
 newspapers severely criticizing the President and his
 policies; aspiring political parties mushroomed and a leading
 opposition figure was released from house arrest; and the
 ability of workers to form unions independent of the governing
 party was enhanced. Nevertheless, President Mobutu retains
 dominant political power, and he made it clear throughout the
 year that he would dictate the pace and shape of the
 transition process. The political opposition was still
 subject to repression, as shown by instances of security force
 disruption of public political meetings, and it is not clear
 that the political system will be liberalized sufficiently to
 permit citizens to change their government.through democratic
 means. Citizens also remained subject to arbitrary and
 prolonged detention and physical mistreatment; extrajudicial
 killings; and continuing abridgment of freedom of
 association. In May the security forces assaulted students at
 the University of Lubumbashi, with consequent loss of life and
 injuries. Subsequent government investigations failed to
 clarify the number of students killed or to pinpoint
 responsibility fully, although a number of regional officials
 have been charged in the case but not yet tried. As in
 previous years, those who committed human rights abuses were
 seldom brought to justice; in some cases government
 authorities actively obstructed efforts to identify and punish
 guilty parties.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings
 The security forces continued to use excessive force in
 repressing peaceful political opposition, and there were
 reported incidents of extrajudicial killings in 1990 as a
 result.
 On the night of May 11-12, after the central electric power
 had been turned off at the University of Lubumbashi, armed,
 masked commandos entered the darkened campus and conducted a
 systematic attack on students in crowded dormitories. (The
 Government's original claim that the incident was only a fight
 among students was abandoned as more information came to
 light.) The assault followed a May 9 incident in which
 dissident students had harassed a close female relative of
 Civil Guard Commander Baramoto, and a student "court" had
 condemned three other Ngbandi-tribe student informers to death
 (see Section 5). Parliament, the regional assembly, and the
 Lubumbashi attorney general's office tried to conduct
 inquiries, but, in the face of executive branch obstruction
 and the dispersal of many witnesses with the closing of the
 University, were unable to ascertain many details of the
 attack, including the casualty toll or the full chain of
 responsibility. Casualty estimates ranged from the
 Government's eventual confirmation of one death and several
 injuries through that of 12 deaths by the Belgian Government
 and up to 40 deaths by domestic human rights groups, to claims
 of several hundred deaths and correspondingly higher numbers
 of injuries in early press reports. Given the circumstances
 of the attack, deaths and injuries could have been higher than
 the official estimate, but with the passage of time, it is
 unlikely that the exact extent of loss of life can be
 determined.
 The June parliamentary inquiry determined that the Shaba
 provincial governor, as well as the regional agents of the
 then A.N.D. and A.N.I., local'army officials, the rector of
 the University and an executive of the urban electric company,
 had organized the assault. Among several questions which the
 parliamentarians admitted they were unable to resolve and
 which merited further investigation, were the number of
 casualties, the identity of the commandos who conducted the
 attack, and whether there was any involvement by national
 security, military, or political leaders. The inquiry was
 obstructed at several stages. Vice Prime Minister for
 Territorial Administration Engulu blocked consideration of a
 separate report by the Shaba regional assembly. The report
 and documentation were later seized at the instance of the
 President of the regional assembly. (In December the report
 was leaked to a local newspaper and published.) In July the
 Lubumbashi public prosecutor arrested a local human rights
 leader who was conducting an inquiry. President Mobutu and
 the transition Government have rejected all further calls for
 an independent commission of inquiry. The Government promised
 to prosecute those whom the parliamentary inquiry identified
 as responsible for the attack, but the pace and scope of the
 investigation at the end of 1990 cast serious doubt on the
 good faith of the effort.
 
 
 ZAIRE
 Various international human rights groups, including the
 Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, which visited Zaire in
 1989 and 1990, report that Zairian soldiers committed a number
 of extrajudicial killings and other abuses in the Kivu region
 in 1989. These reported abuses took place in the context of
 local disputes over land, taxes and the role of traditional
 chiefs.
 b. Disappearance
 After the May Lubumbashi assault there were reports of
 unresolved disappearances of students. Some of those
 originally reported missing eventually appeared in Kinshasa,
 at their~homes, or in nearby countries to which they had
 fled. However, none of the investigations has been able to
 determine whether any remain missing, or if so, how many.
 Several students at the University of Kinshasa, allegedly
 involved in demonstrations in late April and early May, were
 also reported missing. Human rights groups and the Ministry
 (formerly Department) of Citizens' Rights and Liberties (MDLC)
 noted the July 28 disappearance of two civil servant activists
 in Bandundu: Musinga Madeya and Bwanza (first name unknown).
 The two were reportedly arrested by the National Immigration
 Agency and transferred to Kinshasa. Their whereabouts are
 unknown.
 An alleged 1988 disappearance was noted by internal and
 foreign human rights groups in 1990. Miss Kamunga Mwimpe was
 allegedly seized at the instigation of former Minister of
 Women's Affairs, Mayuma Kala. The young woman's disappearance
 was reportedly a crime of passion, but observers have noted
 irregularities in the Ministry of Justice investigation, which
 at year's end appeared to have stalled.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Government has stated that torture is contrary to the law
 and against official policy, but in practice police and
 soldiers continued to abuse their authority in 1990,
 mistreating and severely beating prisoners. There were
 reports, for instance, of serious security force maltreatment
 of leaders of some wildcat strikes. Prisoners held on
 criminal charges are particularly subject to abuse and
 private citizens continue to be beaten and robbed by security
 officials. As far as is known, there were no instances of
 legal action against members of security services for inhuman
 treatment or torture, despite a 1989 ordinance requiring such
 action.
 Credible allegations of security force violence against female
 demonstrators were made on several occasions in 1990. An
 Amnesty International (AI) update noted that security forces
 raped several women after breaking up a Union for Democracy
 and Social Progress (UDPS) meeting in July. The Belgian press
 reported in July that security forces had raped several
 nursing students at the University of Kinshasa, though no
 -evidence or confirmation has come to light in Zaire-
 A few days after the President's April 24 announcements of
 political changes, SARM, a government security force, wounded
 several people in an attack on members of the UDPS, who were
 meeting at the home "of Etienne Tshisekedi, a former cabinet
 minister and UDPS leader, just freed from house arrest. In a
 
 
 ZAIRE
 May 3 address, Mobutu said that aspiring parties could not
 hold public meetings until they were recognized under
 registration criteria yet to be determined. Another UDPS
 meeting was violently suppressed on November 4, and several
 people were injured.
 Prison conditions are harsh, and hunger and disease remained
 common. There were unconfirmed reports that a number of
 prisoners died in Makala prison due to hunger or
 hunger-induced illnesses. Prison reform efforts, begun in
 1989, slowed in 1990, in part due to financial problems.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued
 to visit places of detention and provided limited medical
 supplies and clothing to prisoners in Zaire. Its regular
 prison visits allow the ICRC to ascertain detention
 conditions. The prison controlled by the Special Presidential
 Division (DSP) is not subject to scrutiny by internal or
 international observers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The National Security Council in May issued guidelines for
 assuring greater respect for human rights, and the primary
 internal intelligence service, (SNIP), in August was given the
 mission of safeguarding citizen rights. The security
 services, however, appear not to have ceased the practice of
 holding detainees incommunicado for varying lengths of time.
 By law, those arrested by a judicial police officer must be
 brought before a magistrate within 48 hours for an initial
 hearing. If there are sufficient grounds for arrest, the
 magistrate may order bail or preventive detention for up to 15
 days. Preventive detention judgments must be reviewed by a
 three-magistrate body within 5 days. In practice, arbitrary
 arrest and long detention without charges are common. Some
 suspects are arrested and held without a hearing, often
 incommunicado. Judicial personnel are supposed to visit
 prisons and detention centers to assure that detainees appear
 before a magistrate within the required 48 hours, but such
 visits often do not occur, owing, in part, to a lack of
 personnel and communication and transportation problems.
 Most persons who have been detained for political reasons have
 been held by nonjudicial means ranging from administrative
 detention and house arrest to internal exile and restricted
 movement. They have rarely been brought to trial. The
 Government restricts some dissidents to villages of origin or
 other locations in the interior, one example being General
 Mukobo Mudende, a former army chief of staff, who has been
 under a banishment order in Isangi since 1987. There were no
 reported examples of banishment to the interior in 1990.
 Following the April 24 announcement, the Government ended the
 unacknowledged house arrest of UDPS leader Etienne Tshisekedi.
 The number of political detainees at the end of 1990 was
 unknown. Since many arrests are short term, it is impossible
 to give a figure for those who may be in custody at any one
 time for what could be defined as political offenses.
 However, there were many arbitrary arrests in 1990, including
 of labor leaders, teachers, civil servants, and medical
 workers, often in connection with wildcat strikes. The
 authorities arrested Reverend Brother Digekisa Piluka for
 alleged participation in student activity at Lumbumbushi
 
 
 451
 ZAIRE
 University, and he remained in detention without charge at the
 end of 1990. Others arrested on political grounds included
 members of the Congolese National Movement/Lumbumba (MNC/L),
 Ekongo Odimba Pual, Otete Mamba Jean-Marie, and Otete Gaston,
 who have all been released. A labor activist, Muntumoy
 Tamundel Ngamakam, was arrested for distributing tracts
 calling for a December 8 general strike. Pastor Dibinga wa
 Saidi, a former UDPS militant returned home from Boston, was
 arrested in December while demonstrating outside the Central
 Post Office in Kinshasa and released after several days'
 detention. There were also reports of the detention of
 military officers, including Colonel Lenga-Lenga, Colonel
 Doctor Kabanda Kurhenga, and Lt. Colonel Doctor Bokuli.
 A number of opponents of the Government returned in 1990,
 notably UDPS coleader Marcel Lihau, Congolese National
 Liberation Front (FLNC) chairman Nathaniel Mbumba, MNC/L
 activist Mende Lambert, and others. Other dissidents,
 however, left the country for fear of arrest or harassment,
 including former Minister of Education and human rights
 activist Ndjelo-Empenge. Kanyonga Joseph Emmanuel, who had
 returned to Zaire from exile in 1989 to organize for the
 Action Movement foi Congo Renewal (MARC--a European-based
 opposition partyY, has charged that authorities seized all his
 belongings. Professor Mufuta Kabemba, dean of the Lubumbashi
 faculty, and now in self-exile in Brussels, alleged that
 security forces threatened him for joining other professors in
 a statement condemning the May campus assault.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Judicial Council (formerly a super-ministry of justice
 also charged with administration of the court and penal
 systems) reverted to its earlier status as the Ministry of
 Justice. Zaire's highly centralized Government continued to
 exercise control--sometimes through the Ministry of Justice,
 sometimes through direct intervention of the Presidency--over
 a judiciary and legal system rooted in Belgian and customary
 law. The system includes the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal
 in each region, and the Court of State Security. Judges are
 free of direct political interference in most cases, but in
 sensitive or highly politicized cases they work under implicit
 or explicit constraints imposed by executive or security
 forces. Courts theoretically have increased independence
 since the President's April 24 speech, but senior judges still
 meet resistance from authorities as government policy
 dictates. The transfer of the prosecutor general of
 Lubumbashi in September hampered the judicial inquiry into the
 May campus assault.
 Inadequate judicial salaries are also a severe obstacle to
 achieving an independent judiciary. Magistrates' salaries,
 even after 1989 raises, are so low as to foster corruption.
 Some magistrates and lawyers are frequently thought to accept
 bribes, applying the full vigor of the law only to those who
 cannot pay.
 Defendants are entitled by the Constitution to a public trial
 and defense counsel and, except in certain cases (see below),
 have the right of appeal. They must be represented by
 counsel, at public expense if necessary, in all trials before
 the Supreme Court and before lesser courts (including courts
 martial) in capital cases. Free legal aid may also be
 provided in other cases by request of the court concerned.
 Counsel in lesser civil and criminal cases is often not
 
 
 452
 ZAIRE
 available. With only 500 lawyers and some 600 magistrates in
 all Zaire, many disputes in outlying areas are adjudicated by
 local administrative officials or by traditional authorities.
 State Security Court decisions on national security, armed
 robbery, and smuggling cases are not subject to appeal, but
 other criminal code procedural protections apply. In practice
 many security-related cases never come to trial. There were
 no such trials in 1990.
 The exact number of political prisoners, as distinct from
 political detainees, was unknown at the end of 1990, but
 Amnesty International in its 1990 report covering 1989 stated
 that at least 100 persons were imprisoned for their political
 or religious beliefs. The Government claimed, implausibly,
 that there were no political prisoners being held in Zaire.
 The MDLC was created to redress citizen's rights when all
 other legal avenues had failed. Critics have correctly
 pointed out that the Ministry, in representing the Government
 before the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), is involved
 in a clear conflict of interest for an entity supposed to be
 the citizens' watchdog against government abuses. The
 Ministry deals primarily with conflicts over land titles,
 labor disputes, execution of judgments, and inheritance; only
 about a fourth of its cases have dealt with arbitrary arrests,
 prolonged detentions, illegal seizures, and security force
 abuses. It has achieved only minimal results in such cases,
 although it played a useful role in 1990 in monitoring arrests
 of civil service strikers, in one case reporting on the
 release of a key leader. In any case, the Ministry cannot
 substitute for an independent and forceful judiciary.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Except when national security is threatened, the law requires
 police to have a judicial warrant to search a home. In
 practice, security forces often enter and search homes without
 warrants. UDPS activist Lusanga Ngiele, in a letter to the
 Minister for Territorial Security later printed in an American
 monthly, complained that security agents had sacked his home
 and those of fellow activists. Many Zairians believe security
 services open mail and tap telephone conversations, although
 evidence to confirm this has not come to light.
 Abolition of the single-party system and of several'
 specialized ruling party organs on April 24 significantly
 reduced the administrative apparatus which interfered on a
 day-by-day basis with individual privacy. Two grating
 long-time restrictions, part of the President's "Zairian
 authenticity" policy, were abolished in 1990, namely
 restrictions against neckties and European forms of address.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the citizen's right to express
 opinions and feelings freely but subordinates all rights to
 "public order and good conduct." In 1990 citizens spoke more
 openly than ever before in all forums.
 The growing freedom of the press in Kinshasa was one of the
 most notable human rights developments in 1990. While
 
 
 ZAIRE
 radio and television (which reach much larger audiences,
 especially in rural areas) remained tightly controlled, up to
 a dozen new or newly aggressive newspapers openly report on
 and often sharply criticize government policies. There was
 unprecedented press criticism of the President's ruling style
 and policies, and questioning of his commitment to democracy.
 Several newspapers featured interviews with the opposition to
 present dissident views, an effective technique for expanding
 the limits of political debate. However, the growth in press
 freedom has largely been limited to Kinshasa; press
 distribution in the interior is almost totally lacking.
 Moreover, despite President Mobutu's new tolerance of personal
 criticism from the Kinshasa press, there were serious
 incidents of harassment and intimidation of the press. On
 August 28, armed commandos invaded the offices of the daily
 newspaper Elima. The commandos' leader, Bolamba Mooga Ngungu,
 self-styled head of the "young unconditional Mobutists,"
 earlier had publicly threatened Elima's editor, Essolomwa
 Khoy, and claimed to have been acting on behalf of President
 Mobutu. Security and police forces were slow to intervene to
 stop the attack on the Elima offices, and Bolamba was later
 released. Essolomwa was arrested on October 22, harshly
 interrogated for over 4 hours, and held in detention for 2
 days. Reportedly he was arrested for publishing articles
 characterized as "injurious, defamatory, and leading to
 indiscipline." An additional reason appeared to be related to
 his refusal to attend a September meeting when President
 Mobutu summoned editors to a press conference and a day of
 study at which the rector of the Kinshasa journalism school
 and a prominent jurist (and Mobutu's former chef de cabinet)
 lectured on press responsibility and on the linkage of press
 freedom to law and public order. Several editors in addition
 to Essolomwa refused to attend; some labeled it an attempt to
 temper press openness. There were allegations--some
 proved--that some editors were bought off. Since the meeting,
 some newspapers appear to have softened criticism of the
 President.
 State-owned radio and television have lagged behind the print
 media. A glaring example was television news' nightly press
 review, which utterly failed to reflect intensifying political
 debate. Radio and televison workers asked for greater
 freedom, as well as better working conditions and salaries,
 but were obliged to follow government policy guidance. In May
 a group of television journalists wrote a letter to the
 Minister of Information complaining of both poor salaries and
 the pace of democratization. The drafters of the letter were
 later either fired or demoted to positions of minimal
 responsibility. On October 6, Mobutu announced that
 opposition parties could have (apparently commercial) access
 to television and radio. Foreign journalists wishing to visit
 Zaire must receive prior permission from the Ministry of
 Information.
 Academics and students were able to speak openly in pressing
 for political reform, but the Government cracked down on
 student demonstrations (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The year's most blatant suppression of peaceful assembly--and
 there were many such instances--came just after the April 24
 democratization speech. On April 30, 2 days after dispersing
 a 300- to 500-person UDPS gathering with tear gas, agents of
 
 
 454
 ZAIRE
 the SARM under the personal command of its commander, General
 Mahele, raided a former residence of UDPS leader Etienne
 Tshisekedi during a ceremony in which the building was being
 converted into party headquarters. The SARM sacked the house
 and injured several persons, including Tshisekedi.
 On May 3, President Mobutu specified that, despite his April
 24 announcement of multiparty democracy, political groups
 could not act as parties until legally authorized to do so.
 Several actions were taken to enforce this. On August 9, the
 Interior Ministry ordered regional governors to forbid
 political meetings or demonstrations, and subsequently
 governors prevented political activists from holding press
 conferences. However, these restrictions do not apply in
 practice to the former ruling party, the MPR.
 In early May, security forces reportedly used excessive force
 against students in Kinshasa, Kisangani, Mbanzangungu, and
 Bukavu. The security forces also intervened against MNC/L
 party demonstrators and against striking workers, including
 Onatra Shipping Company workers. In the latter intervention
 several workers were reported severely wounded. In August and
 September, security forces fired in the air above labor union
 and student demonstrators. Again in November, after the
 Government had denied authorization, security forces broke up
 a planned UDPS rally, severely injuring several people. In
 December security forces harassed UDPS and Union of
 Federalists and Independent Republicans (UFERI, former Foreign
 Minister Nguz' party) activists in Lubumbashi, and a squad of
 armed men ransacked the home of Social Christian Democractic
 Party (PDSC) leader Ileo.
 In September the Foreign Ministry issued two separate
 diplomatic notes attempting to restrict diplomats' contacts
 with political groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is recognized in the Constitution, but there
 are significant restrictions on some groups. The population
 is about 50 percent Catholic, 36 percent Protestant and
 Kimbanguist (a Zairian Protestant sect), and 5 percent
 Muslim. Indigenous beliefs and religious traditions are also
 strong. Officially recognized religions are free to establish
 places of worship and to train clergy, but the process to
 become officially recognized is fairly resttictive. The
 Jehovah's Witnesses and a number of other small religious
 groups and sects, banned in 1986 on charges of subversive
 activities or fraud, remained banned in 1990. Most recognized
 churches have external ties, and expatriates are allowed to
 proselytize. There is no legally favored church or religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All citizens, refugees, and permanent residents must carry
 identity cards, and police and soldiers often set up
 checkpoints on major roads to inspect papers.
 In principle any Zairian may obtain a passport and exit visa,
 though in practice it is often difficult to do so. In 1990
 the Foreign Ministry withdrew the diplomatic passports of
 former foreign ministers and ambassadors. Some days later,
 security officials stopped opposition presidential candidate
 and former Foreign Minister Nguz a Karl-i-Bond as he was
 
 
 455
 ZAIRE
 attempting to leave the country at Kinshasa's airport and
 confiscated both his diplomatic and civilian passports. The
 passports were returned after domestic and international
 criticism, and Nguz departed a week later.
 In 1990 there were estimates of about 61,000 officially
 registered Zairians living as refugees in neighboring
 countries-a number that has remained fairly stable in recent
 years. Between September 1989 and January 1990, some 2,800
 Zairian refugees in Angola returned to Zaire as part of a
 repatriation program sponsored by the U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR). The repatriation program was ultimately
 suspended due to a lack of security at the returnee site in
 Angola.
 Zaire provides safe haven to some 385,000 refugees, of whom
 314,000 are Angolans. The latest arrivals, some 40,000
 Sudanese who have taken refuge in the remote northeastern
 corner of Zaire, arrived in March of this year. At year's
 end, additional Sudanese were reported to be in the area, and
 several thousand had already moved into the Central African
 Republic. Refugees are generally allowed to pass freely into-
 Zaire, and the Government provides land for resettlement and
 camps. Upon entry refugees are first processed by military
 and state security officials, and some may be detained and
 closely monitored on suspicion of illegal political activity.
 The UNHCR and church-affiliated organizations provide them
 food, housing, transportation, education, and medical care.
 Forced repatriation is contrary to official government policy,
 and as far as was known, there were no cases in 1990.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government           a
 Despite promises of political reform which, if fully
 implemented, would create a.more open and democratic system,
 citizens still did not have the right in 1990 to change their
 government through democratic means. Political power in Zaire
 remains highly centralized and controlled by the President,
 who, while normally consulting widely, makes all important
 decisions. However, some changes took place. While the
 President made it clear throughout the year that he would
 remain firmly in control of the process of change and the
 future government structure, opposition figures repeatedly
 contested his decisions. As a result, he issued a series of
 modifications.
 President Mobutu first proposed in April a three-party
 political system for Zaire, and then in October, responding to
 public demands, approved a full multiparty format. According
 to his various statements in 1990, the first priority in 1991
 will be to draft a new constitution and then hold a referendum
 on it; the timing of presidential and legislative elections
 was not announced. Since April 24, more than 100 political
 parties have been announced, including the MPR, the former
 sole legal party, the long-time opposition party UDPS, the
 PDSC, and UFERI. The revisions in the July party legislation
 required by the October 6 decision not to limit party numbers
 were approved in December; as of year's end the Government had
 not yet announced which aspiring parties met the criteria for
 registration. Public political meetings were only to be
 permitted after parties had been registered, and government
 forces used excessive force to break up any attempt of the new
 political groupings to meet in public. At the same time, the
 
 
 456
 ZAIRE
 MPR continued to enjoy unacknowledged official backing,
 including continued access to state funds and, in the
 interior, to the use of publicly owned housing. Although the
 Members of Parliament were all elected when the MPR was the
 sole legal party, there have been some lively debates on key
 political issues, and a growing minority is willing to vote
 against government initiatives.
 A major point of contention is the opposition's demand for
 some form of national conference to determine the pace and
 direction of democratization. President Mobutu has on several
 occasions rejected such a conference.
 In addition to the new political groupings, other elements of
 society, including the major churches, pressed for political
 reform during the year. Zaire's churches, both Catholic and
 Protestant, took explicit stands on social reform and
 development of democracy and also called for a national
 conference. In March the Catholic bishops' conference
 prepared a document for President Mobutu, which was leaked and
 published in a Paris-based magazine, criticizing the
 concentration of power and wealth and calling for a new
 constitution. The bishops issued follow-up statements in June
 and September criticizing the slow progress toward
 democratization and called for greater efforts to inform rural
 areas of the political changes taking place. The September
 statement noted that, while the President had declared
 democratization as an irreversible process, the climate of
 intimidation continued.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In midyear several internal, independent human rights groups
 began to operate, including the Zairian League of Human
 Rights, the Voice of the Voiceless,- and the review, Les Droits
 de l'Homme (Human Rights), which has appeared occasionally.
 They have reported aggressively on human rights violations,
 including obstacles to democratization. These groups have
 been permitted to operate without molestation despite their
 publication of reports that were very critical of the
 Government.
 The Government has allowed the ICRC to maintain a permanent
 office in Zaire since 1978, although at times its access to
 prisons has been restricted. In January the Government
 received the special rapporteur on torture of the UNHRC but it
 consistently rejected an international commission to
 investigate the Lubumbashi assault. On December 31, Mobutu
 announced he would invite a representative of the UNHRC to
 attend the trial of those charged in the Lubumbashi incident.
 Such a visit, while useful, would not constitute a full
 independent investigation of the incident.
 In March representatives of the New York-based Lawyers'
 Committee on Human Rights made a follow-up visit to Zaire. In
 contrast to their reception during their previous visit in
 August 1989, when they had come with official sanction, they
 were not received at the MCRL nor, with the exception of a
 senior aide at the Ministry of Justice, by other Zairian
 officials. After a factfinding trip in the interior, they
 returned to Kinshasa where, on March 15, they were assaulted
 and robbed of a briefcase outside the capital's principal
 hotel. The Lawyer's Committee believes the assault was a
 
 
 457
 ZAIRE
 political act designed to intimidate them, although the
 Government rejected this charge. Subsequently, the Committee
 released a highly critical report, entitled "Zaire:
 Repression as Policy," cataloging a "systemic pattern of
 (human rights) abuses."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Zaire, with a population of over 33 million, contains several
 hundred disparate ethnic groups. There are four official
 indigenous languages, while French is the official language of
 government and education. President Mobutu has made a
 political point of naming ethnically diverse governments,
 excluding no region from high office. Still, his home region
 of Equateur, and especially his own Ngbandi tribe, have
 dominated the highest security, intelligence, and military
 posts.
 Custom, tradition, and existing law deny women social
 equality, especially in rural areas. In addition to raising a
 family, women work in the fields and sell food in the markets.
 In the modern economy, women also face discrimination; they
 hold less responsible and lower paying jobs and receive less
 pay for similar work. The Government has been a force for
 some change. For example, women can now legally own
 property. The 1987 family code expressly allows women to
 inherit their husband's estate and strengthens their right to
 manage personal property and to obtain a property settlement
 upon divorce. Still, the code requires married women to
 obtain their husbands' permission for legal transactions such
 as opening a bank account, accepting a job, obtaining a
 passport, and renting or selling land.
 A growing number of women work in the professions,
 universities, and civil service, and women became politically
 more active and vocal during 1990, addressing national
 problems, including education and the health of children,
 rather than primarily womens' issues.
 However, neither the Government nor women's groups have
 addressed domestic violence as a public issue. Wife beating
 occurs and may be widespread, but there are no studies or
 statistical data available on the subject. The police rarely
 intervene, and there are only a few court cases, usually
 involving instances of rape. The press rarely mentions
 domestic violence. Domestic violence is more likely to be
 addressed by family or traditional tribal mechanisms. Female
 circumcision is not generally practiced in Zaire, though
 reports suggest it may exist among some groups in northern
 areas.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Before April 24, the labor movement in Zaire was limited by
 law to the National Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZa), which
 was an integral part of the then sole political party,-the
 MPR. In his April 24 democratization speech, President Mobutu
 also declared he would allow union pluralism, but 8 months
 later the Labor Ministry had not yet authorized unions other
 -than the UNTZa. Several days after the April 24 speech, the
 UNTZa declared itself independent of the MPR. The
 Secretary-General was later ousted and new UNTZa leaders were
 
 
 458
 ZAIRE
 chosen in September in a relatively free and fair election.
 Since April, several worker groups have been organized and
 have applied to the Minister of Labor for approval as legal
 unions. Some of these groups, headed by former Secretaries
 General of the UNTZa, represent an effort to reestablish
 unions which had existed until the late 1960's, before being
 amalgamated into the UNTZa. Others, notably those of the
 civil servants, teachers, and medical personnel, are new
 unions. At the end of 1990, as organizational activities
 proceeded, labor sought answers to such questions as which
 unions will be legalized, to what extent will they be legally
 empowered to collect dues, and whether the UNTZa would
 continue to be favored by the authorities.
 The right to strike is included in the present labor law, but
 because the law establishes lengthy and mandatory arbitration
 and appeal procedures, legal strikes have been rare. In 1990,
 however, the advent of multiple de facto unions and a
 deteriorating economy led to a number of illegal strikes by
 both white-collar and blue-collar workers to press their
 demands, but few received what they viewed as satisfactory
 reponses. Civil servants returned to work in October after a
 3-month strike and partial concessions by the Government. For
 several weeks in September, the teachers' union complained
 that the Ministry of Education declined to bargain on their
 demands.
 The Government used force to put down wildcat strikes, notably
 in the case of ONATRA, the navigation company.
 The UNTZa participates actively in the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity and maintains ties with a number of foreign
 labor confederations. The new unions have not yet been able
 to establish, or to exploit openly, foreign labor ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Neither the UNTZa, which still has the right to bargain
 collectively with employers, nor the new unions, which do not
 yet have legal status, are able to protect worker interests or
 defend worker rights that run counter to government policies.
 Over the last few years, UNTZa has freely negotiated nearly
 1,000 collective bargaining agreements. Under the UNTZa/ANEZA
 (the employer's association) agreements, wages and prices have
 been fixed jointly on an annual basis. Government supervision
 of this process is minimal. Given greater union competition,
 it is unclear how much influence UNTZa will now have in this
 process. The UNTZa is charged with implementing government
 programs to improve worker benefits. It is also unclear to
 what extent the competing unions will be similarly charged
 following the authorization to operate.
 The International Labor Organization Committee of Experts
 noted in 1989 the Government's assurances that, as part of the
 revision of the labor code, measures are to be taken to
 strengthen the provisions protecting workers against antiunion
 discrimination. However, there was little progress toward
 this goal in 1990, given the extensive changes during the
 year, nearly chaotic competition for leadership of UNTZa in
 May-September, and the frequent changes of labor ministers.
 There are currently no export processing zones, although the
 Government has discussed plans to establish one or more.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution and labor code forbid forced labor, and there
 are no indications that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age and Employment of Children
 The legislated minimum age for employment is 18, though minors
 between ages 14 and 18 may legally engage in "light work" if a
 parent or guardian consents. Many children under 14 years old
 work in the informal economic sector, especially in family
 subsistence agriculture.. Neither the labor unions nor the
 Government makes a major effort to enforce child labor laws.
 But child labor, while sometimes used in handicraft
 production, is not frequently used in larger enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The majority of the population is engaged in subsistence
 agriculture or small-scale commerce outside the formal
 sector. In recent years, income in the modern economy has not
 kept up with inflation. The minimum legal daily wage does not
 provide a decent living for workers and their families, and
 workers must rely on the extended family and subsistence
 agriculture to live. Public sector remuneration for the great
 majority of employees remains below a family living wage, and
 workers are often driven to corruption or to second jobs in
 the private sector. The lowest level civil servants earned
 the equivalent of approximately $25 a month at the official
 exchange rate at the end of the year. The maximum legal
 workweek is 48 hours, with only one 24-hour rest period
 required during the week. The labor code specifies health and
 safety standards ostensibly enforced by Ministry of Labor
 inspectors, but there is limited enforcement in practice.
 Minimum wage, safety, and health standards are not observed
 for employees in subsistence agriculture.
