 INDONESIA
 Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous country,
 occupies a 3,000 mile long archipelago. It is developing
 national unity in spite of its diverse ethnic, social
 and religious groups, severe economic difficulties,
 the post-independence absorption of Irian Jaya and the
 recent incorporation of East Timor following the Portu-
 gese departure and Indonesian military intervention.
 At independence in 1945, Indonesia became a constitu-
 tional democracy, but the Government became increasingly
 authoritarian and repressive under Indonesia's first
 President, Sukarno. The unsucessful attempt of the
 then 3.5 million member Indonesian Communist Party
 (PKI) to seize power by force in 1965 set off a chain
 of traumatic events which culminated in Sukarno's
 surrender of power to the current President, Suharto.
 Since then, Indonesia has had limited representative
 government d6minated by the military. Policy stress
 is on economic development, particularly agriculture,
 and on public order. Of the three parliamentary elec-
 tions held in Indonesia since independence, two (1971
 and 1977) were conducted under the present government.
 During the past year there was an acceleration of
 prisoner releases, new legal procedures were intro-
 duced, and international inspection of prisons was
 permitted. Nevertheless, human rights problems remain,
 including detention without trial, largely of persons
 believed by the Government to have been involved with
 the 1965 events, and more recent arrests of students
 and Moslem opposition figures -- many of whom were
 released shortly thereafter. The aftermath of the past
 three years of confrontation in East Timor continued
 to present human rights concerns.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 
 (358)
 
 
 359
 Torture is not officially tolerated by the Govern-
 ment. Amnesty International stated in 1977 that it was
 continuing to receive reports of torture during investi-
 gations; there were a few similar reports from other
 sources. However, well-informed human rights advocates in
 Indonesia state that they believe torture has occurred
 only rarely since the early 1970's. There is no
 evidence of systematic torture or police brutality.
 Moreover, the Government has taken action against
 perpetrators in the several known cases. For example,
 four police officers were sentenced to prison in
 Bogor, West Java, in March 1978 after being found
 guilty of torturing a suspect in March 1974. Police
 in Bandjarmasin, South Kalimantan, who were recently
 accused of brutality against six young suspects, were
 promptly suspended and have been ordered brought to
 trial.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degraaing Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment are not used
 by the Government as instruments of policy nor officially
 condoned, but cases of mistreatment by individual
 guards have probably occurred. Crowding, instances
 of forced labor, poor facilities and inadequate medi-
 cal attention in detention centers have produced prison
 conditions unacceptable by most Western standards.
 However, reports within the past year from foreign
 journalists and released prisoners indicate that the
 general conditions of imprisonment have improved.
 In January 1978, at the invitation of the Indonesian
 Government, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) began a continuing program of unrestricted
 visits to prisons and detention centers (except in
 East Timor). The ICRC is reportedly satisfied with
 the prison access and procedures provided by the Govern-
 ment.
 The Indonesian intervention in East Timor in 1975-76
 led to bombings and alleged atrocities by Indonesian
 troops. The Government subsequently acknowledged
 excesses, withdrew the offending units and reportedly
 disciplined them. Limited military engagements with
 Fretilin insurgents continue in East Timor, although
 
 
 360
 the intensity is decreasing as a result of the surrender
 or capture of Fretilin leaders during 1978. Large numbers
 of people have opted for the Government's amnesty program.
 The Government states that Timorese officials and local
 militia now staff most civilian and military offices.
 It has also announced plans for an economic development
 program designed to raise the territory's extremely
 low living standards.
 During 1978, the Government permitted foreign and
 diplomatic officials to visit certain parts of East
 Timor. They confirmed ample evidence of depressed
 living conditions and of hunger in some resettlement
 camps but were unable to travel freely and so could
 not confirm or refute allegations of more serious
 human rights violations. The Government has given
 permission in principle for foreign voluntary and
 international voluntary organizations (including
 the ICRC) to participate in relief and development
 efforts, but no date has yet been set for a sustained
 presence by one or more of these organizations.
 The United States is prepared to assist the people
 of East Timor through such organizations at such
 time as they can operate under suitable condition.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In 1966, following the outbreak of widespread civil
 strife, the Indonesian Government enacted an Emergency
 Powers Act to supplement a 1963 anti-subversion law,
 enabling detention of suspects without charge for as
 long as one year. Up to 500,000 persons may have
 been initially detained under this Act on suspicion
 of complicity in the attempted coup. The great
 majority were released by the early 1970's. On
 the occasion of its release of 2,500 detainees in
 December 1976, the Indonesian Government announced
 a three-year program to either release in phases
 or try the approximately 30,000 persons it said were
 still held. The release schedule called for 10,000
 to be freed in 1977, another 10,000 in 1978, and a
 final group in 1979. Those to be tried are to be
 brought before tribunals before the end of 1979.
 Amnesty International, in a report issued in October
 1977, estimated that there were "certainly more than
 
 
 361
 55,000 prisoners held without trial in Indonesia, and
 the actual number of prisoners held without trial is
 probably around 100,000." In a supplement issued in
 October 1978, Amnesty International estimated that
 "almost certainly still more than 30,000" are being
 held. Over the past year the Department of State
 has carefully reviewed all available information and
 has found no evidence to support these much higher
 estimates.
 In 1978 the Government implemented its detainee re-
 lease program at a faster pace than in 1977. In 1977
 all 10,000 prisoners designated to be freed were
 released on December 20. In 1978 the Government phased
 releases throughout the year, with over 5,500 being
 released in May, July or September. The 1978 program
 was concluded with a series of further releases
 in November and December, bringing the year's
 total to 9,994 persons. The Government announced
 in early December that the number remaining in
 prison after January 1, 1979, would be 9,739 per-
 sons already designated for release in 1979
 and 1,391 being held for trial but who might alter-
 natively be reclassified and released before the
 end of 1979. Over 4,000 of those released in
 1978 were persons who had been detained on Buru
 Island.
 There were concerns in early 1978 that those released
 would be subject to restrictions confining them to
 certain areas or to their homes. There were also
 allegations that prisoners were being re-arrested or
 would be forced to resettle in remote islands. Avail-
 able information indicates that these concerns were
 unfounded. Amnesty International, in its October
 1978 supplemental report, stated that prisoners
 released in December 1977 and 1978 have not been
 subjected to restrictions of-house or town arrest.
 The Government states that only one former prisoner
 has been re-arrested, this time for a post-release
 crime. There is no indication that released prisoners
 are being sent to resettlement projects against their
 will. All but a few hundred of those released in 1977
 and 1978 have reportedly returned to their homes and
 families. However, Amnesty International, in its
 
 
 October 1978 report, alleged instances of forced
 resettlement in the provinces of West Kalimantan, East
 Kalimantan, South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi.
 Integration of released prisoners into Indonesian
 society remains a continuing problem. The combination
 of Indonesian Government measures and a strong social
 stigma against former detainees has made it very diffi-
 cult for them to find jobs, as noted by Amnesty Inter-
 national and the Center for International Policy, a
 private study group. This problem is aggravated by
 nationwide high levels of unemployment and under-
 employment. Although the Government has called on
 the people to accept the ex-prisoners fully back
 into society, it has no program to facilitate employ-
 ment for former detainees other than the standing
 offer of new agricultural land in resettlement pro-
 jects.
 In early 1978 the Government arrested several hundred
 students, four well known Moslem party politicans,
 and at least several dozen other persons following
 anti-Government demonstrations opposing the re-election
 of President Suharto to another term. The great ma-
 jority were released after a few days. By the beginning
 of December, all but about 40 of these persons, some
 of whom have been charged with acts of terrorism,
 had been released. Student detainees interviewed
 after their release indicated that they had been
 well treated in prison. According to Amnesty Inter-
 national, some Moslem detainees indicated they had
 been ill treated. Trials for those remaining in
 detention were scheduled to begin in January 1979.
 Meanwhile, several leading student detainees have
 been paroled by the courts to city arrest pending
 trial, and the Government shows signs of relaxing
 pre-trial detention orders for other students.
 Three prominent Muslim leaders are still detained
 without formal charges.
 In his annual State Address on August 16, 1978,President
 Suharto specified a need to review laws related to
 national security matters. The Coordinating Minister
 for Political and Security Affairs subsequently announced
 that the government had set as a primary task prepara-
 
 
 363
 tion of a new basic law. Human rights groups in Indonesia
 applauded the announcement. At the time this report
 was prepared, the new legislation had not yet been
 introduced in Parliament.
 The Government has improved safeguards against
 arbitrary actions and taken measures against abuses
 by officials, including the discipling, demotion
 or transfer of police personnel. For instance,
 in early November 1978 the new Minister of Defense
 and Security issued renewed instructions to law en-
 forcement officials to safeguard the dignity and
 rights of suspects during investigation and detention.
 In addition, on November 10, 1978, the six senior
 Indonesian Government officials concerned with law
 enforcement jointly announced new legal procedures
 to be followed in criminal cases, including the
 right to legal assistance during investigation and
 immediate access to families or lawyers.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Indonesian law and judicial institutions are rooted
 in Dutch law, traditional law, and in some cases
 Islamic Law, and the exact character of the law on
 a specific matter is often unclear. Moreover, the
 Indonesian court system is understaffed, overburdened
 and sometimes corrupt. The International Commission
 of Jurists in a September 1978 report by its Centre
 for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers estimated
 that of the 2,000 practicing lawyers in Indonesia,
 only five or six were then willing to defend political
 prisoners and stated that these few ;7ere in constant
 fear of being arrested or re-arrested. However, a
 significantly larger number of lawyers has been gathered
 to handle the defense of the students who are scheduled
 to be tried in January 1979. President Suharto announced
 on August 16, 1978, that the Government intended to
 increase the number of court personnel and to improve
 the legal process in general.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The concept of sanctity of the home has never been a
 part of Indonesian culture or legal traditions, al-
 though privacy is valued. There is no known legal
 
 
 364
 prohibition against police search of the home without
 a warrant. On the other hand, there is no evidence
 of arbitrary behavior on the part of governmental
 officials in this area.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 In Indonesia, the fulfillment of such needs is limited
 primarily by the economy's ability at its present
 stage of development to provide adequate goods and
 services. The standard of living of the great majority
 of Indonesians is low by nearly every criteria.
 For more than a decade, the Indonesian Government has
 given the highest priority to economic development
 programs. With the support and advice of a multi-
 lateral aid consortium, Indonesia is currently nearing
 the end of its.ambitious second five-year developmental
 program. In recent years, the focus has been on the
 agricultural and food sectors; most Indonesians depend
 on agriculture for their livelihood. Indonesia has
 a very effective family planning program.. However,
 mounting population pressure has led to a greater
 concentration on labor-intensive development projects
 to absorb unemployment. Thus, the third five-year
 plan, which will begin in 1979, will emphasize employ-
 ment creation and more equitable distribution of income.
 Ten years of close cooperation between an Indonesian
 civilian economic team and World Bank and International
 Monetary Fund advisors, plus approximately $7.5
 billion in foreign assistance, have helped raise
 the level of per capita income. At the same time, these
 efforts have fallen short of overcoming the immense
 economic problems posed by Indonesia's population, its
 geographic dispersion, lack of infrastructure and trained
 personnel, and mismanagement and corruption. The great
 majority of Indonesians are crowded onto Java while
 most of the potential resources are found in the more
 
 
 365
 remote outer islands. The country remains one of the
 poorest in the world, with estimated per capita income
 in 1977 of about $240 a year. Government develop-
 ment policies are placing increased emphasis on seeking
 to reduce the large income gap between the few rich and
 the mass of the poor.
 Corruption is an endemic problem and has diverted re-
 sources from meeting basic human needs. However, in
 1977 the Government began an anti-corruption campaign
 which is considerably more forceful than earlier
 efforts. In recent years an increasing number of
 senior officials, both military and civilian, have
 been sentenced to long prison terms. For example,
 the former Deputy Commander of the National Police,
 a Lieutenant General, and three other senior
 Police officials were convicted and sentenced
 to jail in late 1978 for misappropriating funds.
 As a further step in efforts to check corruption,
 a senior government spokesman announced on August
 30, 1978, that the anti-corruption campaign would-
 be stepped up after the end of the Muslim fasting
 month of Ramadan in September; President Suharto
 emphasized that civilian and military officials
 should not accept the gifts normally exchanged
 on that occasion except from members of their own
 families. Further, the new Minister of Defense and
 Security has initialed measures designed to ensure
 proper use of military funds and resources and to
 curtail luxurious living at top military levels; he
 has stressed that soldiers who disobey the law will
 be prosecuted.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The rigorous suppression of the Indonesian press during
 the latter part of the Sukarno era was initially re-
 versed by the present Government. Between 1966 and
 1974 the Indonesian press enjoyed a substantial degree
 
 
 366
 of freedom. Following the outbreak of riots in Jakarta
 in January 1974, however, several publications were
 closed by the Government. Since then the press has
 been restricted in its freedom to criticize the Govern-
 ment or senior officials. Criticism of specific
 actions and policies of the Government is accepted
 within implicit limits which have been gradually
 relaxed. By 1977, correspondents of the Washington
 Post and The New Yorker magazine judged Indonesia's
 press the freest and liveliest in Southeast Asia.
 However, in January 1978, the publication of eight
 leading Jakarta newspapers was suspended for two
 weeks for having reported student activities and
 views. These newspapers resumed publication after
 accepting Government limitations on coverage of
 demonstrations, student activities and personal
 criticism of the President and his family. Since
 then the press has again gradually expanded the
 scope of its coverage with tacit government
 approval, as has been the case after previous
 peri6ds of restriction.
 The Government limits freedom of expression when
 it fears that the stability of society is threatened
 or top officials are slandered. The Government
 has at times banned student publications and politi-
 cally inspired poetry and has moved against campus
 demonstrations. One issue of a weekly magazine was
 banned in July for having carried articles on four
 controversial military officers. On the other hand,
 in August 1978, the Minister of Defense and Security
 told a meeting of newspaper chief editors that they
 should not fear retaliation for printing any factual
 material.
 Indonesia is a secular state, although the large
 majority of its people profess Islam as their
 religion. In August 1978, the Minister of Religion
 issued new decrees restricting proselytizing of
 
 
 367
 members of other religions. However, there is no
 hindrance to the free observance of religion by
 Indonesian citizens, although only Islam, Christianity,
 Hinduism and Buddhism are officially recognized.
 The Communist Party is outlawed because of its role
 in the 1965 coup. Only three political groups, each
 reflecting one or more of the major religious and
 political currents in the society, are permitted
 (see below). No other unusual limitations apply to
 the freedom of association. Senior civil service
 officials are forbidden to join political parties and,
 under a proposed new law, ordinary civil servants
 would have to obtain permission from their superiors
 to do so. Freedom of assembly is limited by a require-
 ment that groups obtain permission to hold meetings.
 Some large-scale demonstrations have been prohibited;
 others have been allowed when they have not been consi-
 dered to be threats to public order. However,
 the Government does not induce its citizens to attend
 mass rallies or engage in forced sloganeering.
 Trade union activities are restricted. The Government
 encourages the development of trade unions within the
 framework of a government-sponsored federation. Trade
 unions must register with and be approved by the Ministry
 of Manpower, after which they are allowed to engage
 in collective bargaining and other normal functions.
 However, strikes are forbidden in essential industries
 and subject to significant restrictions in others.
 Consequently, strikes and most other forms of work action
 are rare.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Exit permits are required of persons leaving the country.
 They are usually obtainable without difficulty upon
 presentation bf identification papers and the payment
 of a fee. The Government on a few occasions several
 years ago limited the foreign travel of a few political
 figures. The Government requires a permit to change
 residence. This is done primarily to control the further
 movement of surplus population from the rural areas
 
 
 368
 into the already overcrowded cities. Permits reportedly
 are not difficult to obtain for anyone able to prove
 he has a job in the city. According to both govern-
 mental sources and human rights groups in Indonesia,
 former detainees are free to travel domestically with-
 out having to seek prior permission but are required
 to notify authorities of travel outside their home
 areas.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Government of Indonesia has a form of limited
 representative government dominated by the military.
 Parliamentary elections were held in Indonesia in July
 1971 and in May 1977. Elected representative bodies
 also exist at the provincial, Kabupaten (county) and
 city levels. All adult citizens except prisoners and
 members of the armed forces may vote. Members of the
 armed forces may not stand for election. Current
 Indonesian law limits the number of political groups
 to three: the Development Unity Party, which incor-
 porates four earlier Muslim parties; the Indonesian
 Democracy Party, which is an amalgamation of the former
 Nationalist Party, the Catholic Party, the Christian
 (Protestant) Party and two smaller, secularly-oriented
 parties; and the pro- government GOLKAR group.
 The Government enforces restrictions against political
 parties for criticizing other parties, endangering
 national unity, dishonoring government officials
 or belittling government policies. Despite restraints,
 campaigning by the rival groups in the May 1977
 parliamentary elections was intense, spirited and
 involved the great majority of the electorate. The
 activities of the opposition political parties were
 restricted to some extent iri rural areas. While the
 Government had greatly superior assets to influence
 voters and its party received a majority share of the
 vote, it lost two seats to the combined opposition.
 In accordance with the constitutionally-prescribed
 process, President Suharto was reelected to a new
 five year term in March 1978 by the People's
 Consultative Assembly (MPR), a body consisting
 of all members of Parliament and an equal number of
 other members. Some 30 percent of the latter are
 elected by provincial legislatures, and others are
 
 
 369
 appointed by the Government and by the political
 parties.
 Indonesian cultural tradition embodies a highly
 developed system of decision-making based on
 consultation and consensus rather than confronta-
 tional voting. However, in 1978 the MPR'S consi-
 deration of a religion-related issue resulted in
 an unprecedented explicit vote in which the Develop-
 ment Unity Party, which represents Muslim political
 views, registered its disagreement with a Government
 policy supported by all other participating parties
 and groups. Parliament has only a limited role in
 the decision-making process. It does, however,
 participate in the consensus and on a few occasions
 has persuaded the Government to modify its programs.
 The Indonesian Government has been criticized
 for its initial military occupation of East Timor.
 The United States Government has accepted the
 incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia, but
 it does not recognize that a valid act of self-
 determination occurred. The United States
 Government seeks to encourage the Indonesian
 Government to expand its programs of assistance
 to the people of East Timor and to continue to
 widen international access to the area, particu-
 larly for representatives of recognized inter-
 national humanitarian organizations.
 During 1977 and 1978 a minor rebellion, conducted
 by ethnic Irianese who are Melanesian and do
 not consider themselves to be Indonesian, broke
 out in Irian Jaya. There have been allegations,
 including those by Amnesty International, that
 Indonesian forces may have overreacted and engaged
 in repressive acts. Recently, however, the
 Indonesian Defense Minister- announced a change
 of policy from military search and destroy opera-
 tions to a policy of "peaceful persuasion and
 socio-economic betterment."
 
 
 370
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Indonesian Government permitted the ICRC to
 inspect prisons in 1971, 1974, and 1977. The ICRC
 withdrew its inspection teams in early 1977 when
 misunderstandings between the two sides arose.
 In January 1978, however, at Indonesian Government
 initiative, ICRC inspections were resumed. In
 accordance with usual practice, inspection reports
 have not been released. The Indonesians have on
 occasion permitted other inspection visits to de-
 tention facilities on Buru Island and other locations.
 Representatives of foreign embassies in Jakarta have
 usually been invited to attend ceremonies marking
 the release of detainees from the 1965 coup and were
 allowed to question the releasees. Foreign and
 Indonesian newsmen have also observed some of the
 release ceremonies, including those held on Buru
 Island in 1977. The Indonesian Government has
 stated that diplomatic, press and ICRC representa-
 tives may have continuing access to persons who
 have been released from detention. The ICRC
 has done so in practice.
 Amnesty International released a major and critical report
 on Indonesia in October 1977. A short supplement
 was issued in October 1978 as the preface to the
 Indonesian language edition. The report was based
 largely on information stated to be from sources
 within Indonesia. In recent years, Amnesty International
 representatives have been refused access to Indonesia
 because of the Government's disagreement with Amnesty
 reports.
 United Nations resolutions have been adopted in recent
 years expressing deep concern about the situation
 in the territory and reaffirming the right of the
 people of East Timor to self-determination. The
 United States opposed these resolutions in 1977
 and 1978 because it did not believe they would make
 a pragmatic contribution to improvement of condi-
 tions in East Timor.
