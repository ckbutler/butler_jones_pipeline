 YEMEN
 The Republic of Yemen was proclaimed in 1990 with the unification of the Yemen
 Arab Republic (YAR) and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The
 Constitution provides for a Parliament elected by universal suffrage and a five-
 member Presidential Council elected by the Parliament whose chairman serves as
 Head of State. Yemen held its first parliamentary elections on April 27. They were
 monitored by domestic and foreign observers and were generally held to be free and
 open. They resulted in a 301-member Parliament, with the General People's Con-
 gress (GPC), the party of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, forming a coalition govern-
 ment with the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and Islaah, the Tribal/Islamic Grouping
 for Reform. Tribal leaders in the north and east continue to hold considerable power
 over large amounts of territory based on their traditional prerogatives. Yemen has
 been in the midst of a political crisis since August 1993 which has paralyzed many
 government activities and all policymaking.
 An extensive state-security apparatus, the Political Security Organization (PSO),
 has replaced the National Security Organization (NSO). Unlike the NSO, the PSO
 is independent of the Interior Ministry and reports directly to the President. Its offi-
 cers retain broad discretion over perceived national security issues and, despite con-
 stitutional prohibitions, routinely detain citizens for questioning, frequently mistreat
 detainees, monitor personal activities, and search homes.
 Yemen is a poor country in which agriculture and oil dominate the economy. Re-
 mittances from Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, formerly an
 important source of hard currency, declined significantly in the aftermath of the
 Gulf war, and aid from the Gulf states has almost ended. After unification, the
 Marxist economy in the south was liberalized, but former PDRY state institutions
 remain significant.
 With the holding of free parliamentary elections and less repression of civil lib-
 erties such as freedom of the press there were some gains in the human rights situ-
 ation in 1993. Nevetheless, significant restrictions remained. Major problems in-
 cluded arbitrary detention, torture and abuse of prisoners, and widespread discrimi-
 nation based on sex, race, and religion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-Political and extrajudicial violence
 remains part of the Yemeni political scene. A though there were a number of allega-
 tions of political killings in 1993, none has so far been substantiated.
 b. Disappearance.-As in 1992, there were occasional reports of Yemenis dis-
 appearin   ollowin  detention by the scurity forces. Most such detainees were even-
 tually released. Most reports about disappeared persons were related to former
 members of the National IDemocratic Front (NDF), which waged a guerrilla war
 against the YAR from the mid-1970's through the early 1980's. Families of an esti-
 mated 200 to 300 persons who disappeared in the former PDRY prior to unification
 in 1990 have been'unable to obtain any information from the Government about the
 
 
 1308
 fate of their relatives. The vast majority of these persons are thought to have been
 killed while in the custody of PDRY state security officials.
 In a separate case a credible source reported eight suspects in the Aden bombing
 of the Gold Mohur hotel, in which two tourists died, were abducted and possibly
 killed by the YSP. The Government reported the eight men had escaped.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution proscribes "physical punishment and degrading treatment." It is
 widely believed, however, that security officials resort with impunity to force or the
 threat of force to extract information from detainees. There continued to be reports
 in the Yemeni press alleging torture and mistreatment by prison officials. Amnesty
 International reports that at the beginning of 1993 at least 50 of the 1,000 persons
 arrested in antigovernment riots in December 1992 remained in detention. Some de-
 tainees were reportedly subjected to torture, including beatings and electric shocks.
 Credible reports indicate that Mansur Muhammad Ahmad Rajih, a writer and NDF
 activist, who remains imprisoned, has been subjected to torture throughout his in-
 carceration. There was a credible report that a European tourist was detained and
 tortured in July.
 There were no reported instances of amputation in 1993. In seven out of eight
 cases in which amputation penalties were imposed, the Yemeni Supreme Court re-
 fused to confirm the sentences and in several cases ordered the prisoners released
 upon a finding that their periods of incarceration, which ranged up to 10 years, were
 adequate punishment. The eighth case was still pending.
 ubstandard conditions in Yemeni prisons represent a threat to the health of in-
 mates. Visitors from human rights organizations and local press reports have de-
 scribed inadequate food, medical, and sanitary facilities, and severe overcrowding.
 In the women s section of Sanaa central prison, prisoners were in some instances
 unable to obtain milk for their children who were incarcerated with them.
 Although they are theoretically banned, shackles are still used in a number of
 Yemeni prisons. Mentally ill persons are occasionally shackled, as are those involved
 in 'blood-money" cases, i.e., prisoners held until they can pay a specified amount
 of compensation to the family of someone they have killed, usually in a traffic acci-
 dent.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite constitutional and other legal
 guarantees, there continued to be reports of arbitrary arrest and prolonged deten-
 tion without charge. Moreover, relatives of accused persons are sometimes held
 while, in accoirdance with customary law, compensation for the victim or victim's rel-
 atives is negotiated. Under the law, persons arrested may not be detained for more
 than 24 hours without being brought before a court and formally charged. Upon ar-
 rest, a detainee has the right in th ry to notify a person of his or her choie, but
 this right is seldom honored or is observed only upon payment of a bribe, especially
 in cases of arrests by security officials. While there are p rvisions for release on
 bail, arrested Yemenis more commonl have a close family member pledge surety
 for them. The accused has the right to hear the charges being brought and an oppor-
 tunity to respond to those charges. A judge then decides whether the accused is to
 be held for trial or released. A detainee may not be required to answer questions
 without an attorney present.
 Credible sources report that as many as 4,000 prisoners are held in Yemeni jails
 without documentation concerning their imprisonment. Moat of these prisoners were
 moved to state prisons from outlying jails following unification and are held without
 a record of their sentences or why they were arrested. However, it has become cus-
 tomary for the Government to pardon between 500 and 700 prisoners each year at
 EidAlFitr, a religious holiday marking the end of the holy month of fasting, Rama-
 dan; many of these are believed to be those held without charge.
 A common y of Yemeni employers is to hire third-country nationals, often from
 the horn of  frica, and then, upon the expiration of their term  of service, accuse
 them of theft and have them imprisoned in order to avoid paying their salary or
 ticket home.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-In accordance with an August 1991 decree,' udi-
 cil systems have been unified at the Supreme Court level. The lower courts have
 not yet been merged and continue to function in their respective halves of the coun-
 try. In the former YAR, there are two court systems: Shari'a (criminal and family)
 and commercial. The Shari'a courts are baseda on Islamic law and, viewed within
 their traditional Islamic context (e.g., no jury trials), are considered generally to be
 impartial. The judge actively questons witnesaes. Attorneys are allowed to counsel
 their clients and may alsoa  as   e court and examine witnesses.
 In the commercial courts, defendants enjoy the right of appeal, and court sessions
 are generally open, although the Constitution permits the courts to hold closed ses-
 sions for reasons of security or general morals." Foreign litigants in the commercial
 
 
 1309
 courts have frequently complained of biased rulings, and both Yemeni and non-Yem-
 eni litigants maintain that tribal ties as well as outright bribery are often decisive
 in obtaining a favorable verdict. Former YAR state security courts were formally
 abolished after unification.
 In the former PDRY there are three court systems: magistrate or divisional
 courts, provincial courts, and military courts. Magistrate's courts have jurisdiction
 over most criminal and traffic offenses, juvenile cases, family cases, housing and
 agrarian disputes, and minor civil matters. Provincial courts have jurisdiction over
 serious criminal cases involving the death sentence or long prison terms, inheritance
 cases, major civil claims, and appeals from magistrates' courts. Military courts have
 jurisdiction over crimes by members of the armed forces.
 Yemen's judiciary is not fully independent. There are some "government" judges,
 i.e., judges who will return whatever verdict the Government desires. Thely operate
 generally at the lower court level. The Appellate and Supreme Courts are independ-
 ent from the executive branch of government, though they are not free of corruption,
 even at the higest levels. Although the Shari'a and commercial courts in the former
 YAR are largely independent of the executive, judicial authorities have complained
 of executive branch interference in sensitive cases and of the continued existence of
 extrajudicial prisons maintained by some ministries.
 The Government denies that it holds any political prisoners, although credible
 Yemeni sources dispute this. Amnesty International and other human rights orgam-
 zations have expressed concern about political opponents of the Government who
 were arrested in the former YAR and are still believed to be held in prison. All were
 suspected members of the NDF; no confirmed figure is available on their number.
 Most NDF prisoners appear to qualify as political prisoners on the grounds that
 they did not receive fair trials. Some NDF members, arrested before 1985, are re-
 ortedly still being held despite a general amnesty declared in 1985 for all former
 KDF members.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 constitutional guarantees against such interference, security forces routinely search
 homes, monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise intrude into perronal
 matters, alleging security concerns.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres.-The new Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and press "within the limits of the law." Yemenis typically engage in unin-
 hibited discussions of both domestic and foreign policies in qat (a leaf that acts as
 mild stimulant which many Yemenis chew) sessions, an institution deeply ingrained
 in Yemeni life. However, some Yemenis remain cautious in exercising their freedom
 of speech, believing that they may experience difficulty if security agents overhear
 them criticizing particular government leaders.
 Since unification Yemen has enjoyed greater press freedom. In addition to several
 ma'or newspapers owned by the Government, some 94 papers have been registered,
 although only about 60 are being published, some of them on an irregular basis.
 These papers represent a wide spectrum of olitical opinion and frequently criticize
 government policies and leaders by name.    one striking case in 1993, the editor
 of the only English weekly published several articles accusing President Saleh of
 cronyism. The Government charged the editor with "antigovernment" slander, but
 the court threw out the Government's case, an action that the press hailed as a vic-
 tory for freedom of the press. It remains to be seen what effect this will have on
 the press, which is widely seen as practicing self-censorship, particularly on sen-
 sitive issues such as Yemen's policies during the Gulf crisis and Yemeni-Saudi rela-
 tions.
 The Ministry of Information continues to subsidize most newspapers, which gives
 the Government added control over the print media. The Government has on occa-
 sion prevented the distribution of foreign press articles deemed Lo be critical. Arti-
 cles and photos deemed salacious are forbidden. Although there are no banned pub-
 lications in Yemen, either foreign or domestic, the Government has been known to
 effectively restrict certain publications by imposing excessive duties or by other indi-
 rect means. For example, a credible source alleged that the high tariffs on newsprint
 are applied unevenly, with lower tariffs granted to "government-friendly" news-
 TheMinistry of Information owns and oprates Yemen's radio and television sta-
 tions. News broadcasts appear to be closely controlled by the Government and vir-
 tually never contain reports critical of the Government. However, Yemen's two tele-
 vision channels regularly broadcast uncensored parliamentary sessions even though
 some speakers criticize government policies.
 
 
 1310
 Informational materials carried by both foreigners and Yemenis are subject to in-
 spection at customs points, and those of a religious, political, or pornographic nature
 are often confiscated. Self-censorship is sometimes practiced at Sanaa University,
 where professors and senior administrators require a security clearance before being
 hired. However, there have been no recent reports of government interference in
 teaching programs or curriculum development. Ali Abdul-Fattah Hashim, a writer
 and teacher, remains in prison after being arrested in April 1992 on charges of apos-
 tasy for promoting "heretical" teachings.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Organizations must register
 with the Ministry of Social Security and Social Affairs, but licensing is usually rou-
 tine. Yemeni citizens have a right to demonstrate peacefully and exercise it. Citizens
 continue to demonstrate regularly in front of the President's office, Parliament, and
 provincial government offices to voice their views on domestic issues.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion, and there are restrictions on
 the practice of other religions. Most Yemenis are Muslims, either members of the
 Zaydi Sect, which is a form of Shi'ism, or followers of the Shafi'i Sunni School of
 Islamic lew. Islamic associations with ties to pan-Islamic organizations enjoy a de-
 gree of freedom. The right of these organizations to run schools, however, is re-
 stricted in that they must submit to government oversight and regulation.
 Most of the once sizable Yemeni Jewish population has emigrated; about 500 Jews
 remain, mostly scattered in northern rural areas. There are no formal synagogues,
 but services are routinely held in private homes. Despite occasional hindrances, the
 Government has allowed contact with foreign Jewish groups and has permitted
 these groups to build and operate schools and ritual baths in the two main centers
 of Jewish population, as well as assist Jews wishing to emigrate from Yemen in ob-
 taining travel documents and tickets.
 Except for several families in Aden, there are no indigenous Yemeni Christians.
 Foreign Christians throughout Yemen and the Indian-origin Christian commuity
 of Aden regularly conduct services. While there are no churches in the former Y,
 there are Christian churches and a Hindu temple in Aden. Foreign clergy may not
 proselytize but are present in Yemen, often teaching or working in social services
 or health care. By religious convention, Muslims may not convert to other religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Yemeni citizens enjoy freedom of travel within Yemen, although there
 are many checkpoints on major roads. Foreigners are required to obtain permits for
 travel outside the capital, but the regulations are not strictly enforced and allow the
 Government to respond more quickly in case of need. Permission for most tourist
 travel is easily obtainable through travel agencies, and there are no reports of per-
 mission being denied.
 Most Yemenis are able to travel abroad freely and to emigrate. In contrast to
 1992, Yemeni Jews are now able to emigrate with relatively little hindrance. The
 Government has taken the stand that Yemeni Jews, like all Yemenis, are entitled
 to passports and that if they follow the prescribed procedures they will be issued
 travel documents. This policy is being implemented in practice.
 For most Yemenis, obtaining passports is a relatively simple matter. Exit permit
 procedures have been simplified, and permits are enerally available at the airport.
 However, young males who have not yet completed their military service sometimes
 are prevented from traveling abroad. Moreover, women seeking exit visas are often
 asked to prove that male relatives do not object to their travel. There have been
 no reports of Yemenis being denied the right to return.
 Following a dramatic increase in the number of refugees (primarily from Horn of
 Africa countries) in 1992 from about 10,000 to over 60,000, the influx in 1993 was
 insignificant. There are no known cases of refugees being denied asylum, and there
 were no reports of forced repatriation. Many of the refugees have family or tribal
 ties to Yemen and have found work in Yemen. The Government has offered Somalis
 without ethnic affiliation to Yemen asylum under the care of the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Government closely monitors all
 political activity by refugees. Many of the Palestinians who arrived in Yemen from
 Lebanon in 1982-83 have departed; the remainder live in camps near Sanaa and
 Aden and are closely watched by the security services. Other Palestinians are em-
 ployed, often as teachers or business people, and are not subject to significant re-
 strictions on their freedom of movement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of the citizens of Yemen to change their government was successfully
 tested-at least to some degree-by the holding of the new Republic's first elections
 in April in which 301 members of Parliament were chosen and which were generally
 
 
 1311
 
 judged to be free and open. All the top leaders of the former YAR and PDRY have
 remained in power after unification.
 The Constitution gives broad powers to the Parliament: these include electing the
 Presidential Council, withdrawing confidence from the Government, questioning the
 Prime Minister and other Ministers, ratifying international agreements, and approv-
 ing the budget. In its initial sessions, the Parliament vetoed some government-spon-
 sored bills and requested modifications in others. Parliament has shown less inde-
 pendence on issues of substance, as in the debates over constitutional amendments.
 Implementation of laws passed by the Parliament has been uneven as local ministry
 and other officials retain considerable discretion in interpreting and enforcing the
 law.
 A five-member Presidential Council with broad executive powers has functioned
 since unification. Its chairman is the former YAR President, Ali Abdullah Saleh,
 and its Vice Chairman, the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) Secretary General, Ali
 Salem al-Bidh. The Council's executive powers include the right to pass legislation
 by decree when the Parliament is not in session. Laws passed by decree must be
 submitted for review by the Parliament within 30 days. The Council appointed
 Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas Prime Minister in May 1990, and he formed a govern-
 ment now comprised of 30 ministries, divided among the three coalition members.
 The new Constitution permits political parties, although by law their programs
 may not oppose the Islamic religion or the goals of the Yemeni revolution or violate
 Yemeni international commitments. Under the law, government financial support
 must be given to recognized political parties, and parties may establish their own
 newspapers. Even before unification, while technically illegal in both the YAR and
 the PDRY, new political parties began to organize. There are currently 54 political
 parties in Yemen, but until now none has registered in accordance with the 1991
 political parties law.
 Women may vote and hold office by law, although this right is limited in practice
 by cultural and religious traditions. Two members of the 301-member Parliament
 are women, and few women hold senior leadership positions in the Government or
 political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two nongovernmental human rights organizations: The Yemeni Human
 Rights Organization,headquartered in Sanaa, and The Yemeni Organization for the
 Defense of Liberties and Human Rights, based in Aden. A government-sanctioned
 human rights organization also exists as a committee of the Parliament. It has held
 several meetings and has hosted an international children's rights conference but
 has done little else of substance.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, origin, lan-
 guage, occupation, social status, or religious belief, in practice various forms of dis-
 crimination exist.
 Women.-Although the Constitution provides for equality of the sexes, significant
 restrictions on women are imposed by tradition and law. Under current law, po-
 lygyny is allowed, husbands may divorce their wives without justifying their actions
 before the court, and, in case of divorce, both the family home and the children are
 often awarded to the husband. Until this year the relatively progressive family law
 from the south was still applied in Aden. Eariier this year, however, a presidential
 decree containing more restrictive regulations against women was issued. Since it
 has never been ratified by Parliament, it technically is not law. A prominent lawyer
 in Aden, however, cites from personal experience before the courts their enforcement
 of the more restrictive regulations.
 The institution of dowry payments is widespread. The amount of payments has
 continued to increase; government efforts at limiting their size have been ineffective,
 due to societal restraints. Societal pressures also often force women to defer to the
 guidance of male colleagues and the general supervision of male relatives as, for ex-
 ample, in seeking to travel abroad.
 Education of women in significant numbers began in the YAR only at the end of
 the civil war in 1970, although education of women in the PDRY was more ad-
 vanced. It is conservatively estimated that 80 percent of Yemeni women are illit-
 erate (some estimates range as high as 95 percent), compared to 40 to 50 percent
 of all men. In Aden, women work in midlevel jobs in several ministries and in banks
 and other businesses. Yemen's largest factory group employs women on the same
 pay scale as men, and women have risen through the ranks to lower management
 
 
 1312
 positions. There are female judges and lawyers in Aden and lesser numbers in the
 north. The Ministry of Justice has only one female employee.
 Wife beating and other physical abuse of women does occur in Yemeni families.
 Statistics on wife beating are unavailable. Although there is little public discussion
 of this matter, it has received increasing attention in the press. The female victim
 usually turns to a male relative to pressure the perpetrator to stop the abuse; she
 may seek a legal remedy, but social traditions usually compel women and their male
 relatives to seek mediation and keep the matter within the extended family.
 There is a government-sponsored women's association which promotes female edu-
 cation and civic responsibilities.
 Children.-The Yemeni Government claims to be fully committed to protecting
 children's rights and hosted an international children's rights seminar in 1993. In
 the face of continued government preoccupation with the political crisis, however
 defense of children's rights is a low priority. Yemen is an extremely impoverished
 nation and cannot provide all the health, education, and welfare benefits children
 enjoy in more developed countries. There is, however, a system of universal edu-
 cation for children, as well as Government health clinics.
 Child marriage remains common in rural areas. A form of female genital mutila-
 tion, clitorectomy, is practiced in the Tihama Red Sea coastal region and in the re-
 gion of the Hadhramaut along the Gulf of Aden, especially among Yemenis of Afri-
 can origin. The extent of the practice is unknown. While some government health
 workers in the Tihama actively discourage clitorectomy, there is no government di-
 rective or guidance against the practice. Conservative social mores effectively pre-
 vent public discussion or government acknowledgment of the practice.
 National/ Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Yemenis with a non-Yemeni parent (so-
 called muwalladin) face discrimination. For example, the Constitution requires that
 members of the Presidential Council be "born of Yemeni parents." Sanaa University,
 administered by the Government, applies the same restriction when hiring teaching
 and senior administrative staff, as does Yemen's military academy in selecting ca-
 dets. However discrimination against muwalladin is not universal; many senior
 government officials, including ministers, are muwalladin. Naturalization of the
 non-Yemeni parent is enough to overcome the "Yemeni parents" requirement. An-
 other smaller group known as Akhdam, the descendants of ancient Ethiopian occu-
 piers who later became slaves, also faces persistent social discrimination.
 Religious Minorities.-Apart from several Adeni Christian families and 20-30 un-
 derground Bahais in the norZh, Jews are Yemen's only indigenous religious minor-
 ity. By custom, non-Muslims are not permitted to carry weapons, traditionally car-
 ried by Muslim Yemenis. With the recent lifting of travel restrictions, the most bla-
 tant form of discrimination against Jews has been removed. More subtle forms of
 discrimination, such as lack of political and economic opportunities, and the inabil-
 ity of Jewish men to marry outside the Jewish community, remain. Such discrimina-
 tion is usually the result of custom rather than government policy, however.
 People with Disabilities.-Disabled persons suffer discrimination based on tradi-
 tional social prejudices against mental and physical handicaps. Persons with such
 handicaps are often isolated and are not given equal opportunity for education or
 employment. As noted in Section 1.c., mentally ill persons are occasionally shackled.
 The Government has not enacted legislation or otherwise mandated accessibility for
 the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-As United Yemen has not yet enacted a new labor
 code, the labor codes for the former YAR and PDRY remain in effect for their re-
 spective parts of the country. In both the YAR and PDRY, labor unions were closely
 controlled, if not actually organized, by the respective ruling parties.
 Under the YAR Labor Code, a union may be set up by 100 or more workers upon
 application to and approval by the Government. The Code prescribes a single union
 system with one union committee per enterprise, one union branch per locality, one
 general union per economic sector, and one national umbrella organization, which
 was the Yemeni Trade Union Confederation.
 Public servants, employees, and manual workers employed in the state adminis-
 tration, as well as some categories of farm workers, are excluded from union mem-
 bership. Under the YAR Labor Code, the Council of Ministers may dissolve trade
 unions without judicial action. The Code also prohibits unions from engaging in po-
 litical activity. Financial records are subject to government oversight.
 In the PDRY, the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU), the only labor as-
 sociation, was under close Yemeni Socialist Party control. The YAR and PDRY
 Labor Confederations merged in 1990, forming the Yemeni Confederation of Labor
 Unions (YCLU). The YCLU is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 
 
 1313
 Arab Trade Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions.
 In the YAR, labor-related legislation neither granted the right to strike nor out-
 lawed strikes. No major strikes were held in 1993, in contrast with 1992. A general
 strike was called for in March, postponed until May and finally dropped altogether
 after the Government agreed to substantial cost of living increases. Yemeni labor
 laws neither prohibit nor allow retribution against strikers. The International Labor
 Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts reminded the Government in March that
 numerous changes in the Labor Code were necessary to bring it into conformity with
 ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association. The Government informed the ILO
 in June that Article 39 of the Constitution adopted following unification, guarantees
 to trade unions the right of organization, freedom of association, and political rights,
 which would be amplified in a new labor code.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivdly.-Although the YAR Labor
 Code calls for employers to treat workers collectively, it does not require collective
 bargaining. There are consequently no formal collective bargaining agreements now
 in force. Unions do negotiate wage settlements for their members and have often
 resorted to strikes or other actions to achieve their demands. According to the YAR
 Labor Code, collective agreements must be registered and may be unilaterally re-
 voked by the Government if they do not conform to the security and economic inter-
 ests of the country.
 Neither the PDRY nor the YAR labor codes specifically prohibit antiunion dis-
 crimination. Therefore, employers are not found guilty of antiunion discrimination,
 nor are they required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. Such matters
 may be taken to labor courts, however which are generally favorably disposed to-
 ward unions. The ILO's Committee of Experts again in 1993 urged the Government
 to adopt legislation protecting workers against antiunion discrimination.
 Until a new labor code is passed, workers in the north enjoy limited protections
 under the YAR Labor Code. Workers in the former PDRY have practically no protec-
 tion. In the former PDRY, the State, through the YSP-controlled unions, purported
 to represent the rights of the workers. There was no collective bargaining, and there
 were no nongovernmental bodies that addressed labor grievances.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is for-
 bidden by the Constitution, and there are no reports of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There was no minimum age for
 employment of children in the YAR. Labor by minors aged 12 to 14 was regulated
 by the Labor Code. In the PDRY, the Labor Code prohibited the employment of chil-
 dren (defined as between 7 and 12 years of age) and regulated that of young persons
 (between 12 and 16 years of age), although these provisions were not rigorously en-
 forced. Currently, apprentice employment of young persons aged 14 and older is per-
 mitted. This minimum age requirement is not enforced, and child labor is common
 throughout Yemen, particularly in rural areas. For the most part, it is sanctioned
 by family tradition, and it is not uncommon to see children working in workshops
 or stores. In the south, child labor often occurs on family, cooperative, and state
 farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There was no established minimum wage in
 the YAR. In the former PDRY, the labor laws set a minimum wage which provided
 a worker a minimal standard of living. The prevailing daily wage for unskilled labor
 in Yemen allows a very modest standard of living for a worker with a family.
 YAK legal codes prescribe a maximum 8-hour workday (6 hours during Ramadan),
 but some workshops operate 10- or 12-hour shifts without penalty. The YAR Labor
 Code does not prescribe the number of workdays, only that the maximum workweek
 consist of 48 hours. There is no provision for a 24-hour rest period. The PDRY Labor
 Code stipulates a 42-hour workweek. Government employees generally work a re-
 duced workweek: 35 hours (6 hours a day, 6 days a week, with a 5-hour day on
 Thursdays). These provisions, however, are not widely enforced in either part of
 Yemen. The Ministry of Labor in the YAR investigated complaints of alleged viola-
 tions and, if found valid, sought restitution from the employer.
 Enforcement of the Labor Code is more prevalent against foreign employers of
 Yemeni workers. One foreign oil company was not permitted to require workers to
 shave; beards are usually forbidden on oil rigs to allow for the use of gas masks
 in the event of a blowout. Safety requirements are sometimes unenforceable because
 foreign companies do not have the freedom to discipline workers. Foreign companies
 have had labor conditions and size of work force unilaterally imposed on them by
 government ministries.
 There is no legislation guaranteeing workers the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment. YAR and
 
 
 1314
 PDRY legal codes did not effectively regulate working conditions and health hazards
 in the workplace, and this remains the case. In the past, the YAR government set
 general safety requirements for larger organizations but only occasionally checked
 compliance. There was legislation regulating conditions of labor in the PDRY, but
 there was no agency for effective enforcement.
