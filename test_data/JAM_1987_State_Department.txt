 JAMAICA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Jamaica is a
 constitutional parliamentary democracy with a mixed economy
 emphasizing the private sector. The Governor General,
 appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister,
 represents the Queen, while the elected Prime Minister, the
 leader of the majority party in Parliament, is the country's
 chief executive. The Parliament is comprised of an elected
 House of Representatives and a Senate, appointed by the
 Governor General, normally with the advice of the Prime
 Minister and the leader of the opposition.
 Two major political parties have alternated in power since the
 first elections were held under universal suffrage in 1944.
 The Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) has held the majority in
 Parliament since 1980. The Constitution requires that
 national elections--last held in December 1983--be called at
 least once every 5 years. The People's National Party (PNP)
 boycotted that election due to a dispute with the JLP over the
 timing of the election. Consequently, the JLP won all 60
 seats in the House of Representatives. The next national
 elections must be held before March 15, 1989.
 The Prime Minister has attempted to compensate, in part, for
 the absence of an elected parliamentary opposition by asking
 the Governor General to appoint independent senators to the
 upper chamber. In nationwide elections for local parish
 councils in 1986, the PNP won a majority, confirmation that
 Jamaican democracy continues to function.
 The small, apolitical security apparatus, directed by the
 Ministry of National Security, consists of the Jamaica
 Constabulary Force (JCF-police), the Jamaica Special
 Constabulary Force (JSCF), and the Jamaica Defence Force
 (JDF). Since 1974 the JDF has been authorized to conduct
 joint operations with the JCF to maintain peace and order
 under the Suppression of Crime Act.
 The Seaga Government took office in 1980 with a mandate to
 implement sweeping economic reforms. It has enacted
 comprehensive tax reform, a major currency devaluation,
 removal of price controls, deregulation of most imports,
 reduction of the public sector work force, and divestment of
 many state enterprises. After a decline in gross domestic
 product in 1985, the economy registered a 2 percent growth
 rate in 1986 and over 5 percent growth rate throughout 1987.
 Tourism, bauxite and alumina production, light manufacturing
 and agriculture are important for the Jamaican economy.
 In 1987 human rights generally were respected in Jamaica.
 Violent crime remains a major social problem, particularly in
 the Kingston area. The police often resort to the use of
 lethal force in dealing with criminals who themselves
 frequently use firearms. Newspaper editorials, Jamaican and
 international human rights advocates, the Parliamentary
 Ombudsman, and the Police Commissioner have consistently
 criticized killings by the police. The Jamaica Council for
 Human Rights estimated that 137 people were killed by the
 police between January and September 1987 under what it found
 to be suspicious circumstances. The excessive use of lethal
 force by the police continues to be one of the country's most
 persistent human rights concerns.

 JAM-AICA-
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1i Respect,for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does not
 occur in Jamaica..However, Jamaica does suffer from a high
 rate ofViolent,-rime, some of;which has political overtones.
 Supporters of bqth-ma-ok parties, ag well as the Communist
 Workers Party.of-Jamaica, occasi-onraly resort to violence to
 advance their political -agenda, to prevent rival- parties- from
 engaging in legitimate political'activities, including voting,
 and to'punish those  believed- to have harmed their party's
 interests. The legal system often has been ineffective in-
 dealing with dases of presumed'political killing because of a
 code of silence adhered to by suspects, victims, and witnesses
 alike and the reluctance of the police to get involved in
 political Aispmtes. .   -
 In the past,. violence, aimed,-at disrupting the political
 process has-reached its peak duying, elections.' Hundreds died
 during the last-contested national eleetions in 1980-, -and -
 three persons were killed'in violende-associated witf the 1986
 local elections:. Cooperation- betwden the major pareies to
 minimize violence made the 1986 lcel blections the most
 peaceful in many years. After the 1986 elections, the - -
 Government formed an independent commi~Hion to investigate
 electoral irregularities. One of the commission's major
 recommendatibns was that the JDF, rather' than the pblice, be
 given resp6nsibility for patrolling areas historically prone
 to political Arlol-erice.  Tha'_UDF i-s )erceived by Jamaicahs as
 best equipped- to  take effective,action in such- areas.
 Talks begun during the 1986 elect-ionS aimed at' defusing-
 tensions between the parties' -Ieadersh i -and between-;JLP:and
 PNP partisans cont-inued in' 1987 ..-Most 'such -meetfgs' were -held
 at the Genral Secretary level and involved other r4tiking
 officials from bothparties. ',A meetingiof-the two party  -
 leaders was scheduled and then called off in July; both sides
 anticipate -eschedurinc the meeti-nj    ,.
 b.. Disappearance:                      -
 There was-no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances perpetrated by the security forces. However,
 the JCF can legally take'individuals into custody without an
 arrest Karrant and occasionally holds individuals. suspected of.
 criminal activities incommunicado -for short peribs. In nearly
 all these cases, the individual is released once relatives or
 associates of the detained person protest.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Section 17 of the Constitution prohibits torture or inhuman or
 degrading punishment or other treatment. Despite this,
 suspected criminals are often beaten or mistreated by police
 while being held in local police stations. In previous years,
 some persons have brought suit successfully against the police
 for unlawful actions, and the Government had to pay damages.
 There were no such suits in 1987.
 
 
 534
 JAMAICA
 Violent police actions, particularly the excessive use of
 lethal force in dealing with suspected criminals, occasionally
 spark impromptu demonstrations, including roadblocks. More
 selective recruitment and better training for the police are
 being stressed, but the pace of reform has been slow.
 Armed commercial guard forces, which have proliferated in
 recent years, have also been the subject of complaints. The
 problem is exacerbated by the fact that guard forces typically
 hire less qualified applicants than do the police and provide
 less training. The Prime Minister announced in July his
 intention to introduce legislation requiring licensing of and
 standardized training for commercial guard forces.
 Lynching of persons suspected of stealing livestock or crops,
 housebreaking, and rape occurs with some frequency.in rural
 Jamaica. Such incidents are often reported in the media, but
 prosecution of vigilantes is rare.
 Prison conditions in Jamaica are substandard, particularly in
 the police station jails. The Parliamentary Ombudsman visited
 many police station jails in 1987 in preparation for a report
 to Parliament and reported on the extremely poor conditions in
 those facilities. Overcrowding, unsanitary conditions,
 inadequate food, and limited medical care for inmates are the
 norm for these detention facilities. According to the
 Ombudsman, conditions in the two maximum security prisons are
 marginally better than in the police station jails, but
 similar problems plague the prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under the Suppression of Crime Act, extended at 6-month
 intervals since its adoption in 1974, security forces do not
 need a warrant to detain persons "reasonably" suspected of
 having committed a crime. Although conceived of as an
 extraordinary measure, security forces rely on the Act
 extensively, and detention of suspects without a warrant
 occurs regularly, particularly in poor neighborhoods. Almost
 all detainees are released without being charged.
 Police must record detentions and are responsible for ensuring
 that detainees appear before a member of the judiciary within
 24 hours of detention. However, there have been instances of
 detainees being held for 2 weeks or longer without being
 brought before a judicial officer. Many detainees are unaware
 of their right to timely judicial review of the grounds for
 their detention. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights
 indicates that 90 percent of its caseload involves assisting
 people attempting to locate and gain the release of detained
 family members. The Council reports that supervisory police
 officers have been more cooperative in recent years in
 providing information about detained persons.
 For suspects charged with a crime, a functioning system of
 bail is available. Bail is set by the local police supervisor
 in minor cases, but a judicial officer sets bail for those
 charged with more serious crimes. Persons unable to make bail
 while waiting for a judicial hearing are often detained for
 long periods. Outsiders are permitted access to the accused.
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica.
 The Constitution does not specifically address the matter of
 forced or compulsory labor. Jamaica is, however, a party to
 
 
 535
 JAMAICA
 the International Labor Organization Convention which prohibits
 compulsory labor. There have been no allegations of this
 practice in Jamaica.   .
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is 'independent. Persons charged with criminal
 offenses have access to legal representation, and legal
 counsel is provided to indigents in criminal cases. The Court
 of Appeal and the Parliament may refer cases to the Judicial
 Committee of the PrivyCouncil in the United Kingdom. The
 legal system is overburdqied and inadequately supported by the
 Government. Some cases take years to come to trial, and
 others have had' to be. dismissed due to. the inability of the
 courts'to locate. case filesw Regular trials are open to fhe
 public. Defendants can present evidence and.challenge'the
 prosecution's-evidence.
 In addition to the regular courts, the Gun Court\was
 established in 1974 as an extraordinary system for dealing
 with violent crime. The Gun Court considers all cases
 involving the illegal use or possession of firearms and
 ammunition. Public attendance is restricted,, and less
 stringent rules of evidence are used.  In capital cases,
 hearings before ]he Gun Court serve as preliminary hearings to
 jury trials under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The
 1983 Gun Court Amendment Act eliminated several of the special
 exceptions to normal judicial rules and procedures which had
 applied to the'Gun Court.'.
 Intimidation of witnesses is a chronic problem hampering
 criminal prosecutions in Jamaica. Jurors also have reported
 receiving threats frpm associates of criminal defendants. The
 Parliamentary Ombudsman repbrted that similar threats and
 intimidation are..irected against witnesses and 3urors in
 criminal cases where the accused is'a policeman. Some
 convictions haye been obtained for-such attempts to subvert
 the judicipl system. .A respected judge who had been active in
 antinarcotics cases was murdeied in November.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the Stat
 into the private life of the individual. Individual rights
 are protected. However, the Suppression of Crime Act permits
 entry without a search warrant into homes or businesses
 believed to be occupied by persons."reasonably" suspected of
 having committed g-crime. This authority is sometimes abused
 by the pblice, especially in poor neighborhoods. Regulations
 approved by Parliament in 1980 require that every effort be
 made by security forces to have the owner or occupant of the
 premises present during any search.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are provided for by the
 Constitution and are observed in practice within the broad
 limits of libel laws and the State Secrets Act. Jamaica's
 principal privately owned newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, has
 been critical of Jamaican governments through the years.
 Several smaller circulation newspapers and magazines are also
 published. Foreign publications are widely available. The
 
 
 586
 JAMAICA
 government-owned and -operated Jamaica Broadcasting Company
 (JBC) includes two radio stations and the island's only
 television channel. JBC has typically been accused of bias in
 favor of the Government by whichever party is in opposition.
 The only other broadcasting company is privately owned Radio
 Jamaica (RJR). Although the Government has an equity holding
 in RJR, the company is independent and its broadcasts are
 often critical of government policies.
 In July Prime Minister Seaga announced that the Government
 would sell its RJR stocks and would offer new licenses for
 additional commercial, religious, and public broadcasting
 radio stations. Further, three licenses for television
 stations would be offered--one commercial station, one
 religious, and one public broadcasting station. It is
 anticipated that the public broadcasting station will be
 formed from the existing JBC-TV. There is no censorship or
 interference in academic studies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Large numbers and varieties of professional
 groups; private business, service, social, and cultural
 associations; and trade unions function freely.
 Public rallies are staged by all political parties. Such
 events require a police permit, which is normally granted.
 The opposition PNP and the ruling JLP held rallies and
 meetings throughout the island during 1987.
 Workers and employers enjoy the freedom to establish and
 direct trade and labor organizations. Although it is not
 required, such oganizations generally apply for r~gistration
 with the Ministry of Labour. The Ministry of Labour's trade
 union roster now lists 78 active groups including several
 employer organizations. The Labor Relations and Industrial
 Disputes Act (LRIDA) of 1975 codifies iegulations on workers'
 rights. Union members draft or redraft organizational
 constitutions and rules, elect officers, determine objectives
 and affiliate with national or international umbrella
 groupings, select delegatesto conferences, and freely perform
 other functions. Most unions have joined democratic
 international trade secretariats, the Caribbean Congress of
 Labour, and the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The Christian-Democratic Workers Confederation of
 Labor has attracted one Jamaican adherent, and two small
 unions are affiliated with the Communist World Federation of
 Trade Unions. Labor and management groups select their own
 delegates to tripartite meetings of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO).
 By law, union affiliation may not be a prerequisite for
 employment. Labor, management, and government are committed
 by law and in fact to collective bargaining in contract
 negotiations. When labor and management fail to reach an
 agreement, cases may be referred to the Ministry of Labour for
 adjudication. The Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT) forms
 the first appeal level, and, if necessary, cases then pass to
 the civil courts. Unions protested a 1986 LRIDA change that
 allows the Minister of Labour unilaterally to refer cases
 involving the national interest to the IDT. Opposition PNP
 president Michael Manley has promised to remove the provision
 if elected.

 JAMAICA
 The right to strike is neither endorsed nor forbidden by law;
 Jamaican uni6ns and workers do strike. Striking workers are
 immune to griminal liability but cannot be certain of
 retainifig their jobs.
 Jamaican unions have enrolled about 25 percent of the work
 force, and the two largest unions have direct organizational
 and leadership ties to the two major 'olitical parties--the
 Bustamante Industrial Trade Union is affiliated with the
 ruling JLP, while the National Workers uhion is affiliated
 with the PNP . Both unions maintain their independence and
 sometimes take positions in opposition to their respective
 parties; A third, smaller union, the University and Allied
 Workers Union .is 'ffillated witi the Communist Workers Party
 of Jamaica afid'mirrors its policies.
 Labor laws apply to'the three export free trade zones as well
 as to domestic industries. Government officials have cited a
 need for more compliance verification in the free zones but
 have stated their belief that most employers obey legal
 requirements. Only 2 of the'18. factories in the Kingston Free
 Zone (KFZ) have union representation, and unions have alleged
 that employers in the Zone have colluded to.obstruct
 unionization bf the work force. Workers in some KFZ plants
 conducted'phort work stoppages in 1987 to protest conditions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religi6n is guaranteedby the Constitution and is
 well established in Jamica. More than 80 percent of the
 populatign belong'to varibus Christian denominations, and
 religious groups of all kinds operate freely. Evangelical
 Christian movemhents have gained a significant following in
 recent years, and foreign evangelists visit Jamaica and
 proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The Constituti6n provides for freedom of movement, the right
 to reside wherever'they choose, 'and immunity to expulsion from
 the country. -There are no restrictions on foreign travel or
 emigration. Citizeiship is not revoked for political reasons.
 Jamaica does not have a declared general policy on refugees,
 in part because'.so.few persons apply for that status. Those
 who apply are haidled on a case-by-case basis. The country
 does not often ,c~epE asylum seekers, primarily for domestic
 economic reasons. Jdpaica ig j party to the U.N. Convention
 and Protoc6l Relating to the Status of Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect ior'Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Prime Minister and his Cabinet exercise executive power.
 The executive usually takes the initiative in legislative
 matters and is responsible to the House of Representatives.
 The Constitutionhkequires that an election be held not later
 than 5 years after the first sitting of the preceding
 Parliabent; but thePrime Minister can call national elections
 anytime within that period. The Government has thus far
 resisted calls for new elections much before the expiration of
 its term xn: 1989..
 
 
 538
 JAMAICA
 'In 1986 nationwide local elections were held to fill parish
 council seats. In these hotly contested elections, the PNP
 receiLved 57 percent of the overall vote and gained control of
 12 of the 13 parish councils.
 In response to allegations of irregularities during the 1986
 elections, Prime Minister Seaga appointed an independent
 commission to investigate. In its report, made public in
 September, the commission found that gangs of armed party
 supporters linked to both major parties were active in parts
 of Kingston and neighboring St. Catherine during the election.
 These gangs intimidated voters and sometimes forged voters to
 cast their ballots in open view. The commission also reported
 instances of ballot box-stuffing and theft. It recommended
 that the security forces be deployed during future elections
 to historically troubled areas in numbers sufficient to
 prevent intimidation and fraud.
 Beginning ii January 1987, the PNP held a series of rallies
 around Jamaica to press a demand for an immediate general
 election. The PNP at first threatened a campaign of civil
 disobedience if its demand was not met, but it later dropped
 this threat. These PNP rallies took place in an open and free
 atmosphere, and neither the Government nor the security forces
 impeded the rallies. The JLP also conducted its own series of
 rallies around the country in 1987.
 The widespread political activity in 1987 in anticipation of
 parliamentary elections by early 1989, combined with the
 comparatively peaceful 1986 local elections, clearly
 demonstrated that the democratic tradition remains strong in
 Jamaica, despite the anomalous situation caused by the current
 one-party Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding   International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in
 Jamaica. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights (JCHR), the
 only local human rights organization, has vigorously protested
 abuses by the police and has called for police reform. The
 JCHR protests alleged abuses to the police and judiciary on a
 case-by-case basis and did not issue any official reports in
 1987. The JCHR has reported informally, however, that 137
 people were killed by police between January-and September
 1987 under what it found to be suspicious circumstances.
 Americas Watch visited Jamaica in 1986, and subsequently
 issued a report which claimed that the police engaged in a
 practice of summary executions of criminal suspects, killing
 more than 200 persons in each of the last 7 years. The report
 alleged that victims sometimes included bystanders and
 individuals involved in personal grudges with policemen.
 No foreign human rights groups visited Jamaica in 1987.
 The JCF Commissioner and the Minister of National Security are
 acting to improve significantly the professionalism and
 discipline of the JCF. A senior JCF Commissioner was assigned
 to improve respect for human rights by the police. In 1987
 over 70 Jamaican policemen received specialized training in
 criminal investigative techniques. The training courses had
 segments stressing the importance of good community relations
 and human rights. Credible sources-indicated that following
 the release of the Americas Watch report, incidences of police
 
 
 539
 JAMAICA
 killings and beatings dropped substantially for about 3
 months, but that such occurrences were again on the upswing in
 1987.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Jamaican women are accorded-full equality under the
 Constitution, and the 1975 Employment Act guarantees them
 equal pay for equal work. Women hold influential positions in
 the Civil Service and in the Government. Nevertheless, because
 of cultural and social values, women often suffer economic
 discriminationr frequently evidenced in hiring practices.
 Access to-higher paying jobs outside traditionally female-
 dominated sectors is limited, particularly in the private
 sector. The 1975 Act helped narrow the gap between men's and
 women~s salaries, but disparities remain.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Juvenile Act provides that no child under age 12 shall be
 employedexcept by parents or guardians. Such employment can
 only be in domestic, agricultural, or horticultural work.
 Children under age 12 may not be employed at night or at any
 industrial site. Despite the laws.on child.labor, children
 under l-.Aara'often seen peddling gooda and services on the
 streets.-There is -no evidence of..widespread illegal
 employment~of chldgen in ,ther sectorp of the economy.
 Under the .aqtvies Act, 4.1 pl-ant. ,must be registered and
 approved by the Ministry of Labour before they can begin
 operations. The Ministry's Industrial Safety Division is
 required to make yearly inspections of- all facilities. In
 practice, because of budget constraints, these site
 inspec~tops often .re not performed. The Ministry has. no
 authority tooveYsee private-sector work sites and other
 places-of-.,eployment which do not meet the statutory
 defintion. of a factory..- Otherilaws establish minimum
 standa-ds-tor working conditions.,  - -
 The Government-established a minimum wage of Jamaican $80
 (approximately US-$14.J5) a week-in 1985. Payment of-that
 rate appears tp be enforced, and it is adequate to. support
 minimum food and shelter needs. Legislation in 1985 also
 established a standard workweek of 42 hours, which appears to
 be enforced.
