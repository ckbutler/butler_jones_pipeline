 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau is a one-party state with former
 or present military leaders in key positions. General Joao
 Bernardo Vieira serves as President of the Council of State and
 Head of State, Commander-in-Chief, and General Secretary of
 Guinea-Bissau's previously sole legal political party, the
 African party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape
 Verde (PAIGC). In elections held in June 1989, Vieira, the
 only candidate, was elected for a second 5-year term as
 President. Effective power and day-to-day decisions rest in
 the hands of the President and the Council of State. However,
 there have been growing pressures for political reform, many of
 them emanating from within the PAIGC. In 1991 President Vieira
 and the PAIGC again reaffirmed that the political structure of
 the country was to be changed to a presidentially based,
 multiparty system by early 1993.
 The armed forces (FARP) are responsible for state security,
 both external and internal. FARP leaders are usually members
 of the PAIGC and often hold key positions in the Political
 Bureau or Central Committee. The police were responsible for
 human rights abuses in 1991. Persons accused of political
 crimes are tried by military tribunals.
 Guinea-Bissau's population of 1 million is engaged largely in
 subsistence agriculture. There are-some exports of fish and
 seafood and small amounts of peanuts. The Government's
 postindependence efforts to exercise central control over the
 economy failed to stimulate agricultural production and
 resulted in chronic shortages of most basic commodities,
 inefficient state-owned enterprises, high unemployment, and a
 weak national currency. In 1991 the economy remained extremely
 fragile, despite a series of austerity reforms launched in the
 late 1980's to promote long-term economic growth.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in 1991, as the Government
 and party carefully controlled the reform process. It passed
 potentially important legislation governing new parties, the
 press, and labor, but it cracked down, through detentions,
 physical mistreatment, and other forms of serious harassment,
 on political opponents and nascent groups that attempted to
 move quickly toward a multiparty system. By the end of the
 year, three new opposition-,political parties had attained legal
 status, ending a long midyear period of government inertia on
 the legalization of the opposition. A group of 121 of the
 PAIGC's younger, more reformist members called publicly upon
 the President to recommit himself to the transition and to
 multipartyism.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or extrajudicial killings,
 nor any reports of deaths of persons in official custody.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases .of disappearance.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment, and a
 recent revision also makes evidence obtained through torture or
 other coercion invalid. However, security authorities employ
 abusive interrogation methods, especially severe beatings. In
 September the police beat four members of a nascent political
 party while they were in police custody (see Section 2.b.).
 There have been no known cases of police officers or security
 officials being disciplined for such actions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests in Guinea-Bissau are frequently arbitrary, as arrest
 procedures are undefined, and the use of arrest warrants is the
 exception rather than the rule. The legal system, inherited
 from the Portuguese but modified by the Constitution, includes
 important procedural rights, such as the right to counsel, but
 generally fails to provide adequate safeguards against
 arbitrary or illegal arrest and detention. Bail procedures are
 also observed-erratically.
 The Government frequently holds persons without charge or
 trial, sometimes for extended periods of time, including in
 incommunicado detention. The security services continue to
 have the power administratively to detain suspects without
 reference to judicial authority, often through the device of
 house arrest. The.Government used its detention powers in 1991
 to arrest andhold ,for several hours six members of a
 prospective new political party for alleged illegal
 demonstrations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and many
 urban dwellers, continue to bring judicial disputes to
 recognized traditional counselors. With some exceptions, the
 official judicial system is based on thePortuguese model.
 Intervals between arrest and trial are often lengthy. Defense
 lawyers traditionally have been court appointed. Private legal
 practice became permissible only in 1990*
 The military dominates the handling ofpolitical and security
 cases. Trials involving state security usually are not open to
 outside observers and are conducted by military tribunals.
 Armed forces members are tried by military courts for all
 offenses. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for
 both civilian and military cases, except those involving
 national security matters. In this instance the Council of
 State reviews all decisions.
 The Government maintains that there are no political.detainees
 or prisoners held since the- release in 199G of 22 prisoners
 convicted-of involvement in a 1985 coup plot. There are
 credible reports, however, that .five persons classifiablet as
 political prisoners are restricted to living in the Bijagos
 Islands and- are permitted visits only by family members.
 f- Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Hom, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional guarantees of the inviolability of domicile,
 person, and correspondence, are not always respected in cases of
 serious crimes or state security. International and domestic
 
 
 170
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 mail may be subject to surveillance and censorship. While
 membership in the PAIGC was never forced, persons with
 political aspirations traditionally have realized the
 importance of belonging to what was long Guinea-Bissau's sole
 legal political party, and most government appointments in the
 past have gone to party members.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of intellectual,
 artistic, and scientific expression, with the significant
 exception of cases in which these rights are exercised in a
 manner "contrary to the promotion of social progress." In
 practice, these freedoms are restricted. The Government
 controls all information media and tends to view the press as a
 vehicle for the expression of government views. Journalists
 traditionally are government employees and practice
 self-censorship to maintain their positions. Criticism of
 certain officials or government offices appears from time to
 time in the local news, but typically only when aimed at
 persons who are already known to have lost the President's
 support.
 In the 1991 revisions to the Constitution, an article was added
 that for the first time specifically provided for freedom of
 the press and established a National Council of Social
 Communications to oversee fair access to the electronic and
 print media. While a new press law enacted late in the year
 requires government media to reflect the full range of public
 opinion without favor to-any group, it is too early to know how
 effective the law will prove in practice. By year's end, newly
 legalized parties were granted 10 minutes of television airtime
 per month and were being covered by radio news.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association and government approval is not required for
 peaceful, nonpolitical assemblies and demonstrations,
 heretofore, all existing organizations have been linked to the
 Government or the party. This situation changed significantly
 during 1991, however, with the formation of numerous political
 and nonpolitical organizations having no ties to the PAIGC.
 Over a dozen groups attempted to gain legal status as political
 parties, and at least five conducted effective nationwide
 campaigns to gather the necessary petition signatures.
 Newly emerging opposition political parties faced a number of
 obstacles in complying with the prescribed legalization
 procedures, including a complex and difficult system for
 obtaining valid signatures on-the required petition.
 Additionally, police and security forces harassed and
 intimidated potential petition signers, using inter alia,
 detentions and physical mistreatment. During the year,
 therefore, the Government's position remained ambiguous: the
 groups had to canvas to gather signatures and then apply for
 legalization by registering the list of their members with the
 Supreme Court; until they attained that legal status, however,
 they were not "parties" as such and could not properly organize
 and publicly campaign to attract members. Nevertheless, three
 parties managed to gain legal status, all in the last 3 weeks
 of the year.' Once legal, parties-experienced no difficulties
 with the authorities over demonstrations.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is provided for in the Constitution and has
 been respected in practice. Christians, Muslims, and animists
 worship freely, and proselytizing is permitted. However,
 religious groups must be licensed by the Government. In 1991
 there were no reports of groups being refused licenses.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are allowed to move freely throughout Guinea-Bissau.
 Foreign travel is not restricted, nor is citizenship revoked
 for political reasons. Over the past three decades a-
 considerable number of persons have emigrated for economic
 reasons.
 During late 1990 and early 1991, up to 6,000 Senegalese
 refugees fled into northern Guinea-Bissau to escape the
 separatist disturbances in the Casamance region of southern
 Senegal. The'Government worked with various international
 donors, including the United-States, to'provide for the basic
 health and nutritional needs of the refugdes. No pressure was
 placed on refugees to return to Senegal and at year's end the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported almost 5,000 still
 in Guinea-Bissau, most of them indicating that they intended to
 remain indefinitely.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens did not have this right in 1991. The PAIGC and'
 military elite, headed by President Joao Bernardo Vieira,
 continued to control all political activity, including the pace
 of reform. However, constitutional revisions in 1991 deleted
 all reference to the PAIGC's dominant role and allowed for new
 parties, so long as they do not have an ethnic, regional, or
 religious orientation. Although public -expectations of
 political liberalization outpaced actual reforms during much of
 1991, progress toward democratization was madb.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation-of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A nonpartisan human rights group without government or
 political ties was formed in 1991. This group, the Guinean
 Human Rights League, has made low-key criticisms of the
 Government, calling for penal reform and abolition of the death
 penalty.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While officially prohibited, discrimination against women
 persists within certain ethnic groups, especially the Fulas and
 Mandinkas of the north and east where female circumcision is
 still a widespread practice, despite official prohibition.
 Women enjoy higher status in the societies of the Balanta,
 Papel, and Bijagos groups, who live mainly in the southern
 coastal region. Women are responsible for much of the work on
 subsistence farms, and they have limited access to education,
 especially in rural areas. According to a recent U.N. study,
 females in Guinea-Bissau receive only one-third the schooling
 of males. While there are some high-ranking women in the
 
 
 172
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Government and a ministry for the advancement of women exists,
 authority remains overwhelmingly in the hands of men.
 Physical violence, including wife beating, is an accepted means
 of settling domestic disputes among all ethnic groups. While
 police will intervene in domestic disputes if requested, the
 Government has not undertaken specific measures to raise the
 public consciousness of women or to reduce violence against
 them. It has undertaken educational campaigns against the
 practice of female circumcision, but the practice persists
 among certain ethnic groups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 In 1991 the Constitution was revised specifically to grant the
 freedom to form independent trade unions, and the Government
 had prepared, though still not enacted at year's end, enabling
 legislation to enumerate the rights and obligations of new
 unions. While the Constitution provides for freedom of
 association, in practice only one trade union confederation,
 the National Union of Workers of Guinea-Bissau (UNTG), exists
 in Guinea-Bissau. With strong ties to the PAIGC, the UNTG more
 closely resembles a mass party organization than an independent
 union, and it has been neither aggressive nor effective in
 promoting worker rights.
 The new Constitution of 1991 includes an article which
 recognizes the right to strike and prohibits lock-outs. In the
 past, strikes have occurred only on rare occasions, and the
 public's perception has been that strikes, like antigovernment
 meetings, would not be tolerated. In 1991, however, a nearly
 nationwide teachers' strike lasted for a number of weeks and
 resulted in negotiations between the Government and teachers'
 representatives. Also, capital city taxi drivers organized
 several short-term work stoppages to protest poor road
 maintenance and high fuel prices. In neither of these two
 cases did the Government take any repressive actions against
 the strikers.
 The UNTG is affiliated with the Communist-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions. The new labor law provides that
 unions will have the right to freely affiliate with
 international labor organizations of their choice, but until
 independent unions are formed the practical effect of this
 provision is unknown.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Guinea-Bissau's small manufacturing sector employs fewer than
 5,000 persons, and almost half of the estimated 28,000 salaried
 workers are government employees. The scarcity of salaried
 jobs has forced employees to focus on obtaining and keeping
 employment rather than on organizing and bargaining. Public
 employees are permitted to join the UNTG, but its activities
 have not emphasized organizing employees (whether private or
 public) for the purpose of collective bargaining, and the
 Government dominates the bargaining process. The Constitution,
 even as revised in 1991, does not provide for or protect the
 right to bargain collectively. There are no export processing
 zones in Guinea-Bissau.
 The International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts has
 noted for several years that the Government's provision for the
 
 
 173
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 protection of workers against antiunion discrimination does not
 appear to be accompanied by penal sanctions against employers
 and that the General Labor Act of 1986 is not applicable
 toworkers in the public service.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or-compulsory labor is not permitted by law and is not
 known to exist.
 d.' Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The General Labor Act of 1986 established a minimum age of 14
 for general factory labor and of 18 for heavy or danqerous
 labor, including all labor in mines. These minimum age
 requirements are generally followed in the small wage sector,
 but there is minimal enforcement by the Ministry of
 Administrative Reform, Civil Service, and Labor. Children in
 rural communities do domestic and field work for no pay. The
 Government does not attempt to discourage this practice and, in
 fact, delays the opening of schools until the rice harvesting
 season has ended.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Even in the small wage sector, labor laws are unevenly enforced
 due primarily to the extreme economic underdevelopment of the
 country. However, there 'are government regulations governing
 such matters as.ijob-related disabilities and vacation rights.
 The maximum number of hours permitted in a normal workweek is
 45 hours. Although not consistently enforced, a minimum wage
 is mandated by the Ministry of Civil Service for government �
 employees. The wage is inadequate to maintain even a minimum
 standard of living, and workers must supplement their income
 through reliance on the extended family and subsistence
 agriculture. Existing legal, health, and safety standards for
 workers are not enforced by the Ministry of Administrative
 Reform, Civil Service, and Labor in a uniform or comprehensive
 manner.
