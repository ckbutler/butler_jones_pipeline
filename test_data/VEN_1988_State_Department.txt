 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic
 system, free press, strong unions, and a longstanding
 commitment to democracy. For the past 30 years, power has
 passed peacefully between the two major political parties
 through open elections.
 The Venezuelan law enforcement community is ill equipped to
 cope with contemporary problems. The system suffers from
 jurisdictional overlap and lack of coordination. Congress has
 on occasion considered consolidating all law enforcement
 agencies into a national police force, but has rejected
 reorganization for fear of putting too much power into too few
 hands.
 Venezuela has a mixed economy, dominated by the. public
 sector. The state-owned petroleum industry currently accounts
 for some 17 percent of the gross domestic product, more than
 any other industry. Current economic problems have resulted
 from declining petroleum revenues,.a large foreign debt, and.--
 high government expenditures, which include debt service.
 The principal human rights concerns in Venezuela are
 weaknesses, including allegations of corruption, in the
 country's archaic judicial system which often result in
 prolonged pretrial imprisonment and numerous allegations of
 abuse of detainees. Reports by Amnesty International (AI)
 refer to occasional incidents of police brutality resulting in
 injury or death.
 There were no major changes in 1988 in Venezuela's good human
 rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Authorities do not engage in or condone unlawful or arbitrary
 killing for political motives, and there were no reports of
 such killings. There have been instances of police and
 security forces shooting and killing criminal suspects, and of
 arrested persons dying while in police custody. Perpetrators
 of illegal killings can be charged with a crime and prosecuted
 in the courts, but there were no such actions in 1988. In its
 1988 report, covering 1987, Al stated that there were reports
 of killings by police "in circumstances that strongly suggest
 they were extrajudicial executions."
 In October security forces killed 14 civilians near the
 Colombian border. The security forces claim the unit involved
 mistook the civilians for Colombian guerrillas. There are
 charges that the Government is trying to cover up the
 incident. Several independent investigations of the event are
 now under way.
 b. Disappearance
 Police authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest, or hold
 people in clandestine confinement. There were no reports of
 such incidents.

 VENEZUELA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. Constitutional provisions for
 the integrity of the individual are generally enforced.
 However, AI reported that two military recruits died as a
 result of punishment inflicted after they were caught trying
 to leave their military training school. There was no public
 announcement of any investigation.
 Allegations of physical abuse of detainees remain common.
 These infractions are usually attributed to excesses on the
 part of law enforcement officials or inadequate supervision of
 prison guards. Spartan prison conditions are exacerbated by
 serious--overcrowding. Sanitation and health care are
 inadequate, as is the diet unless supplemented by donations
 from friends and family. Discipline within prisons is
 sometimes inadequate, and violence by guards against the
 prisoners and among the prisoners themselves is especially
 common in the more crowded prisons. Official personnel
 responsible for such violence are not known to be punished.
 The low educational level and limited training of many prison
 guards are contributing factors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The right to judicial determination of the legality of
 detention is provided for by -law. Arrested persons or persons
 under preventive detention legally can be held for up to 8
 days without a formal detention order, during which time they
 may be held incommunicado. Arbitrary arrests and arrests with
 improper warrants are common, and the time limits for holding
 persons are frequently exceeded, usually because of
 inefficiencies in the legal system. In January the Government
 enacted a law which increased the power of judges to redress
 abuses by, among other measures, ordering the release of
 someone unjustly imprisoned. This law has proven particularly
 effective in enforcing the 8-day limit in which an arrestee
 must be formally charged or set free. Elements of the
 Catholic Church have publicized allegations of frequent and
 arbitrary roundups by the police in poor neighborhoods under
 vagrancy laws. AI claims that hundreds of people rounded up
 in such a manner were sent to 'work colonies" in the
 Venezuelan jungle. The most prominent prison camp is at El
 Dorado in Bolivar state.
 Undocumented aliens are frequently held incommunicado and then
 deported without legal proceedings. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is provided for by law, and there exist a number of
 procedural safeguards. However, once an arrestee is formally
 charged, the burden of proof is on the accused to prove his or
 her innocence, and lengthy pretrial detention is the norm.
 The law provides public defenders for those unable to afford
 competent defense; however, the number of public defenders in
 the entire country (350) is insufficient to meet this
 obligation. According to Ministry of Justice officials, only
 approximately 28 percent of the 30,000 persons in prison have
 been convicted. The same judicial authorities attribute such
 a backlog to an insufficient number of qualified judges,
 automatic review of all lower court decisions by higher courts
 unable to limit their dockets, and failure to enforce
 
 
 726
 VENEZUELA
 procedural deadlines at each stage of the legal process.
 Delays of 2 or 3 years in a normal case are not infrequent.
 Bail is only permitted for relatively minor crimes. Prisoners
 are commonly released before a final decision is reached after
 having served more time than they would have served if
 convicted. To cite a particularly egregious example, in May a
 prisoner was released after spending 16 years in prison for a
 crime of which he was never convicted. The extraordinarily
 slow pace of justice appears to be primarily a product of the
 system's complexity and the formality of criminal trial
 procedures. The judicial process is almost exclusively a
 written one, requiring costly and time-consuming production of
 voluminous reports by judges, attorneys, and witnesses at
 every stage.
 Venezuelan leaders and legal experts attribute delays and
 irregularities to corruption and the use of personal
 influence. In a celebrated case, a judge is now in prison for
 accepting a bribe to order the release of drug traffickers on
 dubious technical grounds. The civilian judiciary is legally
 independent, but connections to the two major political
 parties are important in the judicial selection process. The
 nine members of the Judicial Council, an independent body
 responsible for the nomination, training, and discipline of
 judges, are selected by Congress, the President, and the
 Supreme Court. In order to decrease political influence on
 the judiciary, the President signed into law in October a
 reform intended to make it impossible for a single party to
 impose its nominees on the Judicial Council.
 Civilians charged with armed subversion are tried by military
 courts. Such persons are considered insurgents by the
 Government. There is no statutory time limit on military
 adjudication of their cases, although prisoners of the
 military justice system have the same right to appeal to the
 Supreme Court as do ordinary prisoners. Military judges are
 appointed by the Supreme Court. In keeping with the
 Government's longstanding policy of integrating former
 guerrillas into the political.system, in September President
 Lusinchi pardoned a top guerrilla commander, Gabriel Puerta,
 who immediately announced his congressional candidacy.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution and law provide safeguards against arbitrary
 interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 These safeguards are honored in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Venezuela has a free and lively press which frequently
 criticizes the Government and denounces any instances of
 government interference in the media. The Inter-American
 Press Association (IAPA) states that "press freedom exists in
 Venezuela." However, several respected journalists have
 complained to the IAPA that they have been urged by the
 Government to exercise self-censorship and are occasionally
 pressured to avoid reporting on sensitive subjects. In some
 cases, journalists contend that government pressure on their
 employers has resulted in dismissals or lack of media access
 to government officials. Venezuela has 4 nationwide
 television networks, two of which are government owned, 3
 
 
 727
 VENEZUELA
 regional television stations, 168 radio stations, and numerous
 newspapers and magazines, with 9 thriving dailies in Caracas
 alone. The Government currently subsidizes newsprint,
 consumption through preferential exchange controls and is a
 source of advertising revenue for the media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is respected.
 Public meetings, including those of all political parties, are
 held without interference. In the interest of public safety,
 permits are required for public marches. Even violent marches
 are usually met with some restraint by the police, as when
 students rampaged through several cities in February and
 November. Professional and academic associations operatA-
 without interference. Most have ties to political parties.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is predominately Roman Catholic, although other
 religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and proselytize
 actively. Foreign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant,
 are active throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents generally have freedom to travel
 within the country and to go abroad and return. Travel in the
 Amazon military zone is an exception and requires a special
 permit due to security reasons. Venezuelans may emigrate if
 their tax obligations have been met. Citizenship can be
 renounced. Recovery of nationality requires a residence
 period of 2 years for Venezuelan-born repatriates. The
 Constitution provides for revocation of citizenship for
 naturalized citizens on specific and limited legal grounds.
 Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, exiles,
 and displaced persons from many European and Latin American
 countries. Refugees are given normal residence status and may
 be expelled only for criminal activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is freely elected by secret ballot. Venezuela
 is a multiparty democracy, with mandatory suffrage for all
 those 18 years of age or older, and the political process is
 open to all. In the 1988 elections over two dozen parties
 participated. Carlos Andres Perez of the Accion Democratica
 party won the December 4 presidential balloting with almost 55
 percent of the popular vote in an election considered to be
 free and fair. His party received 97 of 201 seats in the
 House of Deputies (where representation is shared with 10
 other parties) and 21 of 46 seats in the Senate (where 3 other
 parties are also represented.  A reform measure enacted
 during the summer established the direct election of governors
 for the first time in Venezuelan history.
 Views are freely expressed, and persons from the entire
 political spectrum contend for positions ranging from
 municipal council seats to the presidency. Minor parties won
 
 
 728
 VENEZUELA
 18 percent of the seats in the national legislature in
 December's elections; some of these parties are outgrowths of
 former guerrilla organizations. The two major parties are the
 centrist Social Democrats and Social Christians. They both
 support the participation of minority parties in the political
 process, a reflection of the widespread desire to have radical
 elements join the political process rather than engage in
 armed insurrection.
 Women continue to be underrepresented in the political sector,
 but are increasingly active in all political parties, public
 administration, and the judiciary. Two cabinet ministers are
 women, as are 13 of 200 federal deputies. A woman ran for
 president for the first time in the December 1988 election.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Al, the Latin American Foundation for Human Rights and Social
 Development, and the Federation of Families of Disappeared
 Persons have offices in Caracas, and human rights
 organizations are able to operate free of government
 restriction. In December 1987, AI sent a delegation to
 Venezuela to discuss human rights with the Government. The
 delegation recommended more attention be given to safeguards
 for police suspects, better access to legal defense, and more
 effective remedies for victims of abuse. Venezuela is a vocal
 critic of governments that commit or tolerate widespread human
 rights violations and supports international human rights
 organizations. The Caracas-based Foundation for Human Rights
 in Venezuela and Latin America was established in 1988.
 Venezuela is a member of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence that economic and social needs and
 cultural aspirations are denied on a discriminatory basis to
 any portion of the population.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,
 and accords women and children "special protection" in the
 workplace. Women workers receive extensive maternity leave
 benefits, and laws limit their involuntary overtime. Women
 are heavily represented in many of the professions, but
 significant differences still exist between men and women in
 wage and employment opportunities.
 Restrictions on property rights based on sex, religion, or
 social status do not exist, but there are some restrictions on
 ownership of business property and employment based on
 nationality.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Both Venezuela's Constitution and its 1936 labor law, as
 revised in 1976, recognize unions' right to exist and workers'
 right to strike. The legal definitions of these rights, the
 Government's enforcement mechanisms, and the prevailing
 political climate permit unions to function freely and
 effectively. About 25 percent of the work force belongs to
 
 
 729
 VENEZUELA
 unions, and organized labor is widely considered to have
 substantial economic and political influence. The
 Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV), which is by far the
 largest labor organization in Venezuela, frequently
 demonstrates its independence from the Government and
 political parties. During 1988 CTV leaders strongly
 criticized the President of Venezuela, although the majority
 of those leaders and the President belong to the same
 political party. The CTV is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and its leaders regularly
 travel to International Labor Organization conferences.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor law specifically states that workers will be free
 from all "interferences, prohibitions, subordinations, and
 coercions" in the exercise of their rights to form unions and
 elect officials. The same legislation proclaims that it is
 the duty of unions to represent their members in negotiations
 for a collective contract, and it also protects employees who
 engage in union activities from reprisals by employers.
 Venezuelan law encourages collective bargaining, which is
 widely practiced. There are no enclaves, such as export
 processing zones, in which workers' legal rights are
 restricted.
 Labor law is enforced by Ministry of Labor inspectors,
 tripartite (labor-management-government) commissions (which
 hear complaints regarding firings), and labor courts.
 Although the latter are overburdened and slow, the overall
 system is generally regarded as effective in protecting
 workers' rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor; unremunerated labor is
 prohibited by law.
 d; Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Venezuelan law prohibits: employment of children under age
 14; a work day of more than 6 hours for 14- and 15-year olds;
 and night work or employment at hazardous tasks for those
 under 18. This legislation is much more difficult to enforce
 in the informal sector than in the formal sector, and there
 has been some media attention to the need for stricter and
 -more widespread enforcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 At the free market exchange rate prevailing in September 1988,
 the minimum salary for urban workers was about $70 monthly.
 This does not include mandatory fringe benefits that vary with
 the worker's individual circumstances. Some Venezuelan
 leaders have recently stated that the local currency is
 undervalued in the free market by 50-75 percent. According to
 labor leaders, 40,000 union members, representing 30 percent
 of the entire organized labor force, earn the minimum wage.
 Agricultural workers are subject to a lower minimum
 wage--about $53 monthly at the September 1988 free market rate.
 These figures reflect a considerable deterioration in real
 wages during the past few years, coinciding with a drop in the
 price of Venezuela's chief export, petroleum. Observers
 generally agreed that workers are suffering hardships, but no
 consensus has emerged on how to improve the situation.
 
 
 730
 VENEZUELA
 By law, the workweek for blue-collar workers may not exceed 48
 hours plus 2 hours daily overtime. White-collar workers are
 subject to a 44-hour workweek. Some unions, such as the
 petroleum workers, have negotiated a 40-hour week. The law is
 generally observed, with the exception of restrictions on
 overtime. Paid holidays and weekly rest days are also
 provided for by law.
 A health and safety law was passed in 1986, and the process of
 developing standards and administering them is under way.
 Opinions regarding its effectiveness vary. Some businessmen
 regard the penal sanctions of this law for cases of negligence
 resulting in injury as too harsh, and some labor leaders
 believe that efforts to improve working conditions are
 proceeding too slowly.
