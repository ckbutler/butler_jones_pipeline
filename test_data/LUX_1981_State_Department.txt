 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional
 monarchy. Although occupied by foreign powers in the past,
 Luxembourgers have always maintained their individualism and
 spirit of independence. Thus, Luxembourg's leaders, many of
 whom still carry the psychological scars of detention during
 the Nazi occupation, are determined to ensure that human rights
 are respected in Luxembourg and to work actively to promote
 respect for human rights worldwide. Despite the worsening
 economic circumstances and increased unemployment, Luxembourg
 continues its efforts to treat women equally and its large
 foreign population fairly.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law (penal code, chapter 4, article
 438, and November 4, 1950 International Convention Safeguarding
 the Rights of Men and Fundamental Liberties) and is not
 practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Treatment of prisoners is exemplary. Prisoners have free
 choice of attorneys and are allowed visitors. A new modern
 prison is scheduled to open in'.1982.
 c. Disappearances
 Official abduction or secret arrest do not occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment:
 There are no prisoners in Luxembourg who are being detained in
 disregard of generally accepted principles. Habeas corpus
 exists and is respected. The law permits one detention without
 charge for up to 24 hours following arrest.
 e. Denial of Failr Public Trial
 Luxembourg has an independent judiciary. Defendants have the
 right to legal counsel. Charges are formally and clearly
 stated. There is the right of appeal.
 f. 'nvasion of the Home
 Police must have warrants, issued by the judiciary, to enter a
 private home. No forced entry has been alleged. Luxembourg's
 statutes prohibit other violations of the home such as bugging,
 demolition or sealing doors and windows.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press, religion
 and assembly (articles 19, 20 and 24). Except for restrictions
 against pornography, there is no media censorship. There is
 neither intimidation nor threats by the government against
 individuals or media organs criticizing it, and the government
 does not interfere with academic inquiry. There are no
 limitations on orderly public meetings. No groups are denied
 or restricted free assembly. Unions have the right to
 organize, negotiate and strike, although by tradition strikes
 are practically non-existent in Luxembourg.
 Luxembourg does not have a state religion and there is no
 discrimination against practitioners of minority religions.
 However, the population is 99 percent Roman Catholic, and this
 faith is deeply intertwined with the conservative culture of
 the country. Thus, a Roman Catholic consensus often surfaces
 on social Issues, e.g., there is no government funding for
 abortions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on women or any other groups
 regarding movement within Luxembourg, foreign travel or
 emigration and repatriation. Luxembourg has a liberal refugee
 and asylum policy in principle, but admits only limited numbers
 of refugees.
 Foreigners applying for residence tend to be judged on the
 value of their skills and their means. An exception to this
 practice was Luxembourg's acceptance of over 100 Vietnamese
 refugees in 1979/80. Once admitted into Luxembourg, refugees
 are very well treated.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy in which all citizens
 at least 18 years of age can participate. Luxembourg's
 sizeable foreign resident population (26 percent) does not have
 the right to participate in the political process although it
 enjoys the rights of free speech, press, assembly, movement and
 religion. Significant numbers of women participate in
 politics, including Colette Flesch, the foreign minister.
 However, not many women in Luxembourg are business executives.
 The government has pending new laws assuring equal treatment
 for women.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The current and prior Luxembourg governments have supported
 international and non-governmental investigation of alleged
 violations of human rights. The Red Cross, Amnesty
 International and the UN High Commission for Refugees have
 representatives in Luxembourg. Luxembourg, as a strong
 advocate for the respect of human rights, consistently supports
 human rights in the Council of Europe and the European
 Communities.

 Although Luxembourg is. a strong advocate for the respect of
 human rights internationally, the government recognizes that
 Luxembourg's small size generally precludes it from directly
 influencing international and regional human rights bodies.
 Instead, Luxembourg consistently advocates its support for
 human rights in the Council of Europe and the European
 Communities and works toward developing a pro human rights EC
 consensus and policy. The government has been especially
 supportive of followers of the Bahai religion in Iran.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Luxembourg is a small country with a very high standard of
 living, as shown by per capita GNP statistics ($12,670 in 1979)
 and by the usual physical indices of a wealthy society: good
 hospitals, many doctors, close to 100 percent literacy, good
 primary and secondary schools, lack of any substantial poverty,
 and low unemployment. A notable feature of the Luxembourg
 economy is the importance of one industry, steel, which
 accounted in 1980 for 58 percent of all exports. Also notable
 is the fact that in 1980, foreigners made up 26 percent of the
 population. Although immigration is low now, the foreign
 population is growing, while the native Luxembourg population
 is declining. Overall, Luxembourg has one of the few negative
 growth rates in the world, with an average of only 1.4 children
 per couple. These demographic trends lead to a rapidly aging
 population, with a life expectancy at birth of 79 years. A
 final notable fact is that Luxembourg has no real universities,
 but rather arranges for the education of its youth in the
 universities of neighboring countries through cultural exchange
 treaties.
