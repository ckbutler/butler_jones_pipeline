 MEXICO
 Mexico is a federal republic with a President, a bicameral legislature and a con-
 stitutionally independent judiciary. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has
 dominated the Government since its founding in 1929. Following political reforms
 in recent years, the opposition expanded its stake in the political system. Opposition
 parties currently hold a significant number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies
 three major governorships, and numerous mayoralties, reflecting prgress ahieved
 by the Salinas Administration toward a fairer electoral process. Nevertheless, the
 PRI maintains predominant political control through a combination of voting
 strength, organizational power, access to governmental resources not enjoyed by
 other political parties, and--according to credible charges from the principal opposi-
 tion parties and other observers--electoral irregularities.
 In 1992 elections were held for 11 governorships, as well as many state legisla-
 tures and municipal governments. Despite opposition gains, including winning the
 governorship of Chihuahua and control of that states Congress, many respected
 nonpartisan observers, both domestic and international, cited a variety of actions,
 including electoral fraud, by election authorities and PRI supporters in several
 states that they charged had distorted the electoral process. The electionproceed-
 ings were seriously contested in four states. In the races for governor in Durango,
 Tamaulipas, and Sinaloa, electoral tribunals rejected opposition complaints that the
 elections were unfair, and the PRI candidates took office. In Michoacan which has
 traditionally been plagued by violence on both sides, protests continued long after
 the elections, and the elected PRI governor eventually requested a year's leave of
 absence, which was tantamount to resignation.
 Mexican security forces include Federal and State Judicial Police, specialized
 forces such as Mexico City's Traffic Police, the Federal Highway Police, local police,
 and the military. Mexican military expenditures represent a small share of the over-
 all national budget. According to the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
 
 
 441
 total military expenditures for 1989 were $875 million. Despite an increasing role
 in counternarcotics operations for the military, the defense budget has remained at
 the same level. Although the Salinas Administration has made some progress in
 controlling abuses, members of the Federal and State Judicial Police continue to be
 responsible for many human rights abuses.
 Mexico has a mixed economy that combines domestic market capitalism with
 some state ownership of major industries. The Government's economic reform pro-
 1gram has been very successful in reducing inflation, promoting growth, and restor-
 ing economic confidence. Negotiations were concluded for a free trade agreement
 with Canada and the United States that is awaiting legislative approval. Growing
 confidence in Mexico has led to increased foreign investment.
 A wide range of individual freedoms is provided for by the Mexican Constitution
 and honored in practice, but there continue to be human rights abuses in Mexico,
 many of which go unpunished, owing to the culture of impunity that has tradition-
 ally surrounded human rights violators. Thse violations include the use of torture
 and other abuses by elements of the security forces, instances of extrajudicial kill-
 ing, and credible charges by opposition parties, civic groups, and outside observers
 that there are flaws in the electoral process. Police brutality is widespread in Mex-
 ico. According to the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), however, as well
 as state and local human rights advocates, allegations of such abuse declined in
 1992. This decline reflects the work of government and nongovernmental human
 rights agencies and a commitment by the Salinas Administration to prosecute of-
 fenders. The Mexican Government established the CNDH in 1990 to investigate
 human rights violations, and the Salinas Administration has given substantial sup-
 port to it. Through November 1992, 588 police and other public employees had been
 disciplined as a result of CNDH investigations into human rights-related com-
 plaints. Of these, criminal charges were brought against 248 employees, and inves-
 tigations were still pending in 141 cases. The CNDH was also largely responsible
 for the Government s early release of 500 indigenous people from prisons during
 1992.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Exra.udicial Killing.--Several political and human rights
 activists were killed in 1992. As in previous years, the identities and motives of the
 perpetrators often have not been established conclusively, but a number of the
 killings may have been politically motivated. The most notable was the November
 slaying in Mexico City of Quintana Roo journalist Ignacio Mendoza Castillo. Men-
 doza was slain the day after he had visited the CNDH to denounce threats against
 himself and other Quintana Roo journalists. While a police investigation concluded
 on November 29 that Mendoza had been shot by one o his private business debtors,
 whom he was threatening to foreclose, the CNDH is also investigating the Mendoza
 slaying. The Commission reported on December 15 that, while preliminary review
 suggested the Mendoza killer had been identified, it would not close its investigation
 until it had finished examining the Attorney General's report.
 Most public attention in 1992, however, remained focused on murders that oc-
 curred in earlier years, including the 1991 murder of physician and journalist Victor
 Manuel Oropeza and the 1990 killing of lawyer and prominent human rights worker
 Norma Corona. Former Mexican Federal Judicial Police (MFJP) Commander Mario
 Alberto Gonzalez Trevino, accused of planning the 1990 murder of Corona, remains
 under arrest, and the trial against him is proceeding. On July 14, 1992, Miguel
 Angel Rico Urres, a principal witness for the prosecution, was fatally shot in prison,
 and there is strong evidence linking his murder to Gonzalez Trevino. He is the
 fourth prosecution witness killed in the Corona case.
 In another earlier case involving police, the CNDH concluded its investigation into
 the deaths of three Quijano brothers at the hands of police in January 1990. Its re-
 port was sharply critical of the Attorney General's investigation of the case, noting
 that the evidence implicated several MFJP agents, and hinting that the physical
 evidence suggested attempts at a coverup. Arrest warrants were issued against five
 MFJP agents involved, but only one had been served as of December 1992. Inves-
 tigations also continue into the death of Victor Oropeza and the 1988 killings of the
 two aides to Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) leader Cuauhtemoc
 Cardenas. New special prosecutors were appointed in both cases but, as of Decem-
 ber 1992, had not resolved either.
 Five PRD supporters in Michoacan were killed by persons unknown in violence
 related to the July 12 election. Complaints have been friled with the CNDH in these
 
 
 and other cases denounced by the PRD as politically motivated killings, and inves-
 tigations continue into the killings.
 There continue to be cases of extrajudicial killing by police. There are also re-
 peated allegations of involvement by judicial police agents in narcotics-related
 killings. At least one judicial policeman has been charged with providing protection
 to drug traffickers involved in a November shootout in Puerto Vallarta that left at
 least six persons dead. In September nine persons were kidnaped in Mexico City,
 tortured and killed. While their murders were attributed to a conflict between drug
 gangs, the murderers have not been identified. In addition, 'madrinas"--civilians
 unofficially recruited by police--continue to be accused by human rights monitors
 of human rights abuses.
 In Mexico's rural states, violent disputes over land sometimes result in
 extrajudicial killings. Paramilitary bands, "madrinas," and local police controlled by
 political bosses and landowners have threatened and sometimes killed peasant ac-
 tivists. In one instance, a local policeman in Trinidad Yaveo was charged with homi-
 cide and is now a fugitive after he killed a man in the course of a police-led eviction
 of a group from a parcel of land, the title to which was contested.
 On July 12 the leader of Mexico City's AIDS movement and two homosexual men
 were tortured and murdered. At least four other'antigay murders took place in Mex-
 ico City during the year, and a number were reported in the state of Chiapas. Gay
 grups accused the police of releasing inflammatory information to the press and of
 failingto investigate these murders vigorously. At year's end, no one had been ar-
 rested and the police reported that they had no suspects.
 The U.S. Government formally protested and sought investigations of two in-
 stances when U.S. citizens died while in police custody, allegedly by suicide.
 With the establishment of the CNDH7 as an independent entity under the Con-
 stitution, and with the formation of official Human Rights Commissions in each
 state, there has been increased attention paid to human rights at both the state and
 federal levels. However, many of the CNDH recommendations have been imple-
 mented only partially.
 b. Disappearance.-Unlike previous years, there was no evidence in 1992 that
 human rights workers, journalists, or political activists disappeared for political mo-
 tives.
 In 1992 the CNDH opened 53 new investigations of reported disappearances and
 continued working on the more than 270 investigations already under way. During
 calendar year 1992, the CNDH concluded 20 cases. Of the 20, 12 were found not
 to be genuine disappearances. The remaining 8 involved murders, and CNDH inves-
 tigations continue in 6 of these cases. There is a suspect in one murder case, and
 in another the murderer has been convicted. None of the resolved murders were
 found to be motivated by political considerations.
 With the 20 cases resolved in 1992, the CNDH concluded 60 disappearance cases.
 Many of these were undertaken as part of a joint program with the Mexican Office
 of the Attorney General (PGR) to resolve all of the cases in Mexico listed by the
 U.N. Working Group on Involuntary or Forced Disappearances. (The U.N. list con-
 tains a total of more than 200 persons who reportedly disappeared in Mexico over
 the last 22 years. Mexican independent human rights groups continue to claim that
 approximately 500 persons disappeared in Mexico over the same period.) The joint
 CNDH/PGR program ended on June 1, 1992; CNDH officials will continue inves-
 tigating the remaining cases on their own.
 While some nongvernmental human rights activists assert that there were politi-
 cal motives behind many disappearances, the Commission found evidence of a politi-
 cal motive in only one o  e disappearance cases it investigated, that of Jose Ramon
 Garcia Gomez, a political activist who disappeared in Morelos in 1988. The Commis-
 sion issued two recommendations in the case. Several suspects in Garcia Gomez' dis-
 appearance, including former police officials, were arrested on criminal charges
 while another, the former state police chief, is being sought. "Amparos" (judicial or-
 ders that quashed the arrest warrants) were issued, and the prosecution was forced
 to appeal in at least two cases.
 c. porture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution. However, police agents continue to employ
 psychological and physical torture. The most commonly used methods of torture in-
 clude threats, beatings, asphyxiation, and electric shock. In its first two years, the
 CNDH received 736 complaints of torture. According to the CNDH, torture com-
 plaints declined sharply during 1992 both in number and as a percentage of all com-
 plaints. The Commission received 292 such complaints from December 1991 to De-
 cember 1992, compared with 422 in the previous year. As a result of the CNDH rec-
 ommendations issued up to December for complaints concerning torture, the Gov-
 ernment brought criminal charges against 16 public officials. Although this rep-
 
 
 443
 resents an improvement, it continues a pattern of failure to try, convict, and sen-
 tence to prison police officials guilty of abusing detainees. Despite the decline in tor-
 ture complaints to the Commission, some nongovernmental human rights monitors
 assert that there has been little decline in the number of such complaints which
 they receive.
 Through the beginning of September, 41 U.S. citizens complained of police abuse,
 a decline of 19 from the same period in 1991, and of 56 from that period in 1990.
 In the 30 cases where victims were able to identify those involved, Federal Judicial
 Police agents were implicated in less than one-third, down from earlier years, while
 state, local, and other federal agency officials accounted for the rest. By year's end,
 the U.S. Government had formally protested 16 cases of torture or other mistreat-
 ment through diplomatic channels, down from 27 such protests during 1991 and 43
 in 1990.
 According to the Mexican Attorney General's reports, PGR investigations under-
 taken in rspone to U.S. protests in 1992 resulted in 2 dismissals 49 suspensions,
 26 reprimands, and two other unspecified punishments of officials found to have
 been involved in the mistreatment of US. citizens. In response to CNDH rec-
 ommendations and investigations, the Government continued efforts begun in 1990
 to reduce the incidence of trture and similar abuse by officials.
 The federal rules of evidence were amended in February 1991, in response to fre-
 quent criticism that confessions are coerced in the period before defendants appear
 before a judge and are assigned a lawyer. Confessions are now inadmissible unless
 given before a judge or a Public Ministry official and in the presence of defense
 counsel or a person in whom the accused has confidence. Similar changes were
 adopted by several states. Although the new rule is credited by the CNDH and inde-
 pendent human rights activists as partly responsible for the apparent decline in the
 incidence of torture in 1992, some human rights groups argued that torture is still
 widespread and that the new rule does not go far enough. They asserted that only
 confessions before judges should be accepted and that the safeguards in the current
 law are inadequate.
 Most prisons in Mexico are overcrowded and lack adequate facilities for the pris-
 oners. Overcrowding remains a problem despite an early release program pushed by
 the CNDH and legal reforms reducing the number of crimes that carry mandatory
 prison sentences. In addition, an entrenched system of corruption has undermined
 prison authority and led to abuses. Frequently, prisoners exercise authority within
 the prison, displacing prison officials. One particularly egregious case involved a
 prison in Nayarit whose warden was fired after a long strng o" abuses at the prison
 ended in the unexplained death of a prisoner who reportedly had been summoned
 to the warden's office. Conflicts between rival prison groups, often involved in drug-
 trafficking, continued to spark violent confrontations. While prison officials have
 been prosecuted for abusing prisoners, they usually were charged with only minor
 offenses and have avoided serious punishment. The CNDH and Government have
 embarked on a major prison building program designed to reduce the overcrowding
 lack of security, and the mixing of male and female prisoners and of accused and
 sentenced criminals that have addqd greatly to prison violence.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires that those ar-
 rested be brought before an officer of the court as soon as possible, generally accept-
 ed as within 24 hours of their arrest. That person takes their statement and informs
 them of the charges against them. A prisoner must be arraigned before a judge and
 found by that udge to have probably committed a crime, if the prisoner is to be
 held more than 72 hours from the time when he was charged by an officer of the
 court. Failure to observe the deadline is a violation of the law and prisoners can
 file an *amparo" petition (similar to filing for habeas corpus) requesting immediate
 release if the time limits are not met. However, police and judges often fail to meet
 these constitutional and procedural deadlines.
 Incidents of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment occur frequently: CNDH figures
 show that illegal deprivation of liberty is the most common complaint among its
 human rights cases. From June 1990 to June 1992, out of 10,244 complaints re-
 ceived by the CNDH, 826 alleged arbitrary detention. In one case, a young PRD po-
 litical activist, Morelos Madrigal Lachino was kidnaped by unknown persons
 dressed as policemen, held incommunicado or more than 3 days, and beaten before
 being released.
 Generally, arrests may be made only upon authority of a judicially issued war-
 rant. The law permits suspects caught in the act of committing a crime to be ar-
 rested without a warrant. It has been frequent police practice to arrest a suspect
 without a warrant even when not caught in the act and for judges to overlook the
 irregularity. That practice has only recently begun to abate with the dismissal of
 several cases based on improper arrests. In order for the protection against arbi-
 
 
 444
 trary arrest to be given full effect, human rights advocates assert that defense coun-
 sel must regularly raise the issue and judges must be prepared to recognize it.
 Frequent credible reports continue to be made of human rights violations, includ-
 ing forced expulsions and unlawful arrests, in connection with conflicts in rural
 areas. These incidents often involve indigenous people evicted by landowners with
 local police and government support. In September 1991, a group of indigenous pro-
 testers and a Catholic priest were arrested by police during a protest in Palenque,
 Chiapas. After reportedly suffering beatings and other hardships, most were not
 charged and were released within several days. Several others were held for more
 than a month, and one for more than three months, before being released on sus-
 pended charges, the equivalent of receiving a pardon.
 Exile of Mexican citizens is not normally practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Mexican judicial system is divided into fed-
 eral and state court systems, with the federal courts having jurisdiction over most
 civil cases and those involving maor felonies, including drug trafficking. The politi-
 cal opposition and many credible, independent analysts charge that, because judges'
 appointments must be renewed once before they are given tenure, the judiciary is
 overly dependent on the executive branch. The Government, in turn, denies that po-
 litical beliefs have any bearing on the impartial administration of justice. Factors
 such as low pay and high caseloads contribute to continued corruption within the
 judicial system.
 The Constitution requires that the court must hand down a verdict within 4
 months of arrest for crimes that carry a maximum sentence of 2 years or less, and
 within a year for those with longer maximum sentences. The trial itself, sentencing,
 and appeals can delay the imposition of a criminal sentence for significant periods
 of time, sometimes adding a year or more to the entire process. Trial is by a judge,
 not a jury, in nearly all criminal cases. Defendants have a right to counsel, ani pub-
 lic defenders are available. Other rights include protection against self-incrimina-
 tion, the right to confront one's accusers, the right to a translator if one's native
 language is not Spanish, and the right to a public trial. Such protections are not
 always observed in practice. More attention has been paid to ensuring prompt ar-
 raignments of current suspects, although unlawful detention remains a widespread
 problem. The long trial process is one of the major causes of overcrowding in the
 prison system, as those who do not qualify for or cannot make bail swell the prison
 population.
 A coalition of nongovernmental human rights groups called for an amnesty for
 many indigenous prisoners who, it is charged, are political prisoners denied access
 to fair trials because of language and cultural barriers, as well as poverty. The
 CNDH launched a program to seek early release for prisoners, including indigenous
 people, and to improve compliance by federal and state officials with legal require-
 ments that indigenous people be represented fairly. The Government denies cha s
 by human rights groups that many indigenous people are wrongly imprisoned, but
 it has released more than 500 in 1992 as part of the CNDH-sponsored early release
 proa.
 Wro~arndsputed November elections in the state of Tamaulipas ended in protests,
 several opposition leaders were imprisoned and charged with committing acts of vio-
 lence. Most were released, and charges against them were dismissed within 3 weeks
 of their arrests, but charges remained pending against several at year's end. The
 opposition claims that these leaders were falsely arrested for political reasons. While
 the National Front Against Repression (FNCR) stopped keeping a log of those it con-
 siders political prisoners, some observers continue to assert that there are political
 prisoners in Mexico, though the number continues to decline from the 33 reported
 by the FNCR in 1989. Historically, the FNCR claimed that most political prisoners
 in Mexico were peasants and peasant activists arrested in land disputes. The Gov-
 ernment disputes the appellation "political prisoner," charging that most of those
 whom human rights groups claim to be political prisoners have been guilty of crimes
 such as terrorism, criminal association, and damage to property.
 f. Arbitrary Interferince with Privacy, Family, ome, or Correspondence.-Privacy
 and freedom from intrusion by the Government into homes, family, and correspond-
 ence are rights protected under Article 16 of the Constitution. Although search war-
 rants are required by law, unlawful searches occur frequently in Mexico. Wiretaps
 placed in violation of the law were found in a meeting room in Morelia, Michoacan,
 that was to be used by the opposition National Action Party (PAN) central commit-
 tee. No convictions resulted ?nom the ensuing investigation, and the Government de-
 nied any official involvement. Shortly afterward, however, the local representative
 of the Mexican National Security Agency stepped down, a move interpreted by oppo-
 sition leaders as a result of the investigation of the incident.
 
 
 Peasants and urban squatters involved in conflicts over land charged that local
 landowners, with the compliance of local political leaders and often accompanied by
 police or bands of civilian thugs, evicted them from their homes without appropriate
 judicial orders, often with violence. In Chiapas, according to the CNDH and other
 credible reports, local village leaders expelled from their villages indigenous ?eoIle
 who converted from their traditional religion to evangelical faiths. Efforts by the
 state government supported by the Catholic hierarchy have not been successful in
 ending the expulsions, largely because the Catholic hierarchy has little influence in
 some nominally Catholic ndan communities, and because the Government found
 it difficult to force reintegration into small communities of people who have been
 ostracized for their beliefs.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and of the press are provided
 for by the Constitution. Opposition leaders freely voice their criticism of the Govern-
 ment, and there are a large number of newspapers and magazines with a wide
 range of editorial views. However, there are significant restrictions on these free-
 doms.
 The Government's control of a significant advertising budget and its ability to re-
 ward favored journalists by providing them access enabled it to use that leverage
 to discourage unfavorable reports. Also, a number of journalists depend upon receipt
 of under-the-table payments from the often public entities they cover to supplement
 low wages. But at least one newspaper revised its wage and advertising revenue dis-
 tribution policies to reduce or eliminate abuses. Recently, the Government an-
 nounced that it would no longer cover expenses incurred by reporters accompanying
 the President on his travels abroad. Plans to privatize two of three remaining gov-
 ernment-owned television stations and the government-owned newspaper El
 National had not been carried out by December. After the planned sales are com-
 pleted, the Government would retain control of an educational television station and
 another, cultural station will continue to be run with government funding by an
 independent bard headed by leading intellectuals.
 The Federal Electoral Code provides opposition parties during an electoral cam-
 paign with 15 minutes per month of television time and additional time in propor-
 tion to their Wlectoral strength. Despite that provision, the opposition asserts that
 media coverage is unbalanced and argues that campaign media spending should be
 controlled. Opposition political parties and independent observers charge that Meai-
 c's two principal television networks, one government owned and the other pri-
 vately owned, accord the government party inordinate news coverage, particularly
 at election time.
 Violence and threats against journalists continued to be a serious problem in
 1992. In the Yucatan, unidentified persons vandalized the offices of a publisher of
 a newspaper, he received a package bomb shortly afer calling for an investigation
 into the violent eviction by police of protesters from the main town square. The po-
 lice identified no suspcts. As already noted, the death in July 1991 of physician
 and columnist Victor M4anuel Oropza Contreras remains unresolved. Two suspects
 charged with the murder were reease in 1992 in compliance with a recommenda-
 tion from CNDH, and charges are now pending against several police officials ac-
 cused of fabricating a case against the two. A new prosecutor was named to lead
 the case in September.
 The first stage of a CNDH study of attacks on journalists concluded in 1992, and
 a second was begun. In response to a complaint by the Union of Democratic Journal-
 ists, the Commission began an inquiry in 1990 into 55 cases of alleged denial of
 human rights to journalists. In December 1992, the CNDH updated its report on
 that first stage and announced that it had embarked on a second stage, investigat-
 ing 22 new cases. Of the 55 original cases, 40 were concluded and police investiga-
 tions pursuant to Commission recommendations continue in the remaining 15. Of
 those 40 concluded, 12 were dropped from the study as not involving journalists or
 after a finding that the incident involved a private dispute. The murderers have
 been convicted in 10 cases, trials are pending against private suspects in 3 cases
 (including the murders of Manuel Buendia and Javier Juarez Vazquez), and sus-
 pects have been identified in 2 others. Five were dismissed after findings of not
 guilty, two private citizens accused of murder were acquitted for acting in self-de-
 fense, six cases were archived for lack of evidence, and one policeman was convicted
 of battery. In none of the cases did the CNDH establish evd ence of a political mo-
 tive. One of the cases, that of Hector Felix, was closed after two men (not public
 servants) were convicted of murdering him and sentenced to terms of 25 and 27
 years. Later, the case was reopened to consider new evidence that others were in-
 
 
 volved. Six killers involved in the 1986 murder of PAN journalist Linda Bejarano
 were sentenced to 25- to 27-year terms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution grants the
 right of peaceful assembly for any lawful purpose. A government permit is generally
 required for major demonstrations. The Government, with few exceptions, permits
 demonstrations by a broad range of political groups.
 c. Freedom of Rel ion.-The Constitution permits persons to practice the religion
 of their choice. In J anuary a constitutional amendment was adopted that trans-
 formed the legal relationship between church and state in Mexico. Applicable to all
 faiths, the amendment permits religious entities to acquire legal standing and au-
 thorizes them to own property and to run private schools. It permits clergy to vote
 and wear religious garb in public. These had been illegal since the passing of
 antichurch laws in the late 1920's but tolerated in practice. The clergy remain
 barred from holding public office and advocating partisan political positions. Legisla-
 tion implementing the constitutional change restricts the rights of churches to own
 businesses and communicatione media and sets rules for acquiring legal status as
 a religious association. Individual clergy may be political candidates, but only after
 a period of separation from their religious roles.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Movement within and outside the country is unrestricted. The Govern-
 ment has customarily admitted persons recognized as refugees by the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees. Approximately 43,000 Guatemalan refugees reside in
 camps and resettlement afeas in three southern Mexican states. Since 1990 they
 have been permitted to accept work outside their camps and may travel freely in
 the five-state area of Chiapas, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, and Yucatan. The
 Government estimates that an additional 400,000 Central Americans, mostly Guate-
 malans and Salvadorans, are living and working in Mexico. These pre-1990 undocu-
 mented Central Americans lead a precarious existence, are subject to deportation
 when caught, and are often exploited as a source of cheap labor. Changes in the
 1991 Mexican law governing refugee status did not have a measurable impact on
 the pre-1990 population of Central American immigrants in Mexico.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since 1929, Mexico's Government has been controlled by the PRI, which has won
 every presidential race and every gubernatorial race except the 1989 Baja California
 Norte election and the 1992 Chihuahua election. (The third opposition governorship,
 that of Guanajuato, was an interim appointment by President Salinas in 1991.) To
 maintain power, the PRI has relied on extensive public patronage, the use of gov-
 ernment and party organizational resources, and, according to respected independ-
 ent observers, electoral fraud.
 Eleven governors were selected in 1992, and elections were held for several state
 legislatures and numerous municipal governments. The most hotly contested races
 were in the states of Chihuahua and Michoacan. In Chihuahua, the National Action
 Party candidate won the election in a tight, but apparently clean, election that con-
 trasted sharply with elections in the state 6 years ago when the PAN claimed that
 its victory was stolen. The Government was responsive to opposition complaints of
 irregularities before the election, replacing PRI candidates who did not fulfill resi-
 dency requirements and arresting two goverment officials who were caught ille-
 ally possessin  voting credentials. The AN candidate's clear victory was accepted
 by tePRI the day after the election.
 In contrast to the election in Chihuahua, the Michoacan gubernatorial and state
 Congress election was dominated by controversy and by allegations of fraud, some
 of which were credible. Even before election day, the PRD accused the PRI and the
 Government of massive, unfair cing; denying PRD sympathizers the
 right to vote by removing their names from the offcl listof voters or notproviding
 them voter credentials; and stacking the election oversight organs with PRI support-
 ers. After the PRI was declared the winner in the gubernatorial and 17 of 18 con-
 gressional races, the opposition filed dozens of formal complaints with the state elec-
 tion tribunal, challenging the results from over a third of the voting precincts. How-
 ever, the state electoral tribunal dismissed all the complaints in a pro forma man-
 ner. Moreover, the state electoral college convened secretly-without inviting PRD
 congressmen-to ratify the PRI candidate's gubernatorial victory, and the congres-
 sional electoral college ratified the legislative elections despite lacking a quorum as
 stipulated by the state electoral law. Because their demands were not met through
 the legal review process, the PRD took their complaints to the street, resulting in
 extensive public demonstrations throughout the state. Under continued opposition
 pressure, PRI governor Eduardo Villasenor announced he was taking a 1-year's
 
 
 leave of absence, effectively stepping down, and an interim governor was appointed.
 PRD and PRI negotiators then agreed on ground rules for the December municipal
 elections designed to avoid a repetition of the gubernatorial race protests. The plan
 included choosing local election officials by agreement, equal access to the media,
 and spending restraints. Nonetheless, the PRD also lodged protests in the aftermath
 of the December 6 municipal elections in Michoacan, claiming irregularities occurred
 in over 24 municipalities.
 Credible allegations of election fraud were also made in several other state elec-
 tions, notably in Durango, Veracruz, and Tamaulipas. In Durango, the PAN com-
 plained of illegal pressure on voters to support thePRI. In Veracruz, the PRD said
 the PRI padded its victory margin, and in Tamaulipas, the opposition coalition can-
 didate denounced the failure of electoral review panels to consider opposition objec-
 tions. Most observers agreed that such irregularities did not affect the outcomes in
 these elections.
 The electoral process is still heavily weighted in favor of the PRI; nevertheless,
 in recent years there have been improvements in the federal electoral law, COFIPE.
 Passed in 1990, COFIPE introduced several changes into the electoral process, in-
 cluding the complete renovation of the official list of voters and distribution of over
 36 million voting credentials to eligible voters. COFIPE also strengthened opposition
 political party representation at the Federal Electoral Institute, which supervises
 federal elections, and created a Federal Electoral Tribunal (TFE), an autonomous
 oversight commission that rules on electoral-related disputes.
 Many Mexicans do not have confidence that government electoral oversight and
 review organs will act impartially. Consequently, nongovernmental human rights
 organizations and civic and academic gups have taken it upon themselves to serve
 as independent electoral watchdog.,For example, during the Chihuahua guber-
 natorial elections, the Council for Democracy, a loosely aligned group of academics,
 journalists, and politicians, organized a "quick count" of the vote results in the state;
 its results mirrored the official results. Teams of citizen observer groups also fanned
 out into several states during the year to serve as independent election monitors.
 Despite improvements, the opposition and independent observers continued to as-
 sert that the laws do not ensure fair elections. The opposition's strongest criticism
 continued to be the charge that the official lists of state voters were manipulated
 by inflating the number of PRI voters, removing the names of opposition supporters,
 or not delivering voting credentials to them. Opposition allegations of electoral er-
 rors were bolstered by the Government's failure to report election results on time
 and its inability to deliver credentials to everyone who met the registration require-
 ments. The Government responded to opposition pressure by agreeing to discard the
 existing official voter list, which was only used in one federal election, to compile
 a new official list of voters, and to issue new voter credentials which for the first
 time will have a photograph of the holder. These credentials will be used in the
 1994 presidential election.
 Opposition and independent observers also lodged credible complaints that the
 Government used public resources to support campaigns of PRI candidates and fre-
 quently used patronage, particularly in the form of the Government's social services
 and development program-the National Solidarity Program (PRONASOL)-for par-
 tisan political advantage. In hotly contested elections during the past year, the PRI
 spent millions of dollars on the campaign, sometimes outspending the opposition by
 as much as 30 to 1. While this is not illegal in Mexico-Mexico does not have laws
 regulating campaign spending--critics charge that this imbalance has worked
 against growing democratic pluralism. President Salinas announced in his Novem-
 ber I State of the Union speech an initiative to limit campaign spending, advance
 the impartiality of electoral authorities, ensure separation between the government
 and the parties, and ensure equal access to the media. The PRI has already begun
 to obtain alternative financing through public fundraising, but it remains to be seen
 how fully these initiatives will be implemented.
 Under Mexican law, indigenous peoples have the same political rights as all other
 Mexican citizens. They do not live on independently governed reservations, although
 many indigenous communities continue to exercise considerable local control over
 economic and social issues. These communities continue to apply their traditional
 law to resolve a variety of disputes, including allegations of crimes.
 While there is no separate indigenous political party in Mexico, in many states-
 particularly Chiapas, axaca, and Guerrero-indigenous voters make up an impor-
 tant percentage of the populations. Traditionally, indigenous voters strongly backed
 the ruling PRI. In return for this support, in many areas the Government permitted
 the local autonomy noted above. Opposition politicians and human rights advocates
 stepped up their criticism of elections in indigenous areas, arguing that the reported
 
 
 results often reflect distortion of the voting process and not a genuine consensus to
 support the PRI.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits both domestic and international human rights groups to
 operate in Mexico without restrictions or harassment. However, human rights mon-
 itors continued to be subject to threats, which must be taken seriously since activ-
 ists in past years were subjected to violence and in some cases killed. In October
 and November, well-known human rights advocate Teresa Jardi received five death
 threat letters, urging her to leave Mexico. She met with President Salinas, who
 lauded her work, denounced the threats, and set in train an investigation into the
 threats. Together with the killing of Quintana Roo journalist Ignacio Mendoza (men-
 tioned above), the Jardi threats were the most serious attack on human rights mon-
 itors in 1992.
 Ranking Mexican officials routinely meet with domestic and international human
 rights activists to discuss human rights problems. In June 1990, President Salinas
 established the semiautonomous National Commission on Human Rights and ap-
 pointed respected jurist Jorge Carpizo Macger as its president. In January 1992,
 constitutional reforms took effect making the CNDH legally independent. The Com-
 mission's advisory council is composed of respected human rights leaders, and Dr.
 Carpizo has received strong support from President 3alinas for CNDH efforts.
 The Commission s mandate, however, does not provide it jurisdiction over labor
 or electoral matters, nor does it have prosecutorial powers. The CNDH, which calls
 itself an ombudsman, must rely upon the pressure of public opinion and the accu-
 racy of its investigations to induce compliance with its recommendations to state
 and federal authorities to investigate and prosecute transgressors. Since announcing
 in June 1992 that too many of its recommendations had been only partially com-
 pleted, the CNDH has pursued an agressive campaign to force compliance. In its
 reports for 1992, the Commission noted that of the 412 recommendations it has is-
 sued since it began work in June 1990, 160 have been accepted and fully complied
 with, 228 accepted but not yet fully implemented (106 of which were issued in the
 last 6 months), and only 8 had not been accepted by the authorities to which they
 were addressed. Human rights activists claim that the Government of Mexico
 should take concrete steps to ensure that public officials who are accused of human
 rights violations are prosecuted and not transferred to another jurisdiction, or dis-
 missed in one and then rehired in another. The Government has publicly recognized
 this problem and has announced its plans to develop a national register of police
 to confront it.
 There are more than 90 nongovernmental human rights organizations active in
 Mexico. In addition to assisting individual victims of human rits abuse, such orga-
 nizations have become increasingly active in monitoring elections. Recognizing the
 advances by the CNDH in the protection of human rights, they decry its lack of ju-
 risdiction in electoral matters and have moved to fill that gap. Their leaders assert
 that ensuring fair and free elections is the best way to improve the administration
 of justice and to ensure that human rights violators are prosecuted. Under the con-
 stitutional change making the CNDH independent, state human rights commissions
 will be created by legislation in all 31 states. These entities will handle matters
 arising under state law, although the National Commission will continue to have
 review authority.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Mexico takes pride in its Spanish and indigenous origins and in the success the
 country has achieved in fostering a climate of racial harmony. Indigenous groups,
 many of which do not speak Spanish, are encouraged to participate in political life,
 and the Government is respectful of their desire to retain elements of their tradi-
 tional lifestyle. However, these groups remain largely outside the country's political
 and economic mainstream, a result not of overt governmental discrimination but
 rather of longstanding patterns of economic and social development. Reform this
 year of the Mexican Constitution's provision on agriculture, which resulted in the
 announcement that there is no remaining open land free to be distributed to peas-
 ants through government expropriation or grant, may make it more difficult for In-
 dian groups to acquire new land and may increase pressure on those with good
 lands to sell. As noted earlier, human rights groups continue to complain with some
 justification that indigenous defendants in criminal cases are not treated fairly, de-
 spite the 1991 amendment to federal law requiring an interpreter at every stage of
 a criminal proceeding for indigenous peoples not fluent in Spanish.

 Historically, women in Mexico have played a subordinate role, economically po-
 litically, and socially. Women are becoming increasingly active economically andp
 litically; one woman is a member of President Salinas' Cabinet, another holds the
 number two position in the PRI, and others are key congressional and union lead-
 ers. Legally, women are equal to men. They have the right to file for separation and
 divorce and to own property in their own name. The Constitution provides for equal
 pay for eqcual work and for maternity leave.
 Domestic assault is a crime but in practice-largely due to social tradition-
 women are often reluctant to tile reports of abuse or to press charges. Police are
 reluctant to intervene in what is often considered a domestic affair. The CNDH has
 included programs and publications on women's rights in its training and education
 campaign, and the Center Against Violence Toward Women (COVAC) has worked
 to encourage rape victims to come forward and report sexual crimes. Encouraged by
 the 1991 changes in the law defining rape, stiffening sentences for offenders, and
 guaranteeing reparations for victims, women's groups are now seeking legislative re-
 form of the family and civil codes regarding domestic violence and sexual harass-
 ment at the workplace.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and specific provisions of the cur-
 rent Federal Labor Law (FLL) give all workers the right to form and join trade
 unions of their own choosing. Unions must register with the labor secretariat or
 equivalent state government authorities. In theory registration requirements are not
 onerous, involving the submission of basic information about the union in order to
 give it jegal status. There have been repeated allegations by labor activists, how-
 ever, that the federal and state labor authorities improperly use this administrative
 procedure to withhold registration from groups considered disruptive to government
 policies. Privately, trade unionists supportive of the Government and even employ-
 ers say this occurs.
 About 30 to 35 percent of the total Mexican work force is organized in trade
 unions, most of which are members of several large union confederations, known as
 labor centrals. Mexican unions may join together freely in labor centrals without the
 Government's prior approval but require registration in order to have legal status.
 As with union registration there is evidence this requirement can be misapplied to
 function as a restriction. It took from early 1990 until September 4, 1992, for one
 new labor central whose members were all well established, registered trade unions,
 to obtain its registration. In this case, although the new central's member unions
 were all Labor Congress (CT) members, they had been outspokenly critical of tradi-
 tional leadership of the Congress
 The largest Mexican trade union organization is the Confederation of Mexican
 Workers (CTM), organizationally a major supporter of the PRI. All PRI-affiliated
 federations, such as the CTM and a number of autonomous unions (a total of 37
 organizations) belong to the C, a trade union coordinating body which represents
 approximately 85 percent of Mexico's organized workers.
 The tradition of a significant presence of union officers in the Government, espe-
 cially in elected positions, and the continued union influence in the nominating proc-
 ess for PRI candidates at all levels of government, perpetuates a symbiotic relation-
 ship that limits the freedom of action of unions. For example, union officers support
 government economic policies and PRI political candidates in return for having a
 voice in policy formation. When systemic reforms were instituted in the late 1980's,
 however, the mainstream labor organizations began to lose strength within the rul-
 ing PRI. After the August 1991 federal legislative elections, in which fewer than
 usual PRI labor candidates participated, the percentage of CT senators and deputies
 in the federal congress fell to less than 10 percent. In 1992, only one labor leader
 was named as a PRI gubernatorial candidate. This, and the reality of privatization
 and economic restructuring of the economy, have prompted a debate within the CT
 about how best to adjust to changing circumstances.
 Mexican law grants workers the right to strike. The FLL requires as a first step
 that a 6- to 10-day strike notice be filed, followed by a brief, government-spnsored
 mediation effort. If a strike is ruled illegal, employees must return to work within
 24 hours or face dismissal for cause. On the other hand, once a legally recognized
 strike occurs, by law the company (or its subunit) that is the strike target must shut
 down totally. Even management officials may not enter the premises until the strike
 is resolved.
 The FLL also permits strikes by public sector employees, although this rarely oc-
 curs. Strike figures for 1992 are expected to be higher than for 1990 or 1991, mainly
 due to prolonged strikes within the cotton textile industry and at a large Volks-
 wagen plant. During 1991, strike activity was low; 7,006 notices of intent to strike
 
 
 450
 were filed with the Federal Board of Conciliation and Arbitration (JFCA), and 136
 actual strikes occurred. The comparable figures for 1990 were 6,395 strike notices
 and 149 strikes.
 Labor leader Agapito Gonzalez Cavazos was arrested in January 1992 in Mata-
 mores. He was accused of tax fraud but, since his union had just instituted legal
 strikes against a number of 'maquiladora" (in-bond export) plants with expired
 labor contracts, his supporters charged harassment. Mexican government officials
 denied this. Due to his advanced age and health problems, Agapito Gonzalez was
 kept under a loose form of house arrest in a private hospital in Mexico City while
 government prosecutors and his own lawyers worked on his case. He was released
 on bond in mid-October 1992 and resumed his union activities in Matamoros.
 Unions and labor centrals are free to join or affiliate with international labor or-
 ganizations and do so actively.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The FLL strongly upholds the
 right toorgaze and to bargain collectively. On the basis of only a small showing
 intrest by employees, an employer must recognize the union concerned and make
 arrangements either for a union recognition election or proceed immediately to nego-
 tiate a collective bargaining agreement, and such agreements are commonplace. Ac-
 cording to the employers, FLL bias on this point is so pronounced that it has led
 many of them to encourage company unionism as an alternative to organization by
 national or local unions affiliated with the dominant labor centrals. Union represen-
 tation elections are traditionally open (not secret), and votes are recorded by name.
 Management as well as competing trade union officials are with the presiding JFCA
 official when each and every worker votes.
 The public sector is almost totally organized. The degree of private sector organi-
 zation varies widely by states. While most traditional industrial areas are heavily
 organized, states with a small industrial base usually have few unions. Workers are
 protected by law from antiunion discrimination, but this law is unevenly enforced,
 especially in states with a low degree of unionization.
 The rate of unionization of maquiladora industries varies by area, but is compara-
 tively low. The Attorney General for Human Rights of Baja California attributes the
 low rate of unionization of maquiladoras in his state to the fact that the relatively
 good wage and benefit packages of the large maquiladoras reduce the incentives to
 unionize. However other observers report abject working conditions and inadequate
 wages in these industries and allege government as well as employer efforts to sup-
 press unionization. There is, however, no credible evidence that the central Govern-
 ment has suppressed the unionization of maquiladoras. There are indicators that
 some state and local government figures and business leaders have discouraged
 unionization in their respective areas. Critics correctly point out that it is difficult
 to explain the low level of unionization in some states, given the ease of unioniza-
 tion under the law, yet the trade unions have not instituted any complaints either
 with the Government or with the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor. There have been no credible reports of forced labor for many years.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The FLL sets 14 as the minimum
 age for employment by children. Children from 14 to 15 may work a maximum of
 6 hours, may not work overtime or at night, and may not be employed in jobs
 deemed hazardous. In the formal sector, enforcement is reasonably adequate for
 large and medium-size companies; it is less certain for small companies. As with
 employee safety and health, the worst enforcement problem is with the many very
 small companies. Eighty-five percent of all registered Mexican companies have 15
 or less employees, and 80 percent have 5 or less employees, indicating the vast
 scope of the enforcement challenge just within the formal economy.
 Illegal child labor is largely found in the informal economy, which includes signifi-
 cant numbers of underage street vendors, employees in very small businesses, and
 workers in rural areas. The ILO reports that approximately 18 percent of Mexican
 children aged 12 to 14 work. Often such children work for their parents or other
 close relatives. In addition, -small-scale employers prepared to disregard company
 registration, social security, health, safety, and tax laws are often equally prepared
 to violate child labor laws.
 In 1992 the Mexican Government increased from six to nine the minimum num-
 ber of years that children must attend school. The move was part of a major edu-
 cational reform effort designed, in large part, to upgrade the skills of the Mexican
 labor force. The Government recognizes as a long-term goal the need to continue in-
 creasing educational opportunities for youth.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution and the FLL provide for a
 minimum wage for workers, which is set by the tripartite National Minimum Wage
 Commission (government, labor, employers). In December 1987, the major labor cen-
 
 
 trals and unions, along with employers, agreed to a temporary tripartite accord with
 the Government to limit price and wage increases to compensate for purchasing
 power losses caused by inflation. The accord has since been renewed annually. By
 1991 annual inflation was reduced to 19 percent and was expected to be about 12
 percent for 1992. Wages set by collective bargaining agreements and white-collar
 salaries in the private sector generally kept pace with inflation even though the
 minimum wage has not. Since the financial collapse of 1982, the minimum wage
 ceased being adequate. Recent data on urban areas indicate that 14 percent of
 urban workers earn less than one minimum wage, 41 percent earn between one and
 two minimum wages, and 32 percent earn between two and five minimum wages.
 The FLL sets 48 hours as the standard legal workweek. The FLL provides that
 workers who are asked to exceed 3 hours of overtime per day or work any overtime
 on 3 consecutive days must be paid triple the normal wage. For most industrial
 workers, especially unionized ones, the real workweek has declined to about 42
 hours, although they are paid for a full 48 hours. (This is why unions jealously de-
 fend the legal ban on hourly wages in favor of daily wages.)
 Mexico's legislation and rules regarding employee health and safety are relatively
 advanced. All employers are bound by law to observe the "General Regulations on
 Safety and Health in the Workplace" issued jointly by the Secretariat of Labor and
 Social Welfare (STPS) and the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). In addi-
 tion, in late 1991 the maquiladora associations in northern border states agreed to
 cooperate in a special proram with STPS and IMSS health and safety experts to
 help their member companies overcome any deficiencies in their compliance.
 The focal point of standard setting and enforcement in the workplace is in FLL-
 mandated bipartite (management and labor) safety and health committees in the
 plants and offices of every company. These meet at least monthly to consider work-
 place safety and health needs and file copies of their minutes with federal or state
 labor inspectors. Government labor inspectors schedule their own activities largely
 in response to the findings of these workplace committees. Individual employees
 may aso omplain directly to the Offie of Labor Inseion or the Genersr Direc-
 torat of Medicine and Safety in the Workplace. Workers may remove themselves
 from hazardous situations without jeopardizing their employment. Complaints may
 be brought before the Federal Board of Conciliation and Arbitration at no cost to
 the plaintiff. Mexican labor and social security officials report that compliance is
 reasonably good by moat large companies, beth foreign-owned and domestic. Most
 ompliane difficulties occur with small businesses, few of which export any goods
 or services.
