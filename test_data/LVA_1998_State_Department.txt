 LATVIA
 Latvia is a parliamentary democracy, which regained its independence in 1991
 after more than 50 years of occupation by the Soviet Union. The Prime Minister,
 as chief executive, and the Cabinet are responsible for government operations. The
 President, as Head of State, is elected by the Parliament. The Saeima reelected
 
 
 1352
 President Guntis Ulmanis to a second 3-year term in June 1996. The October elec-
 tions for the 100-seat Parliament (Saeima) and the national referendum for amend-
 ing the Citizenship Law to meet European standards were free and fair. The judici-
 ary is independent but not well-trained, efficient, or free from corruption.
 The security apparatus consists of: The national police and other services, such
 as the Special Immigration Police and the Border Guards, who are subordinate to
 the Ministry of Interior, municipal police under local government control; the Coun-
 terintelligence Service and a protective service under the Ministry of Defense; and
 the National Guard, an element of the national armed forces, which also assists in
 police activities. Civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of the secu-
 ty forces. The Constitution Protection Bureau (SAB) is responsible for coordinating
 intelligence activities. However, Interior Ministry forces, municipal police, and intel-
 ligence personnel sometimes acted independently of central government authority.
 Some members of the security forces, including police and other Interior Ministry
 personnel, committed human rights abuses.
 The Latvian economy is increasingly oriented toward the private sector. About 95
 percent of agricultural land is farmed privately. The privatization of state monopo-
 lies is virtually complete. Three large enterprises-shipping, telecommunications
 and energy-have not been privatized yet, but are slated to be as soon as 1999 with
 the possible exception of the energy monopoly. The currency remained stable and
 freely traded; unemployment was 8.6 percent, up from 7.3 percent in 1997; and an-
 nual inflation was 2.8 percent, down from 7.7 percent in 1997. Per capita gross do-
 mestic product (GDP) was approximately $2,556, continuing the rise begun in 1996.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens and the
 large resident noncitizen community, although problems remained in certain areas.
 Members of the security forces, including the police and other Interior Ministry per-
 sonnel, continued to use excessive force; police and prison officers beat and mis-
 treated detainees and inmates. There were reported incidents of soldiers beating ci-
 vilians, including one instance in the town of Aluksne in which a civilian died of
 his injuries. In most instances, the Government took disciplinary measures against
 those responsible. For example, the soldiers involved in the beatings and their offi-
 cers were demoted or reprimanded. Prison conditions remained poor. The inefficient
 judiciary did not always ensure the fair administration of justice. Earlier in the
 year, the former Citizenship and Immigration Department (CID), renamed the Citi-
 zenship and Migration Affairs Office, was reorganized in an effort to make it more
 streamlined and efficient. The National Human Rights Office (NHRO) and other
 human rights groups have noted its improved performance. Women are discrimi-
 nated against in the workplace. Domestic violence, trafficking in women, and child
 prostitution and abuse, are significant problems.
 In October the Saeima passed amendments to the country's 1992 Constitution,
 granting constitutional protections to human rights in Latvia that until then were
 protected by provisions in the interim Constitutional Law. In January the Govern-
 ment ratified the Council of Europe's Convention on the Prevention of Torture and
 Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and its First and Second Proto-
 cols. In November the Government opened a new refugee reception center at
 Mucinieki, on the outskirts of Riga. The NHRO continues to function independently
 and to achieve greater recognition from the public, although infighting among its
 leaders has harmed its public standing seriously.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 I a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 In 1997 unknown assailants shot and killed Janis Riba, the leader of the
 ultranationalist group, Aizargi. Riba's followers claim that the killing was politically
 motivated; others speculate that rivals within the ultranationalist movement com-
 mitted the murder. A police investigation was still under way at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture. In conjuction with the Soros Foundation and the
 NHRO, the Ministry of Interior continued its programs in educating police officers
 in human rights matters. Even so, there were credible reports that police and prison
 personnel beat and mistreated prison inmates as well as asylum seekers. In Feb-
 ruary mobile police in Viesite severely beat youths attending a rock concert. Also
 in February, four municipal policemen were arrested in Riga for extorting bribes
 from businessmen. In March the Interior Ministry dismissed four menibers of a mo-
 bile police unit stationed in Jekabpils for using excessive force against civilians. In
 
 
 1353
 March police struck elderly demonstrators with rubber truncheons (see Section 2.b.).
 In late summer, detainees at the Special Immigration police facility in Riga staged
 a hunger strike to protest unsanitary conditions. On a few occasions, soldiers at-
 tacked civilians. The Government took disciplinary measures against those involved,
 including demoting, reprimanding, or dismissing military or police who committed
 these offenses. After the highly publicized hazing incidents of 1996, military au-
 thorities took steps to curb the practice. There were no confirmed reports of hazing
 during the year.
 Prison conditions remained poor, although human rights groups noted some im-
 provements during the year. Inadequate sanitation facilities, persistent shortages of
 blankets and medical care, and insufficient lighting and ventilation are common
 problems, as is the shortage of resources in general. Detainees complain that they
 are subject to physical and psychological intimidation by prison guards. Most jails
 badly need renovation. Prison cells are often severely overcrowded and have inad-
 equate ventilation and toilet facilities. Ministry of Interior personnel stated that
 prisoners accused of crimes spend an average of 1 year in prison before trial, but
 many have been there much longer. Human rights groups are alarmed by the in-
 creasing number of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases in Latvia's prisons, and the
 Government has launched a joint project with the Soros Open Society Institute to
 address the problem. The Government also has stated its intention to continue ren-
 ovations as rapidly as its limited finances allow and has embarked on a program
 to upgrade the prison guard forte by replacing the Army draftees who now perform
 such duties with full-time professional guards. In addition, the head of the prison
 administration system visited foreign correctional institutions in the summer to
 seek ways of improving prison facilities.
 Detention facilities for asylum seekers improved dramatically with the opening of
 Mucinieki center in November (see Section 2.d.).
 The situation for some imprisoned children, who are not always separated from
 adults, remained poor. Children as young as 14 years of age were kept in unsanitary
 conditions, and suffered from disease and deprivation. Both boys and girls are sub-
 ject to violence and possible sexual abuse. Education facilities are poor or nonexist-
 ent.
 The Government permits human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no known instances of arbi-
 trary arrest. The responsibility for issuing arrest warrants was transferred from
 prosecutors to the courts in 1994. The law requires the prosecutor's office to make
 a formal decision whether to charge or release a detainee within 72 hours after ar-
 rest. Charges must be filed within 10 days of arrest. No detainee may be held for
 more than 18 months without the prosecutor presenting the case to the defendant
 and the court. Detainees have the right to have an attorney present at any time.
 These rights are subject to judicial review but only at the time of trial. There were
 credible reports that these rights are not always respected in practice, especially
 outside of Riga.
 There were no reports of forced exile, which is prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 the courts must rely on the Ministry of Justice for administrative support, and the
 judiciary is not well trained, efficient, or free from corruption.
 The Supreme Court does not have a clearly established right to rule on the con-
 stitutionality of legislation or its conformity with the country's international obliga-
 tions; however, in 1997 a constitutional court was set up to fulfill these functions.
 The seven-judge panel is authorized to hear cases at the request of state institutions
 (the President, Cabinet, Prosecutor, Supreme Court, local governments, or one-third
 of Saeima members) but not of individuals or courts. A project is currently under-
 way to expand the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court to include referrals from
 lower courts.
 The Government continues to reform the judicial system. In 1995 it completed the
 establishment of regional courts to hear appeals of lower court decisions. For more
 serious criminal cases, two lay assessors join the professional judge on the bench.
 Corruption in the judicial system reportedly is widespread. In 1997 the judges ap-
 pointed to preside over the trial of the president of the collapsed Bank Baltija,
 Aleksander Lavent, resigned from the case, citing alleged political pressure from the
 Government. The accusation came after the judges released Lavent to house arrest
 following a heart attack that he suffered in the courtroom on the first day of the
 trial. In December the courts determined that Lavent had recovered his health, and
 he was returned from house arrest to prison. The trial of Lavent and his alleged
 accomplices is scheduled to resume in January 1999.
 
 
 1354
 Most judges have inadequate judicial training, and the court system is too weak
 to enforce many of its decisions. A major difficulty in enforcing court decisions is
 the lack of an effective bailiff or sheriff system. In April in a decision that caused
 a public outcry, Armands Stendzenicks, who had been extradited from Germany on
 charges of embezzlement, was released from prison on bail through the mishandling
 of prosecutors and the courts. Stendzenicks subsequently was reincarcerated for al-
 legedly obstructing justice. In June the Prosecutor General successfully appealed the
 light sentence handed down to Mafia boss Ivan Haritonov and secured a sentence
 of 8 years' imprisonment.
 Court decisions are not published systematically, nor is there a centralized index
 for those that are published. Trials may be closed if state secrets might be revealed
 or to protect the interests of minors. All defendants have the right to hire an attor-
 ney, and the State will lend funds to destitute defendants for this purpose. Defend-
 ants have the right to read all charges, confront all witnesses, and may offer wit-
 nesses and evidence to support their case. They may also make multiple appeals of
 adverse verdicts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that law enforcement authorities have a judicial warrant in order to inter-
 cept citizens' mail, telephone calls, or other forms of communication. The laws pro-
 tecting privacy apply to citizens and noncitizens equally. There were no credible re-
 ports of the unsanctioned taping of the telephone conversations of public officials,
 such as came to light in 1996.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. The
 1991 Press Law prohibits censorship of the press or other mass media. Most news-
 papers and magazines are privately owned. Newspapers in both Latvian and Rus-
 sian publish a wide range of criticism and political viewpoints.
 A large number of independent television and radio outlets broadcast in both Rus-
 sian and Latvian, and the number of people receiving satellite television broadcasts
 continued to increase.
 The Law on the Media, revised in October, contains a number of restrictive provi-
 sions regulating the content and language of broadcasts. No more than 25 percent
 of private broadcasts may be in languages other than Latvian; in prime time, 40
 percent of television broadcasts must be of Latvian and 80 percent of European ori-
 gin. However, these provisions are not always implemented. In addition foreign in-
 vestment may not exceed 20 percent of the capital in electronic media organizations.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The authorities may not pro-
 hibit public gatherings. Organizers of demonstrations must provide advance notice
 to-local authorities, who may change the time and place of public gatherings for
 such reasons as fear of public disorder. Numerous public meetings and political
 demonstrations took place without government interference, including a reunion of
 the Latvian Legion (veterans of the German Army in World War II), commemora-
 tions of the Red Army victory in World War II, Russian-speaking minorities asking
 that Russian be made an official language and protesting delays in the issuance of
 alien resident passports, and Russian extremist groups. The Latvian Legion march
 resulted in the dismissal of the National Armed Forces commander for participating
 in the event contrary to government orders prohibiting Latvian officials from attend-
 ing. However, on March 3, police attempts to break up an illegal demonstration by
 elderly Latvian and ethnic Russian pensioners in front of the City Council resulted
 in a mobile police officer striking a protester with a rubber truncheon. There were
 no injuries, but the. incident received extensive media coverage in Russia and led
 to denunciations by the Russian Government. In January 1997 the Saeima passed
 legislation on public demonstrations that requires protesters to remain specified dis-
 tances from foreign missions, the Saeima, the Prosecutor's office, and certain other
 public institutions. While the law purports to imitate western European statutes,
 independent human rights organizations in Latvia find its provisions contradictory
 and confusing.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public organizations. How-
 ever, the Law-on Registering Public Organizations bars registration of Communist,
 Nazi, or other organizations whose activities would contravene the Constitution.
 More than 40 political parties are officially registered. Noncitizens are prohibited
 from forming political organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally respects this right in practice. Although the Government does
 
 
 1355
 
 not require the registration of religious groups, the 1995 Law on Religious Organiza-
 tions accords religious organizations certain rights and privileges only if they reg-
 ister. Under this law the Justice Ministry has registered over 800 religious con-
 gregations, including Mormons, whose previous lack of official registration had cre-
 ated difficulties in obtaining visas and residence status.
 According to the Ministry of Justice's Department of Religious Affairs, the church
 groups denied registration to date include the Latvian Free Orthodox Church, the
 Church of Christ Scientist, and the Rock of Salvation Church. On October 12, the
 Ministry of Justice registered Jehovah's Witnesses as a legal religious organization,
 reversing a 1996 decision. Foreign evangelists and missionaries are permitted to
 hold meetings and to proselytize, but the law stipulates that only religious organiza-
 tions in Latvia may invite them to carry out such activities. Foreign religious de-
 nominations have criticized this provision.
 In October Parliament adopted amendments to the Law on Education, one of
 which stipulated that religious education may be provided to students in public
 schools on a voluntary basis only by representatives of Evangelical Lutheran,
 Roman Catholic, Old Believer, Jewish, Baptist, and Orthodox religious organiza-
 tions. Students at state-supported national minority schools may also receive edu-
 cation in the religion "characteristic of the national minority." Other denominations
 may provide religious education in private schools only. In 1996, the Parliament
 adopted amendments to the Law on Religious Organizations, one of which reduced
 the number of persons necessary to seek registration as a religious organization
 from a minimum of 25 to 10 persons residing permanently in Latvia. In June Par-
 liament further amended this legislation to allow any citizens and permanent resi-
 dents included in the Inhabitant's Register to register a religion. However, asylum
 seekers, foreign embassy staff, and those in the country temporarily or in special
 status still cannot register a religious organization.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no obstacles to freedom of movement within the country, for-
 eign travel, or repatriation of citizens. Latvia has readmitted noncitizens who
 claimed refugee status in a foreign country, or who voluntarily abandoned their per-
 manent residence, and then decided to return to Latvia to live and work. Nonciti-
 zens who left Latvia as refugees based on Soviet-era persecution have no difficulty
 returning on foreign refugee travel documents for business reasons or for family vis-
 its. The Government also extends protections to noncitizen residents who travel
 abroad.
 The 1995 Law on the Status of Former Soviet Citizens stipulates that registered
 permanent resident noncitizens enjoy the rights to establish and change residences,
 travel abroad, and return to the country. Noncitizens can be granted amnesty. How-
 ever, certain rights are denied to noncitizens. Although restrictions on holding jobs
 such as airline personnel and firefighters were lifted, noncitizens still are prohibited
 from working as private detectives, armed guards, or certified attorneys. Noncitizens
 may own land in urban areas without undue complications, but in rural areas only
 under complex procedures. The law also provides for the issuance of a new nonciti-
 zen travel document verifying these rights. In April 1997 the CID began issuing a
 new, more secure aliens' passport to noncitizens. The slow pace in issuing aliens
 passports led to public protests in March, after which the Government took steps
 to speed up the process. The CID was renamed the Citizenship and Migration Af-
 fairs Office and was reorganized in an effort to make it more streamlined and effi-
 cient. The NHRO and other human rights groups have noted its improved perform-
 ance. The Government also completed the gradual phasing out of former Soviet ex-
 ternal passports, which are no longer valid for travel to and from Latvia as of De-
 cember 31.
 At the end of 1997, a group of 33 aliens remained at Olaine awaiting final deter-
 mination of their status. The Olaine detention center for asylum seekers had serious
 shortcomings and conditions were substandard. The group was relocated systemati-
 cally to the modern refugee facility at Mucinieki, which began operations in Novem-
 ber. By year's end only 10 persons of this group remained at Mucinieki.
 The Government worked closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), including on the construction of the new refugee center at
 Muciieki. The Interior and Justice Ministries are responsible for implementing the
 terms of Latvia's accession to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 done at Geneva in 1951. Special immigration police and border guards units are to
 help prescreen asylum requests. Decisions from the Citizens and Migration Affairs
 Office can be appealed to a new asylum appeals board in the Ministry of Justice.
 Training for personnel of these bodies is under way.
 The issue of provision of first asylum did not arise.
 
 
 1356
 
 Instances of alien smuggling, often central and south Asians seeking to transit
 Latvia, Western Europe, or the United States, did occur. During the first 6 months
 of 1998, immigration police arrested 227 illegal immigrants, 61 less than in the first
 6 months of 1997. According to figures provided by the immigration police, 187 ille-
 gal immigrants departed voluntarily in 1998 and 346 were deported. Latvia has ap-
 proached Russia and Belarus about concluding refugee readmission agreements, the
 lack of which poses a major barrier to effective control of the eastern border.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. There were free and fair elec-
 tions for Parliament in 1998. Candidates from 6 of the 21 participating parties, rep-
 resenting a broad political spectrum, won Saeima seats, and 72 percent of eligib le
 voters participated. Concurrently, 68 percent of the electorate participated in a pop-
 ular referendum on revising the country's Citizenship Law.
 The election law prohibits persons who had remained active in the Communist
 Party or various other pro-Soviet organizations after January 13, 1991, or who
 worked for such institutions as the KGB from seeking elected office. It also let stand
 provisions preventing noncitizens from voting in local elections.
 In June 1996, the Parliament fulfilled its constitutional responsibility to elect an
 individual to serve a 3-year term as President. The Saeima chose freely among four
 candidates in a secret ballot that resulted in the reelection of the incumbent Presi-
 dent.
 Following the restoration of independence in 1991, citizenship was immediately
 accorded only to those persons who were citizens of the independent Latvian Repub-
 lic in 1940 and their direct descendants. After independence the status of approxi-
 mately 670,000 persons changed from citizens of the Soviet Union to noncitizen resi-
 dents in Latvia. Owing to the Russification policy pursued during the Soviet era,
 ethnic Latvians constitute 56 percent of a total population of 2.5 million, and 78 per-
 cent of citizens. Ethnic Latvians do not constitute a majority in seven of the eight
 largest cities. Citizens of other ethnic origins number approximately 400,000, of
 which almost 300,000 are Russian.
 The Latvian Citizenship Law passed in 1998 includes a Latvian language and res-
 idence requirement for those seeking to naturalize, as well as restrictions on former
 Soviet intelligence- and military personnel. The law requires applicants for citizen-
 ship to renounce previous non-Latvian citizenship, to have -knowledge of the Con-
 stitution and Latvian history, and to pledge allegiance to Latvia. At present, accord-
 ing to Naturalization Board figures, nearly 95 percent of applicants pass the citizen-
 ship tests on the-first attempt.
 In addition, the October referendum brought the Law into compliance with Orga-
 nization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) standards. Amendments sig-
 nificantly eased the naturalization requirements for children born to noncitizen par-
 ents since independence and abolished the "windows" system, which restricted eligi-
 bility for naturalization in designated age groups.
 International observers, including the resident OSCE mission, credit the Govern-
 ment with establishing a competent and professional Naturalization Board with of-
 fices throughout the country to implement the law. In the estimation of the NHRO,
 the OSCE and various NGO's, the Board has sought to apply the law fairly.
 Throughout most of the year the pace of naturalization remained slow. According
 to statistics provided by the Naturalization Board, only 10,000 noncitizens, or
 roughly 7 percent of the 149,000 eligible to apply, had been naturalized by Septem-
 ber. A major study of social integration, conducted by the Baltic Data House (an
 independent market and social research center), entitled "On the Road to a Civic
 Society," was published in March. It concluded that the reasons for this relatively
 small number may include potential applicants' lack of confidence that they could
 meet language requirements, the restricted category of applicants eligible to seek
 naturalization in the first 2 years, certain benefits that flow from noncitizen status
 (such as travel without visas to Russia and exemption from compulsory military
 service), and a sense that the legal status of permanent resident noncitizens is rel-
 atively secure. However, since the referendum, the numbers of those seeking to nat-
 uralize increased significantly.
 International experts, government officials, and domestic human rights monitors
 agreed that Latvia must continue to place high priority on and devote sufficient re-
 sources to implementing the citizenship law in a fair and impartial manner, as well
 as seek ways to expedite naturalization and promote social integration. Working
 with the EU and the United Nations Development Program, the Government also
 has implemented a long-term nationwide Latvian language teaching program for
 adults and children in non-Latvian schools.
 
 
 1357
 There are no ethnic restrictions on political participation. Nonethnic Latvians, in-
 cluding ethnic Russians and the first Roma deputy in the Saeima, serve in various
 elected bodies. Noncitizen residents (the majority of whom are ethnic Russians) may
 not vote in local or national elections.
 Although women are still underrepresented in government and politics, 17 women
 won Saeima seats in the October elections (compared with only 8 in the previous
 elections). Four members of the Cabinet of Ministers (up from two in the last gov-
 ernment) are women: the Ministers of Justice and of Culture and the State Min-
 isters for Revenue and for the Environment. Two Saeima committees-the Audit
 Committee and the Credentials Committe-are chaired by women, compared with
 one previously.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A growing number of nongovernmental organizations devoted to research and ad-
 vocacy on human rights issues, including prison conditions and women's and chil-
 dren's rights, operate without government restriction. Several organizations deal
 with issues of concern to local noncitizens and other nonethnic Latvians, presenting
 them to the courts and the press.
 The Government demonstrated a willingness to engage in dialog with nongovern-
 mental organizations working on human rights issues. The Government continued
 to implement its national program for the protection and promotion of human
 rights, which was adopted in 1995 based upon the recommendations of key inter-
 national organizations. A resident OSCE mission continued to operate with a man-
 date to "address citizenship issues and other related matters."
 The National Human Rights Office remained an independent institution with a
 mandate to promote human rights, provide information on human rights, inquire
 into individual complaints, and initiate its own investigation into alleged violations.
 However, its reputation has been tarnished badly by infighting between its perma-
 nent director Olafs Bruvers and members of his staff; by charges from international
 institutions, including its primary funder, the United Nations Development Pro-
 gram, that the Office has become inefficient and politicized; and by calls from inter-
 national critics and Latvian policymakers, including the Prime Minister and Foreign
 Minister, that Bruvers step down.
 More encouraging was the fact that in May the Latvian Human Rights and Eth-
 nic Studies Center received a $20,000 award in recognition of its contributions in
 the human rights field. The European Integration Council approved a program
 aimed at fostering Latvia's integration into the European Union, which identified
 expanded language training, speeding up naturalization, and improving the work of
 the Naturalization Board as priority tasks.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 According to the 1922 Constitution, all citizens are equal under the law. In Octo-
 ber the Saeima passed amendments to the Constitution, granting constitutional pro-
 tections to fundamental human rights in Latvia. The amendments supersede provi-
 sions of the 1991 Constitutional Law, which had served in the interim, and contain
 constitutional provisions for the exercise of the freedoms of speech, religion, associa-
 tion, the press, and other basic liberties. The amendments also provide protections
 from discrimination regardless of race, sex, religion, language, or disability. Only
 citizens can vote or hold government office. Noncitizens can own land only under
 complicated procedures.
 Women.-Despite legal protections, international observers and human rights
 groups are growing increasingly concerned about problems facing women in Latvian
 society. Although no overall statistics are available, sources indicate that domestic
 violence against women, often connected with alcohol abuse, is a significant and
 underreported problem. There is also evidence to suggest that sexual harassment
 in the workplace is widespread. Women who are victims of abuse often seem to be
 uninformed about their rights and reluctant to seek redress through the justice sys-
 tem. Human rights groups assert that the legal system, including the courts, tends
 to downplay the seriousness of domestic violence and that the police are sometimes
 reluctant to make arrests in such cases. The NHRO continued to work with the In-
 terior Ministry to assist victims of domestic abuse and to sensitize law enforcement
 personnel to this problem. In August in conjunction with Nordic and Latvian organi-
 zations, it sponsored an international conference called "Women and Men in Dia-
 logue" that, among other issues concerning gender equity, discussed violence in the
 home and the workplace.
 
 
 1358
 There are no shelters designed specifically for battered or abused women. There
 is one shelter in Riga where homeless women with children may reside for up to
 2 months. Nor are there any specific rape or assault hot lines. However, NGO's re-
 port that there is a universal "crisis hot line," which victims of domestic violence
 sometimes call. (However, most callers are apparently alcoholics or persons express-
 ing suicidal wishes.)
 Police do not compile figures for domestic violence as a distinct category. Instead,
 episodes are placed under more general categories such as assault or battery. How-
 ever, police figures on rape show a decrease in rape cases over the past 3 years.
 During the year, 83 cases were reported and 68 were solved. These figures contrast
 with 1996 when there were 130 reported rapes, and 93 cases solved.
 Both adult and child prostitution are widespread, often linked to organized crime,
 and abetted by economic problems in the society. Although there is no official esti-
 mate of the number of prostitutes, unofficial figures suggest that 10,000 to 15,000
 persons work as prostitutes. Of these, an estimated 12 to 15 percent are considered
 juveniles (i.e., between the ages of 8 and 18. Although in theory children are pro-
 tected by the Constitution and the Law on the Rights of the Child, these rights only
 are enforced sporadically in the case of child prostitutes. The NHRO reports that
 adult prostitutes have no legal protections. Engaging in prostitution is technically
 against the law; however, generally neither the prostitutes nor their clients are
 prosecuted. There are no state institutions to assist prostitutes. However, the pri-
 vate Latvian Center for Gender Problems provides medical help and social support
 for prostitutes.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men. The Labor Code prohibits women
 from p erforming "hard jobs or jobs having unhealthy conditions," which are specified
 in a list agreed upon between the Cabinet and labor unions. Moreover, the code
 bans employment discrimination. In reality women frequently face hiring and pay
 discrimination, especially in the emerging private sector. According to the Central
 Statistic Bureau, the number of women in the lower income brackets exceeds that
 of men by 75 percent, while men outnumber women 2 to 1 in upper income levels.
 It is not unusual to see employment advertising that specifically seeks men. Sexual
 harassment of women in the workplace is reportedly common. Cultrl factors tend
 to discourage women from coming forth publicly with complalnts of abuse. Women
 apparently have not brought any discrimination suits before the courts. In Decem-
 ber the Cabinet of Ministers tasked the Ministry of Welfare with coordinating gov-
 ernment programs on gender equality issues and promised additional funding in
 this area.
 Women's advocacy groups are growing in size and number. They are involved in
 finding employment for women, lobbying for increased social benefits, assisting vic-
 tims of domestic, abuse, and opposing the hazing of military recruits.
 Children.-In June the Government adopted the Law on the Rights of the Child.
 The Government is currently discussing and securing funding for a state plan on
 improving the status and condition of children. Part Two of the Constitution, which
 the Saeima passed in October, contains provisions protecting the rights of children.
 Evidence suggests that abandonment and child abuse, including sexual abuse, are
 relatively widespread, as is child prostitution. Schooling is mandatory and free
 through the ninth grade, i.e., between the ages of 7 and 16. Despite the existence
 of laws on mandatory education, truancy is widespread and growing. A few chil-
 dren's advocacy groups are active, particularly in lobbying for legislation to protect
 children's rights and for increased welfare payments for children. Law enforcement
 authorities have won court suits to remove children from abusive parents and se-
 cured convictions in child molestation cases.
 The Law on the Rights of the Child and the constitutional provisions on children
 are based on Western European models and provide various protections, including
 health care and legal protections against physical abuse. However, resources are not
 adequate to enforce observance of thesepprovisions.
 Although legislation has long provided for the establishment of special institutions
 for the rehabilitation and vocational training of juvenile offenders, the Government
 has made only sporadic efforts to reduce the number of juveniles who are housed
 in adult prison facilities, but who have committed relatively minor offenses.
 People With Disabilities.-Part Two of the Constitution protects the disabled
 aganst discrimination; the Law on the Medical and Social Problems of Disabled,
 which has been in effect since 1992, assures their right of access to public facilities,
 etc. Provisions in the Labor Law and other laws protect the disabled from bias in
 the workplace and from job discrimination. In June the Cabinet of Ministers adopt-
 ed a framework documrentntitled "Equal Opportunity for Everyone.a The document
 is designed to coordinate the efforts of all branches of government in assisting the
 disabled. The Government supports special schools for disabled persons. It does not
 
 
 1359
 uniformly enforce a 1993 law requiring buildings to be accessible to wheelchairs,
 and most buildings are not. However, some larger cities, including Riga and
 Ventspils, have undertaken an extensive wheelchair ramp program at intersections.
 Religious Minorities.-There was no progress reported in apprehending the per-
 petrators of the 1995 bombing of a Riga synagogue. In April another bomb exploded
 at the synagogue, causing considerable property damage. President Ulmanis, the
 Prime Minister, and others condemned the bombing and enlisted the assistance of
 foreign experts in launching an investigation. The Government also fired the State
 Police chief and other ranking police and Ministry of Interior officers for failing to
 protect the synagogue. In June two youths were arrested for painting anti-Semitic
 slogans on a wal opposite the synagogue. The Government has not yet decided on
 actions or legal proceedings against the youths. There also were incidents in Liepaja
 and other places in which Jewish monuments were defaced. Police have not yet de-
 termined the culprits..
 In 1998 a politician belonging to Latvia's largest nationalist party, For Fatherland
 and Freedom, republished a Nazi era, anti-Semitic book, "The Horrible Year." (The
 book also appeared for sale in the party's bookstores in Riga, although party leaders
 claim that they had not authorized its sale there.) The-Government criticized the
 contents of the book and its reissuance, and called on the State Prosecutor's office
 to investigate whether the book's publication violated the law.
 President Ulmanis consulted with members of the Jewish Survivors of Latvia or-
 ganization and well-known Latvian historians on establishing a special historical
 commission to evaluate the Holocaust and other events of 20th century Latvian his-
 tory. The University of Latvia established a Judaic studies center in the summer.
 The mayor of Riga commemorated the deeds of Zanis Lipke, a Latvian blue-collar
 worker who saved the lives of more than 50 Jews during the occupation of Riga,
 by renaming a street in the former ghetto in his honor. After prolonged negotiations,
 the German Government in August agreed to provide $1.2 million (2 million
 Deutschmarks) to create a medical center for the victims of the Nazi occupation.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Of Latvia's more than 2.5 million inhab-
 itants, there are approximately 1.1 million persons of non-Latvian ethnicity, includ-
 ing more than 765,000 ethnic Russians, 100,000 ethnic Belarusians, almost 70,000
 ethnic Ukrainians, and more than 60,000 ethnic Poles. More than 70 percent of Lat-
 via's inhabitants are citizens, including nearly 400,000 persons who belong to na-
 tional or ethnic minorities. There are approximately 687,000 noncitizens, of which
 an estimated 65 percent are Russian; 12 percent, Belarusian; 9 percent, Ukrainian;
 and smaller percentages of Poles, Lithuanians, Jews, Roma, Germans, Tatars, Esto-
 nians, and Armenians. Because of certain lingering anachronisms in the law, per-
 sons belonging to national and ethnic minorities who are not citizens occasionally
 may encounter difficulties in participating fully in civic life.
 The law provides for the basic human rights of noncitizens. It provides noncitizens
 who have been permanent residents continuously since July 1, 1992, with the rights
 to change residence, leave and return, and invite close relatives to join them for the
 purpose of family reunification. The law also provides for issuance of new travel doc-
 uments reflecting these rights. It also requires the registration of noncitizens re-
 gardless of their housing status, helping to resolve cases of persons previously un-
 registered because they lived in former Soviet military .or dormitory housing. Lat-
 via's housing patterns are now based on private, rather than communal, ownership
 of property; no new cases involving this provision of the law were reported during
 the year. However, Latvia has maintained the Soviet-era practice of requiring the
 holder's ethnicity to be printed in his passport. Groups such as Roma and
 Belarusians have complained that, because the passport is a basic form of identifica-
 tion in Latvia, the requirement has opened them to various forms of discrimination
 based on ethnicity.
 In-May the Cabinet of Ministers amended the regulations that distinguished be-
 tween citizens and noncitizens-in calculating social benefits. Various laws still pro-
 hibit employment of noncitizens in certain categories. These include restrictions on
 noncitizen employment as armed guards, private detectives, and certified attorneys.
 The NHRO found most of these practices to be consistent with international stand-
 ards and practices that allow a state to limit government employment, political par-
 ticipation, and some property rights to those persons who are citizens.
 The language law requires employees of the State and of all "institutions, enter-
 prises, and institutes" to know sufficient Latvian to carry out their profession. The
 law also requires such employees to be conversationally proficient in Latvian in
 order to be able to deal with the public. Despite the language law, there have been
 no reports of widespread dismissals, even in the city of Daugavpils, in which only
 15 percent of the population is ethnically Latvian. Moreover, Russian is the prevail-
 ing language in state-owned industrial enterprises. Nevertheless, many nonethnic
 
 
 1360
 Latvians allege that they have been disfranchised and that the language law dis-
 criminates against them. In May the Cabinet rescinded regulations that required
 Latvian language competence for a person to be registered and receive unemploy-
 ment compensation and social security benefits. There is evidence to suggest that
 the problem is not completely resolved in local government administrations outside
 Riga. Restrictive provisions that were under consideration by the Saeima Education
 and Science Committee were voted down, leaving in place the existing language law,
 which does not require the use of Latvian in public gatherings, business meetings,
 schools, etc. OSCE experts have worked closely with the Saehna on revisions to the
 Language Law that would bring it up to international standards. The debate on the
 issue is likely to occur in 1999.
 Some ethnic Russians also have complained of discrimination resulting from the
 property laws, which allow individual noncitizens to own land only under com-
 plicated procedures. Moreover, noncitizens were given fewer privatization certifi-
 cates (which can be used to purchase shares of stock and to privatize apartments
 and land) than were citizens. However, the law does. allow land ownership by com-
 panies in which noncitizens own shares. The local Russian media and the Russian
 Government also voiced concern about acts of vandalism against Soviet army war
 memorials and cemeteries. In April a bomb exploded in a park across from the Rus-
 sian Embassy, damaging a number of Embassy vehicles, but causing no injuries.
 Government officials condemned the act and launched an investigation, which is
 still ongoing. In March the Prosecutor General's office launched an investigation
 into anti-Russian statements published in the newspaper of the nationalist For Fa-
 therland and Freedom party as possible violations of the country's national and ra-
 cial equality policies. The investigation was still underway by year's end. In addi-
 tion, in July the police arrested Vilis Linins, the chief ideologue of the
 ultranationalist "Thundercross" organization, which is suspected of terrorist attacks
 against Soviet memorials and other targets. Linins was charged with sabotage and
 illegal possession of explosives and is awaiting trial. The two persons killed in the
 blast were the bombers themselves. Work on the damaged Soviet army victory
 monument in Riga (which is under around-the-clock police guard) is continuing.
 For the time being, the Government has agreed to continue using Russian as the
 language of instruction in public schools where the pupils are primarily Russian
 s eakers. It also supports schools in eight other minority languages. However, under
 the revised Education Law, the Government is to phase out its support for non-Lat-
 vian language elementary schools by 2004. Although all non-Latvian-speaking stu-
 dents in public schools are supposed to learn Latvian and to study a minimum num-
 ber of subjects in Latvian, there are shortages of qualified teachers.
 Most state-funded university education is in Latvian, and incoming students
 whose native language is not Latvian must pass a Latvian language entrance exam-
 ination. However, there are several private institutions offering higher education in
 Russian.
 Throughout the year, President Ulmanis spoke out forcefully in favor of the rights
 of ethnic minorities and of social integration, notably in the run-up to the October
 3 referendum on citizenship. On other occasions, he also has expressed his regret
 for Latvia's part in persecuting Jews during World War II and urged that such in-
 tolerance never again be permitted. The President's Council on Minorities and Na-
 tionalities, which met irregularly during 1998, failed to live up to its promise of pro-
 moting dialog between the Government and minority communities. The Cabinet of
 Ministers also created an Integration Council, composed of representatives of Lat-
 via's various ethnic groups, to devise an action plan for social integration. The Coun-
 cil's framework, outlining the plan, is nearing completion and will be presented for
 public discussion in 1999.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Law on Trade Unions mandates that workers,
 except for the uniformed military, have the right to form and join labor unions of
 their own choosing. Union membership, which had-been about 50 percent of the
 work force in 1993, continued to fall as workers left Soviet-era unions that include
 management or were laid off as Soviet-style factories failed. In general the trade
 union movement is undeveloped and still in transition from the Socialist to the free
 market model.
 Current law does not limit the right to strike. No significant job actions or strikes
 occurred in 1998. The remaining state-owned enterprises (shipping, energy and tele-
 communications) have not faced strikes, wage payment arrears, or any major labor
 problems in recent years. Almost all other businesses are now privately owned. The
 law bans dismissal of employees who have invoked the right to strike. There have
 been no reported cases of such dismissals. Unions are free to affiliate internationally
 
 
 1361
 
 and are developing contacts with European labor unions and international labor
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have the right
 to bargain collectively and are largely free of government interference in their nego-
 tiations with employers. The law prohibits discrimination against union members
 and organizers. However, some emerging private sector businesses threaten to fire
 union members. These businesses usually provide better salaries and benefits than
 are available elsewhere. The Government's ability to protect the right to organize
 in the private sector is weak.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including among children, and it is not practiced. Inspectors from the
 Ministry of Welfare's Labor Department enforce this ban.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The stat-
 utory minimum age for employment of children is 15 years, although children be-
 tween the ages of 13 to 15 years may work in certain jobs after school hours. The
 law restricts employment of those under the age of 18; for example, by banning
 night shift or overtime work. Children are required to attend school for 9 years, be-
 tween the ages of 7 and 16. Schooling is free. State authorities are lax in their en-
 forcement of child labor and school attendance laws. However, there is no evidence
 of forced or bonded labor involving children, which is prohibited by law (see Section
 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government raised the monthly minimum
 wage to about $70 (42 Lats), far below the amount that trade union officials describe
 as the bare minimum for survival. The Government has decided to raise the mini-
 mum to $85 (50 Lats) in 1999. Many factories are virtually bankrupt and have re-
 duced work hours. The Labor Code provides for a mandatory 40-hour maximum
 workweek with at least one 24-hour rest period weekly, 4 weeks of annual vacation,
 and a program of assistance to working mothers with small children. The laws es-
 tablish minimum occupational health and safety standards for the workplace, but
 these standards are frequently ignored. Workers have the legal right to remove
 themselves from hazardous work situations, but these standards are frequently ig-
 nored in practice.
