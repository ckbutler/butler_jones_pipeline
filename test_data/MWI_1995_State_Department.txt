 MALAWI
 In May 1994, the Republic of Malawi held its first democratic, multiparty elec-
 tions since independence. Bakili Muluzi was elected President, and a coalition be-
 tween the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD)
 gave him the support of 122 of the 177 seats in the National Assembly. The Malawi
 ongress Party (MCP), formerly the sole legal party, is in opposition with 55 seats.
 In May the ational Assembly ratified a new Constitution. The judiciary is gen-
 erally independent, but its reputation was damaged by government interference
 early in the trial of former president H. Kanruzu Banda and five other MCP leaders
 for the murders of three cabinet members and a member of parliament in 1984. On
 December 23, a ury found Banda and his co-defendants not guilty.
 The National olice, headed by the Inspector General of Police under the Ministl
 of Home Affairs, is responsible for internal security. Although the army is apolitica,
 the police occasionally called on the army for support. While violence and common
 crime have become frequent, there was no indication of organized activity in Malawi
 or abroad by remnants of the Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP), formerly the MCP's
 paramilitary wing. Despite notable improvements, there continued to be credible al-
 legations of human rights abuses by the police.
 Small, densely populated, and landlocked, Malawi's economy is predominately ag-
 ricultural. Over 85 percent of the population derives its income from agriculture. To-
 bacco remains the primary foreign exchange earner, other cash crops include tea,
 coffee, and sugar. Foreign aid remains a critical source of income. Breaking with
 traditional state marketing boards that controlled prices, the Government relaxed
 its control of the economy and extended market pricing to major agricultural goods.
 The economy suffered from high inflation, a shortage of foreign exchange, and
 drought. Nevertheless, it was ex ted to grow by 9.9 percent in real terms after
 a 12.4 percent decline in 1994. Per capita income is estimated at less than $100.
 Wealth remains concentrated in the hands of a small elite, many of whom remain
 aloof from national politics.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but serious
 problems remained. The police continued to abuse detainees and use excessive force
 in handling criminal suspects. In September the Government appointed a new In-
 spector General of Police, the second in 2 years, to lead a major police reform. Pris-
 on conditions remained poor. Lengthy pretrial detention, the inefficient and
 understaffed judicial system, and the diversion of resources to the Banda trial called
 into question the ability of defendants to receive a timely and, in some cases, a fair
 trial. High levels of crime have prompted angry mobs to execute alleged criminals
 summarily. The Government remained in control of the broadcast content of the na-
 tion's radio stations, but allowed the print media to report freely. The Human
 Rights Commission mandated by the Constitution to explore human rights viola-
 tions under ex-president Banda has yet to be named. Women continued to experi-
 ence severe societal discrimination, and violence against women and children re-
 mained a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-TriaIs of former life president H.
 Kamuzu Banda and 5 associates on charges related to the extrajudicial killings of
 three cabinet members and a member of parliament during the Banda era began
 
 
 157
 in July. In December Banda and the 5 other MCP leaders were acquitted (see Sec-
 tion i.e.).
 Frustrated by inadequate law enforcement and rising crime, angry mobs some-
 times resorted to vigilante justice in beating, stoning, or burning sus ected crimi-
 nals to death. The Government made no discernible effort to punish individuals who
 carried out these abuses.
 There were isolated reports of deaths of detainees while in, or shortly after release
 from, police custody. The most publicized occurred in April when the alleged killer
 of General Manken Chigawa the Army Commander, allegedly jumped to his death
 from the back of a moving police vehicle.
 b. Disappearance-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Inspectorate of Prisons, an investigative body mandated by the Constitution,
 confirmed that the police continued to physically abuse detainees. While higher
 ranking officials demonstrated familiarity with new standards for the humane treat-
 ment of prisoners, their subordinates commonly employed unacceptable techniques.
 In an attempt to promote professionalism in the police, a new Inspector General of
 Police was named in September, the second in 2 years. The Government also sought
 community involvement in its comprehensive reform of the police.
 Prison conditions remained poor. Overcrowding, inadequate nutrition, and sub-
 standard sanitation and health facilities remained serious problems. While not kept
 in separate facilities, women are segregated within the prison compound and tended
 by female warders. The Inspectorate of Prisons and local organizations monitor po-
 lice behavior and prison conditions without government interference.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Eie.-The law permits the accused to challenge
 the legality of detention, to have access to legal counsel, and to be released or in-
 formed of charges by a court of law within 48 hours. In cases where the court deter-
 mines that a defendant cannot afford to supply his own counsel, legal services are
 provided by the Government. In practice, the authorities held many detainees for
 weeks without charge because of police inability to complete investigations prompt-
 ly. With few persns able to afford legal counsel, the country's four public defenders
 were not sufficient to meet the needs of indigent detainees. October statistics from
 Malawi's four largest prisons suggested that approximately 46 percent of prisoners
 are detainees awaiting trial.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Constitution pro-
 vides for a High Court, a Supreme Court of Appeal, and subordinate magistrate
 courts. The judges and caseloads of the traditional court system were transferred
 to the magistrate courts during the first half of the year. The transfer further in-
 creased the already sizable backlog in the criminal docket.
 The Chief Justice is appointed by the President and confirmed by the National
 Assembly. Other justices are appointed by the President following a recommenda-
 tion by the Judicial Service Commission. All justices are appointed until the age of
 65 and may be removed only for reasons of incompetence or misbehavior, as deter-
 mined by a majority in Parliament and the President.
 By law, defendants have the right to a public trial but not to a trial by jury. In
 dealing with murder cases, the High Court nevertheless used juries of seven persons
 from the defendant's home district. Defendants are also entitled to an attorney, the
 right to adduce and challenge evidence and witnesses, and the right of appeal. How-
 ever, the judiciary's budgetary and administrative problems effectively denied expe-
 ditious trials for many defendants.
 The judicial system is also handicapped by serious weaknesses including poor rec-
 ordkeeping, shortage of trained personnel, and a heavy caseload. In addition, the
 Banda trial absorbed nearly the entire budget set aside for homicide trials. The
 backlog of homicide cases numbered approximately 750, half of which were more
 than 2 years old. The High Court's decisions to permit ex-president Banda to be
 tried in absentia, and initially to deny defense attorneys access to prosecution evi-
 dence in MCP leader John Tembo's trial for conspiracy to murder Malawi's Catholic
 bishops, called into question the right to due process in these cases. In particular,
 in the early stages of the trial against ex-president Banda, Tembo, and others for
 the murders of four associates in 1984, government ministers openly attempted to
 influence court proceedings. Following public criticism, the Government retreated,
 and, on December 23, the six defendants were acquitted in a jury trial.
 Many of the old repressive laws, including laws affecting freedom of the ress,
 were superseded by the new Constitution. The High Court also overturned ol laws
 which were in conflict with the Constitution. The Government named the head of
 
 
 158
 the constitutionally mandated Law Commission to oversee efforts to remove or re-
 vise outdated law, but the Commission was not operational at year's end.
 Juvenile offenders have special rights under the Constitution, including the right
 to be separated in custody from adults, to be treated in a manner which accounts
 for age and the possibility for rehabilitation, and exemption from the punishment
 of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Govern-
 ment authorities generally respected the constitutional right to privacy regarding
 person, family, home, and private communications. However, army and police forces,
 in carrying out sweeps for illegal weapons, did not obtain search warrants as re-
 quired by law. Postl authorities apparently ceased their past practice of opening
 and inspecting private correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedoms of
 speech and press, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice.
 The Government also generally tolerated the broad spectrum of political and ideo-
 logical opinion presented in the country's two dozen papers. However, media rep-
 resentatives complained about government secrecy and periodic oral threats against
 members of the press by government officials. There also were complaints that the
 Government unfairly subsidized certain newspapers through advertising revenues.
 Malawi has two radio stations. A small private station broadcasts only religious
 programming and is not permitted to broadcast news. State-owned Malawi Broad-
 casting Corporation (MBC), however, is the most important medium for reaching the
 public. MBC programming was dominated by reporting of the activities of senior
 government figures and official government positions. Parties and groups pposed
 to the Gove-nment largely were denied access to the broadcast media. The Govern-
 ment also denied applications to establish new stations, ostensibly for lack of financ-
 in $here were no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government respects these rights in
 practice. Authorities routinely granted official permits, which are required by law
 for large meetings. The Government requires organizations, including political par-
 ties, to register with the Registrar General in the Ministry of Justice. Despite fre-
 quent lenghy delays, there were no reports of groups being denied registration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Religious groups must register with the
 Government. One previously banned denomination, Jehovah's Witnesses, held a con-
 vention in Malawi in 1995.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have freedom of movement and residence within the country,
 and the right to leave and return. Although in 1994 the Government lifted restric-
 tions governing where noncitizens could reside and work, in general Asians and ex-
 patriates remained hesitant to test these new rights or to return to areas from
 which they had been displaced.
 Malawi ceased to host refugees in large numbers when the last remaining
 Mozambican refugees were repatriated in June. There was little conflict or resent-
 ment during the repatriation process and the Government cooperated with the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) throughout the year. The remaining ref-
 ugee population consists of approximately 900 "urban refugees" from Somalia, Zaire,
 Rwanda, and Burundi. Responding to local resentment over the presence of these
 refugees, the Government decided to establish a single refugee center with the sup-
 port of UNHCR funding. In February these urban refugees rioted when the Govern-
 ment phased out cash payments and required refugees to live at its designated refu-
 gee center.
 Asylum applicants are granted hearings to make their case for refugee status.
 While there were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status, the Government has become increasingly wary of those who travel long
 distances to seek asylum in Malawi.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are generally able to exercise this constitutional right. Malawi has uni-
 versal suffrage for citizens 18 years of age and older. There were allegations of vote-
 buying, intimidation, and the misuse of government assets during by-elections,
 which were consistent with common practices under the Banda regime. In one case
 
 
 where the charges were sustantiated, the Electoral Commission struck down the
 election result that had favored the ruling coalition.
 President Muluzi (UDF), Vice-President Justin Malewezi (UDF), Second Vice-
 President Chakufwa Chihana (AFORD), and a 27-member Cabinet exercise execu-
 tive authority. A legal challenge to the creation of the office of Second Vice-Presi-
 dent remained under judicial consideration throughout 1995. While the executive
 and the legislature were elected in free, democratic elections, the executive in fact
 exerted considerable influence over the legislature. In August AFORD and UDF
 agreed not to contest seats held by the other, Local elections have been postponed
 due to a lack of funds, effectively preventing the citizenry from selecting new local
 leadership. However, the Minister of Local Affairs reaffirmed the Government's com-
 mitment to the ongoing reorganization of local government structures. The Govern-
 ment generally does not interfere with the operation of opposition political parties.
 There are no laws that restrict the participation of women or minorities in the
 political process. In practice, however, women hold only a tiny number of prominent
 positions in the Cabinet, National Assembly, local government councils, and other
 public bodies. However, during the debate on the new Constitution, women's groups,
 allied with traditional chiefs, prevented the National Assembly from eliminating the
 proposed senate for budgetary reasons. With half its seats intended for female rep-
 resentatives of various interest groups, senate supporters successfully argued that
 it was the only constitutional body that ensured women's representation.
 Section 4. Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights rups operated without
 government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights
 cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 However, many local monitoring groups were not active in 1995.
 The Ombudsman, a position mandated by the Constitution, was appointed, but at
 year's end legislation was still being drafted concerning the Ombudsman's power to
 investigate and take legal action against government officials reponsible for human
 rights and other abuses. The Constitution also provides for a ational Compensa-
 tion Tribunal to entertain claims of criminal and civil liability against the former
 government. Tribunal rules and procedures neared finalization in 1995, but limited
 funds exist for compensation. Members of the Constitution's Human Rights Com-
 mission, also entrusted with monitoring and protecting against violations of con-
 stitutional rights, had not been named at year's end.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically provides for equal rights for women; forbids discrimi-
 nation based on language, culture, or religion; and generally provides every citizen
 the right to equality and recognition before the law. In practice, the capacity of gov-
 ernment institutions to assure equal rights for all citizens is limited.
 Women.-Spousal abuse, especially wife beating, is common. Malawian society
 began to take more seriously problems of violence against women. The press pub-
 lished more frequent accounts of rape and abuse, and the judiciary imposed heavier
 penalties on those convicted of rape. However, domestic violence is not discussed
 openly by women, reportedly even among themselves, and there are no confidential
 shelters or facilities for treatment of women who suffer physical or sexual abuse.
 Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes.
 Under the new Constitution, women have the right to full and equal protection
 by law and may not be discriminated against on the basis of their sex or marital
 status. In practice, however, discrimination against women is pervasive, and women
 do not have opportunities equal to those available to men. Historically, women, es-
 pecially in rural areas, have been unable to complete even a primary education and
 are therefore at a serious disadvantage in the job market. Women often do not have
 equal access to legal and financial assistance and wives are often victims of dis-
 criminatory inheritance practices in which the majority of the estate is taken unlaw-
 fully by the deceased husband's family. Women are usually at a disadvantage in
 marriage, family, and property rights but have begun to speak out against abuse
 and discrimination.
 As the coordinating body for women's organizations, the National Commission on
 Women in Development (NCWID) led the fight to create and preserve the Senate.
 It worked with a new human rights nongovernmental organization, the Society for
 the Advancement of Women, to prepare petitions and broadcasts on the Senate. The
 NCWID has undertaken workshops to educate grassroot extension workers about
 
 
 160
 the new legal status of women. The Government addresses women's concerns
 through theMinistry of Women and Children Affairs and Community Development.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for equal treatment for children under the
 law, and the Government greatly increased spending on children's health and wel-
 fare. The Government has established free primary education for all children. A few
 charitable organizations attempted to reduce the number of child beggars in urban
 areas and find alternative care for them. The problem of street children worsened
 as the number of orphans whose parents have died from HIV/AIDS has increased.
 A few small ethnic groups practice female genital mutilation (FGM), which is
 widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health. The media have also begun to report on the sexual abuse of
 children, especially in relation to traditional practices of initiation. While still
 shrouded in secrecy, emerging data on rites to initiate girls into their future adult
 roles suggest that abusive practices are widespread andmore damaging than pre-
 viously believed. Also the common belief that sex with children reduces the risk of
 AIDS contributes to the sexual abuse of minors.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not mandated accessibility to
 buildings and services for the disabled, but one of the national goals listed in the
 new Constitution is to support the disabled through greater access to public places,
 fair opportunities in employment, and full participation in all spheres of society.
 Special schools and training centers, which assist individuals with disabilities, and
 several self-supporting businesses, run by and for the disabled, have existed for
 some time.
 National Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Malawians of African heritage are members
 of indigenous tribes and are not discriminated against by government or society.
 However, noncitizens do not enjoy equal treatment. Although former restrictions on
 where Asians could live and work are now unconstitutional, only a few Asians test-
 ed the new policy (see Section 2.d.).
 The Government did not clarify its policy on tempora  em loyment permits for
 expatriates, although it granted most such applications. The  verniment's decision
 not to automatically renew the permits had caused concern and sometimes hardship
 to businessmen, teachers, health workers, and missionaries. Business residence per-
 mits are readily granted to new investors.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join trade
 unions, but unions must register with the Ministry of Labor and Manpower Devel-
 opment (MOLMD). Unionization is on the rise, but resistance on the part of many
 employers remained. Army personnel and police may not belong to trade unions.
 Other civil servants are allowed to form unions, and their various factions ended
 internal divisions in mid-November when free and fair elections resulted in a new,
 credible leadership. By December there were 13 registered trade unions. Given the
 low percent of the work force in the formal sector (about 12 percent), and the lack
 of awareness of worker rights, and union benefits only a minuscule percent of the
 work force is composed of union members. Statistics on the numbers of union mem-
 bers are not available. Unions are independent of the Government, parties, and
 other political forces. Although there are no restrictions on the number of union fed-
 erations, Malawi has only one, the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU),
 which was formed in July. All unions are affiliated to it. According to MOLMD,
 there are no unusually difficult registration procedures that would prevent a trade
 union from registering. However, the Ministry will not register more than one union
 representing a category of employees.
 Members of registered unions in "essential services" have the right to strike after
 having carried out prescribed procedures. Essential services are nowhere specified;
 they are determined by the Minister of Labor. The Trade Union Act requires that
 labor disputes in essential services be reported in writing to the Minister of Labor,
 who then attempts to negotiate a settlement. He may refer the case to a tribunal
 within 28 days of receiving the dispute report if it is not possible to reconcile the
 parties. The law implies that if a trade dispute has gone through this process, and
 if it has not been resolved or referred to a tribunal, workers in essential services
 may strike. By December there had been numerous strikes: two by civil servants,
 one by Lilongwe Water Board workers, one by air traffic controllers, and one by Ma-
 lawi Railways employees. There is no clear agreement on which strikes were legal.
 As the Trade Union Act requires that unions must approve strikes by secret ballot,
 all the strikes may have been illegal.
 The laws do not specifically prohibit retaliation against strikers. There is no pro-
 hibition on antiunion actions against unions which are not legally registered. Arbi-
 tration rulings are legally enforceable.
 
 
 161
 Unions may form or join federations and affiliate with international organizations
 with government permission.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize. The right to bargain collectively, although practiced, is only implied and not
 expressl protected by law.
 The Ministry of Labor sets minimum wage rates based on recommendations of the
 Tripartite Wages Advisory Board. In June the Government raised minimum wages
 over the objection of organized labor.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, but there are no effec-
 tive mechanisms for resolving complaints, and there is no legal requirement that
 employers reinstate workers dismissed because of union activities. When labor cases
 were reported to MOLMD offices, employers did not resist Ministry efforts to rec-
 oncile the parties.
 In August Parliament passed a bill to establish export processing zones, but by
 years end none had been established.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The new Constitution prohibits
 forced labor, and such labor is not employed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution defines children
 as those under the age of 16 years and prohibits the employment of children in work
 which is hazardous, harmful, industrial, or interferes with their education. However,
 while primary education is now free and universal, it is not compulsory. Enforce-
 ment by police and labor inspectors in MOLMD is not effective because of budgetary
 constraints. There is significant child labor on tobacco and tea estates, subsistence
 farms, and in domestic services. There is no special legal restriction on children's
 daytime work hours.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are two legislated minimum wage rates,
 but the administratively set minimum wages are insufficient to support a worker
 and family. Wage earners tend to supplement their incomes through farming activi-
 ties carried out through the extended family network. In June the urban minimum
 wage rose to roughly $0.78 (MK10.85) per day, including $0.08 for rent; in all other
 areas it is roughly $0.56 (MK7.50) per day, including $0.07 for rent. The MOLMD
 is unable effectively to enforce the minimum wage. The prescribed minimum wages
 are largely irrelevant for the great majority of citizens who earn their livelihood out-
 side the formal wage sector.
 The maximum legal workweek is 48 hours, with a mandatory weekly 24-hour rest
 period. The laws require payment for overtime work and prohibit excessive compul-
 sory overtime. However, labor inspections are more the exception than the rule, and
 the statutory restrictions are frequently violated.
 The Workers' Compensation Act includes extensive occupational health and safety
 standards. Enforcement of these standards by MOLMD is erratic, and workers-
 particularly in industrial jobs-often work without basic safety clothing and equip-
 ment. MOLMD officials say that workers have the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment. However,
 given the low level of education of most laborers and the high level of unemploy-
 ment, they are unlikely to exercise this right. Workers dismissed for filing com-
 plaints about workplace conditions can theoretically file a complaint with the near-
 est labor office or sue the employer for wrongful dismissal.
