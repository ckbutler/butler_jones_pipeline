 JORDAN
 
 The smallest and least well-endowed with natural
 resources of Arab confrontation states, Jordan has
 assumed the greatest burden is sheltering Palestinian
 refugees. This refugee population of nearly one
 million persons, almost equal to Jordan's population
 at the time of the greatest influx of refugees in
 1948-49, has imposed severe strains on the economic
 and political fabric of the country. NevertheleSs,
 Jordan has been very generous in conferring Jordanian
 citizenship on the refugees and assisting in their
 full economic, political and social integration.
 During periods of internal troubles and inter-Arab
 disputes, such as the Baghdad Pact riots of 1956 and
 the 1970 civil war with the Palestinians there have
 been some curtailment of political rights and occa-
 sional detentions without trial. These restrictions
 have been relaxed with the return of calmer times.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The use of torture is rare and is not condoned by the
 Government. No accusations of torture have come to
 the attention of the State Department in 1978.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 While persons taken into custody may occasionally be
 subjected to rough treatment by their jailors, cruel
 or degrading treatment or punishment is not tolerated
 by the Jordanian Government. The State Department
 knows of no confirmed reports of prisoner mistreatment
 of any kind.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Government does not use arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment except in periods of war or major inter-
 nal turmoil. Those arrested are usually arraigned
 within 24 hours. Under Jordan's 1955 Defense Law,
 the country may be ruled by military edict in times
 of emergency. Such a state of emergency was last
 proclaimed in 1973 and is still in force. Under this
 edict, regular civilian courts continue to operate.
 However, provincial governors may arrest and bring
 to trial before a military tribunal any person con-
 sidered to be a "threat to public order or the
 general security." During the widespread civil
 strife in 1970 when the Palestinian Fedayeen chal-
 lenged the Jordanian Government, hundreds of
 Jordanians and Palestinians were taken into custody
 under military edict.
 A 1973 amnesty edict provided for the release of all
 political prisoners except those convicted of espio-
 nage. Similar amnesties have since been declared,
 including two in 1977. Such amnesties have been
 applied both.to those convicted and those held without
 trial. Amnestied individuals are often fully rein-
 stated in their previous occupations even within the
 government and armed forces. As part of their
 rehabilitation and as a means to assure loyalty,
 a few, including leaders of an abortive coup attempt,
 have been given positions of high responsibility and
 trust. In 1977 Amnesty International queried the
 Jordanian Government about reported prolonged deten-
 tion of three trade unionists who were members of
 the Communist Party. All three had been released
 prior to receipt of the inquiry. Amnesty International
 has not espoused the case of any prisoners in Jordan.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the 1955 Defense Law, certain civil crimes,
 such as embezzlement by government employees, black
 marketeering, trafficking in narcotics or weapons,
 security offenses and espionage, may be tried by
 military courts when martial law is in effect, as
 it has been since 1973. Judgment handed down by
 military courts cannot be appealed.
 
 
 575
 However, the majority of offenses and suits are
 settled in civil courts in fair and public trials
 with a full appeals process and independent judiciary.
 There is a third set of generally fair and impartial
 courts with an independently certified judiciary
 which handles domestic relations within the framework
 of traditional Muslim and Christian religious laws.
 The purview of these courts has been shrinking over
 the years and now encompasses only such matters as
 marriage, divorce, adoption, custody of minors and
 inheritance.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary entry of private homes by Jordanian authori-
 ties is against the law and has not occurred to our
 knowledge. Arrests are made in homes only on the
 authority of the equivalent of legal warrants.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Despite its scarcity of natural resources, Jordan has
 pursued since 1958 economic and social development
 programs aimed at improving the welfare of its popu-
 lace and attaining an economy which by the 1980s would
 not be dependent on foreign assistance to balance its
 budget or feed its people. These plans suffered a
 severe setback in 1967, when Jordan lost its most
 productive land to Israeli occupation and, within a
 few days, acquired more than 200,000 additional
 refugees. In 1970 an internal war with the Palestin-
 ians again forced postponement of long-range develop-
 ment plans in favor of short term recovery measures.
 The momentum of development has been regained, and
 Jordan has registered impressive gains, although it
 continues to depend heavily on external financial
 assistance. One international agency has noted
 specifically the success of Jordan's economic develop-
 ment policies. Heavy emphasis has been placed on the
 development of water resources, reforestation, expansion
 of agriculture, tourism and development of manpower
 skills. The United States is assisting Jordan in some
 of these areas. Several projects now in the planning
 
 
 576
 stages will provide a safe water supply to three major
 urban and many rural localities. A school construction
 loan has allowed Jordan to build new schools in many
 areas of the country, and a new health project is
 expected to improve delivery of basic health services
 throughout the country. A Jordan Valley village
 development project encompasses construction of
 schools, clinics and government administration build-
 ings and provides mortgage loan funding to enable
 people to buy or improve homes. Such corruption as
 may exist does not divert significant resources from
 the poor.
 Basic education is compulsory through the equivalent
 of the eighth grade. All Jordanian citizens have
 access to higher educational and technical training,
 including scholarships abroad. These programs have
 benefited not only East Bank Jordanians but also,
 particularly since 1967, large numbers of Palestinian
 refugees who have assimilated themselves into the
 Jordanian economy and society.
 Offered Jordanian citizenship, the refugees possess the
 same rights as other citizens with respect to employ-
 ment, buying and selling land and engaging in business.
 There are exceptions however. After the 1970-71
 civil war the Government took action to reduce the
 number of Palestinians in the Civil Service, and it
 has never placed Palestinians in command of combat
 units.
 While the Jordanian budget makes no specific references
 to refugees, the allocation for education, health and
 social affairs, labor and development and reconstruc-
 tion were increased to take into account the influx of
 refugees after 1967.
 The Government of Jordan has given higher priority to
 programs for its native Jordanians and those refugees
 who have assimilated into Jordanian society than for
 those who continue to live in camps supervised by the
 United Nations   Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
 UNRWA's resources have not kept pace with the needs
 for education and training, particularly at the
 secondary level.
 
 
 577
 There is no official discrimination against women.
 Educational, social and economic opportunities are
 open to them, and with the present labor shortage
 the Government has increased its efforts to encourage
 women to enter the labor force. Although Jordan's
 society retains its traditional character of male
 predominance, public and private sector efforts to
 attract more women into the labor force are slowly
 making progress. About 14 percent of Jordan's non-
 agricultural work force is female as opposed to
 4 percent in 1975. Several women are officers in
 Jordan's diplomatic service. As an indication of the
 leading role Jordan wishes to play in the Arab world
 in improving the status of women, it hosted in 1978
 a regional United Nations conference on "Women and
 Development."
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The 1952 Constitution guarantees the liberties of
 speech, press, religion and assembly. Jordan is a
 signatory to the International Covenant on Political
 and-Civil Rights and the International Covenant on
 Economic and Social Rights. There are no restrictions
 on the right to worship. People in Jordan are in most
 instances free to express their opinions, but the
 state-controlled radio and television system, news-
 papers and periodicals, which are all subject to
 government influence, practice a form of self-
 censorship on important national security issues.
 Media criticism of the Government's domestic policies
 occurs fairly frequently, but is rarely vehement. The
 press generally adheres to the Government's position
 on major foreign policy issues. Newspapers are occa-
 sionally closed down temporarily for printiig articles
 of which the Government strongly disapproves. Such
 suspensions were limited to two in 1978, each of three
 days' duration. Both suspensions were imposed to stop
 rumors, in one case that the Government was planning
 
 
 578
 a general amnesty and in the other that the Government
 was planning to use part of the increased subsidies
 resulting from the Baghdad Arab summit to raise civil
 service and military salaries. The Government has
 recently permitted greater press freedom.
 On Middle East issues the press has almost consistently
 taken a more radical approach than the government.
 Articles by members of the opposition, and most recent-
 ly come by prominent members of the PLO such as
 Ibrahim Baker (a member of the Palestine National
 Committee) have begun to appear.
 The right of assemply is restricted in certain respects;
 see 3.c. below.
 Jordan's labor movement is officially encouraged by
 the Government. Over the past year, union leaders
 have been increasingly urged by the Government to
 involve themselves actively in community service
 projects to benefit not only union members and their
 families, but non-union citizens as well. Thus union-
 sponsored health clinics provide health care to anyone
 who seeks it. Government supervision of union
 activities, and of union elections in particular, was
 much lighter in 1978 than in the past. Strikes
 infrequently occur and are officially prohibited.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Jordanians, including Palestinians (who are eligible
 for travel documents on the same basis as other
 Jordanian citizens), are free to travel within the
 country, except into military areas, and to go abroad.
 They are allowed to emigrate freely.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Organized political opposition currently is not
 permitted. Thus the right of assembly is restricted.
 There is a Parliament which includes both elected
 members and appointees of the Crown. The Senate's
 thirty members are appointed; the sixty members of the
 Chamber of Deputies are elected. The current parlia-
 ment was adjourned sine die by the King in 1967, and no
 
 
 579
 parliament has subsequently been convened, although a
 consultative assembly was established in 1978.
 Parliamentary elections have been postponed for the
 indefinite future because of the impossibility of
 conducting Jordanian elections in the occupied West
 Bank.
 In an attempt to broaden the base of his Government,
 King Hussein instituted in 1978 a National Consulta-
 tive Council (NCC) with appointed representatives from
 most areas and from the various social, ethnic and
 tribal groups found in Jordan. Several pieces of
 legislation, including a controversial new civil
 service law, have been referred to the council for
 consideration and advice. The NCC does not have a
 veto power over governmental actions, but it appears
 that the NCC is providing a forum for useful dialogue
 between the Government and the public.
 In accord with ancient Arab and particularly Bedouin
 traditions, any citizen can petition for redress of
 grievances directly to the King, the Crown Prince and
 other senior government officials. Written petitions
 are often thrust into the hands of the King when he
 appears in public. The halls of government are filled
 daily with ordinary citizens seeking assistance or
 redress. Many receive satisfaction.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Jordanian Government is sensitive to outside
 monitoring or criticism of its policies with respect to
 human rights, which it views as an internal matter. It
 has not, however, made any specific effort to inhibit
 outside inquiries or studies-of these policies.
 Amnesty International has made inquiries about human
 rights matters form time to time. Jordan has offi-
 cially denied allegations of human rights violations.
 In 1977, Amnesty International protested the detention
 of three people who had been released a month before
 the protest. Jordan supports international progress
 on human rights issues, and is willing to do so publicly.
 
 
 580
 It has been particularly active in international fora
 on the question of the treatment of prisoners in the
 occupied West Bank.
