 BAHAMAS
 The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a constitutional,parliamentary democracy
 and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Queen Elizabeth , the nominal
 head of state, is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister Hu-
 bert A. Ingraham's Free National Movement (FNM) has controlled the Government
 and Parliament since August 1992. The judiciary is independent.
 The police and the sma B   ames Defence Force answer to civilian authority and
 generally respect laws protecting human rights. However, there continue to be re-
 ports that police occasionally abuse detainees.
 The economy depends primarily on tourism, which accounts for over two-thirds of
 the gross domestic product. Financial services, particularly offshore banking and
 trust management, are also a major source of revenue. While some citizens enjoy
 relatively high average income levels, there is considerable underemployment and
 poverty. The official unemployment rate is over 13 percent, but unofficial estimates
 range up to twice that figure.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of democratic freedoms and human rights. The prin-
 cipal human rights problems include reports of occasional police abuse of detainees,
 continuing harsh conditions at the only prison, delays in trials, violence and dis-
 crimination against women, and violence against children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 In September a bank robber was shot and killed during an exchange of fire. Police
 officials denied responsibility for the shooting, and some evidence reportedly sup-
 ports their contention. Investigations were not complete by yearls end. In another
 case, a court acquitted the two police officers dismissed from the force and charged
 with murder in the 1995 death of a third officer.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel and degrading treatment or pun-
 ishment, but corporal punishment-abolished in 1984-was reinstated in 1991.
 In February police officers shot a citizen after a high-speed chase in Nassau. The
 victim was driving a car similar to one from which shots had been fired at police
 officers. The Government almost immediately offered a public apology to the victim
 and his family and made financial arrangements for his medical treatment and
 other compensation. The police claim that the use of deadly force was justified
 under the circumstances and did not discipline the officers involved.
 Human rights monitors and members of the general public continued to express
 concern over instances of police abuse against criminal suspects. Many of the
 charges of abuse involved beatings in order to extract confessions. Police officials de-
 nied that there have been violations of defendants' rights. According to the officials,
 a defendant's rights are protected by the trial judge, who determines the admissibil-
 ity of a defendant's statement as evidence at trial. The Police Complaints and Dis-
 
 
 cipline Unit, which reports directly to senior police officials, is responsible for inves-
 tigating allegations of police brutality.
 Conditions at Fox Hill, the only prison, continue to improve, but remain harsh
 and overcrowded. The men's prison, originally built in 1953 to house about 600 in-
 mates holds over 1,200 prisoners. The women's prison population is around 30, con-
 siderably less than full capacity. Male prisoners are crowded into poorly ventilated
 cells that generally lack running water and adequate sanitation facilities. There are
 no separate facilities for inmates being held on remand, although some are eventu-
 ally segregated in a medium security wing after being processed through maximum
 security. Prison officials estimate that about 13 percent of the incoming prisoner
 population is infected with the HIV virus. Most prisoners lack beds, many sleep on
 concrete floors, and most are locked in their celia 23 hours per day. Facilities for
 women are less severe and do have running water. Organizations providing aid,
 ounseling servies, and religious instruction have regular access to inmates.
 The Government providedfunds to enable prison officials to make improvements
 in prison facilities and to continue prisoner rehabilitation programs. Modern train-
 ing facilities include new computers and personnel to train the officers and staff.
 The prison has installed a computer system for its records, with plans for future
 links with the courts as well as law enforcement entities. A new entrance facility
 and visitor center was completed, with equipment to screen visitors for contraband.
 As risoners are moved into two planned new facilities, much-needed renovation is
 set for the maximum security unit.
 Local and international human rights groups were able to visit the prison during
 the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. The authorities conduct arrests openly and, when required, ob-
 tain judicially issued warrants. Serious cases, including those of suspected narcotics
 or firearms offenses, do not require warrants where probable cause exists. Arrested
 persons appear before a magistrate within 48 hours (or by the next business day
 for cases arising on weekends and holidays) to hear the charges against them. They
 may hire an attorney of their choice. The Government does not provide legal rep-
 resentation except to destitute suspects charged with capital crimes. Police some-
 times deviate from prescribed procedures, however, and act arbitrarily. The Govern-
 ment respects the right to a judicial determination of the legality of arrests.
 Judges tend not to grant bail to foreign suspects, particularly on more serious of-
 fenses, since the authorities consider foreign offenders likely to flee if released on
 bail. Judges sometimes authorize cash bail for foreigners arrested on minor charges,
 but in practice, foreign suspects generally prefer to plead guilty and pay a fine rath-
 er than pursue their right to defend themselves, given possible delays in court cases
 and harsh conditions in the prisom There were complaints of excessive pretrial de-
 tention. In December Parliament amended the Bail Act to prohibit bail for repeat
 offenders and those accused of certain violent crimes.
 The authorities detain illegal migrants, primarily Haitians and Cubans, at the
 Carmichael Road Detention Center until arrangements can be made for them to
 leave the country. Illegal migrants convicted of crimes other than immigration viola-
 tions are held at the prison and remain there for weeks or months, pending deporta-
 tion after serving their sentences, unless they can arrange private means for their
 repatriation. Security concerns again forced the authorities to transfer groups of
 Cuban detainees temporarily from the detention center to the prison. These detain-
 ees have all since been released or deported.
 Exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The justice system derives from English common
 law. The judiciary, appointed by the Governor General on the advice, in most cases,
 of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission, has always been independent. Mag-
 istrates courts are the lowest level courts and only handle crimes with a maximum
 sentence of 5 years. Trial by jury is only available in the Supreme Court, which is
 the trial court that handles most major cases. Its decisions may be appealed to the
 the Court of Appeal, with the Privy Council in London being the final court of ap-
 peal.
 Trials are fair and public, defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and the
 right to appeal. The judicial system is plagued by a large backlog of cases. This situ-
 ation improved somewhat over the year because of the efforts of the Government
 to introduce a case management system. The training of court reporters, completed
 in 1996, also helped to speed up trials. Despite these measures to improve efficiency
 in the courts, complaints persist of excessive pretrial detention and delayed justice
 for victims.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the Government gen-
 erally respects these prohibitions in practice. The law usually requires a court order
 for entry into or search of a private residence, but a police inspector or more senior
 police official may authorize a search without a court order where probable cause
 of a weapons violation exists. Such an official may also authorize the search of a
 person (which extends to the vehicle in which the person is traveling) without a
 court order, should probable cause exist for drug possession.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government respects the constitutional pro-
 vision for the right of free expression, and the political opposition criticizes the Gov-
 ernment freely and frequently. Three daily and several weekly newspapers, all pri-
 vately owned, express a variety of views on issues of public interest, including vary-
 ing degrees of criticism of the Government and its policies. Foreign newspapers and
 magazines are readily available.
 There is a government-run radio station and three privately owned radio broad-
 casters. The country's sole television station, the state-owned Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion of the Bahamas, presents a variety of views, although opposition politicians
 claim with some justification that their views do not receive as extensive coverage
 as those of the Government.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights to free assembly and association, and the authorities respect these rights
 in practice. The law permits private associations, but groups must obtain permits
 to hold public demonstrations. The authorities grant such permits almost without
 exception.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Govern-
 ment provided first asylum to 47 persons (46 Cuban nationals and 1 Liberian) in
 1996, based on recommendations by the UNHCR. There were no reports of forced
 return of persons to a country where the feared persecution.
 Although the repatriation agreement between the Bahamas and Haiti expired at
 the end of 1995, the Government continued to repatriate illegal Haitian immigrants
 based on the terms of the agreement. The Bahamas signed a repatriation agreement
 with the Government of Cuba in January, and since then the authorities success-
 fully repatriated illegal Cuban immigrants.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy with two major politi-
 cal parties and general elections at least every 5 years. An elected Prime Minister
 and Parliament govern. The political process is open to all elements of society, and
 citizens 18 years of age and older are eligible to register and vote; voting is by secret
 ballot. Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in 1997. In the 1992 elec-
 tions, slightly more than 92 percent of registered voters cast valid ballots. The two
 principal political parties are the ruling Free National Movement and the opposition
 Progssive Liberal Party (PLP). The PLP led the country for 6 years of internal
 self-government from 1967 to 1973, and held power from independence in 1973 until
 1992.
 The FNM holds 32 of 49 seats in the House of Assembly, and the PLP holds 17.
 Both the ruling party and the opposition name members to the upper house-the
 Senate-in compliance with constitutional guidelines. Although it does pass legisla-
 tion, the Senate is primarily a deliberative body that serves as a public forum to
 discuss national problems and policies to address them.
 The Parliament has four elected female members, including the deputy speaker
 of the House, and three appointed female Senators, including the government leader
 in the Senate. A woman serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Attorney General.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Individual human rights monitors and several local human rights groups, as well
 as representatives of international human rights organizations, operate freely, ex-
 pressing their opinions and reporting their ffiding on alleged human rights viola-
 tions without government restriction. The Government allows them broad access to
 institutions and individuals.                                               I
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government generally respects in practice the constitutional provisions for in-
 dividual rights and- freedoms regardless of race, place of origin, political opinion,
 creed, or sex. However, both the Constitution and the law discriminate against
 women in several respects.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women continued to be a serious problem,
 with many women seeking shelter at the private, but government-suported, crisis
 center in Nassau. The Government has established a nationwide to -ree hot line,
 with two trained volunteers on each of the inhabited islands on call to respond in
 the event of a crisis. The crisis center, with help from the Government, instituted
 a public awareness campaign to highlight the problems of abuse and domestic vio-
 lence. The Domestic Court, which deals exclusively with' family issues such as
 spousal abuse, maintenance payments, and legal separation, continued to receive a
 high volume of cases. The court can and does impose various legal constraints to
 protect women from abusive spouses or companions.
 The Constitution discriminates against women by not providing them with the
 same right as men to transmit citizenship to their foreign-born spouses. Addition-
 ally, the law makes it easier for men with foreign spouses to confer citizenship on
 their children than for women with foreign spouses. Some inheritance laws also
 favor men over women. For example, when a person dies without a will, the estate
 p asses to the oldest legitimate son, or in cases where there is no son, the closest
 legitimate male relative. Prominent women of all political persuasions continue to
 push for an amendment to the Constitution and reated laws to redress this situa-
 tion.
 Women participate fully in society and are well represented in the business and
 professional sectors, as well as in the judiciary and the Government. The Minister
 of Foreign Affairs and Attorney General, Janet Bostwick, also directs the Bahamian
 Bureau of Women's Affairs, which is within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Children.-The Government places priority on maintaining adequate expenditures
 for child welfare and education. However, child abuse and neglect remain serious
 problems. The law requires that anyone having contact with a child they believe to
 be sexually abused must report their suspicion to the police. The same reporting re-
 quirement does not apply to cases of physical abuse, which nonetheless are high.
 The police refer reported cases of sexual and physical abuse to the Department of
 Social Sorvices, which investigates them and can bring criminal charges against
 perpetrators. The Department may remove children from abusive situations if the
 court deems it necessary.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the 1973 National Building Code mandates
 certain accommodations for the physically disabled in new public buildings, the au-
 thorities rarely enforce this part of the code. The code fails to mandate accmmoda-
 tion in new private buildghowever, which often lack accessibility as welL
 The Disability Affairs Unit of the Ministry of Social Development and National
 Insurance works with the Bahamas Council or Disabiity, anumbrella organization
 for groups offering services for the disabled, to provide a coordinated public and pri-
 vate sector approach to the n    of the disabled. A mix of government and private
 snal           nonresidential institutions provides a range of educational, training,
 and counseling services for bth physically and mentally disabled adults and chil-
 dren. In January the Government opened a new training center, with emphasis on
 computer training, within a private residential institution. Graduates of the center
 were working within government and the private sector by the end of the year. The
 Ministry's national policy statement, presented to the Government in January, is
 still under consideration.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoities.An estimated 30,000 Haitians reside in the
 Bahamas legally and productively, but social, economic and political sensitivities re-
 main. Members of the Haitian community reported that some police and immigra-
 tion officials have taken Haitians off the streets into custody before allowing them
 a chance to produce their residency permits. Haitians also complained that officials
 sometimes came to their residences late at night, a violation oftheterms of the ex-
 pired Bahamas-Haiti repatriation agreement. These alleged violations are difficult
 
 
 to confirm, but some similar past complaints resulted in procedural changes by the
 authorities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that labor unions have the
 right of free assembly and association. Private sector and most public sector workers
 may form or join unions without prior approval. Members of the police force, defense
 force, fire brigade, and prison guards may not organize or join unions. Workers exer-
 cise the right of association extensively, with almost one-quarter of the work force
 (and one-half the workers in the important hotel industry) belonging to unions.
 The country's two major umbrella labor organizations, the National Workers
 Council of Trade Unions and Associations and the Trade Union Congress (TUC),
 and individual labor unions all function independent of government or political
 party control. A third umbrella organization, the National Congress of Trade
 Unions, continued to grow, adding the third largest union, the Bahamas Union of
 Teachers, to its membership.
 The Industrial Relations Act requires that, before a strike begins, a simple major-
 ity of a union's membership must vote in favor of a motion to strike. The Depart-
 ment of Labor must supervise the vote. Unions have instituted slowdowns or stop-
 pages at the Bahamas Electricity Corporation, the Water and Sewerage Corpora-
 tion, the Ministry of Public Works, Bahamasair, and a popular restaurant in Nas-
 sau. In order to resolve trade disputes more quickly, the Industrial Relations Act
 was amended in July to establish the industrial tribunal. According to the act, trade
 dispute matters are first filed with the Ministry of Labor and then if not resolved,
 turned over to the tribunal. The tribunal will follow normal court procedures for the
 admission of evidence, direct examination, and cross examination. The tribunals de-
 cision is final and is only appealable in court on a strict question of law.
 All labor unions have the right to maintain affiliations with international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers freely exercise their
 right to organize and participate in collective bargaining, which the law protects.
 Unions and employers negotiate wage rates without government interference.
 The Constitution and the Industrial Relations Act prohibit antiunion discrinina-
 tion by employers. The act requires employers to recognize trade unions, and it re-
 quires the reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. Employers may dis-
 miss workers in accordance with applicable contracts,-which generally require some
 severance pay. The Government enforces labor laws and regulations uniformly
 throughout the country. City Markets, one of the largest grocery chains, filed a law-
 suit in September to void the certification of the Commercial Stores, Supermarkets,
 and Warehouse Workers' Union as the bargaining agent for its workers.
 There are two small free trade zones. Labor law and practice in these zones do
 not differ from  the    e rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and such labor does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits the employment
 of children under the age of 14 for industrial work, work during school hours, or
 work at night. There is no legal minimum age for employment in other sectors, and
 some children work part time in light industry and service jobs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the regu-
 lar workweek to 48 hours and provides for one 24-hour rest period. The act requires
 overtime payment (time and a hail) for hours beyond the standard. The act permits
 the creation of a Wages Council to recommend the setting of a minimum wage, but
 the Government has never established such a council or a general minimum wage.
 However, in September the Government established a specific minimum wage for
 all hourly and temporary workers throughout the public sector.
 The Ministry of Labor, responsible for enforcing labor laws, has a team of inspec-
 tors who conduct on-site visits to enforce occupational health and safety standards
 and investigate employee concerns and complaints, hut inspections occur only infre-
 quently. The Ministry normally announces inspection visits in advance, and employ-
 ers generally cooperate with inspectors to implement safety standards.
 The national insurance program compensates workers for work-related injuries.
 The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to find suitable alternative em-
 ployment for employees injured on the job but still able to work. The law does not
 provide a right for workers to absent themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
