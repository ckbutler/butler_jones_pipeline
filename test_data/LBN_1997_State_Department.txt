 LEBANON
 Lebanon is a parliamentary republic in which the President is by tradition a
 Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of the
 Chamber of Deputies a Shi'a Muslim. The Parliament consists of 128 deputies,
 equally divided between Christian and Muslim representatives. The judiciary is gen-
 erally independent, but is subject to political pressure.
 Non-Lebanese military forces control much of the country. These include about
 25,000 Syrian troops, a contingent of Israeli army regulars and an Israeli-supported
 militia in the south, and several armed Palestinian factions. All undermine the au-
 thority of the central Government and prevent the application of law in the patch-
 work of areas not under the Government's control. In 1991 the governments of Syria
 and Lebanon concluded a security agreement that provided a framework for security
 cooperation between their armed forces. However, Syrian military intelligence units
 in Lebanon conduct their activities independently of the agreement.
 In 1989 the Arab league brokered a peace settlement at Taif, Saudi Arabia, to end
 the civil war in Lebanon. According to the Taif Accord, Syrian troops were to be re-
 deployed from their positions in Lebanon's coastal population areas to the Biqa' Val-
 ley, with full withdrawal contingent upon fulfillment of other aspects of the Taif Ac-
 cord and subsequent agreement by both the Lebanese and Syrian governments. Al-
 though the Syrian Government has refused to carry out this withdrawal from the
 coastal areas, strong Syrian influence over Lebanese politics and decisionmakers
 makes Lebanese officials unwilling to press for a complete withdrawal. The relation-
 ship with Syria does not reflect the will of most Lebanese citizens.
 Israel exerts control in and near its self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Leb-
 anon through its surrogate, the South Lebanese Army (SLA), and the presence of
 about 1,000 Israeli regular troops. The Iranian-backed Shi'a Muslim faction
 Hizballah, with the tacit support of the Government and, to a lesser extent, Pal-
 estinian guerrillas continue to be locked in a cycle of attack and counterattack with
 Israeli and SLA troops typically. Palestinian groups operate autonomously in refu-
 gee camps throughout the country. During the year, the Government continued to
 consolidate its authority in the parts of the country under its control, and took ten-
 tative steps to extend its authority to the Biqa' Valley and Beirut's southern sub-
 urbs. However, it did not attempt to reassert state control over the Palestinian refu-
 gee camps, nor to disarm Hizballah and the SLA or dislodge Israel from the south.
 The security forces comprise the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which may arrest
 and detain suspects on national security grounds; the Internal Security Forces
 (ISF), which enforce laws, conduct searches and arrests, and refer cases to the judi-
 ciary; and the State Security Apparatus and the Surete Generale, both of which col-
 lect information on groups that may jeopardize state security. The Surete Generale
 is also responsible for the issuance of passports and residency permits and for cen-
 soring foreign periodicals and movies that treat national security issues. The secu-
 rity forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 Before the 1975-90 hostilities, Lebanon was an important regional financial and
 commercial center. There is a market-based economy in which the majority of the
 work force is employed in the services sector, e.g., banking and commerce. There is
 
 
 1514
 a small industrial sector, based largely on clothing manufacture and food processing.
 The gross national product is estimated to be approximately $5,000 per capita. A
 reconstruction effort, begun in 1992, is moving forward. Lebanon receives substan-
 tial remittances from abroad that offset its trade deficit and results in a balance
 of payments surplus.:
 Since the end of hostilities, the Government has taken some limited steps to im-
 prove human rights conditions and serious problems remain in several areas. Mem-
 bers of the security forces used excessive force and tortured some detainees. Prison
 conditions remained poor. Government abuses also included the arbitrary arrest and
 detention of persons who opposed government policies. Long delays in trials are a
 problem. The Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government
 also partially limited press freedom, particularly by implementing the 1996 media
 law to restrict radio and television broadcasting in a discriminatory manner. Jour-
 nalists practice self-censorship. The Government impses limits on freedom of move-
 ment. The Government continued to restrict freedom of assembly and ban dem-
 onstrations. The right of citizens to change their government remains limited by
 shortcomings in the electoral system. Although the 1996 parliamentary elections
 represented a step forward, the electoral process was flawed, as the elections were
 not prepared or carried out impartially. The Government decision to postpone mu-
 nicipal elections until April 1999 (a decision subsequently overturned by the Con-
 stitutional Council) infringed on citizens' ability to change their government at the
 local level. In December the Parliament passed a law calling for municipal elections
 in mid-1998. Discrimination against women and Palestinians, and violence against
 women are problems.
 Although the overall level of armed conflict has declined in recent years, life and
 property, especially in the south, are still threatened by artillery and aerial attacks
 by the various contending forces. These forces continue to commit abuses, including
 killings, terrorist bombings, and abductions.
 The SLA maintains a separate and arbitrary system of justice in the Israeli-con-
 trolled zone, which is independent of Lebanese central authority. During the year,
 SLA officials arbitrarily arrested, mistreated, and detained persons, and expelled
 several local residents from their homes in the zone. Palestinian groups in refugee
 camps maintain a separate, arbitrary system of justice for other Palestinians. Mem-
 bers of the various Palestinian groups that control the camps tortured and detained
 their Palestinian rivals.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-During the year, political killings
 declined as the Government further consolidated its authority over the country.
 However, there continued to be reports of extrajudicial killings. In January a sus-
 pect reportedly died while being interrogated by government agents; the suspect's
 family members asserted that he was beaten to death (see Section 1.c.). Also in Jan-
 uary, 3 Palestinians, including Jihad Ayyub of Yasir Arafat's Fatah movement, were
 killed by unidentified gunmen in the Ayn al-Hilwe refugee camp. On August 23,
 Khalil Mussawi, an Amal movement official in the village of Arzun (south Lebanon),
 was killed by unknown persons in central Beirut when an explosive detonated as
 he opened the trunk of his car.
 In January the Judicial Council found Ahmad al-Kassem, Khalid Mohammad
 flamed, and Munir Saish Abbud guilty of the 1995 assassination of a Sunni cleric,
 Sheikh Nizar Al-Halabi. The death sentence has carried out on March 24, after
 President Elias Hrawi refused an appeal for clemency. The other 14 individuals in-
 volved in the case sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 to 20 years, or were
 acquitted and released. In May the Judicial Council found former Lebanese Forces
 commander Samir Ja'Ja' guilty of attempting to kill then-Minister of Defense Michel
 Al-Murr in 1991. Ja'Ja' has sentenced to death, but the sentence has commuted to
 life at hard labor. During January the Government deported three Iraqi diplomat
 suspects in the 1994 killing in Beirut of an Iraqi dissident.
 In December the Government indicted three persons suspected of causing the
 1996 death of Akram Arbeed. The suspects allegedly beat Arbeed while he was ac-
 companying a candidate in the 1996 parliamentary elections. There were no devel-
 opments in the 1994 death of Tareq Hassaniyeh, who was allegedly beaten to death
 by authorities in the Bayt Al-Din prison, nor in the 1994 death of Fawzi Al-Racy,
 who died while in the custody of the Ministry of Defense.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The Government still has taken no judicial action against groups known to be re-
 
 
 1515
 sponsible for the kidnapings of thousands of people during the unrest between 1975
 and 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continued to be credible reports that security forces used torture on some de-
 tainees. On January 4, a suspect reportedly died while being interrogated by the
 Drug Enforcement Authority. The Government claimed that the suspect threw him-
 self from the window, but the family of the deceased asserted that he was beaten
 to death. In May unknown armed men severely beat a journalist who distributed
 leaflets critical of the Lebanese army (see Section 2.1.). No charges had been
 brought by years end.
 A 1996 court case against three policemen accused of causing paralysis in a pris-
 oner in their custody is still pending.
 Abuses also occurred in areas outside the State's authority, especially in the Pal-
 estinian refugee camps. There were credible reports that members of the various
 Palestinian groups that control the camps detained and tortured their Palestinian
 rivals.
 Prison conditions are poor and do not meet minimum international standards.
 There are only 18 operating prisons with a total capacity of 2,000 inmates. However,
 prisons are overcrowded, with a total population of nearly 5,000. Inmates also lack
 heat and adequate toilet and shower facilities. The- prison system is regulated by
 law. However, the Government has not budgeted funds to rehabilitate the prison sys-
 tem.
 In addition to regular prisons, the Surete Generale, which mans border posts, op-
 erates a detention facility. -Hundreds of foreigners, mostly Egyptians and Sri
 Lankans, are detained there pending deportation. They reportedly are held in small,
 poorly ventilated cells. Credible reports indicate that guards raped some of the Sri
 Lankan women during their detention.
 The Government does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors.
 Hizballah detains and reportedly mistreats SLA members and suspected agents
 at unknown locations. The South Lebanon Army operates its own detention facility,
 Al-Khiam prison, and there are frequent allegations of mistreatment of detainees.
 Both groups occasionally release prisoners. The SLA, for example, released some
 risoners in April and July. An ICRC-brokered exchange of one SLA prisoner for
 four Hizballah prisoners took place in April.
 Hizballah does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors. The SLA does
 not permit prison visits by human rights monitors, although it has on occasion al-
 lowed the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit detainees at Al-
 Khiam, for the purpose of delivering letters, medicine, and food from detainees' fam-
 ilies. These visits have been suspended since September.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government uses arbitrary arrest
 and detention. The law requires security forces to obtain warrants of arrest before
 making arrests. However, military prosecutors, who are responsible for cases involv-
 ing the military, as well as those involving espionage, treason, weapons possession,
 and draft evasion, make arrests without warrants. They reportedly issue blank war-
 rants of arrest to be completed after the suspect has been arrested. Arresting offi-
 cers are required to refer a suspect to a prosecutor within 24 hours of arrest, but
 frequently do not do so.
 The law requires the authorities to release suspects after 48 hours of arrest if no
 formal charges are brought against them. Some prosecutors flout this requirement
 and detain suspects for long periods in pretrial confinement without a court order.
 The law authorizes-judges to remand suspects to incommunicado detention for 10
 days with a possible extension for an additional 10 days. Bail is only available to
 those accused of petty crimes, not those accused of felonies. Defendants have the
 right to legal counsel, but there is no public defender's office. The Bar Association
 has an office to assist those who cannot afford a lawyer.
 Security forces continued the practice of arbitrary arrest, detaining mainly the op-
 ponents of the Government. In January security forces arrested the financial man-
 ager of a hotel in Beirut, a Jordanian national, releasing him after 23 days of cap-
 tivity. No charges were brought against him.
 In February military police arrested a journalist who was covering elections at a
 Lebanese university. The journalist -was accused of taking pictures of army person-
 nel inside the university. He was released after the army took the camera and de-
 stroyed the film.
 In April security forces arrested several members of a labor union who were gath-
 ered in the labor union office in Sidon to conduct elections of the labor union rep-
 resentatives. Twenty-six persons were arrested, including journalists covering the
 elections. All of those arrested were released within a few hours.
 
 
 1516
 Human rights groups credibly report that detained persons are sometimes trans-
 ferred to Syrian custody and imprisoned in Syria. The number of such persons can-
 not be determined accurately, but President Hrawi in a televised interview last year
 stated that 210 Lebanese were in Syrian custody.
 The authorities often detain for short periods and without charges political oppo-
 nents of the Syrian and Lebanese governments.
 Local militias and non-Lebanese forces continued to conduct arbitrary arrests in
 areas outside central government control. The SLA detains an estimated 150 Leba-
 nese citizens and an undetermined number of Palestinians at Al-Khiam prison in
 the south.
 In June Hizballah's security apparatus detained three UNIFIL servicemen in the
 southern suburbs of Beirut who were taking photographs of flags. The three were
 released after 10 hours. The Government did not take anypunitive action against
 Hizballah. An SLA member kidnaped in 1996 was released during a prisoner ex-
 change in October 1996.
 Syrian forces reportedly detain persons.
 In July the Israeli navy detained five fishermen off the coast of Tyre in south Leb-
 anon. On July 3, Israeli forces detained a journalist, reportedly on suspicion of col-
 laboration with Hizballah. The journalist has released on August 7. Israel holds sev-
 eral Lebanese citizens, including Sheikh Abed al-Karim Obaid and Mustafa Dirani,
 figures associated with the Islamic Resistance.
 Palestinian refugees are subject to arrest, detention, and harassment by the state
 security forces, Syrian forces, various militias, and rival Palestinians.
 Exile as a form of punishment is not regularly practiced, although in 1991 the
 Government pardoned former army commander General Michel 'Awn and two of his
 aides on the condition that they depart the country and remain in exile for 5 years.
 'Awn was accused of usurping power. The 5-year period ended in August 1996 but
 'Awn remains in France.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is generally impartial and independ-
 ent. However, influential politicians and Syrian intelligence officers sometimes in-
 tervene to protect their supporters from prosecution.
 The judicial system is composed of the regular civilian courts, the Military Court,
 which tries cases involving military personnel and military-belated issues, the Judi-
 cial Council, which tries national security offenses, and the tribunals of the various
 confessions, i.e., religious affiliations, which adjudicate disputes including marriage,
 inheritance, and personal status.
 The Judicial Council is a permanent tribunal of five senior judges that adjudicates
 threats to national security. On the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, the
 Cabinet decides whether to try a case before this tribunal.
 The Ministry of Justice appoints judges according to a formula based on the con-
 fessional, i.e., the religious affiliation, of the prospective judge. The shortage of
 judges has impeded efforts to adjudicate cases backlogged during the years of inter-
 nal conflicts. Trial delays are also caused by the Government's inability to conduct
 investigations in areas outside its control. Defendants have the right to examine evi-
 dence against them. The testimony of a women is equal to that of a man.
 Hizballah applies Islamic law in areas under its control. Palestinian groups in ref-
 ugee camps operate an autonomous and arbitrary system of justice. The SLA main-
 tains a separate and arbitrary system of justice.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 the authorities generally show little interest in controlling the personal lives of citi-
 zens, they readily interfere with the privacy of persons regarded as foes of the Gov-
 ernment. Laws require that prosecutors obtain warrants before entering houses ex-
 cept when the army is in hot pursuit of an armed attacker.
 The Government uses informer networks and monitors telephones to gather infor-
 mation on its adversaries. The army Intelligence Service monitors the movements
 and activities of members of opposition groups (see Section 2.b.). In May cabinet
 ministers conceded for the first time that telephone calls were being tapped. The
 Prime Minister publicly stated that he is among those whose telephones are tapped.
 The Speaker of Parliament alleged that cellular calls are also tapped and that more
 than one wing of the security services was involved. The Speaker formed a par-
 liamentary commission to investigate the subject.
 Militias and non-Lebanese forces operating outside areas of central government
 authority have frequently violated rights of privacy. Various factions also use in-
 former networks and monitor telephones to obtain information on their adversaries.
 On March 28, the SLA expelled a woman from the village of Hasbayya.
 In August Israeli forces expelled a Lebanese woman and her five children from
 their home in Qleia village.
 
 
 1517
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-An undetermined number of civilians continued to be killed in south Leb-
 anon,;as Hizballah, Palestinian guerrillas, and to a much lesser extent the Lebanese
 army on the one hand, and Israeli forces and the SLA on the other, engaged in re-
 curring cycles of violence. Hizballah attacked SLA and Israeli troops deployed on
 Lebanese soil. Hizballah (and possibly armed Palestinian groups) also launched
 rocket attacks against northern Israel. Israeli forces conducted repeated air strikes
 and artillery barrages on Hizballah, Lebanese army and Palestinian targets inside
 Lebanon.
 There were numerous incidents in the, cycle of attack and reprisals. On August
 18, a roadside bomb exploded near Kfar Houne in an SLA-controlled area, killing
 two teenage relatives of an SLA commander. The SLA retaliated by shelling the city
 of Sidon, killing six civilians and injuring dozens -of others. The Lebanese army re-
 sponded by shelling the SLA positions, and Hizballah later fired Katyusha rockets
 into northern Israe.
 On November 23, mortar attacks by Lebanese guerrillas killed nine Lebanese ci-
 vilians in the city of Beit Lif" in the Israeli security zone. Following its investigation
 the attack, the Israeli-Lebanon Monitoring Group (ILMG) determined that "armed
 elements" were responsible for the attack.
 In February the Israeli air force raided Baalbek and hit the building of
 Hizbalah's "Voice of-the Oppressed" radio station. In August Israeli jets destroyed
 an electrical pylon south of Beirut. In September 12 Israeli commandos were killed
 by an explosion and subsequent firefight with Lebanese army,-Hizballah, and Amal
 forces during a nighttime incursion by Israel into the central coastal region. Later
 the same month Israel fired on Lebanese army personnel carriers, killing 6 soldiers.
 The ILMG continued to deal with alleged violations of the understanding between
 Israel and Hizballah not to target civilians or launch attacks from civilian-populated
 areas.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including.
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, but the Government partially limits this right in practice, particularly by in-
 timidating journalists and broadcasters into practicing self-censorship. The Govern-
 ment imposes direct censorship on satellite broadcasts originating in Lebanon.
 Lebanon has a long history of freedom of opinion, speech, and the press. Although
 there were repeated attempts to restrict these freedoms during the year, daily criti-
 cism of government policies and leaders continued. Dozens of newspapers are pub-
 lished throughout the country, financed by various Lebanese and foreign groups.
 While the press is normally independent, press content often reflects the opinions
 of these financial backers.
 The Government has several tools at its disposal to control freedom of expression.
 The Surete Generale is authorized to approve all foreign magazines and non-periodi-
 cal works including plays, books, and films before they are distributed in the mar-
 ket. The law prohibits attacks on the dignity of the Head of State or foreign leaders.
 The Government may prosecute offending journalists and publications in the Publi-
 cations Court, a special court empowered to try such matters.
 Moreover, the 1991 security agreement between Lebanon and Syria contains a
 provision that effectively prohibits the publication of any information deemed harm-
 ful to the security of either state. In view of the risk of prosecution, Lebanese jour-
 nalists censor themselves on matters related to Syria.
 During the year, the Government severely attacked press freedoms by filing
 charges against several newspapers. In April a weekly (Haramun) was charged with
 defaming the President and publishing materials deemed disturbing to the nation's
 standards. In June two newspapers (Al-Diyar and Al-Kifah Al-Arabi) were charged
 with defaming the Prime Minister, and with publishing a cartoon that harmed the
 judiciary. In April the Publications Court sentenced the editor in chief of the daily
 AI-Kifah AI-Arabi to pay a fine of $30,000 for publishing an article deemed insulting
 to the King of Saudi Arabia. Another court fined two journalists at the Nida' Al-
 Watan daily and the newspaper's administration $10,000 for defamation, and or-
 dered them to pay compensation to state-run television Tele-Liban. The two journal-
 ists had accused Tele-Liban and its chairman of embezzlement,
 In May journalist Pierre Attalah was indicted by a military investigating judge
 for having distributed leaflets that harmed the Lebanese army's reputation. The
 same day he was severely beaten by unknown armed elements, Attallah later flew
 to France to seek political asylum. A court hearing on the case is ongoing.
 In implementing the 1994 Media Law, the Government closed down many of the
 myriad television and radio stations that had sprung up during the civil war, grant-
 ing licenses to those stations owned by or closely associated with powerful govern-
 
 
 1518
 ment officials. In July, facing mounting protests, it granted licenses to several addi-
 tional radio and television stations, including a Hizballah-run television station,
 that had been operating without a license. The decision raised the total number of
 licensed television and radio stations to 25.
 In February the Surete Generale suspended for 2 weeks the staging of a play. The
 play was subsequently authorized, after the author made changes in the dialogue.
 Between August and September, the censorship authority of the Government's
 Surete Generale blocked television transmission of three different items. One of the
 items, a music video called "We've Got to Change the System," was subsequently
 allowed to be broadcast, but two taped interviews with former political figures re-
 mained banned.
 Lebanon has a strong tradition of academic freedom and a flourishing private edu-
 cational system born of inadequate public schools and a preference for sectarian af-
 filiation. Students exercise the right to form campus associations and the Govern-
 ment usually does not interfere with students groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly, the Government restricts this right. Any group wish-
 ing to organize a rally must obtain the prior approval of the Interior Ministry, which
 does not render decisions uniformly. In 1997 the Government again banned all ral-
 lies, but various plitical factions, such as Amal, Hizballah, "Awnists, and support-
 ers of the Prime Minister held rallies without obtaining government permission.
 In August the Government interfered with a rally in support of early municipal
 elections by closing down the meeting place and sending a large number of security
 forces to the alternate rally site. However, it did not break up the rally, which was
 attended by several parliamentary deputies.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association. The Government generally
 respects this right; however, there were exceptions durin the year.
 In general the Government does not interfere with the establishment of private
 organizations. The law requires that persons forming organizations notify the Inte-
 rior Ministry, which should then issue a "receipt" acknowledging that proper notifi-
 cation was given. In practice the "receipt" has evolved into a permit, which can be
 withheld at the whim of the Ministry. The Bar Association in April criticized the
 current practice but did not provide examples of groups that had been denied a per-
 mit this year.
 The Ministry of Interior also scrutinizes requests to establish political movements
 or parties, and to some extent monitors their activities. The army Intelligence Serv-
 ice monitors the movement and activities of members of opposition groups.
 Neither Syria nor Israel allows groups openly hostile to them to operate in areas
 under their control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-he Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. However, there are some limitations. Travel to Is-
 rael is prohibited by law, but frequently occurs via Israeli-occupied territory in
 southern Lebanon. All males between 18 and 21 years of age are subject to compul-
 sery military service asore required to register at a recruitment office and obtain
 a travel authorization document before leaving the country. Husbands may block
 foreign travel by their wives and minor children.
 Lebanese Armed Forces and Syrian troops maintain checkpoints in areas under
 their control. In south Lebanon, the Lebanese army, the Israeli army, and the SEA
 maintain tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Is-
 rael's self-declared security zone.
 There a   re      estrictions on the right of all citizens to return. Many emigres,
 however, are reluctant to return for a variety of political, economic, and social rea-
 sons. After years of internal conflict, the recent expansion of governmental authority
 has removed barriers that previously hindered domestic travel. The Government has
 encouraged the return to their homes of over 600,000 persons displaced during the
 civil war. Although some people have began to reclaim homes abandoned or dam-
 aged during the arthe vast majority of displaced persons have not attempted to
 reclaim and rehabilitate their property. The resettlement process is slowed by tight
 budgetary constraints, shattered infrastructure, the lack of schols and economic op-
 portunities, and the fear that physical security is still incomplete in some parts of
 the country.
 Most non-Lebanese refugees are Palestinians. The United Nations Relief and
 Works Agency (UNWA) reported that the number of Palestinian refugees in Leb-
 anon registered with  enWA was 352,668. This figure, while it includes only the
 families of refugees who arrived in 1948, is also presumed to include many thou-
 
 
 1519
 sands who currently reside outside the country. Most experts estimate the actual
 number now in Lebanon to be fewer than 300,000.
 The Government issues laissez-passers (travel documents) to Palestinian refugees
 to enable them to travel and work abroad. However, after the Government of Libya
 announced in September 1995 its intention to expel Palestinians working in that
 country, the Lebanese government moved to prohibit the return of Palestinians liv-
 ing abroad unless they obtain an entry visa. The Government maintained that the
 visa requirement is necessary to ensure the validity of Lebanese laissez-passers, as
 a large number of those documents were forged during the years of strife. The effect
 has been to discourage foreign travel by Palestinians resident in Lebanon.
 The Government seeks to prevent the entry of asylum seekers and undocumented
 refugees. There have been no known asylum requests since 1975. There are legal
 provisions for granting asylum or refugee status in accordance with the 1951 U2.
 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Govern-
 ment cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) and the UNRWA.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution states that citizens have the right to change their government
 in periodic free and fair elections. However, lack of government control of parts of
 the country, defects in the electoral process, and strong Syrian influence over Leba-
 nese politics and decision-makers significantly restrict this right. The 1996 par-
 liamentary elections represented a step forward, but the electoral process was
 flawed by serious shortcomings, as the elections were not prepared or carried out
 impartially. Government officials acknowledged some of the electoral shortcomings
 and pledged to correct them in future elections. Several losing candidates submitted
 challenges to the Constitutional Council which, in four separate cases, ruled that
 the election results were invalid. The Government conducted by-elections for those
 seats on June 29.
 According to the Constitution, elections for the Parliament must be held every 4
 years. The Parliament, in turn, elects the President every 6 years. The President
 and Parliament nominate the Prime Minister, who with the President chooses the
 Cabinet. According to the unwritten "National Pact of 1943," the President is
 Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of Par-
 liament a Shi'a Muslim. Until 1990 seats in Parliament were divided on a 6 to 5
 ratio of Christians to Muslims. Positions in the Government were allocated on a
 similar basis between Christians and Muslims. Under the National Reconciliation
 Agreement reached in Taif, Saudi Arabia in 1989, Members of Parliament agreed
 to alter the national pact to create a 50-50 balance between Christian and Muslim
 members of parliament. The Taif Accord also increased the number of seats in par-
 liament and transferred some powers from the President to the Prime Minister and
 Cabinet.
 Citizens' ability to change their government on a local level was undermined by
 a decision taken by Parliament in July to extend the term in office of municipal offi-
 cials to April 30, 1999. Municipal elections have not been held since 1963. Many
 serving officials are elderly or have been appointed by the central Government. The
 decision to extend municipal terms was challenged by 14 parliamentarians, and the
 Constitutional Council ruled on September 13 that the extension was invalid. The
 Government responded to the ruling by declaring existing municipal officials short
 term "caretakers" The Parliament in December passed a law calling for municipal
 elections in mid-1998.
 Women have the right to vote and there are no legal barriers to their participa-
 tion in politics, although there are significant cultural barriers. No women hold cabi-
 net positions. Three women were elected to Parliament in 1996.
 Palestinian refugees have no political rights. An estimated 17 Palestinian factions
 operate in Lebanon, generally organized around prominent individuals. Most Pal-
 estinians live in refugee camps controlled by one or more factions. The leaders of
 the refugees are not elected, nor are there any democratically organized institutions
 in the camps.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights gups operate freely without overt government restriction,
 including the Lebanese Asociation for Human Rights, the Foundation for Human
 and Humanitarian Rights-Lebanon, and the National Association for the Rights of
 the Disabled. Some of these groups have sought to publicize the detention in Syria
 of hundreds of Lebanese citizens. The Government has made no public comment on
 
 
 1520
 the issue. The number of such persons cannot be determined accurately, but on No-
 vember 24, 1996 President Hrawi stated that 210 Lebanese were in Syrian custody.
 Some human rights groups have reported harassment and intimidation by govern-
 ment, Syrian, and militia forces.
 In general the Government is unwilling to discuss human rights problems with
 foreign governmental or nongovernmental organizations. However, it has facilitated
 visits to the country of Amnesty International teams to report on Israeli activities
 in south Lebanon.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution calls for "social justice and equality of duties and rights among
 all citizens without prejudice or favoritism." In practice, aspects of the law and tra-
 ditional mores discriminate against women. Religious discrimination is built into
 the electoral system. In February the Parliament approved a law giving preference
 to disabled persons for employment in government positions. Discrimination based
 on the other listed factors is illegal, and is not widespread.
 Women.-The press reports cases of rape with increasing frequency; what is re-
 ported is thought to be only a fraction of the actual number. There are no authori-
 tative statistics on the extent of spousal abuse. Most experts agree that the problem
 affects a significant portion of the female population. In general battered or abused
 women do not talk about their suffering for fear of bringing shame upon their own
 families or accusations of misbehavior upon themselves. Doctors and social workers
 believe that most abused women do not seek medical help. The Government has no
 separate program to provide medical assistance to battered women. It does provide
 legal assistance to victims of crimes who cannot afford it regardless of the gender
 of the victim. The Lebanese Association for Combating Violence Against Women,
 founded in 1994, has been active in lobbying to improve the socio-economic condition
 of women and to reduce violence against women. In September it that announced
 it was seeking funding to build a shelter for abused women.
 The legal system is discriminatory in its handlingof "crimes of honor." According
 to the Penal Code, a man who kills his wife or other female relative may receive
 a reduced sentence if he demonstrates that he committed the crime in response to
 an illegitimate sexual relationship conducted by the victim. Since 1991, however,
 the Government has begun to increase sentences on violent crimes in general and
 to seek punishment for men who commit "crimes of honor."
 Women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law, academia,
 the arts, and to a lesser degree, in business. However, social pressure against
 women pursuing careers is strong in some parts of society. Males sometimes exer-
 cise considerable control over female relatives, restricting their activities outside the
 home or their contact with friends and relatives. Women may own property but
 often cede effective control of it to male relatives for cultural reasons. In 1994 the
 Parliament removed a legal stipulation that a woman must obtain her husband's
 approval to open a business or engage in a trade. Husbands may block foreign travel
 by their wives (see Section 2.d.).
 Only men may confer citizenship on their spouses and children. Accordingly, chil-
 dren bern to Lebane~e mothers and foreign fathers are not eligible for Lebanese citi-
 zenship. In late 1995, the Parliament approved a law allowing Lebanese widows to
 confer citizenship on their minor children.
 Religious groups have their own family and personal status laws administered by
 religious courts. Each group differs in its treatment of marriage, family property
 rights, and inheritance. Many of these laws discriminate against women. For exam-
 ple, Sunni inheritance law gives a son twice the share of a daughter. Although Mus-
 lim men may divorce easily, Muslim women may do so only with the concurrence
 of their husbands.
 Children.-The plight of children is a growing concern, but the Government has
 not allocated funds to protect them. Education is not compulsory, and many children
 take jobs at a young age to help support their families. In lower income families,
 boys generally get more education, while girls usually remain at home to do house-
 work.
 An undetermined number of children are neglected, abused, exploited, and even
 sold to adoption agents. There are hundreds of abandoned children in the streets
 nationwide, some of whom survive by begging, others by working at low wages. Ac-
 cording to a UNICEF study, 60 percent of working children are below 13 years of
 age and 75 percent of them earn wages below two-thirds of the minimum wage. Ju-
 venile delinquency is on the rise; many delinquents wait in ordinary prisons for trial
 and remain there after sentencing. Although their number is ve  small, there is
 no adequate place to hold delinquent girls, and they are nl  eld in the womn-
 
 
 1521
 en's prison in Ba'abda. Limited financial resources have hindered efforts to build
 adequate facilities to rehabilitate delinquents. However, the Higher Relief Commit-
 tee allotted some financial resources to the association for the protection of juveniles
 to lease a two-story building in Ba'asir in order to accommodate 50 juvenile
 delinquents.
 There are neither child welfare programs nor government institutions to oversee
 the implementation of children's programs. The Committee for Children's Rights,
 formed in 1993 by prominent politicians and private citizens, has been lobbying for
 legislation to improve the condition of children. The Ministry of Health requires the
 establishment of health records for every child up to 18 years of age.
 People With Disabilities.-Over 100,000 people sustained disabilities during the
 civil war. Care of the disabled is generally a function performed by families. Most
 efforts to secure education, independence, health, and shelter for the disabled are
 made by some 100 private organizations for the disabled. In general, these organiza-
 tions are poorly funded.
 Lebanon's heavily damaged cities make no accommodation for the disabled. Build-
 ing codes have no requirements for ease of access, though the Government in its
 rebuilding projects has constructed sidewalks in some parts of Beirut allowing ac-
 cess for disabled. The private "Solidere" project for the reconstruction of downtown
 Beirut has self-imposed requirements for disabled access. This project is widely con-
 sidered a model for future construction efforts around the country.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government (see Section 3). The Amended Constitution of 1990 embraces the prin-
 ciple of abolishing religious affiliation as a criterion for filling all government posi-
 tions, but few practical steps have been taken to accomplish this. One notable excep-
 tion is the Lebanese Armed Forces, which through universal conscription and an
 emphasis on professionalism has significantly reduced the role of confessionalism (or
 religious sectarianism) in that organization. Each religious affiliation has its own
 courts for family law matters, such as marriage, divorce, child-custody, and inherit-
 ance.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to the United Nations, an esti-
 mated 350,000 Palestinian refugees are registered in Lebanon (see Section 2.d.).
 Most Palestinian refugees live in overpopulated camps that have suffered repeated
 heavy damage as a result of fighting. The Government has instructed relief workers
 to suspend reconstruction work in the camps, and refugees fear that in the future
 the Government may reduce the size of the camps or eliminate them completely.
 The Government officially ended its practice of denying work permits to Palestin-
 ians in 1991; however, in practice, very few Palestinians receive work permits. Pal-
 estinians still encounter job discrimination, and those who find work at all are fun-
 neled into unskilled occupations. They and other aliens may own land of a limited
 size but only after obtaining the approval of five different district offices. The law
 applies to all aliens, but for political, cultural, and economic reasons it is applied
 in a manner disadvantageous to Palestinians and, to a lesser extent, Kurds. The
 Government does not provide health services to Palestinian refugees, who must rely
 on U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and UNRWA-contracted private hos-
 pitals.
 In recent years, Palestinian incomes have declined as the Palestinian Liberation
 Organization closed many of its offices in Lebanon, which formerly employed as
 much as 50 percent of the Palestinian work force. Palestinian children have report-
 edly been forced to leave school at an early age because U.N. relief workers do not
 have sufficient funds for education programs. The U.N. estimates that 18 percent
 of street children are Palestinian. Drug addiction and crime reportedly are increas-
 ing in the camps, as is prostitution.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Al workers, except government employees, may es-
 tablish and join unions and have a legal right to strike. Worker representatives
 must be chosen from those employed within the bargaining unit. About 900,000 per-
 sons form the active labor force, 42 percent of whom are members of 160 labor
 unions and associations. Twenty-two of the unions, with about 200,000 workers, are
 represented in the General Confederation of Labor.
 In general the Government does not control or restrict unions, although union
 leaders allege that the Government has tried to intervene in elections for union offi-
 cials.
 Palestinian refugees may organize their own unions, but restrictions on their
 right to work make this right more theoretical than real. Few Palestinians partici-
 pate actively in trade unions.
 
 
 1522
 Unions are free to affiliate with international federations and confederations, and
 they maintain a variety of such affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and to bargain exists in law and practice. Most worker groups engage in some
 form of collective bargaining with their employers. Stronger federations obtain sig-
 nificant gains for their memers, and on occasion have assisted nonunionized work-
 ers. There is no government mechanism to promote voluntary labor-management
 negotiations, and workers have no protection against antiunion discrimination. The
 Government's ban on demonstrations arguably diminishes unions' bargaining power.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is not prohibited by
 law. In the absence of a prohibition against it, children, foreign domestic servants,
 and other foreign workers are sometimes forced to remain in situations amounting
 to coerced or bonded labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The 1946
 Labor Code stipulates that workers between the ages of 8 and 16 may not work
 more than 7 hours a day, with 1 hour for rest provided after 4 hours. They are also
 prohibited from working between the hours of 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. There is a general
 prohibition against "jobs out of proportion with worker's age." The Code also pro-
 hibits certain types of mechanical work for children between the ages 8 and 13, and
 other types for those between the ages 13 and 16. The Labor Ministry is tasked with
 enforcing these requirements, but the civil war left it with few resources and a de-
 moralized and sometimes corrupt staff. The Ministry does not rigorously a pply the
 law. Forced and bonded child labor is not prohibited and sometimes occurs (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a legal minimum wage,
 currently about $200 (300,000 Lebanese pounds) per month. The law is not enforced
 effectively in the private sector. In theory the courts could be called upon to enforce
 it, but in practice they are not. The minimum wage is insufficient to provide a de-
 cent standard of living for a worker and family. Trade unions actively try to ensure
 the payment of minimum wages in both the public sector and the large-scale private
 sector, such as education and transport.
 The Labor Law prescribes a standard 6-day workweek of 48 hours, with a 24-hour
 rest period per week. In practice workers in the industrial sector work an average
 of 35 hours a week, and workers in other sectors work an average of 30 hours a
 week. The law includes specific occupational health and safety regulations. Labor
 regulations call on employers to take adequate precautions for employee safety. En-
 forcement, the responsibility of the Labor Ministry, is uneven. Labor organizers re-
 port that workers do not have the right to remove themselves from hazardous condi-
 tions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
