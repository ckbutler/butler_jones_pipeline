 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal parliamentary form of govern-
 ment and an independent judiciary. Citizens periodically choose their representa-
 tives in free and fair multiparty elections.
 Elected civilian officials control the federal, provincial, and municipal police
 forces. The armed forces have no role in domestic law enforcement except in na-
 tional emergencies. Laws requiring the security forces to respect human rights are
 strictly observed, and violators are punished by the courts.
 Canada has a highly developed, market-based economic system. Laws extensively
 protect the well-being of workers and provide for workers' freedom of association.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 there were occasional complaints in some areas, primarily regarding discrimination
 against aboriginals, the disabled, and women. The Constitution and laws provide
 avenues for legal redress of such complaints. The Government took serious steps to
 address violence against women, including the strengthening of antistalking laws.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The controversy over the 1995 shooting death of an aboriginal activist at
 Ipperwash, Ontario continues. In April an Ontario provincial police officer was
 found guilty of criminal negligence causing death in the shooting and was sentenced
 to 2 years' community service under the supervision of a parole officer (see Section
 5).
 
 
 1024
 In July a civilian commission reported on its inquiry into allegations of abuses
 by troops deployed as part of the 1993 peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The com-
 mission reported evidence of an attempted cover-up of the shooting of two Somali
 civilians, one of whom died. One soldier -was convicted of manslaughter and torture
 and sentenced to 5 years in prison, of which he served approximately 18 months.
 A second soldier was found guilty of negligence in the performance of his duty and
 sentenced to 90 days in prison. In addition, the careers of several senior officers
 were ruined.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and the Government observes the prohibition in
 practice.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards, and the Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights monitors.
 As a result of an inquiry into a 1994 incident at the women's prison at Kingston,
 Ontario, the federal government took steps to protect the privacy of female pris-
 oners, includingithe appointment of a deputy commissioner of women's corrections
 and changing the policy for strip searches to ensure that no men are present at
 searches of female inmates.
 I Although conditions at Toronto's Don jail have improved, inmates continues to
 complain of overcrowding, inadequate facilities, and inhuman conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public liaL.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process and vigorously enforces the right to
 a fair trial.
 The court system is divided into federal and provincial courts, which handle both
 civil and criminal matters. The highest federal court is the Supreme Court, which
 exercises general appellate jurisdiction and advises on constitutional matters. The
 judicial system is based on English common law at the federal level as well as in
 most provinces; in the province of Quebec, it is based on the Napoleonic Code.
 Throughout Canada judges are appointed. In criminal trials, the law provides for
 a presumption of innocence and the right to a public trial, to counsel (free for
 indigents), and to appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 generally prohibits such practices, government authorities scrupulously respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and of
 the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent
 press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic Political system combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 Journalists are occasionally banned from reporting some specific details of court
 cases until a trial is concluded, and these restrictions, adopted to ensure the defend-
 ant's right to a fair trial, enjoy wide popular support. Some restrictions on the
 media are imposed by provincial-level film censorship, broadcasters' voluntary codes
 curbing graphic violence, and laws against hate literature and pornography. The Ca-
 nadian Human Rights Act prohibits repeated communications by telephone that ex-
 pose a person or group to hatred or contempt. Human rights groups are exploring
 the possibility of extending this prohibition to the Internet.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.veThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and extends first
 aslum. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to
 regee status. Canada is a resettlement country, and the Government projected
 granting 22,600 claims for refugee status for 1997 (as of September 1).
 In 1997 mostly in August and September, almost 1,000 CzecRoma claimed refu-
 gee status in Canada. Most of the refugees are awaiting adjudication of their claims
 to asylum. In the wake of the huge influx, the Government reimposed visa require-
 
 
 1025
 ments for citizens of the Czech Republic but has not forcibly deported any of the
 asylum claimants.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 A significant body of opinion in the province of Quebec, represented by the party
 that governed the province throughout 1997, continues to mmntain that Quebec has
 the right to withdraw from the confederation if that proves to be the democratically
 expressed will of the people of Quebec, and that it is only Quebeckers who have the
 right to make this decision. The federal Government has maintained that the deci-
 sion of a province to separate and the conditions under which this may be accom-
 plished are the shared responsibility of the Federal Government, the governments
 of all the provinces, and all the nation's citizens.
 A case is pending before the Supreme Court in which the Court was asked to de-
 cide whether Quebec has a right to secede from Canada unilaterally under inter-
 national and Canadian law.
 Women play a significant role in government and politics, although they are
 underrepresented numerically. In the new Parliament elected in June, 63 of 301
 members in the House of Commons are women. Five women were appointed to the
 new 30-person Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides for equal benefits and protection
 of the law regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age, sex-
 ual orientation, or mental or physical disability. These rights are generally re-
 spected in practice, but there are occasional charges of discrimination in this multi-
 cultural society.
 Affirmative action (employment equity) legislation is a topic of some national and
 provincial debate. Federal employment equity legislation was passed by Parliament
 in 1995, but the Ministry of Labor is still consulting on the regulations required by
 the act, and it has not yet entered into force. The legislation is designed to strength-
 en employment equity provisions for employees under federal jurisdiction.
 Women.-The law prohibits violence against women, including spousal abuse. The
 health and economic costs of violence against women have been calculated at $3.15
 billion (Can $4.2 billion) annually. Nevertheless, according to Statistics Canada, 3
 in 10 women currently or previously married or living in a common-law relationship
 have experienced at least 1 incident of physical or sexual violence.
 The Criminal Code prohibits criminal harassment (stalking) and makes it punish-
 able by imprisonment for up to 5 years. In May a law came into force that strength-
 ens criminal harassment (stalking) provisions. The new law also prohibits female
 genital mutilation and improves the tools available to the criminal justice system
 to deal with and prevent child prostitution.
 Women are well represented in the labor force, including business and the profes-
 sions. The law prohibits sexual harassment, and the Government enforces this pro-
 vision.
 Women enjoy marriage and property rights equal to those of men. Over 85 percent
 of single parent households are headed by women. Child support reforms in 1996
 and 1997 include: amendments to the income tax act to eliminate child support from
 the custodial parent's taxable income and the tax deduction available to payers of
 child support; amendments to the divorce act to establish fairer and more consistent
 child support payments; new measures to strengthen enforcement; and an enhanced
 income supplement for lower-income families.
 Children.-The Government demonstrate     s strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Federal and provincial regulations protect children from abuse, overwork, and
 discrimination and duly penalize perpetrators of such offenses. There is no societal
 pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. However, disabled
 
 
 1026
 
 persons are underrepresented in the work force: they make up 2.6 percent of the
 federally regulated private sector work force, but those capable of working total 6.5
 percent of the population. The law mandates access to buildings for people with dis-
 abilities, and for the most part the Government enforces these provisions.
 In October the Supreme Court, in a case involving a deaf patient who had been
 denied sign-language interpretation, ruled that people with disabilities must be ac-
 commodated where it would not constitute an undue hardship to do so.
 Indigenous People.-The treatment of Canada's aboriginal people continued to be
 one of the most important human rights issues facing the country. Disputes over
 land claims, self-government, treaty rights, taxation, duty-free imports, fishing and
 hunting rights, and alleged harassment by police continued to be sources of tension
 on reserves. Aboriginal people remain underrepresented in the work force, over-
 represented on welfare rolls, and more susceptible to suicide and poverty than other
 population groups.
 n April on the 15th anniversary of the patriation of the Constitution, aboiginal
 groups staged a national Day of Action, including demonstrations at the Prime in-
 ister's residence and Parliament Hill, prayer vigils, and other demonstrations. The
 goal of the demonstrations was to focus attention on aboriginal rights under the
 onstitution and the promise made at the time of patriation to define these rights
 through First-Ministers meetings with aboriginal groups. The demonstrations were
 larly peaceful.
 November 1996, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples released its final
 report, proposing a 20-year strategy for rebuilding First Nations through restoring
 aboriginal communities and restructuring their relationship with the government.
 The Federal Government is continuing to study the recommendations of the report
 and has yet to issue its official response.
 Treaty rights for aboriginals are recognized in the Canadian Constitution, and the
 Federal Government is currently engaged in discussions with aboriginal groups on
 various treaty issues.
 The Federal Government continues to be involved in self- government negotiations
 with over 350 first nations, although no significant settlements were reached during
 the year.
 There were several violent deaths on the Stoney reserve west of Calgary amid
 charges of corruption and mismanagement. Six young aboriginals died (including by
 suicide, drug overdoses, and an alleged murder) since June 26, when provincial
 court Judge John Reilly ordered a Crown investigation into social conditions, allega-
 tions of political corruption, and financial mismanagement. A seventh death (attrib-
 uted to prescription-drug overdose) occurred on September 26.
 Concern also emerged that federal authorities have been slow to respond to com-
 plaints that range from political and financial corruption on the reserve to alleged
 sexual assaults. Indian Affairs officials had been warned in a January letter of a
 "major crisis" in social services (at least four staff members from the Stoney band's
 social services department collected welfare while also receiving paychecks), but fed-
 eral authorities did not advise the Royal Canadian Mounted Police until 8 months
 later. Federal Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart has ordered an internal inves-
 tigation. Health Canada had already suspended funding for a treatment center on
 the Stoney reserve, pending investigation of alleged sexual assaults on young cli-
 ents. Other .allegations of child sexual assault include reent charges against a
 school bus driver, charges that a former Stoney educational authority said he
 warned Indian Affairs about more than a year ago.
 The controversy over the 1995 shooting death of an aboriginal activist at
 Ipperwash, Ontario continues. In April an Ontario provincial police officer was
 found guilty of criminal negligence causing death in the shooting and sentenced to
 2 years' community service. The relatively light sentence and other aspects of the
 incident, including the role of provincial officials before and during the confrontation
 between police and Indian protesters, are the subject of ongoing controversy and
 court cases. The Indians still control Ipperwash provincial park, which they claim
 is on sacred burial ground.
 Quebec's Indian peoples remain overwhelmingly opposed to separation from Can-
 ada and deeply distrust the separatist government of the province. Despite the Que-
 bec Prime Minister's recent overtures to the leaders of the Cree and Inuit nations,
 surveys indicate that most of Quebec's 60,000 Indians would favor partition of the
 province in the event of Quebec's separation from Canada. Indian leaders maintain
 that a sovereign Quebec would treat Indians simply as another ethnic minority in-
 stead of as sovereign nations within the territory of the province. They point out
 that Quebec maintained in court this year that aboriginal title to land in the prov-
 ince was extinguished during the French colonial regime and no longer applies.
 
 
 1027
 Distrust of the Quebec provincial government was recently highlighted by a pro-
 posal by Hydro-Quebec, the electrical utility owned by the province, to settle some
 700 non-Indian families in the James Bay area as part of a plan to increase elec-
 trical generating capacity. Calling this "ethnic occupation" of their traditional lands,
 the Indians maintain that this proposal is a blatant attempt by the separatist gov-
 ernment to put a French face on the area, to counter a possible future attempt
 at partition of the province.
 In November in a decision based on a 235-year-old treaty, a New Brunswick court
 ruled that aboriginals have the exclusive right to harvest "any and all trees they
 wish on Crown land," and that the trees on Crown land "are Indian trees.&" Some
 legal observers note that the decision, if upheld on appeal, could have repercussions
 throughout the country.
 Religious Minorities.-In March the League for Human Rights of B'nai Brith in
 Canada (headquartered in Toronto) reported that there were 244 incidents of anti-
 Semitic harassment in 1996-a decrease of 26.3 percent from 1995, which had the
 highest number of incidents since documentation began in 1982. The League attrib-
 uted the decline to law enforcement actions taken against key hate movement lead-
 ers and to a successful, proactive antihate movement education program. The
 League noted, however, that the amount of anti-Semitic activity over the Internet
 continues to grow.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The narrow defeat of the 1995 Quebec sov-
 ereignty referendum left unresolved the concerns of French-speaking Quebeckers
 about their minority status in Canada, while sharpening the concerns of English-
 speaking Quebeckers about their minority status.
 The separatist Parti Quebecois provincial government of Quebec reiterated its in-
 tent, if reelected in 1998 or 1999, to hold another sovereignty referendum about the
 year 2000 and reasserted the right of Quebec voters to determine the future of the
 province. It charged the federal Government with charting an undemocratic course
 by signaling that it would treat a third Quebec sovereignty referendum differently
 than it treated the first two in 1980 and 1995.
 Some English-speaking and native groups in Quebec assert the right to keep parts
 of Quebec in Canada in the event Quebec declares independence. Despite personal
 meetings and other overtures by Quebec's Prime Minister to Indians and the Eng-
 lish-speaking community, both groups remain distrustful of the separatist Govern-
 ment of Quebec. Many members of these communities fear that their rights would
 be infringed by a sovereign Quebec.
 The Constitution protects the linguistic and cultural rights of minorities. Despite
 Canada's federal policy of bilingualism, English speakers in Quebec and French
 speakers in other parts of Canada generally must live and work in the language
 of the majority.
 In Quebec language laws restrict access to English-language publicly-funded
 schools through grade 11 to children whose parents were educated in English in
 Canada and to short-term residents. Local law stipulates that French is the working
 language of most businesses and must be predominant in bilingual commercial
 sign age.
 The English-speaking minority of Quebec, comprising some 16 percent of the pop-
 ulation, has protested vociferously the closing of hospitals and other health care fa-
 cilities providing service in English, as part of a general reorganization and
 downsizing of the health care system in Quebec. Members of this minority maintain
 that the cuts are part of a continuing assault on their community's rights by the
 provincial government. They maintain that the bilingual facilities that they are now
 required to use are reluctant to post signs with English language content due to fear
 of sanction by Quebec's Office of the French Language; they also claim that they
 are greeted coldly and grudgingly when requesting services in English at these fa-
 cilities, or meet with outright refusals by reception personnel to speak English, a
 practice also noticed by English-speaking tourists. Representatives of the English-
 speaking minority point to recent statements by members of the health care commu-
 nity that provision of services in English conflicts with the right of Quebeckers to
 work in the French language, a right provided by Quebec's Charter of the French
 Language. Some English speakers have expressed concern that access to English-
 language health care could be further reduced by an ongoing provincial government
 review of bilingual staffing requirements in French-language hospitals. On the other
 hand, the only French-language hospital in Ontario was partially closed as a result
 of a restructuring of the provincial health care system, raising concerns among
 French speakers about access to health care in Ontario.
 Pressed by some English speakers to roll back the language laws, and by some
 French speakers to expand them, the Quebec provincial government reestablished
 
 
 1028
 
 a French language inspection office that had been abolished in 1993, and promised
 better enforcement of existing laws.
 Provinces outside of Quebec often lack adequate French-language schooling, which
 is of concern to local Francophones, although French-language schools and French
 immersion programs are reported to be thriving in all three prairie provinces.
 In October the Province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax school board announced
 that they would cooperate in implementing the 75 recommendations mentioned in
 an August report on causes of racial violence at 2 high schools in the Cole Harbor
 area of Halifax. Authorities originally had hesitated to implement the suggestions
 but were forced to act when new violence erupted at the school on October 3. Par-
 ents and students became involved in shoving and pushing, and a teacher was
 struck in the face. Police had to break up the incident, but they did not press any
 charges. School officials immediately closed the school and did not fully reopen it
 until October 15 with new security measures in place and a "zero tolerance" policy
 on disruptive behavior.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for members of the armed forces, workers in
 both the public and private sectors have the right to associate freely. The Labor
 Code protects these rights for all employees under federal jurisdiction, while provin-
 cial legislation protects all other organized workers.
 Trade unions are independent of the government. Of the civilian labor force, 29.5
 percent is unionized.
 -All workers have the right to strike, except for those in the public sector who pro-
 vide essential services. The law prohibits employer retribution against strikers and
 union leaders, and the Government enforces this provision. Postal workers staged
 a nationwide strike in November over wages and work rules.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers in both the public
 (except for some police) and the private sectors have the right to organize and bar-
 gain collectively. While the law protects collective bargaining, for some public sector
 ,workers providing essential services there are limitations, which vary from province
 to proce.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination and requires employers to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities. There are effective mechanisms for resolving com-
 plaints and .obtaining redress.
 In Ontario the provincial government introduced legislation that would bar
 strikes by public-sector employees during a 2-year period. The measure accompanied
 a substantial downsizing by the Ontario government. Unions protested vigorously,
 arguing that their collective bargaining rights would be infringed. The provincial
 government subsequently withdrew the legislation. In October teachers in the prov-
 ince staged a massive strike to protest the provincial government's reorganization
 plans for the school system.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial sys-
 tem.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor, including that per-
 formed by children, is illegal, and there were no known violations.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor legislation varies from province to province. The federal Government does not
 employ youths under 17 years of age while school is in session. Most provinces pro-
 hibit children under age 15 or 16 from working without parental consent, at night,
 or in any hazardous employment. These prohibitions are effectively enforced
 through inspections conducted by the federal and provincial labor ministries. Edu-
 cation is compulsory through age 15 nationwide.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohi-
 bition effectively (see section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Standard work hours vary from province to
 province, but in all the limit is 40 or 48 a week, with at least 24 hours of rest.
 In 1996 the Federal Government passed legislation to align the federal minimum
 wage rates with the provincial/territorial rates. Minimum wage rates are set in each
 province and territory, currently ranging from $3.57 to 5.00 (Can $5 to 7) per hour.
 Ontario and Alberta have a minimum wage rate for youths lower than their respec-
 tive minimums. In the Northwest Territories the minimum wage for youths is high-
 er than the standard provincial minimum wage for adults. A family whose only em-
 ployed member earns the minimum wage would be considered below the poverty
 1me.
 
 
 1029
 Federal law provides safety and health standards for employees under federal ju-
 risdiction, while provincial and territorial legislation provides for all other employ-
 ees. Federal and provincial labor departments monitor and enforce these standards.
 Federal, provincial, and territorial laws protect the right of workers with "reason-
 able cause" to refuse dangerous work.
