 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia continued its transition from a highly centralized Communist-led state
 to a full-fledged multiparty democracy. The Prime Minister is nominated by the
 President and approved by the State Great Hural, the national legislature. Mon
 lia's progress in the development of democratic institutions was demonstrated by
 the overwhelming, and unexpected, June 28 election defeat of the Mongolian Peo-
 ple's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), which had been in power since 1921. A coalition
 of democratic, reform-minded parties took 50 of 76 seats in the unicameral legisla-
 ture. The coalition won despite the MPRP-designed single member districts, which
 the MPRP apparently calculated would give it a far greater majority in the Hural
 than it anticipated it would get under proportional representation or a mixed sys-
 tem. The MPRP accepted its defeat and entered into its new role in opposition.
 Security forces are under civilian control; the newly appointed Mimster of Defense
 is the first civilian to hold this post. Reduced government spending continues to
 downsize the military. The Mongolian Central Intelligence Agency (MCIA) is respon-
 sible for internal security; its head has ministerial status and reports directly to the
 
 
 Prime Minister. Some members of the security forces committed occasional human
 rights abuses.
 Despite post-1990 reforms most large economic entities remain under state con-
 trol; the new Government plans to privatize 60 percent of these entities by 2000.
 The economy continued to expand and strengthen, despite annual inflation rates of
 about 40 to 50 percent. However, Mongolia remains a very poor country, with per
 capita income at approximately $340 a year. The mainstays of the economy continue
 to be copper production and other mining, livestock raising done by a majority of
 the rura population, and related food-, wool-, and hide-processing industries, which
 meet both local needs and produce goods for export. A growing trade and small
 entrepeneurial sector in the cities provides basic consumer goods. Minerals, espe-
 cially copper, provide the bulk of export earnings; foreign exchange earnings were
 hurt badly by the drop in world copper prices. An unreliable energy system, the lack
 of transportation and other infrastructure, and a small domestic market discourage
 foreign investment.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Problems
 remain, however, including occasional beatings of detainees and prisoners by secu-
 rity forces, poor prison conditions, restrictions on due process for detainees, and vio-
 lence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 Several dozen prisoners died in custody, at least partially due to inadequate man-
 agement and oversight by the authorities (see Section l.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution forbids such practices, there were credible reports that
 police and prison officials sometimes beat or otherwise physically abused prisoners
 and detainees.
 Prison conditions are poor-including insufficient food and heat-and threaten the
 health of detainees. With the continuing rise in crime and subsequent rise in the
 prison and pretrial detainee population, severe crowding in both prisons and deten-
 tion facilities is common, aggravating management and resource issues.
 The deaths of several dozen prisoners from unclear health-related causes appears
 at least partially attributable to negligence and inadequate oversight. However,
 there is no evidence of a pattern of deliberate abuse or of a policy of withholding
 food or other necessities as punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 shall be searched, arrested, detained, or deprived of liberty except by law, but these
 protections have not been fully codified. Under the Criminal Procedures Code, police
 may arrest those caught committing a crime and hold them up to 72 hours before
 the decision is taken to prosecute or release. A warrant must be issued by a prosecu-
 tor for incarceration of longer duration or when the actual crime was not witnessed.
 A detainee has the right to see a defense attorney during this period and during
 any subsequent stage of the legal process. If a defendant cannot afford a private at-
 torney, a state-appointed attorney will be appointed.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independentjudi-
 ciary. The courts are independent, and there is no evidence that they discriminate
 aganst any group, or that decisions are made for political reasons.
 The court system consists of local courts, provincial courts, and the Supreme
 Court. The 9-member Supreme Court is at the apex of the judicial system hearing
 appeals from lower courts and cases involving alleged misconduct by high-level offi-
 cials. Local courts hear mostly routine criminal and civil cases; provincial courts
 hear more serious cases such as rape, murder, and grand larceny and also serve as
 the appeals court for lower court decisions. A Constitutional Court, separate from
 the criminal court system, has sole jurisdiction over constitutional questions. The
 General Council of Courts, an independent administrative body, nominates can-
 didates for vacancies on both the Supreme and lower courts; the President has the
 power to ratify or refuse to approve such nominations. The Council also is charged
 with ensuring the rights of judges and guaranteeing the independence of the judici-
 ary.
 All accused persons are guaranteed due process, legal defense, and a public trial,
 although closed proceedings are permitted in cases involving state secrets, rape
 cases involving minors, and other cases provided by law.

 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that the State shall not interfere with the private beliefs and
 actions of citizens, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 The head of the MCIA may, with the knowledge and consent of the Prime Minister,
 direct the monitoring and recording of telephone conversations. The extent of such
 monitoring is unknown.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the rights of free-
 dom of speech, press, and expression. The Government generally respects these
 rights in practice.
 A growing range of newspapers and other publications represent major political
 party viewpoints as well as independent views. Although in the past the Govern-
 ment controlled access to newsprint, all newspapers now buy newsprint directly
 from private suppliers, and neither party-affiliated nor independent news media re-
 port difficulty securing an adequate supply. Due to transportation difficulties, un-
 even postal service, and fluctuations in the amount of newsprint available, access
 to a full range of publications is somewhat restricted in outlying regions.
 There is a government-financed television station with countrywide reception, as
 well as a new, limited operation private television channel, and several radio sta-
 tions. The latter are particularly important as the major sources of news in the
 countryside. Both official and private media present opposition and government
 views. Residents also have access to foreign broadcasts from the United States,
 China, Russia, Japan, the United Kingdom, and other countries on commercial sat-
 ellite and cable television systems.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right both to worship
 and not to worship and explicitly recognizes the separation of church and state. The
 Government generally respects these provisions in practice. Although Mongolia has
 no official state religion, the Government has contributed to the restoration of sev-
 eral Buddhist sites important as religious, historical, and cultural centers.
 Although under the provisions of a 1993 law on relations between church and
 state, the Government may supervise and limit the numbersof both places of wor-
 ship and clergy for organized religions, there are no reports that it has done so. Reli-
 however, must register with the Ministy of Justice. Proselytizing is
 glou   , aoug    a Ministry ofEducation directive bans the mixing of foreign lan-
 gnag or other training with religious teaching or instruction. Contacts with coreli-
 gionists outside the country are aowe
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country
 as well as the right to travel and return without restriction, and the Government
 generally respects these rights in practice. By regulation, some categories of foreign-
 ers who wish to travel for more than a week must notify the police in their projected
 destination of their plans.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees in the small number of cases
 reported in which such status has been claimed. There were no reports of forced ex-
 pulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 through periodic, free elections by secret ballot, with universal suffrage. Presi-
 dential, national legislative, and local elections are held separately. The MPRP
 which had ruled since 1921, had hoped to continue its domination of the Hural
 through the establishment of 76 single member, electoral districts in which a plural-
 ity could determine the winner. However, the MPRP was beaten by a coalition of
 democratic parties in June legislative elections. About 90 percent of eligible voters
 cast ballots; international observers judged the elections to be free and fair. The
 MPRP handed over power and stepped down, in the first transition of power be-
 tween political parties in Mongolian history. In October 6 local elections, the MPRP
 succeeded in capturing 14 of 21 provincial assemblies. There are currently 12 reg-
 istered political parties.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in government and
 politics, but they are underrepresented in the highest levels of the Government and
 
 
 733
 in the highest echelons of the judiciary. Only 7 of 76 Hural members are women.
 Although there are significant numbers of women in various midlevel ministry posi-
 tions, there are no women in the Cabinet or the Supreme or Constitutional Courts.
 Underrepresentation of women at the highest levels of government and in the pro-
 fessions has several causes, including tradition and some degree of discrimination
 by the virtually all-male web of leadership.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that **** No person shall be discriminated against on
 the basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status" and that
 * * * Men and women shall be equal in political, economic, social, cultural fields,
 and family affairs." The Government generally enforces these rights in practice.
 Women.-There is increasing public discussion of domestic violence, including
 spousal and child abuse, after many years of government and societal denial. Al-
 though there are no reliable or exact statistics as to the extent of such abuse,
 human rights groups believe that it is a common phenomenon. The large economic
 and societal changes under way have created new stresses on the family, including
 loss of jobs, inflation, and lowered spending on social and education programs. These
 factors, coupled with the serious problems caused by extremely high rates of alcohol
 abuse, have led to increased instances of abuse and abandonment and have added
 to the ranks of single-parent families, most of which are headed by women. Al-
 though women's groups are advocating new statutes to cope with domestic violence,
 at present there is no known police or government intervention in cases involving
 violence against women beyond prosecution under existing assault laws when for-
 mal charges have been filed.
 The Constitution provides men and women with equal rights in all spheres, and,
 both by law and practice, women receive equal a for equal work and have equal
 access to education. Women represent about ha of the work force, and a significant
 number are the primary earners for their families. Although many women occupy
 midlevel positions in government and the professions and many are involved in the
 creation and management of new trading and manufacturing businesses, women are
 almost completely absent from the highest leadership ranks of both the public and
 private sectors. There is no government agency overseeing women's rights, nor are
 there any notable efforts by the Government to encourage greater representation by
 women in policymaking positions.
 A small number of women's rights groups concern themselves with such issues as
 maternal and children's health and domestic violence. The law prohibits womfen
 from working in certain occupations that require heavy labor or exposure to chemi-
 cals that could affect infant and maternal health.
 Children.-Increased stress on the family structure and in society has had direct
 effects on many children, and the Government has been unable to keep pace with
 all of the educational, health, and social needs of the most rapidly growing segment
 of its population. Children of both sexes are guaranteed free public education
 through the age of 16, although family economic needs and state budgetary difficul-
 ties make it difficult for some children to attend school. In addition there continues
 to be a severe shortage of teaching materials at all educational levels.
 There are growing numbers of infants and small children orphaned by maternal
 deaths and desertion and, in Ulaanbaatar and major urban centers, growing num-
 bers of street children; one unconfirmed estimate has the national street children
 population at 3,000. The Government is committed in principle to children's rights
 and welfare, but it provides only minimal support for the shelters and orphanages
 that do exist; those facilities must turn to private sources to sustain their activities.
 Mongolia has a long tradition of support for, and often communal raising of, chil-
 dren. The Government has been reluctant to admit the extent of the problem and
 slow to take steps to improve the welfare of children who have become the victims
 of larger societal and familial changes.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment and education, and the Government provides benefits to the disabled
 according to the nature and severity of the disability. Those who have been injured
 in industrial accidents have the right to be reemployed when ready to resume work.
 The Government also provides tax benefits to enterprises that hire the disabled, and
 
 
 some firms do so exclusively. There is no legislation mandating access for the dis-
 abled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution entitles all workers to form or join
 union and professional organizations of their own choosing. Union officials estimate
 that union membership now totals over 400,000, somewhat less than half the work
 force. Union membership rolls are decreasing as the economy shifts from large en-
 terprises and as increasing numbers of workers become either self-employed or work
 at small, nonunionized fi-ms. No arbitrary restrictions exist on who may be a union
 official, and such officers are elected by secret ballot.
 Union members have the right to strike. Those employed in essential services,
 which the Government defines as occupations critical for national defense and safe-
 ty, e.g., police, utility, and transportation workers do not have the right to strike.
 Most union members are affiliated with the Mongolian Trade Unions Confed-
 eration (MTUC), but some are affiliated with the newer Association of Free Trade
 Unions (AFTU). Both organizations have ties with international labor organizations
 and confederations in other countries.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively-In theory wage levels and
 other employment issues are decided in tripartite contract negotiations between em-
 ployer, union, and government representatives. The Government's role is limited to
 ensuring that the contract meets legal requirements as to hours and conditions of
 work. In practice wages and other conditions of employment are set mainly by the
 employer, whether that employer is a private firm or the Government.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law specifically prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor. However, most members of the military are required to
 help with the fall harvest. Many members of the military, along with prisoners,
 joined in the fight against the massive steppe and forest fires that struck Mongolia
 in the spring.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits children under
 the age of 16 from working, although those 14 and 15 years of age may do so with
 parental consent. Those under 18 years of age may not work at night, engage in
 arduous work, or work in dangerous occupations such as mining and construction.
 Enforcement of these prohibitions, as well as all other labor regulations, is the re-
 sponsibility of state labor inspectors assigned to regional and local offices. These in-
 specters have the authority to compel immediate compliance with labor legislation,
 but enforcement is limited due to the small number of labor inspectors and the
 growing number of independent enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The monthly legal minimum wage is $13
 (7,680 tugriks) per month, or $0.06 (37 tugriks) per hour. This level applies to both
 public and private sector workers and is enforced by the Ministry of Population Pol-
 icy and Labor. This is the lowest wage for manual labor, such as janitorial work;
 virtually all civil servants make more than this amount, and many in private busi-
 nesses earn considerably more. The minimum wage alone is insufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The law sets the standard legal workweek at 46 hours and establishes a minimum
 rest period of 24 hours between workweeks. For those under 18 years of age, the
 workweek is 36 hours, and overtime work is not allowed. Overtime work is com-
 pensated at either double the standard hourly rate or by giving time off equal to
 the number of hours of overtime worked. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are
 prohibited by law from working overtime.
 Laws on labor, cooperatives, and enterprises set occupational health and safety
 standards, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare provides enforcement. According
 to labor law, workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work sit-
 uations and still retain their jobs. Mongolia's near total reliance on outmoded ma-
 chinery and problems with maintenance and management lead to frequent indus-
 trial accidents, particularly in the mining, power, and construction sectors. Effective
 enforcement of existing occupational health and safety standards is difficult because
 the Government has less than 40 full-time inspectors to cover all firms, including
 a growing number of small enterprises. Some of the major industrial sectors, how-
 ever, have part-time inspectors.
