 NAMIBIA
 Namibia is a multiparty, multiracial democracy with an independent judiciary.
 President Sam Nujoma, leader of the South West Africa Peole's Organization
 (SWAPO), won Namibia's first free elections in November 1989. President Nujoma
 and the SWAPO party received just over 70 percent of the vote in the December
 1994 Presidential and National Assembly elections, which, despite some irregular-
 ities, were generally regarded as free and fair.
 The police, supervised by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Namibian De-
 fense Force (NDF), supervised by the Ministry of Defense, share responsibility for
 internal security. The civilian authorities maintain effective control of the security
 forces, although individual members of the police forces occasionally committed
 human rights abuses.
 Namibia's modern market sector produces most of its wealth while a traditional
 subsistence agricultural sector (mainly in the north) supports most of its labor force.
 The principal exports are diamonds and other minerals, cattle, and fish. Mining,
 ranching, and fishing-the mainstays of the market sector-are still largely con-
 trolled by white Namibians and foreign interests. Government policy, however, is to
 "Namibianize" the increasingly important fishing sector, so that more indigenous
 entrepreneurs are able to participate, and to provide opportunities for black
 Namibians in the potentially lucrative and labor-intensive tourism industry. The
 gross domestic product is $1,663 per capita. However, there remains a wide dispar-
 ity between income levels of blacks and whites.
 
 
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; although
 blems remained in several areas. There continued to be credible reports that po-
 ice abused criminal suspects. Despite the release of the "Heroes Book," SWAPO
 continued to fail to provide a complete accounting for missing detainees held during
 the preindependence period. Prison conditions remain harsh, but the Government
 took several steps during the year to improve them and to increase the emphasis
 on rehabilitation. A large court backlog leads to lengthy delays of trials.
 The Married Persons Equality Act, signed into law in May, eliminated discrimina-
 tory practices against women in civil marriages. Women married under customary
 law, however, continued to experience serious legal and cultural discrimination. Al-
 though violence against women and children, incruding rape and child abuse, contin-
 ues to be a serious problem, the issue received increased attention from government
 officials and human rights activists. In September the President elevated the head
 of the Department of Women's Affairs to cabinet-level rank. Inherited problems of
 racial and ethnic discrimination and glaring disparities-especially in education,
 health, employment, and working condition-ntinue, despite sustained efforts
 by the Government to reduce them. Societal discrimination against indigenous peo-
 ples persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Illing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. There were no developments concerning the reported
 shooting of civilians in berder areas in 1995 and no reports of such instances in
 1996.
 According to press reports, the Namibian and South African Governments held
 discussions regarding the extradition from South Africa of those implicated in the
 murder of SWAPO activist Anton Lubowski. In 1994 the "Namibian High Court de-
 termined that Lubewski had been killed at the behest of the former South African
 Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB). While the Attorney General later ruled that there
 was insufficient evidence to prosecute the assassins, the Prosecutor General decided
 to reopen the 1989 inquest in 1995.
 b. Dappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Human rights organizations, political parties, and the public continued to call for
 a full accounting of unexplained disappearances of persons detained by SWAPO
 prior to independence. In August President Nujoma released the long-promised, offi-
 cial SWAPO memorial book, known as the Heroes Book, which lists the names of
 nearly 8,000 people who died during the liberation struggle. Local human rights or-
 ganizations harshly criticized the beok, characterizing it as an uncnvincing coverup
 and declaring that the listing is fraught with inaccuracies and omissions regarding
 those who died or disappeared in SWAPO detention camps. SWAPO was viewed
 widely as having failed, once again, to deal forthrightly with the missing detainee
 issue. While some of the Government's critics would be satisfied with an official
 apology for SWAPO abuses against these detainees, others are pressing for full ac-
 countability through a truth commission, prosecutions, and convictions.
 e. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Consiti  on provides that "no persons shall be subject to torture or to crel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment." There were credible reports how-
 ever, that members o the   lice beat or otherwise abused civilians, either during
 arrest or in police station houses. According to human rights organizations, the
 overall number of such instances appears to be decreasing, although the problem
 remains particularly acute in northern areas. In November apliceman accused of
 abusing a criminal suspect was charged with attempted murder, assault, and kid-
 naping. The police launched internal investigations of alleged abuse of prisoners but
 there were no public reports that abusers were punished.
 Prison conditions are harsh, but do not pose a serious thrat to life or health.
 Human rights organizations continued to complain about prison overcrowding. In
 March 1995 the overnment created a Ministry of Prisons and Correctional Serv-
 ices, charged with administering the country's prisons and jails. The Ministry em-
 phasizes correctional and rehabilitation functions, including vocational training, and
 has made some concrete progress. For example in 1996 the Government opened two
 new rehabilitation facilities where inmates are taught skils for use upon their re-
 lease. The Government also expanded its model program to separate youthful of-
 fenders from adult criminals, athough in many remote and rural areas juveniles
 continue to be held with adults.
 The Government continued to grant nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) and
 diplomatic officials regular access to prisons and prisoners.
 
 
 199
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exle.-The Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest
 or detention, and the Government generally respected these provisions in practice.
 According t the Constitution, persons who are arrested must be informed of the
 reason for their arrest and must be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours
 of their detention. The accused are entitled to defense by legal counsel of their
 choice, and those who cannot afford a lawyer are entitled to state-provided counsel.
 In practice, however, many accused persons in remote and rural areas are not le-
 gaily represented, primarily due to resource constraints. A trial must take place
 within a reasonable time," or the accused must be released. Human rights organi-
 zations criticized the length of time that pretrial detainees were held, which
 stretched up to 1 year in many cases while investigations were pending.
 Some traditional leaders reportedly continued to detain and imprison persons ac-
 cused of minor offenses without recourse to police or judicial review. The Govern-
 ment continued training traditional leaders on the legal limits of their authority.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The formal court system has three levels: 30 magistratess courts, the High Court,
 and the Supreme Court. The latter also serves as the court of appeals and as a con-
 stitutional review court.
 Most rural Nanibians first encounter the legal system through the traditional
 courts, which deal with minor criminal offenses, such as petty theft and infractions
 of local customs, among members of the same ethnic group. A special commission,
 created to make recommendations on the prospective jurisdiction of traditional
 courts, concluded that traditional cultural practices and structures should be main-
 tained, provided that they were consistent with constitutional protections and exist-
 ing laws. The Traditional Authorities Act delineates which offenses may be dealt
 with under the traditional system.
 The constitutional right to a fair trial, with a presumption of innocence until prov-
 en guilty, is generally afforded by the judiciary. However, long delays in hearing
 cases in the regular courts and problems associated with the traditional system
 limit this right in practice.
 The lack of qualified magistrates, other court officials, and private attorneys has
 resulted in a serious backlog of criminal cases, which often translated into long
 delays-sometimes 6 months or more-between arrest and trial. To address these
 problems, the Government, together with the University of Namibia, provided in-
 service legal training to magistrates and other court officials at the University's
 training center.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides all citizens with the right to privacy and requires arresting
 officers to secure a judicial warrant for certain listed offenses before conducting a
 search. Government authorities respected these rights in practice, and violations are
 subject to legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respected these rights.
 The government-owned Namibian Broadcasting Corpration (NBC) operates most
 radio and television services. Although the NBC provides significant coverage of the
 opposition, there were growing complaints that the NBC, in particular the television
 service, became even less balanced in its coverage of sensitive issues than in 1995
 and did not cover certain issues at all. This was especially evident relating to cov-
 erage of the missing detainees question where private organizations involved in the
 issue have been critical of the lack of coverage ofpress conferences dealing with the
 question. In April the Journalists' Association of Namibia adopted a resolution con-
 demnin the Government for attempting to suppress public debate on the detainee
 issue. %C radio has a much wider audience than the television service and is ac-
 knowledged to be somewhat more balanced in its reporting.
 There are three private radio stations and a private cable television service which
 broadcasts Cable News Network and South African news and entertainment pro-
 grams. A variety of privately owned newspapers operate without government re-
 striction. While there is evidence of self-censorship in state-owned media, reporters
 for independent newspapers criticize the Government openly and do not engage in
 evident self-censorship.
 In April the National Assembly passed the Powers, Privileges, and Immunities of
 Parliament Act which included a clause making publication of leaked documents or
 false information about parliamentary matters a criminal offense. However, when
 
 
 the Media Institute of Southern Africa, other civil liberties groups, and foreign dip-
 lomats criticized this attempt at limiting press freedom, the Government and the
 National Council amended the bill to exclude this provision.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government respects these rights in
 practice. Various organizations, includingpoliticalrparties and religious groups, held
 c. Freedom of Religiwn.-The Constitution provides far freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR), and U     CR officials have observed a marked improvement in the
 Government's refugee policy. However, in a number of cases the status of the asy-
 lum applicants had not yet been decided. In an attempt to deal with this backlog,
 the UNHCR recently appointed a nongovernmental legal organization to screen
 cases. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to
 refugee status. Human rights organizations, however, reported cases where authori-
 ties initially denied detained illegal immigrants the right to apply for refugee status
 until human rights organizations or attorneys intervened.
 Namibia is a first asylum country and continues to permit asylum seekers to
 enter the country. It does not turn back asylum seekers. There are presently 2,020
 refugees and asylum seekers at the Osire refugee camp, 90 percent of whom are
 from Angola. The rest are from Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and other Afri-
 can countries. Asylum seekers are interviewed by host country officials and those
 granted refugee status are permitted to work and attend school or the University
 of Namibia. Schools have been established for refugees and asylum seekers at Osire
 camp. Its residents are permitted to leave the camp, which is not fenced.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this constitutional right for the second time in December 1994
 in what were generally agreed-despite some irregularities-to be free and fair
 presidential and parliamentary elections. The Government printed and distributed
 useful and informative voter guides with lists of government and opposition can-
 didates and requested international election observers. There were televised de-
 bates, and the opposition parties were able to campaign freely.
 The Constitution establishes a bicameral parliament and provides for general
 elections every 5 years and regional elections every 6 years. Incumbent President
 Nujoma was reelected to a second 5-year term of office during the country's first
 postindependence elections for the National Assembly and Presidency in December
 1994. The ruling SWAPO party won 53 of the 72 elected National Assembly seats,
 the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, the major opposition party) secured 15
 seats, and three smaller parties obtained a total of 4 seats.
 The DTA unsuccessfully challenged the results of the election, based on discrep-
 ancies in four constituencies in the north where votes cast exceeded the number of
 registered voters. In March 1995, the High Court rejected the DTA's challenge; this
 decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in midyear.
 Women are increasingly involved in the political process but remain seriously
 underrepresented. There are 3 female ministers and 3 female deputy ministers out
 of a total of 22 ministerial and 22 deputy ministerial positions. In addition two
 women hold cabinet-level positions, Director of the National Planning Commission
 and Ombudsman. Women hold 16 of 98 parliamentary seats. In June female legisla-
 tors formed a Women's Caucus in Parliament to review legislation for gender sen-
 sitivity. Historic economic and educational disadvantages have served to limit the
 participation of the indigenous San ethnic group in politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local nongovernmental organizations, such as the National Society for Human
 Rights (NSHR) and the Legal Assistance Center, operated freely, criticizing the Gov-
 ernment's handling of the SWAPO detainee issue, misconduct by members of the
 police, and discrimination against women and indigenous ethnic groups. In addition
 other human rights organizations such as the Namibia Institute for Democracy, the
 Human Rights Documentation Center, the Center for Applied Social Sciences, and
 
 
 the Media Institute of Southern Africa worked openly on a variety of human rights
 issues affecting women, ethnic minorities, and other groups.
 Representatives of international human rights organizations traveled to Namibia
 and discussed human rights issues with governmental and nongovernmental rep-
 resentatives.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, gender, or religion,
 and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology of apartheid." However, the
 Government has not taken effective action against discrimination faced by women
 and the disabled.
 Women.-Violence against women, including beating and rape, is widespread. Be-
 cause of traditional attitudes regarding the subordination of women, many incidents
 of abuse are never reported to the authorities. In those few grave abuse cases where
 legal action has been initiated, however, the courts often sentenced male offenders,
 including spouses, to long terms of imprisonment. An historical problem of low bail,
 which has ealowed some males to repeat their offenses, appears to be lessening. The
 courts sentenced convicted rapists to prison terms averaging 6 to 9 years. In April
 the Namibian Women's Organization praised the decision by the High Court to sen-
 tence a convicted rapist to life imprisonment. The man had sexually assaulted a
 woman in front of her children in 1995. This was the first time a convicted rapist
 was given a life sentence. Centers for abused women and children in Oshakati,
 Windhk, Ketmanshoop, and Rehoboth are staffed with specially trained female
 police officers to assist victims of sexual assaults.
 Despite constitu tion  prctos and new legislation, women face persistent dis-
 crimination arising out of deep-rooted traditions of all ethnic groups and customary
 law. The Government, prodded by active women's rights organizations, has begun
 to address some forms of discrimination. In September the President elevated the
 head of the Department of Women's Affairs to cabinet-level rank. In addition the
 Married Persons Equality Act, promulgated in May, provides women in civil mar-
 riages who are married under community property laws with status equal to that
 of their husbands. Married women are now permitted to open bank accounts, sign
 contracts, and serve on the boards of companies without having to obtain their hus-
 bands' permission. This new legislation, however, does not apply to customary (tra-
 ditional) marriages, where women continue to face legal and cultural discrimination.
 Traditional practices also continue to permit family members to confiscate the prop-
 erty of deceased men from their widows and children.
 Children.--Children's rights, including those of protection from economic exploi-
 tation and from work that is hazardous or harmful to their health, education, men-
 tal, spiritual, moral, or social development, are enumerated in the Constitution. In
 practice the Government has been able to commit only limited resources to the pro-
 tection of children's welfare. The Government devotes 31 percent of the national
 budget to education. The Government, with the assistance of international organiza-
 tions, launched a national polio eradication campaign as part of its ongoing immuni-
 zation program. A seminar for parliamentarians, organized under U.N. auspices,
 was held on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. A juvenile justice diversion
 program was expanded to separate juvenile offenders from adults in the criminal
 justice system.
 Child abuse is a serious and increasingly acknowledged problem. The authorities
 vigorously prosecuted cases involving crimes against children, particularly rape and
 incest, and encouraged discussion and the issuance of printed materials in schools.
 In September a child rapist was given a 20-year sentence for sexually abusing a 10-
 year-old girl. The centers for abused women and children also worked to reduce the
 trauma suffered by abused children and provided training to police officials on han-
 dling this problem.
 People With Disabilities.-While discrimination on the basis of disability is not ad-
 dressed in the Constitution, the Labor Act of 1992 prohibits discrimination against
 disabled persons in employment.
 The Government does not legally require special access to public buildings for the
 disabled. Some municipal governments, however, have installed ramps and special
 curbing at street crossings for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The San people, the country's earliest known inhabitants,
 historically have been exploited by other ethnic groups. The Government has taken
 a number of measures to end this societal discrimination against the San, including
 seeking their advice about proposed legislation on communally held lands and in-
 creasing their access to primary education. Similarly, the Government has sought
 the views of the Himba people in northwest Namibia in connection with feasibility
 
 
 202
 
 studies for the construction of a major hydroelectric dam in the heart of their tradi-
 tional territory. By law all indigenous groups are able to participate equally in deci-
 sions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and allocations of natural resources.
 Nevertheless, the San and other indigenous Namibians have been unable to exercise
 fully these rights as a result of historically minimal access to education and eco-
 nomic opportunities under colonial rule, coupled with their relative isolation in re-
 mote areas of the country.
 The Traditional Authorities Act, which came into effect in December 1995, defines
 the role, duties, and powers of traditional leaders. The act provides that customary
 law that is inconsistent with provisions of the Constitution is invalid and delineates
 which types of crimes may be dealt with in traditional courts. The act assigns to
 traditional leaders the role of guardians of culture and tradition, and also mandates
 that traditional leaders elected to Parliament must choose between their traditional
 and elected offices before the end of 1996. Some traditional leaders and human
 rights organizations have maintained that this provision is unconstitutional, and a
 court challenge is being pursued.
 Nat onal/Racial/lEthknic Minorities.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination
 based on race and other factors and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology
 of apartheid.' Nevertheless, as a result of more than 70 years of South African ad-
 ministration, societal, racial, and ethnic discrimination persists, and some apart-
 heid-based statutes have not yet been repealed or replaced by the Parliament. Many
 nonwhites continued to complain that the Government was not moving quickly
 enough in education, health, housing, employment, and access to land.
 Also some opposition parties, including members of the Herero and Nama ethnic
 groups, complained that the SWAPO-led Government provided more development
 assistance to the numerically dominant Ovambo ethnic group of far northern Na-
 mibia than to other groups or regions of the country. In June 1995, the High Court
 denied the application by the "Basters" community for the Government to return its
 traditional land in the Rehoboth area, ruling that the community's "traditional
 lands" reverted to the central Government upon independence. The Supreme Court
 areed with the High Court's judgment and dismissed the Basters final appeal in
 Maay.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association,
 including freedom to form and join trade unions. The 1992 Labor Act extended that
 right to public servants, farm workers, and domestic employees. Trade unions have
 no difficulty registering, and there are no government restrictions on who may serve
 as a union official. No union has been dissolved by government action. During the
 year, the Namibian public service held vigorously contested union elections.
 Unions are independent of Government and may form federations. The two prin-
 cipal trade union umbrella organizations are the National Union of Namibian Work-
 ers (NUNW), and the Naibia People's Social Movement (NPSM). The larger
 NUNW continues to maintain its strong affiliation with the ruling SWAPO party.
 Roughly half" of the wage setor is organized to some degree, although less than 20
 percent of full-time wage earners are organized.
 Except for workers providing essential services (e.g., jobs related to public health
 and safety) and workers in the nascent export processing zones (EPZ's), workers
 enjoy the right to strike once conciliation procedures have been exhausted. Under
 the Labor Act, strike action can only be used in disputes involving specific worker
 interests, such as pay raises. Disputes over worker rights, including dismissals,
 must be referred to a labor court (which is convened when needed in the existing
 magisterial districts) for arbitration. The Labor Act protects legally striking workers
 from unfair dismissal.
 Unemployment, which is nearly 40 percent, remained a significant problem in Na-
 mibia, affecting largely the black majority. Apartheid-era attitudes among some em-
 ployers contributed to a divisive, 10-week strike at a major mining firm. While the
 atmosphere at the three mine sites was tense and occasionally violent, the con-
 frontation was eventually defused by high-level government intervention.
 Trade unions are free to exchange visits with foreign trade unions and to affiliate
 with international trade union organizations. Unions have exercised this right with-
 out interference. The American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organi-
 zations, through its African-American Labor Center representative in South Africa,
 provided technical assistance to the NUNW during regular visits to Namibia.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Coilectivey.-The 1992 Labor Act provides
 employees with the right to bargain individually or collectively. Collective bargain-
 ing is not widely practiced outside the mining and construction industries; wages
 
 
 203
 are usually set by employers. As unions become more active, however, informal col-
 lective bargaining is becoming more common.
 The Labor Act provides a process for employer recognition of trade unions and
 protection for mehbers and organizers. The law also empowers the labor court to
 remedy unfair labor practices and explicitly forbids unfair dismissals, which may be
 appealed to the labor court.
 The Labor Act applies to the prospective EPZ in Walvis Bay. A compromise on
 this point was reaced by the Government and NUNW representatives in August
 1995. However, trade unionists continued to challenge the constitutionality of the
 compromise because it precludes strikes and lockouts. Under the compromise, labor-
 related issues in the EPZ would be referred to a special EPZ Dispute Settlement
 Panel, composed of employers and workers, for expeditious resolution. As business
 activity in the Walvis Bay EPZ had just begun to get under way by year's end, the
 effectiveness of this compromise in securing the rights of workers in the EPZ could
 not yet be determined.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law.
 Although there were no formal complaints filed with the Ministry of Labor, there
 were ongoing reports in the media that farm workers often receive inadequate com-
 pensation for their labor and are subject to strict control by farm owners. Ministry
 of Labor inspectors sometimes encountered problems in gaining access to the coun-
 try's large, privately owned commercial farms in order to document possible Labor
 Code violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the 1992 Labor Act, the
 minimum age for employment is 14 years, with higher age requirements for certain
 sectors such as mining, construction, and night work. Ministry of Labor inspectors
 generally enforce minimum age regulations, but children below the age of 14 often
 work on family and commercial farms, and in the informal sector. A report on the
 status of children estimates that 13,800 children under 15 years of age are already
 in the labor force. Of these, 41 percent are working as unpaid laborers on family
 and commercial farms. Boys in rural areas traditionally start herding livestock at
 age 7. According to 1991 figures, approximately 2 percent of farm workers are chil-
 dren (mainly from the San ethnic group). There were also reports that Angolan and
 Zambian children, who are not protected by the Labor Act, worked on communal
 and cattle farms in border areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage law. In
 Windhoek's nonwhite townships, many workers and their families have difficulty
 maintaining a minimally decent standard of living. White citizens earn significantly
 more on average than do black citizens, in large part because whites own most of
 the country's productive resources and have had access to education that enables
 them to take advantage of the skilled labor shortage.
 After independence the standard legal workweek was reduced from 46 to 45
 hours, and includes at least one 24-hour rest period per week. An employer may re-
 quire no more than 10 hours per week of overtime. The law mandates 24 consecu-
 tive days of annual leave, at least 30 workdays of sick leave per year, and 3 months
 of unpaid maternity leave. In practice, however, these provisions are not yet rigor-
 ously observed or enforced by the Ministry of Labor. During 1996 two important
 NGO studies-one of farm workers and the other of domestic employees-high-
 lighted the dismal conditions which some employees encounter while working in
 these occupations.
 The Government mandates occupational health and safety standards. The Labor
 Act empowers the President to enforce them through inspections and criminal pen-
 alties. The law requires employers to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of their
 employees. It provides employees with the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations.
