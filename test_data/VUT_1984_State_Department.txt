 VANUATU
 The Republic of Vanuatu, governed under a single-chamber
 parliamentary system, became independent in 1980 following
 more than 70 years of joint British-French rule when it was
 known as the New Hebrides. Independence was accompanied by
 temporary political turbulence, including an attempt at
 secession, which left a legacy of suspicion of outside
 interference. Political legitimacy in Vanuatu is based on
 majority rule, supported by both Melanesian and Western
 tradition. Elections are vigorously contested and fair; the
 courts are independent and solicitous of individual rights;
 and the police and military are under civilian control.
 The Vanuatu economy resembles that of other Pacific island
 states in its dependence on international prices. Tourism
 earns more foreign exchange than all exports combined.
 Vanuatu has gained some revenue as a tax haven, although
 returns from ship and corporation registration are small.
 Until recently, attempts to attract foreign investment have
 been hampered by uncertainty over land rights; however, a new
 land law was enacted in 1983 and leases are being signed.
 The first general election since independence, held in
 November 1983, was vigorously contested and democratically
 conducted. Most of the strains from the 1980 secessionist
 rebellion have subsided.

 hearing before a judge is observed.

 VANUATU
 The courts are independent of military or executive

 unfair exercise of judicial authority.

 national newspaper and manages the national radio station.
 There is no independent television or commercial radio.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political
 parties or trade unions in Vanuatu. There are two main
 political parties and a relatively new smaller party  Vanuatu
 has a small but active trade union movement with the right to
 organize, strike, and bargain collectively. As of 1984, there
 were 21 registered trade unions and six employer
 associations. In February 1984, a labor council, called the
 Vanuatu Trade Union, was formed with help from the
 International Labor Organization and became a member of the
 Pacific Trade Union Council.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and respected in
 practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations
 work without restriction.

 abroad. There are no bars to returning home from abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Vanuatu is a multiparty democracy. Numerous candidates
 competed in the parliamentary elections in 1983; both the
 campaign and voting were considered by outside observers to
 have been fair. Elections to provincial and local councils
 have also been contested and fair.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has publicly expressed willingness to permit
 investigation by qualified and objective outside observers.

 VANUATU
 There have been no charges of human rights violations in the
 past year. The 1984 Amnesty International Report does not
 contain an entry for Vanuatu. Freedom House's 1984-85 report
 lists it as 'partly free,' noting that the only 'critical"
 newspaper was closed down by the Government in 1983.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Buoyed by tourism, which has expanded steadily since
 independence, the Vanuatu economy weathered the recent
 international recession with few problems. Per capita GNP was
 $801 in 1982 according to World Bank data. Gross domestic
 product rose an estimated 2 percent in 1982. Vanuatu's
 balance of payments for 1984 is expected to be positive. The
 rate of inflation was less than 4 percent. Communal land
 ownership by clans is thought to inhibit economic development,
 but a system of land leasing has been implemented in an
 attempt to ameliorate this difficulty.
 Government services are provided without discrimination.
 Education is heavily dependent on British and French aid, and
 on church schools. The population was estimated to be 130,000
 in 1984 and to have grown at a declining average rate of 2.7
 percent (World Bank). The infant mortality rate is 34 per
 1,000 live births. The calorie supply was about 87 percent of
 requirements in 1977. According to 1979 government statistics,
 37.3 percent of the populationis literate. Women have equal
 legal rights, but traditional culture has hampered their
 moving into leadership roles. The only female candidate for
 the National Parliament in 1983 was defeated by a small
 margin. Several women hold senior positions in the government
 bureaucracy.
