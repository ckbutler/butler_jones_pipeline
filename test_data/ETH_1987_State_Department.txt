 ETHIOPIA
 In September 1987, the Provisional Military Government of
 Socialist Ethiopia (PMGSE) declared itself to be the People's
 Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE). Mengistu Haile Mariam
 remains the effective ruler, and the "new" Government boasts a
 Soviet-model Constitution which formally provides for a wide
 range of protections and civil liberties for its citizens, as
 well as an elected parliament, the Shengo. In reality,
 President Mengistu continues to exercise complete control over
 the majority of Ethiopians. Mengistu is also the Commander-in-
 Chief of the armed forces, the ultimate source of his power in
 the country. He also holds the top post of General Secretary
 in the Workers Party of Ethiopia (WPE), established September
 6, 1984, as the nation's only political party. The stated
 goal of the party is to transform Ethiopia into a Marxist/
 Leninist state.
 Ethiopia deploys the largest standing army in Africa south of
 the Sahara, numbering over 250,000 men. It uses this force
 primarily to pursue military solutions to the armed
 insurgencies of varying intensities directed against the
 Government. Ethiopia also supports rebel movements fighting
 against its neighbors. The Government has an extensive
 internal security apparatus which uses a comprehensive system
 of surveillance and informers, including the kebeles (urban
 neighborhood associations) at the neighborhood level, to
 maintain its control over the population.
 The PDRE is committed to a centralized, planned economy based
 on "Socialist" principles. The economy currently suffers not
 only from civil strife (military expenditures take 20 percent
 of the budget), but also from ideological constraints, most
 visible in the Government's priority of funding for state
 farms in a nation of small, independent farmers. At the end
 of 1987, new drought and famine gripped Ethiopia.
 Ethiopia's record on human rights remained deplorable in 1987,
 notwithstanding adoption of the new Constitution which provides
 a legal basis for respect for human rights. The Government
 continued to exercise tight control over political processes,
 judicial functions, the media, labor, and education. Both
 government forces and members of longstanding insurgent groups,
 notably in Eritrea and Tigray, committed atrocities against
 prisoners and civilian populations. During 1987 the nationwide
 program of consolidating rural homesteads in new villages
 continued, often by implicit threats of force, and was
 sanctioned in the Constitution. The resettlement program
 resumed in late 1987, but the Government promised that it
 would be on a modest scale and on a purely voluntary basis.
 The Government unveiled a general plan aimed at ending the
 insurgencies, through the establishment of five autonomous
 regions, but at the end of 1987 details of the plan were
 lacking, and its practicality remained to be tested.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported instances of extrajudicial executions
 in 1987. The Government has come to rely less on actual
 violence and more on the latent threat of violence to maintain
 political control.

 ETHIOPIA
 b. Disappearance
 Although the Ethiopian Government increasingly has tolerated
 religious activity (the new Constitution also recognizes the
 right of religious freedom), it has not explained the
 disappearance between 1979 and 1985 of a number of religious
 leaders and lay people, including the Patriarch of the
 Ethiopian Orthodox Church (1979), the leader of the Ethiopian
 Evangelical Mekane Yesus Church (1979), and a number of
 Jehovah's Witnesses. Some of these people cannot be located
 and ate presumed to have been executed summarily or to have
 died.
 The well-publicized disappearance in May 1986 of the Ethiopian
 Permafient Representative to the United Nations and Ambassador
 to Canada, Berhanu Dinka, remains unresolved despite pressure
 by many Western governments for information concerning his
 whereabouts. No charges are known to have been filed against
 him, but there are unconfirmed reports that he was transferred
 in July 1987 from the "Third Police Station" (an Addis Ababa
 torture and interrogation center) to the so-called "Gebi
 Prison" in the basement of the National Palace.
 .. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The-new Constitution notably omits the passage from the 1955
 Constitution-prohibiting cruel and inhuman punishment. The
 use of torture-by the Government persisted in 1987 but has
 declined from'the levels during the period of "revolutionary
 terror" in the late 1970's.
 Torture has.-been used against members of most opposition
 groups, both those opposed for ideological reasons, such as
 the radically leftist Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party
 (EPRP) or the more moderate Ethiopian People's Democratic
 Alliance (EPDA), and those opposed for a combination of
 ideology and ethnic/regional separatism, such as the Ethiopian
 People's 'Liberation Front (EPLF) in Eritrea, the Tigray
 People's Liberation Front in Tigray, and the Oromo Liberation
 Front among the Oromo. The EPRP and the EPDA have no open
 membership within Ethiopia at present, and the Government
 seems more concerned with the ethnic/regional opposition
 groups. Political prisoners are initially taken to central
 investigation centers operated by the Ministry of Interior,
 such as the Third Police Station in Addis Ababa or the Mariam
 Gimki Center in Asmara. Interrogation is often combined with
 physical abuse, especially for those suspected of affiliation
 with an opposition or insurgency group.
 Common methods of torture include prolonged beating on the
 soles of the feet, prolonged suspension from a rope in a
 contorted position, death threats, mock executions, sleep
 deprivation, and submergence to the point of unconsciousness
 in tanks of dirty water. In June 1986, Amnesty International
 (AI) published a special report, "Political Imprisonment and
 Torture in Ethiopia," and appealed to the Ethiopian
 Government, inter alia, to stop torture and safeguard
 prisoners from ill-treatment. In two 1986 cases involving
 prosecutions of kebele officials for torture, AI reported the
 authorities had sentenced 14 kebele officials to 3-year and
 life imprisonment terms, while another received the death
 sentence.

 ETHIOPIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 While no accurate figures are available, some human rights
 groups outside Ethiopia estimate that the Government has
 incarcerated as many as 3,000 people for political reasons.
 Over half of these political prisoners have not been formally
 charged or sentenced. The new Constitution sets forth certain
 civil liberties for all Ethiopians, including prohibition
 against unreasonable search and seizure and a requirement that
 arrested citizens be arraigned in court within 48 hours. The
 Constitution also provides for arrest warrants, a fair trial,
 the right to protection against self-incrimination, and the
 right to counsel. These constitutional measures became
 effective on September 12, 1987, but the Government has yet to
 take any steps to implement them or to extend them to those
 already imprisoned at the time they came into effect.
 Widespread expectations of a general amnesty for political
 prisoners concurrently with the establishment of the PDRE did
 not materialize.
 Although the new Constitution emphasizes the seriousness of
 any treasonable act, it does not specifically limit the due
 process rights of those charged with offenses against the
 State. Nevertheless, Ethiopians suspected of antigovernmental
 actions or sentiments continue to be subject to arrest or
 detention by the police without charge or judicial review. In
 politically sensitive arrests, the Government generally prefers
 to operate in secret, taking the suspect from home at night.
 In most cases, political detainees are held incommunicado,
 without charge and without legal representation, at least
 initially, and sometimes for the length of their term of
 incarceration. The term of confinement for a suspect held
 without legal charge is subject to the whim of the detaining
 official or agent. Some prisoners continue to be held without
 charge 13 years after their detention.
 In 1987 about 25 people were arrested in Addis Ababa, Dire
 Dawa, and Gondar, reportedly after arranging for the
 surreptitious departure of Jews from Ethiopia. At the end of
 1987, they had not been charged or tried, and AI cited reports
 that several of them had been tortured.
 Arbitrary arrest is not limited to the politically suspect.
 Even people with no record of political activity or political
 affiliations have been arrested and detained for months or
 longer without explanation. In March 1987, the Government
 detained an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 unemployed Addis Ababa
 residents suspected of street crime. Those whose kebeles
 would not vouch for them were transported to a "resettlement"
 site in the countryside.
 Ethiopia has generated the largest number of refugees in
 Africa. There are more than 1 million Ethiopian refugees
 living in neighboring countries, and tens of thousands, many
 of whom cannot return to Ethiopia for fear of persecution,
 living abroad.
 There is no information that forced labor is practiced in
 Ethiopia. However, on the demand of the kebele officials,
 citizens are required to "volunteer" their services for
 frequent community work programs. Workers are also expected
 to "volunteer" to work extra hours and weekends, at no pay, so
 that factory quotas can be met.
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In the PDRE there continues to be no real separation between
 the executive branch and the judiciary. Courts are subject to
 political control and are responsive to the requirements of
 Ethiopia's leadership. The modern court system has a Supreme
 Court at the apex and includes magistrate courts and a Special
 Court of Appeal. While the civil court system operates
 relatively independently of politics, the criminal court
 system is more open to political manipulation. The special
 courts established for trying political crimes against the
 State were abolished with the adoption of the new Constitution
 in February 1987. The recent consolidation of the Ministry of
 Interior and Ministry of Publid Security into a single ministry'
 under.the former head of Public Security implies a continuing,
 overriding piiority for state security regardless of
 constitutional provisions for humane judicial procedures.
 AI and Western governments continue to press the PDRE to bring
 charges against, or to release, all political prisoners,
 including the 10 remaining members of the royal family
 detained since the Revolution. When political trials do take
 place, they are almost always held in secret with only the
 verdict (if even that) publicly announced. Prisoners cleared
 of charges or whose terms have been completed are not always
 promptly released from prisons.
 In -practice, the right to a fair public trial is observed and
 respected in civil add criminal cases of a nonpolitical nature.
 These cases generally are based upon the submission of evidence
 in a public setting. Minor cases are tried at-the kebele
 level, while more serious criminal accusations are tried in
 courts where the accused has access to court-appointed lawyers.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the "inviolability of the house"
 and protects against unlawful entry into private homes. In
 reality, as in the past, warrants are not used for searches of
 offices or private homes. However, the number of incidents of
 forced entry by government forces, which are often related to
 enforcing military call-ups, appeared to decrease in 1987,
 including in homes in regions of insurrection,
 Although the practice is generally decreasing, surveillance of
 persons, both visual or thrbugh use of listening devices,
 continues with no legal restraints. All mail is subject to
 government monitoring. Ethiopian citizens can be called in at
 any time for questioning by authorities and for mandatory
 kebele meetings, political rallies, or marches. Refusal to
 appear for any of the above may result in imprisonment without
 hearing.
 Local kebele association officials monitor urban Ethiopians,
 whereas peasant association leaders perform the same function
 in the countryside. These officials monitor visitors
 received, items brought in and out of houses, any meetings,
 and adherence to local curfews. Such surveillance and petty
 interference in the private lives of Ethiopian citizens is
 very much dependent on the makeup of the kebele and its
 leadership.
 Government proclamations designed to enforce Socialist
 patterns of work make it illegal for a private farmer to
 
 
 100
 ETHIOPIA
 employ laborers on his farm or to own more than one home.
 Such proclamations, however, are apparently ignored in some
 remote areas of the country.
 The Government's forced resettlement program which was halted
 following an international outcry late in 1985, was rife with
 abuses, including the wholesale separation of families and
 inhumane conditions of transport to resettlement sites up to
 700 kilometers distant. There were reports in 1987 that up to
 100,000 persons had returned to their native provinces.
 Nevertheless, an affirmation of the Government's commitment to
 resettlement is incorporated in Article 10 of the new
 Constitution, which protects the Government's right to "ensure
 that human settlement patterns correspond to the distribution
 of natural resources." In accordance with this commitment,
 the Government late in 1987 resumed the resettlement program,
 announcing plans to resettle 300,000 people in 1 year. By the
 end of 1987, however, only a few hundred people had been
 resettled. Preliminary reports indicated that these people
 had volunteered for resettlement to escape the drought, that
 families had been resettled as a unit, that they had been
 transported in buses adequate td the task, and that the
 resettlement sites were prepared to receive them.
 Progress was made in 1987 to reunite unaccompanied
 children/orphans with their families. Of the estimated 17,000
 unaccompanied children/orphans who were a byproduct of drought
 and resettlement, the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation
 Commission has placed 9,137 with family members. Although the
 reunification effort continues, the Commission estimates that
 it may be impossible to locate the families of about 3,000
 children.
 The Government's mandatory "villagization" campaign, which
 collects scattered rural farmers into newly created villages,
 continued in 1987. It is sanctioned under Article 10,
 Sub-Article 3 of the Constitution, which states that "the
 State shall encourage the scattered rural population to
 aggregate in order to change their backward living condition
 and to enable them to lead a better life." According to the
 Government, 5,725,530 Ethiopians had been moved into such
 villages as of February 1987 (15 percent of the rural
 population). The Government has announced plans that call for
 31 percent of the rural population to be moved into villages
 by July 1988. Rural farmers cannot avoid participating in the
 program, and to date almost everyone living in areas scheduled
 for villagization has been moved into the new settlements.
 The program has proceeded in the Gondar region despite some
 scattered antigovernment violence in opposition to the program
 early in 1987. The Government has devoted few resources to
 this large program, so fbrmers must dismantle their own
 houses, transport them to the government-selected village
 site, and reassemble them. Social services such as schools,
 new roads, or clinics, though promised, are rare. The
 Government has repeatedly stated that this program is a
 precursor to collectivization of Ethiopia's agriculture.
 Despite this goal, over 90 percent of agriculture is still on
 an individual family basis.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 In 1987 armed conflict between government and various
 opposition forces continued in many parts of the country,
 especially in the regions of Tigray. and Eritrea. In previous
 years, there were some reports from insurgent areas of summary
 executions of combatants and civilians by both government
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 101
 ETHIOPIA
 forces and rebel groups. No specific instances were recorded
 in 1987. While in previous years there were instances of
 relief workers in insurgent areas being killed, no incidents
 occurred in 1987. However, a guerrilla group detained a
 Western humanitarian relief worker in October 1987; she was
 released in neighboring Sudan in November. Another guerrilla
 group seized two Western contractors working at a village
 settlement scheme in November 1987; they had not been released
 by the end of the year. Guerrilla forces continued
 indiscriminate mining of roadways as a battle tactic.
 Government and insurgent forces reportedly destroyed crops and
 homes in their opponents' areas.
 On October 23, 1987 insurgent forces attacked and burned
 without warning an unarmed and unescorted famine relief
 column, destroying 23 late-model trucks traveling to food
 distribution centers in Eritrea and Tigray. One driver was
 killed, and 400 tons of wheat, enough to feed 40,000 people
 for a month: was destroyed. This incident challenged the
 famine relief effort, particularly to regions which insurgents
 claim to dominate. The temporary severance of crucial
 transport links increased the possibility of famine afflicting
 hundreds of thousands of civilians.
 The number and treatment of prisoners held by government
 forces and rebel groups are not known. Some reports indicate
 that the treatment of PDRE prisoners by some guerrilla forces
 generally has been good. The Government apparently does not
 recognize those rebels captured in battle as prisoners of war,
 but rather classifies them as guilty of treason and either
 executes or imprisons them. The Government considers its own
 soldiers captured by insurgent forces as deserters who merit
 execution, imprisonment, or immediate reassignment to the war
 front if returned. The Government prevents relief
 organizations from providing communications with families of
 the PDRE prisoners in rebel hands. Of the insurgent groups,
 only the EPLF has begun to allow the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) limited access to some of its
 prisoners.
 In addition, the Ethiopian-Somalia conflict continued to
 simmer in 1987. The PDRE has permitted the ICRC to visit 230
 of its Somali prisoners of war, who were captured during the
 1977 war between the two countries.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Ethiopia. The
 Government owns and operates all information media and
 exercises censorship through editorial boards and the Ministry
 of Information. Expression of unauthorized political opinions
 or of views at variance with the official government line can
 result in imprisonment. Political, economic, and social
 policies In Ethiopia are formulated at top levels of
 government, then disseminated and monitored through the
 government-controlled media and government-organized citizen
 groups.
 The Government closely monitors the pronouncements of public
 officials, academics, and clergy. Some instructors and
 professors in secondary schools and at the university have
 
 
 102
 ETHIOPIA
 resisted the politicization of education. Academic freedom,
 although seriously circumscribed, especially in the political
 and social sciences, still finds limited expression at the
 university. In October 1987, students at two University of
 Addis Ababa campuses demonstrated against dormitory living
 conditions and the removal of the dean of students. About 10
 students were arrested for their alleged leadership role in
 the demonstrations but released a short time later.
 Books and magazines can be confiscated if deemed to contain
 sentiments opposed to the revolution. Foreign magazines and
 newspapers are not readily available since foreign exchange is
 not granted to purchase them. Foreign radio broadcasts are
 widely listened to in Ethiopia. There is no evidence of overt
 attempts by the Government to interfere with radio reception.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Notwithstanding constitutional provisions, assembly of any
 sort not previously approved by the Government is strictly
 forbidden under penalty of arrest. In contrast, attendance at
 government-sponsored rallies, meetings, and parades is
 frequently mandatory and enforced by a wide range of
 sanctions.  Ethiopians, traditionally cautious in their
 associations with one another and with foreigners, have become
 even more.so under the present regime. There is a pervasive
 system of informers and surveillance. Frequent or close
 association with foreigners can result in questioning, arrest,
 and detention. Professional associations, such as the Rotary
 and Lions clubs, are allowed to operate, though their
 membership and activities presumably are monitored by the
 Government. Trade and professional associations were
 reorganized in 1986 by order of the Workers Party of
 Ethiopia. New boards were selected for these groups from
 members approved by the party.
 Workers are not permitted to organize independently in
 Ethiopia, and labor/management negotiations are strictly
 controlled. Collective bargaining does not exist. Strikes
 and slowdowns are forbidden. The only labor organization
 allowed to operate is the government-controlled All-Ethiopia
 Trade Union (AETU). The AETU, one of Ethiopia's mass
 organizations, is a political group used by the Government to
 implement its policies, expand party control within the
 workplace, and prevent work stoppages. Many of AETU's top
 leaders have been trained in Eastern Europe, and the
 organization has close ties to Soviet and Eastern European
 labor organizations. The 1985 report of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts criticized the
 mandatory, single trade union structure in Ethiopia and
 repeated its request that freedom of association be granted to
 rural workers and public servants.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite government attempts to deemphasize the importance of
 religion in Ethiopian life and to ensure Orthodox Church
 conformance with party policies, there has been a notable
 resurgence in recent years in religious observance and church
 attendance. The Government allows the Orthodox Church and the
 Muslim religion (each claims about 50 percent of Ethiopia's
 population) freedom of worship and proselytism, as stipulated
 in the new Constitution. The Government has appointed some
 officials to the Orthodox Church administration to ensure
 church conformity with party policies. Party members are
 
 
 103
 ETHIOPIA
 prohibited from worshiping, but this ban is not enforced.
 According to press reports, kebeles often discourage church
 attendance, generally by scheduling mandatory meetings on
 Sunday mornings. , The Government -nationalized most church
 property when it took power, and the church reportedly is
 dependent on annual government compensation payments to cover
 clergy salaries.
 Orthodox and Muslim holidays are recognized by the Government,
 and officials of both religions are allowed to exercise
 jurisdiction over civil matters such as marriage. However,
 the Government exppnges references to any deity from dialog in
 television programs and films and forbids such references in
 government statements or publications.
 Some other religions, particularly foreign Protestant -
 evangelical organizations, which found their activities
 sharply curtailed following the revolution, have experienced a
 general trend of greater 1olerancelby central and local
 government officials over the last 2 years. Local government
 officials allowed a number of churches that had been closed to
 reopgn. Tn 1986 a number of church officials were released
 from detention including the General Secretary of the
 Mennonite Church (who had.been-detained since 1981) and
 leaders of the Ethiopian -Evangelical Mekane Yesu church. The
 Governmen1 .gives permits to-,forgign missionaries to enter and
 work in Ethiopia in limited numbers, although ostensibly as
 development specialists, not as missionaries.  The Jehovah's
 Witnesses, hqwever, remain totally banned.
 Ethiapiats small Jewish community (the Falashas) live in areas
 of insurgency (Tigray, Gondor). Stories of "genocidal"
 actions by Ethiopian authorities or of highly brutal behavior
 toward Ethiopian Jews-have not been substantiated by American.
 visitors to these areas.. Jews do suffer-some economic .
 discrimination, a holdover from'prerevolutionary practices.
 During~jg7 the: ovqoment continued to permit foreign
 visitors, including groups of American-Jews, relatively
 unrestrictedaccess to Falasha -communities in the Gondar
 region. These :communities also continued to receive
 assistance from the U.S. Government andprivate sources.
 Large numbers of Ethiopian Jews have surreptitiously left the
 country in recent years. The Government has attempted to
 bldck this exodus as part of its overall antiemigration policy
 (see Section l.d.). Those who have left Ethiopia are not
 permitted to return-to visit family members, and family
 members (as with non-Jewish Ethiopians> are ,generally not
 permitted to emigrate on the basis of family reunification.
 d.- Freedom of Movpment Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although the new Constitutipn provkdes for freedom of movement
 and the freedom to change one's place of residence within
 Ethiopia, actual government practice is quite restrictive.
 Travel within Ethiopia is limited asia result of the
 insurgencies (several areas, mainly in the northern
 administrative zones, are closed to travel for security
 reasons). Permission is required for Ethiopian citizens to
 change their place of residence, and persons- considered
 politically suspect can be forbidden to travel outside their
 home areas. Travel abroad by Ethiopians is closely controlled
 by the Government through the issuance of passports and
 mandatory exit visas. Passport appl-ictions require a letter
 of recommendation from the appropriate kebele head. Foreigners
 
 
 104
 ETHIOPIA
 in Ethiopia have always been required to obtain a travel permit
 for internal travel. In 1987 they occasionally were denied
 that permission, although most representatives of the United
 Nations and of foreign assistance programs and embassies,
 including U.S. officials, have been able to obtain permits to
 travel in connection with their assistance programs.
 Emigration is highly restricted, except in special
 circumstances such as marriage to or adoption by a foreign
 national. Leaving Ethiopia without authorization is a serious
 offense punishable by 5 to 15 years' imprisonment or, in
 exceptional cases, reportedly by death. Nonetheless,
 considerable illegal emigration occurs either under the
 subterfuge of travel abroad for business or to visit
 relatives, or by arduous treks overland and surreptitious
 crossing of borders.
 The Government recognizes the right of voluntary repatriation,
 and its proclamation of mass amnesty for Ethiopians living
 abroad (numbering more than 1 million) remains in effect.
 From 1983 to 1987, according to figures provided by the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), approximately 750,000
 Ethiopians spontaneously returned to Ethiopia from Sudan,
 Djibouti, and Somalia. Most of the returnees were rural
 people who returned spontaneously; the outflow of refugees
 during the same period was about 550,000. The PDRE supports
 UNHCR repatriation programs, which have successfully
 repatriated 3,397 Ethiopians from Djibouti since late 1986 and
 approximately 5,500 Ethiopians from Somalia during the same
 period. Many of the returnees benefited from UNHCR
 assistance. There is no evidence that they were mistreated or
 discriminated against upon their return.
 There have been no reports of the Government forcibly
 repatriating refugees from other countries.
 As a result of the civil war in southern Sudan, an estimated
 103,000 Sudanese refugees entered Ethiopia in 1987, bringing
 the total number of Sudanese refugees to about 225,000. The
 Ethiopian Government also reports that it has received at
 least 10,000 asylum seekers from Somalia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Ethiopia are not free to change the government.
 In fact, the new Constitution institutionalizes all power in
 the Workers Party of Ethiopia (WPE), the President, his
 advisors, and the new Council of State. Political and
 economic policies are still dictated to the population with
 little opportunity for public debate.
 To give a semblance of democracy to the newly organized
 administration, the Government sponsored a referendum to
 approve the new Constitution and an election to choose the
 members of the 835-member national Shengo (one-chamber
 parliament) from slates of candidates approved by the WPE.
 Following public discussion meetings held throughout the
 country, the People's Review Board made several changes in the
 draft Constitution. Eighty percent of those voting reportedly
 voted in favor of the new Constitution.
 The WPE and its "mass organizations" purport to offer Ethiopian
 citizens a means of participation in government, but its real
 role is to ensure adherence to Marxist/Leninist principles.
 
 
 105'
 ETHIOPIA
 The.WPE, like its Soviet counterpart, is an exclusive
 group--not everyone can join. Some, such as higher-level
 government officials, are required to join if they wish to
 keep-their.jobs. Kebeles, the primary party/government
 control..mechanisms at the local level, control housing
 allocation,.basic food rationing, political indoctrination,
 and implementation of other government policies, such as
 registration and selection of youths for national military
 service.
 The new Constitution mandates the formation of assemblies
 (shengos) in the various regions including in the five newly
 created autonomous regions. Under the autonomy plan, the
 Assembly of the Eritrean Autonomous Region is to have the
 exclusive right to promulgate and enforce its own laws so long
 as they do not conflict with national laws. The assemblies of
 the other four autonomous regions, Assab, Tigray, Dire Dawa,
 and'Ogaden, would-require -permission from the central
 governmdertin order to formulate their own laws. The
 Cons.titution'also lists a number of responsibilities reserved
 for the regionar-assemblies and their executive committees,
 including the preparation of social and economic plans and
 budgets for approval'by the national Shengo. The PDRE hopes
 the  autonomy plan will serve as the basis for a political
 solution-to the various internal insurgencies, but
 implementatian has not really begun.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 --wNongoverhmental, Investigatioif of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights,
 The Government resists attempts. by international and
 nongovernmental organizations to investigate human- rights
 cases. It-did not respond, for example, to Al's various
 inquiries in 196, such as on the. reported use of torture.
 There is no governmental or private body to investigate
 alleged human rights violations. Representatives of the ICRC
 in Addis Ababa are allowed to visit some of the prisoners of
 war from the 1977-78 war with Somalia. The ICRC does not have
 access to prisoners held by Ethiopian-backed rebel groups
 opposing the Governments of Sudan and Somalia. Ethiopia is
 not a signatory to any of the United Nations' human rights
 documents or the African Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all Ethiopians
 irrespective of nationality, sex, religion, occupation, social
 or other status. The highest government echelons are no
 longer dominated by the Amhara ethnic group but include many
 Oromos and a few Eritreans and Tigreans. Almost all senior
 government and political figures are of Christian origin,
 although the population is approximately 50 percent Muslim.
 While the rights of women are protected and promised
 additional government support by the Constiutution, sexual
 discrimination persists. Various U.N. studies indicate,
 Ethiopian women are subject to many disadvantages,
 encountering, among other things, cultural and traditional
 biases, marriages imposed at a very young age, hard and-
 time-consuming labor, inadequate employment opportunities, and
 subaverage wages in urban areas. Village leadership is
 invariably male, and all clergy are male. However, women in
 the principal Ethiopian cultures (Oromo, Amhara, Eritrea, and
 
 
 106
 ETHIOPIA
 Tigray) enjoy economic rights equal to those of men. They may
 inherit, sell, or buy property and engage in business. In
 some rural areas, women have a subservient status within the
 home, and child marriages remain common, despite opposition by
 the Government. Long-established practices, such as female
 circumcision remain prevalent despite government opposition
 among Ethiopian Orthodox and Muslim families and is less
 common with some other groups.
 The Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association, a mass
 organization created in 1980, has the proclaimed goal of
 improving the status of women. Women are poorly represented
 at the top echelons of government. There are, however, 46
 female members in the 835-member Shengo.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The new Constitution recognizes in principal the right to work
 and to rest. Given high unemployment, there is pressure for
 existing jobs in the modern economy. Accordingly, the minimum
 age of 14 for nonfarm labor seems to be respected. The
 maximum legal workweek of 48 hours also is generally respected
 in practice, but, as noted, there is much volunteer labor to
 meet factory or office quotas, and government workers receive
 little of their promised time off. Health and safety codes
 for the workplace are rudimentary and remain unenforced.
 The minimum wage in Ethiopia is about $24 per month.
 Additional allowances effectively raise the minimum wage of a
 full-time employee to about $34. Day laborers in the
 agricultural sector receive almost $1 per day plus some
 payment in kind (shelter or a meal, for example). Day
 laborers in the urban areas receive almost $1.50 per day plus
 transportation to and from the workplace. The minimum wage
 has been under review for some time without decision.
