 LIBERIA
 Liberia, sub-Saharan Africa's first republic, has been ruled
 by a military council since the 1980 coup ended 133 years of
 constitutionally elected government. Supreme executive and
 legislative authority is vested in the 23-member Peoples'
 Redemption Council, with Council Chairman Samuel Kanyon Doe
 directing the government as Head of State and Armed Forces
 Commander in Chief.
 The coup broke the political and economic power of a minority
 group descended from 19th-century settlers who came to Liberia
 seeking freedoms denied them in the United States and West
 Indies. However, these so-called *Americo-Liberians" and their
 descendants had largely excluded from power the indigenous
 ethnic groups, 95 percent of Liberia's two million population.
 The young coup makers, all noncommissioned officers from indig-
 enous backgrounds, justified taking power as a revolt against
 elite rule. The Council has committed itself to establishing
 civilian democratic government in 1985, and the legitimacy of the
 military regime rests primarily on this pledge. Since the coup,
 substantial progress has been achieved in the transition with the
 drafting of a new constitution, election of an assembly to review
 the draft, declaration of amnesty for political prisoners,
 lifting of the curfew, and restitution of some expropriated
 properties. The Council has promulgated a detailed timetable for
 turnover of power according to which the present ban on political
 activity is scheduled for repeal in April 1984, followed by
 election of a President, Vice President, and legislators in early
 1985.
 Martial law is in force and the old constitution, patterned on
 the American model, has been suspended along with the right of
 habeas corpus. However, the civilian court system has been
 reestablished to try defendants charged under pre-coup statutes,
 which remain valid. Abuses by security officers, usually acting
 individually without apparent government sanction, rose sharply
 after the coup. Although the severity and frequency of these
 incidents have diminished, reports are common of harassment,
 extortion, arbitrary detention and summary judgment of civil
 disputes by police and military officers, including in some
 cases Council members.
 Education, wealth, and commercial property are concentrated in
 a narrow elite, while two-thirds of the population remain in
 subsistence agriculture. The Council has attempted to reduce
 income disparities by increasing employment in government,
 the country's largest single jobs provider, and raising
 minimum wages for civil servants and military. However, eco-
 nomic contraction and government mismanagement and corruption
 have obstructed the Council's stated intent to broaden access
 to education, health service, and participation in the modern
 sector.
 Liberia has a mixed economy with significant public corporation
 activity in utilities, agricultural marketing, and transporta-
 tion. Foreign exchange receipts and government revenues are
 heavily dependent on exports of iron ore, rubber, and timber,
 all of which have suffered prolonged market decline. Retail
 and wholesale trade are dominated by expatriate communities,
 primarily Lebanese and Indian. Regulations regarding capital
 accumulation, investment, and repatriation are liberal, but only
 citizens may owrt real property, and citizenship is restricted
 by law to 'Negroes or persons of Negro descent.'

 Public order has stabilized since the random violence,
 repression, and executions of the coup and its aftermath. The
 regime has ceased secret trials and executions ot alleged coup
 plotters.  In 1983 no persons were known to have disappeared or
 been killed for their political beliefs or actions. The
 civilian court system operates on the Anglo-American pattern
 with a degree of due process and impartiality, but corruption
 and influence by high government officials prejudices the out-
 comes of some trials. Arbitrary arrests and detentions are
 not condoned, but the Government is unable to curb completely
 the excesses of some of its own members. In addition,
 unauthorized beatings are sometimes administered to suspects
 at the time of arrest. Prison conditions are harsh, although
 prisoners may receive visitors and materials from the outside.
 Bail bonding is available in most non-capital ottenses.
 The Council decrees formally curtail freedom of speech and press.
 Nevertheless, the Government has dealt inconsistently with
 news publications and public speakers, alternately encouraging
 and punishing both criticism and discussion of its actions.
 Freedom of association is limited by a ban on labor strikes and
 forced dissolution of some fraternal organizations. Freedoms
 of movement and privacy are largely respected, although
 individual cases of harassment have been reported. There is no
 religious persecution, but some friction exists between Muslims
 and Christians.
 The Council depicts itself as the 'redeemer" of a historic
 Liberian commitment to human rights and democracy that fell
 progressively into disuse under previous administrations. The
 military government is actively pursuing the transition to
 democratic civilian rule. Respect for human rights has
 improved with the relaxation of some authoritarian measures and
 reaffirmation through the constitutional process of human rights
 principles. The Council has posed no known objections to human
 rights investigations by individuals or organizations. However,
 the regime remains watchful of perceived challenges to public
 order or its own survival, and has responded with threats and
 occasional repressive actions. The framework of martial law
 remains in place during the transition process. In addition,
 continued indiscipline and corruption among the security forces
 and throughout the Government pose difficulties in upholding
 human rights.
 RESPECT FOR UMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 In the aftermath of the 1980 coup, the Council publicly executed
 13 former regime officials, and soldiers acting apparently with-
 out the sanction of the Government murdered several other members
 of the dispossessed Americo-Liberian elite. Prior to 1983, the
 military government also executed several alleged coup plotters
 following secret trials. With Council consolidation of support,
 this practice has ceased. Several investigations of reported
 coup-plotting were conducted in 1983, with suspects either
 cleared or administratively disciplined for "improper" behavior
 or statements.

 Reports of ritual killing resurfaced in 1983. This traditional
 practice calls for use of human body parts by magicians for
 spells designed to confer power or prosperity upon the person
 commissioning the witchcraft. While most well-educated
 Liberians claim to disdain superstition or sorcery, belief in
 the power of traditional magic is still strong among the
 illiterate and rural populations--and, to a lesser extent,
 among literate persons as well. Specific motivations for the
 ritual killings were unclear in each of the approximately 12
 cases, and no alleged instigators were identified or charged.
 There is no evidence of involvement by organized government,
 quasi-government, or opposition elements. The Government, in
 fact, has condemned the practice and vowed to halt it. Ritual
 murder victims were apparently randomly selected. No known
 instances occurred in 1983 of persons killed for their political
 beliefs or actions.
 b. Disappearance
 Following the coup, hundreds of persons with connections to the
 tormer regime were imprisoned without charge for varying periods
 by the new Government. While no lists of detainees were made
 public, in most cases relatives and friends were able to learn
 of the detentions, make visits, and provide supplies to those
 detained, with the announcement of an amnesty for all political
 prisoners in December 1981, approximately 20 remaining prisoners
 were released. Two prominent political figures were said by the
 Government to have died while in detention: Former National
 Police Director Varney Dempster and former Senator A. B. Tolbert,
 son of the late President William B. Tolbert who was overthrown
 in the coup. Since that time, there have been no permanent dis-
 appearances of persons resulting from actions of government,
 quasi-government, or opposition elements, although arbitrary
 arrests and detentions, mostly short term, have continued.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Suspects in criminal offenses may be subjected to beating or
 lashing by security personnel upon or shortly after apprehension
 as a summary form of 'justice." However, it is not in most cases
 repetitive nor used as a tool in interrogation. Prisoners are
 also often stripped to their underwear in an effort at
 humiliation and to impede their escape. These practices run
 counter to Liberian judicial principles and are not condoned by
 the Government, although they have proved difficult to curb.
 However, some criminal statutes authorize sentences including
 periodic administration of a specified number of lashes. Most
 prisons lack proper nutritional, exercise, and sanitary
 facilities. Several injuries but no deaths resulted from the
 collapse through poor maintenance of an aged prison building in
 Greenville, Sinoe County, in September. However, the Palace of
 Correction in Zwedru, Grand Gedeh County, is reported to be
 clean, modern, and spacious.
 Custom and government regulation permit "trial by ordeal* in
 some civil and criminal cases although senior government offi-
 cials have spoken out against the practice. While the sus-
 pect's consent is formally required, social pressure may play
 a coercive role. The ordeal usually consists of drinking a
 liquid prepared trnm the bark of the 'sassywood" tree.
 
 
 201
 Vomiting the liquid after ingestion indicates innocence, while
 its retention signifies guilt. However, even if vomited, the
 potion may be toxic. At least three deaths were reported by
 the press following sassywood ingestion in 1983. In one
 instance, following the death of a suspect who drank sassywood,
 another person involved in the case also voluntarily ingested
 the liquid to prove its impartiality--and afterward also died.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Martial law coexists under the Government with civilian law
 enforcement and Judicial machinery. While the Constitution
 and the right of habeas corpus have been suspended, the full
 body of pre-coup statute and case law is regarded as valid.
 Civilians charged with statute violations are arrested by
 police under warrant and must be charged within three days
 of the arrest. Suspects have the right of bail in noncapital
 offenses, are entitled to legal counsel, and may only be
 convicted in a court ot law under the due process procedures.
 Security officers charged under Council decrees, and in some
 cases civilians, may be arrested by armed forces personnel and
 brought before the Supreme Military Tribunal. The Tribunal is
 a panel of three uniformed officers which operates in accordance
 with the Uniform Code of Military Justice of the U.S. military.
 In practice, reports of abuses by police and soldiers are
 frequent, although declining in response to disciplinary efforts
 by some senior government officials. On separate occasions in
 1983, the National Police Director and the Chairman of the
 Joint Security Commission publicly criticized police officers,
 alleging arbitrary arrest, detention, confiscation of personal
 belongings, and requirement of payment in exchange for release
 from detention. Soldiers have also reportedly arrested civil-
 ians without proper cause, citing "martial law" and requiring
 payment to avoid or be released from detention. Some Council
 members apparently have arrogated to themselves informal
 authority to arrest, detain, and try persons involved in civil
 and labor disputes, imposing fines and short prison sentences
 without reference to due process or the content of relevant
 statutes and decrees. In May, a Council member traveling
 through a county capital ordered the former county superin-
 tendent detained for one day and fined $100 because the former
 official failed to greet the Councilman upon the latter's
 arrival.
 In most cases, arbitrary arrest and detention are ended upon
 payment of a "fine" or personal appeal to higher authority. In
 some instances, Council members have countermanded orders from
 other Councilmen to detain individuals. Detainees are typically
 involved in private disputes. But despite the Government's
 stated policy not to hold political prisoners, at least two
 cases were reported in 1983 of persons detained for having
 criticized government actions. One was held one week, the other
 two months. Most detentions are of short duration--but there
 was a report in mid-1983 that a civilian employer had been in a
 military stockade for more than five months upon the order of a
 Council member who intervened in a dispute between the employer
 and one of his workers. At that time, according to the report,
 approximately 20 other persons were being held in the stockade
 without warrant.
 
 
 202
 Detention without trial also occurred under the former regime.
 The Government has on several occasions announced the release
 of persons whose incarceration antedated the 1980 coup. In July,
 Head of State Doe toured the Monrovia Central Prison in the
 Liberian capital and ordered the release of seven persons who
 had been held without trial on murder charges from two to 15
 years.
 The Government does not exile citizens.   In fact, the Council
 has on many occasions urged Liberians who fled or stayed
 abroad after the coup to return home. However, the Government
 specifically excluded from its amnesty two former regime
 figures, who remain abroad:  former Vice President Bennie
 Warner and True Whig Political Party Secretary General Clarence
 Simpson.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Liberia's civilian statutory court system is modeled after
 Anglo-American jurisprudence, and its military courts follow
 the Uniform Code of Military Justice of the U.S. military.
 while a degree of due process and impartiality exists, cor-
 ruption among lawyers and judges reportedly tarnishes the
 quality of justice available in the courts. In July, the
 Supreme Court banned the prosecutor for the Special Military
 Tribunal from practicing law for one year after an investigation
 by the Grievance and Ethics Committee indicated he had abandoned
 unfinished cases after being paid for handling them. Apparent
 incompetence also plays a role. In April, the Monrovia City
 Court sentenced 50 "juvenile delinquents* to jail pending
 payment of $50 fines each without formally charging the youths
 or affording them counsel.
 Allegations of corruption and incompetence have twice led the
 Head of State to dismiss the three-judge panel constituting the
 Special Theft Court, whose decisions are not subject to review
 by any other court. As of this writing, the Theft Court,
 established shortly after the coup, had not been reconstituted
 a second time in view of criticism from judiciary and government
 figures of its record and its anomalous position in the Liberian
 judicial system. Some decisions of the Theft Court and the
 Supreme Military Tribunal have reportedly reflected exercise of
 influence by high government officials. However, the Supreme
 Court in September defied the Justice Minister, reversing a
 Ministry order to freeze the bank account of a company in
 litigation and fining the Minister $500 for contempt of court.
 Traditional courts presided over by tribal chiefs are not bound
 by Anglo-American common law or judicial principles but apply
 customary unwritten law to domestic and land disputes and petty
 theft. Customary court decisons may be reviewed in the statu-
 tory court system, or may be appealed through a hierarchy of
 chiefs, followed by administrative review by the Internal
 Affairs Ministry, and in some instances a final review by the
 Head of State. Allegations of corruption and incompetence are
 also frequent in traditional court proceedings.
 Prior to 1983, there were several instances of secret trials
 resulting in executions of alleged coup plotters. The degree
 of due process afforded defendants could not be ascertained.
 There were no reports of secret trials in 1983, although one
 person was administratively disciplined for "improper*
 
 
 203
 statements following an investigation into allegations he
 participated in coup-plotting. Nor were there any charges
 brought publicly of violating the political activities ban or
 opposing the regime.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the martial law regime currently in effect, security
 forces may enter private residences without warrants, although
 civilian courts continue to issue warrants in the majority of
 cases. There were several cases reported in 1983 of persons
 arrested in their homes without'a warrant. In none of these
 cases, however, was the residence reportedly entered forcibly.
 In enforcing the ban on political activities, Liberian security
 services monitor the activities of groups or individuals believed
 to harbor political ambitions. Surveillance is not widespread or
 generalized, however. Children are not encouraged to report on
 the activities of their parents, nor are there "block wardens"
 designated to monitor the activities of persons in their
 neighborhoods or work places.
 There have been some instances reported of apparent mail-opening
 by government forces. There is no express prohibition on
 receiving foreign publications, but decrees banning criticism of
 government actions have discouraged the distribution of a book by
 a noted Liberian dissident abroad. However, copies of a magazine
 by a U.S.-based group of Liberian students that freely comments
 on both negative and positive aspects of Council rule are widely
 available.
 The Government has returned most of the real and personal
 property confiscated from prominent individuals and families
 after the coup. However, some residences remain in use by
 government officials. In addition, the Government has not
 authorized the return of holdings, some extensive, owned by the
 families of the late President Tolbert and the 13 former regime
 cabinet officials executed shortly after the Council's accession
 to power.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government has dealt inconsistently with the issue of free
 speech and press. Council Decree 2-A outlaws efforts to
 "control, influence, oppose, castigate, or deride (government)
 actions or policies." The decree mandates death by firing
 squad for offenders. However, in practice, only two cases have
 been tried under the decree, both prior to 1983, and in both,
 the convicted defendants were pardoned by the Head of State.
 In a March 1983 statement to the editor of Liberia's only daily
 independent newspaper, Head of State Doe urged journalists to
 report freely on any subject, including government corruption,
 "without fear or favor," as long as reporters got the facts
 right. However, one month later, the Government detained for
 one week without charges the writer of a letter to the newspaper
 because he criticized a Government decision to prosecute the
 former president of a state-owned bank for corruption. The
 newspaper itself was closed in August by the Justice Minister,
 
 
 204
 who claimed its articles were "uncomplimentary to Government."
 It reopened three days later after Doe's intervention. In
 September, an army camp commander in a rural area proclaimed
 his authority to censor any news from the camp and briefly
 detained a reporter for the state-owned Liberia News Agency.
 Public speakers have been punished as well for addressing major
 issues. Another commencement speaker was briefly detained in
 early 1983 by security forces and interrogated after giving an
 address that stressed the importance of academic institutions
 freely pursuing independent lines of inquiry. In September and
 October 1983, Doe denounced "Socialist" influence in the class-
 room and threatened to fire 300 leftist teachers, although no
 dismissals followed.
 The independent press, consisting of one daily and a number
 of less frequent and relatively minor publications, reports
 generally accurately on a wide range of news developments, but
 usually avoids direct criticism of government policies. In
 analyzing public issues, finding fault with the status quo and
 suggesting remedies, however, editorials regularly criticize
 indirectly. In a few instances, Government has forbidden
 reports on specific events, such as labor unrest or school
 disturbances, whose disclosure could prove embarrassing to the
 Government. However, there is no continuing censorship of
 independent news organs. The government-owned Liberian News
 Agency keeps high standards of accuracy, although it omits
 reports on some developments at the direction of the
 Information Ministry. In addition to supplementing the inde-
 pendent press, the Agency provides news copy for the government
 organs: a daily newspaper; AM, FM, and shortwave radio stations;
 and the single television channel. The two private radio
 stations, both run by missionary groups, also use the govern-
 mental news agency for their domestic news. Government radio and
 television feature a number of public interest programs, such as
 a weekly series in which members of the Constitution Drafting
 Commission talk freely on civilian rule transition issues with
 interlocutors who telephone in.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned under the political activities
 prohibition. This is scheduled for repeal in 1984 as the
 civilian rule transition proceeds. Some fraternal organizations,
 notably the Masons, have been dissolved, but there are no
 restrictions on civic, religious, social, recreational, or
 self help development associations that do not discuss or engage
 in political issues. Unions are barred from calling strikes,
 but brief strikes have occurred despite the ban. The Inter-
 national Labor Organization has criticized this situation. In
 most cases, workers have been persuaded to return peacefully
 to their jobs and Government has taken no punitive action. An
 agricultural union was suspended for most of 1983 after one of
 its branches struck briefly. A transport union was also sus-
 pended indefinitely because the Government alleged its operation
 of bus stations infringed on a government prerogative. However,
 the organizing, collective bargaining, and internal operations of
 labor unions are not directed or controlled to a significant
 degree by the Government. The Council has in fact extended the
 right of organizing to commercial plantations, forbidden under
 previous administrations. Most unions belong to the Liberian
 Federation of Labor Unions, an affiliate of the International
 
 
 205
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. A government regulation
 antedating the coup requires government knowledge and concur-
 rence in any foreign assistance to Liberian unions. The
 Secretary General of an independent union, not affiliated with
 the Federation, was detained several weeks without formal charges
 in 1983 on the grounds that he had met with a leader of the
 Brussels-based World Confederation of Labor after the Labor
 Ministry had advised the foreign trade union spokesman not to
 come to Liberia.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While some friction exists between Christians and Muslims,
 there is no religious persecution in Liberia. The pre-coup
 Constitution called for separation of church and state, a
 concept repeated in the draft constitution for the future
 civilian government. Christianity, brought by 19th century
 settlers and spread through the interior by missionary
 organizations, has long been the religion of elite groups.
 But Christianity has not been an official or state-favored
 religion. Nor has there been official or informal discrim-
 ination against minority religions. Substantial segments of
 the rural population continue to practice traditional religions,
 and approximately 15 percent of the total population is Muslim.
 Many government officials are Muslims, including one supreme
 court justice and two Cabinet ministers. Muslims are active
 throughout the economy, especially in transportation and gold
 and diamond trading. In late 1983, the Government solicited
 suggestions for a date of particular significance to Muslims to
 be declared an annual national holiday.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither domestic movement nor foreign travel is restricted.
 Some travelers have reported harassment and requests for payoffs
 from security personnel manning internal checkpoints and border
 crossings. Exit visas are required for departure, and obtaining
 them may be made more difficult by bribe-seeking officials.
 Emigration and immigration are not formally restricted. Some
 naturalized Liberian citizens originally from other African
 states have had their citizenship revoked on apparently arbitrary
 grounds.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Liberia is ruled by a military council with no formal mechanism
 to allow participation by the people in political processes.
 Political activity is expressly proscribed. However, the
 military regime is actively preparing for a return to civilian
 rule and has solicited the views and participation of the people
 in the transition process. The Constitution Drafting Commission
 in 1981-82 made extensive visits throughout Liberia to hold
 public hearings on problems with the former regime and to solicit
 suggestions for the form of a new civilian government.   In 1983,
 regional conventions throughout the country attended by chiefs,
 elders, educated persons, and other community leaders elected 59
 members to a Constitutional Advisory Assembly on a population-
 proportional basis. The Assembly reviewed and modified the draft
 produced by the Commission. The process is scheduled to
 accelerate in 1984 with the repeal of the political activities
 
 
 206
 ban followed by election of the President, Vice President and
 legislators in early 1985. The new Government is scheduled to
 take power on April 12, 1985, the fifth anniversary of the coup.
 The draft constitution calls for a separate legislature,
 executive, and judiciary with extensive guarantees of human and
 political rights. The legislature is to be elected by universal
 suffrage and to have sole authority to originate laws. Judicial
 independence is mandated. The Head of State and other government
 officials have many times reaffirmed the Council's commitment to
 return the country to civilian rule in 1985.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has posed no known objections to investigations
 of the human rights situation in Liberia by any individual or
 organization. There have been no allegations of harassment,
 persecution, or intimidation in connection with attempts to
 document alleged human rights violations. The President of
 the League of Red Cross Societies visited Liberia in September.
 In its latest report, Amnesty International was concerned about
 the arrest and prosecution of individuals who allegedly infringed
 a government ban on all political activities, five of whom were
 sentenced to death but subsequently pardoned and released in
 January 1982. Freedom House rates Liberia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Liberia was founded by private American "colonization societies,"
 as a territory where blacks could enjoy political, economic, and
 social freedoms denied them in the United States. Eventually,
 20,000 settlers came to Liberia, and they and their descendants
 have remained heavily influenced by American cultural, economic,
 and political models. In urban. areas and along the seacoast
 where settler dominance was strongest, a modern sector has
 evolved with a free enterprise economy, substantial political
 and economic equality for men and women, and Anglo-American
 judicial procedures based on English common law as transmitted
 and modified by the American experience. Here, land is plotted,
 deeded, and held in fee simple and women can inherit equally.
 There is no formal discrimination in property ownership,
 educational opportunity, or participation in economic and
 political processes. Women in Liberia have held ministerial
 and ambassadorial positions, and are represented in the profes-
 sions and throughout the modern economy.
 However, 70 percent of the 2,091,000 population (1983) practice
 subsistence agriculture and follow a traditional culture in
 which men's and women's roles are more strictly defined. Here,
 most land is held communally among the related families of a
 clan, and women provide the majority of the labor in food
 production and distribution, both for household consumption and
 market sale. As opposed to statutory marriage, seen as a
 contract between individuals, customary marriage is an agreement
 between families. With payment of dowry under the customary
 marriage system, a woman is considered the property of her
 husband and his family. Upon the husband's death, the marital
 contract continues with the family, who have certain obligations
 and responsibilities to the widow, or, more commonly, widows, if
 they remain with the family as wives to other relatives. In the
 traditional sector, women are not usually entitled to inherit
 
 
 207
 from their husbands or to administer their estates. In
 addition, women are informally excluded in many indigenous
 ethnic groups fram chieftancies or membership in the Councils of
 Elders that direct the affairs of the community. In practice,
 especially in urbanizing areas, many women use both the customary
 and statutory legal systems.
 The Liberian economy depends heavily on export of iron ore,
 rubber, and timber, whose production is dominated by' foreign
 corporations. Expatriate communities, primarily Lebanese and
 Indian, also control an estimated 80 percent of retail and
 wholesale trade. However, foreigners are not permitted to own
 real property. Gross National Product (GNP) per capita was
 estimated in 1981 at $536.50, but 50 percent of national income
 is held by only five percent of the population. The current
 figure is probably significantly lower due to negative GNP growth
 each year since 1980. Twenty-three percent of the population is
 below the absolute urban poverty level.
 Health care is poor, especially outside urban areas. Only 20
 percent of the population has access to safe water (64 percent
 In urban areas and six percent in rural). Average calorie
 supply, however, is 101.39 percent of requirements (1977).
 Despite a relatively high infant mortality rate, 132.10 per
 1,000 (1983), and a life expectancy at birth of only 53.56 years
 (1980), the population is growing by 3.3 percent per year (1983).
 Education for this growing population is a major problem.
 Primary school enrollment in 1979 was 67 percent with significant
 disparity between males (83 percent) and females (51 percent).
 But many students drop out, two-thirds of public school teachers
 are not professionally qualified, and literacy is rated at only
 25.40 percent (1980).
 Problems in health care, education, and economic management are
 exacerbated by the prevalence of corruption throughout the
 Government. In a strong attack on corrupt officials in October,
 Head of State Doe criticized kickbacks and commissions allegedly
 demanded by many officials for approving or implementing
 development projects. Doe said this practice has damaged the
 Liberian economy and warned that the Government would take
 decisive action against those found guilty. In practice,
 however, there has been no amelioration in 1983 in the level of
 corrupt ion.
