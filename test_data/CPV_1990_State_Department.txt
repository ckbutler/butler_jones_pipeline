 CAPE VERDE
 The African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV)
 has ruled the country since its independence from Portugal in
 1975. In 1990 the Government announced major political
 reforms for the future, and in October the National Assembly
 legalized political opposition parties. However, the Assembly
 also passed enhanced powers for President Aristides Pereira,
 who earlier had resigned as Secretary General of the PAICV.
 The campaign began on December 5 for legislative elections to
 be held in January 1991. Also, at year's end preparations
 continued for presidential elections in February 1991.
 Cape Verde faces no obvious external threats to national
 security, and the Government in 1990 moved, through a major
 reorganization, to distance the military and security forces
 from the political party apparatus. The defense portfolio was
 given to the Prime Minister, and a Secretary of State for the
 Armed Forces was created. The armed forces were tasked
 primarily with the protection of Cape Verde's exclusive
 economic zone, drug interdiction, and counterterrorism.
 Internal security and police forces were transferred to the
 Ministry of Rural Development, Fisheries and Internal
 Administration, which gave local police forces considerable
 autonomy from the central Government.
 Cape Verde has few exploitable natural resources, aside from
 an attractive climate, a hardworking population, and a
 strategically placed geographic position. Cape Verdeans have
 a long history of economically driven emigration, primarily to
 Western Europe and the United States. Development efforts for
 the resident population of 350,000 were thwarted by a 20-year
 drought, but summer rains over the past 4 years have brought
 some improvements in the agricultural sector. The Government
 controls banking, imports of most basic commodities, airlines,
 the press, and schools. However, new codes of industry and
 foreign investment enacted in 1989 ushered in a more liberal
 economic policy. In 1990 government decrees created the legal
 basis for a free trade zone and established a foreign
 investment center for marketing promotion, research and policy
 analysis, investor advisory services, and training to support
 private sector initiatives. Private property rights are
 respected.
 In 1990 the human rights climate in Cape Verde improved with
 efforts by reform minded elements in the PAICV to move toward
 a more representative political system in 1991. While the
 Government and PAICV leaders clearly intended to guide the
 change, opposition forces contributed importantly to bringing
 about significant reform of the political system and to
 effectively expanding the boundaries of freedom of speech,
 press, assembly, and association. An agreement between the
 PAICV and the MPD, subsequently enacted into law by the
 National Assembly, created an independent body to monitor
 government-owned print media and granted equal and free access
 to the electronic media during election campaigns. There were
 no reports of politically motivated deaths or police brutality
 during the past year. No political prisoners are being held.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported instances of political or extrajudicial
 kilIings in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported instances of officially inspired
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police brutality has been a problem in past years. However,
 in 1990 there were no reported instances or evidence of
 torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Cape Verdean law requires that an accused person, unless
 caught in the act of committing a crime, be-brought before a
 judge to be charged within 48 hours of arrest. Additionally,
 a person may not be arrested without court order unless caught
 in the act of committing a felony. In exceptional cases, with
 the concurrence of a court official, the formal charge process
 may be delayed up to 5 days after the arrest. However, for
 crimes against state security, persons may be detained-for up
 to 5 months without trial upon a- judge's ruling. This
 loophole is occasionally abused, and cases of arbitrary arrest
 by members of the "Popular Militia," a voluntary paramilitary-
 party organization, occur periodically. There were no known
 security detentions in 1990. -There is a functioning system of
 bail, and everyone is entitled to representation by an
 attorney in civil or criminal cases. Thdse unable to afford
 legal counsel are represented by lawyers named by the lawyers'
 associatiom.
 There were no known instances of forced exile for political or
 other reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, whose
 members are appointed by the Government, regional courts, and
 local popular courts. The autonomous Institute for Judicial
 Support, to which most private lawyers belong, provides
 counsel for indigent defendants. Trials are conducted by one
 judge, without a jury, and appear to be handled expeditiously.
 Trials are public, and evidence suggests that the courts
 protect individual rights in most criminal cases. Verdicts can
 be appealed. Popular tribunals adjudicate minor disputes on a
 local level in rural areas. The "judges," appointees of the
 Ministry of Justice, are usually prominent local citizens
 without legal training. Decisions can be appealed within the
 regular court system.
 There were no known political prisoners in at the end of 1990.
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the
 inviolability of domicile, correspondence, and other means of
 communication, and these rights are respected in practice.
 The law requires warrants issued by a judge before searches of
 homes may be conducted. The Constitution has a provision that
 every citizen has the right and the duty to participate in the
 political, economic, and cultural life of the country. While
 in theory this provision could be used to force participation
 against one's will, there was no evidence of this.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution proclaims freedom of speech and intellectual
 creativity, including the rights of authorship. However, it
 also stipulates that none of these rights and freedoms may be
 exercised "contrary to national unity." While freedom of the
 press is not a specific constitutional guarantee, a law
 adopted in December 1985 assures citizens the right to express
 their thoughts in the press in a responsible manner. Although
 the term "responsible manner" is not defined in law, no
 journalist or newspaper has been punished for actions
 considered to be irresponsible.
 The National Assembly met in three extraordinary sessions in
 1990 to legitimize the Government's decision to move to a
 multiparty system and to define the modalities of the
 transition. Assembly debates were lively, the voice of
 dissent was heard, and not all PAICV proposals were accepted.
 The sessions were broadcast live on national radio. Summaries
 of the Assembly's activities appeared in the press and on the
 evening television news.
 In October the National Assembly approved three proposals
 submitted by the Government that were based on an agreement
 between the PAICV and the MDP on journalism and the media.
 These laws established (1) an independent Council of Mass
 Communication to guarantee freedom of the press and equal
 access to the media by all political parties; (2) a code of
 ethics for journalists which, among other things, safeguards
 the confidentiality of sources; and (3) equal access to
 national electronic media for all political parties for
 predetermined periods of time during election campaigns.
 The Council of Mass Communication is an independent body
 composed of nine representatives: three from the. Government,
 including one from the the Ministry of Justice, three from the
 National Assembly, two journalists from the Association of
 Journalists, and one representative of all mass communications
 institutions. For the transition period only, the Council
 will consist of four members: a presiding official from the
 Ministry of Justice and three journalists nominated by the
 President of the Republic.
 In the latter months of 1990, the most widely read newspaper,
 the radio, and the television, all government owned, attempted
 to give balanced coverage to government and opposition
 viewpoints. Local radio broadcasts carry items from Western
 press agencies as well as from.Eastern European countries,
 generally balancing coverage and identifying sources on
 controversial international issues.

 CAPE VERDE
 In 1990 the Council of Ministers passed a decree giving all
 political groups access to the media. Radio and television
 provide coverage for both the PAICV and the opposition. As
 Cape Verde moved toward a multiparty system, articles critical
 of government figures and policy became frequent. The major
 opposition party now publishes and circulates its own
 newspaper.
 Despite the changing climate, on at least one occasion in 1990
 the Government summoned one of the reporters of the
 government-controlled VozdiPovo, known to be a member of the
 opposition, to explain his views, which were critical of the
 PAICV, before a civil court. He was not prosecuted. In June
 VozdiPovo failed to publish an interview with the principal
 opposition leader. Amid accusations of government censorship,
 the interview was subsequently published, with the VozdiPovo's
 editor attributing the delay to editorial privilege.
 A monthly newspaper published by a group of Catholic priests
 has existed for over 10 years. While frequently critical of
 the Government and the PAICV, it has been tolerated. Foreig.
 periodicals generally circulate freely in Cape Verde even when
 they contain articles critical of the Government. Generally,
 international radio broadcasts are received without
 interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The 1980 Constitution provided for the freedom to assemble,
 associate, and demonstrate; however, in- practice these
 freedoms were limited to PAICV meetings and groups. In 1990
 the National Assembly adopted a law permitting political
 associations to form and assemble publicly, and subsequently
 it legalized political opposition parties. By the end of
 1990, there were two legitimate political opposition parties,
 the MPD and the Uniao Cabo Verdiana Independente E Democratica
 (UCID). The MPD, which emerged as the viable opponent to the
 PAICV, held rallies and meetings throughout Cape Verde.
 Despite instances of minor squabbles between MPD and PAIC.V
 supporters, by and large the authorities did not interfere.
 Permits are needed for public meetings. They were routinely
 granted throughout the year.
 Sports and religious youth groups, as well as private and
 professional associations, exist. Government authorization is
 required in order to establish an association.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution requires separation of church and state.
 Freedom of worship was respected by the Government; members of
 all faiths practiced their religion without harassment. While
 at least two-thirds of the population, including much of the
 government leadership, is nominally Catholic, that did not
 adversely affect other faiths. Evangelical Protestants and
 Seventh-Day Adventists are two other significant religious
 communities.
 At least two faiths, the Baha'i and Christian Science, banned
 or suppressed under Portuguese colonial rule, have been
 reestablished since independence. There are no restrictions
 on religious practices, teaching, or contacts with
 coreligionists outside Cape Verde. The Catholic Church, for
 example, openly opposes birth control methods which are
 advocated and supported by the Government. Foreign
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 missionaries operate freely in Cape Verde; more than half of
 the Catholic clergy are foreigners. Cape Verdean immigration
 law requires that missionaries applying for residency belong
 to a denomination with a recognized membership in Cape Verde.
 In this context, two American Mormon missionaries were asked
 to leave Cape Verde in 1989 after their visitor's visas
 expired; however, new American Mormon missionaries were
 admitted to Cape Verde in 1990.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative
 restrictions on travel or residence in Cape Verde. All
 resident Cape Verdeans wishing to leave the country, either
 temporarily or permanently, must obtain exit permission from
 the Government. Permission has not been denied for political
 reasons. Emigration has long been an important and recognized
 means of escape from prevailing harsh economic conditions.
 The Government maintains close contact with emigre communities
 and encourages Cape Verdeans living abroad to maintain ties
 with the homeland. In 1990 the National Assembly passed a new
 nationality law permitting dual nationality for the purpose of
 encouraging Cape Verdeans, who adopted other nationalities at
 the time of independence and afterwards, to reapply for Cape
 Verdean citizenship. Repatriation is a constitutional right;
 the Government does not discourage those intending to
 repatriate. The law allows for revocation of citizenship on
 several grounds, including activities contrary to the interest
 of the country. However, there were no known cases of the
 Government instituting proceedings to deprive persons of
 citizenship for political reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1990 citizens still did not have the right to change their
 government by peaceful means. However, the Government's 1990
 decision to move from a single party to a multiparty system
 opened up the possibility of a more representative system in
 the future. President Pereira gave up his position as
 Secretary General of the PAICV. The PAICV and the MPD reached
 an important agreement in 1990 on issues involving elections
 scheduled to take place in 1991.
 Provisions of an agreement between the PAICV and the MPD on
 the upcoming elections and implementation of changes leading
 to a multiparty political system were subsequently adopted by
 the National Assembly. In accordance with the PAICV/MPD
 agreement, the Constitution was amended to abolish the PAICV's
 monopoly on power. The National Assembly unanimously passed
 an electoral law which granted universal adult suffrage,
 prohibited members of the Armed Forces from running for the
 legislature, and established modalities for legislative and
 presidential elections, which are scheduled to be held in
 1991. This law also established criminal penalties for
 election fraud. Some fundamental issues, such as the powers
 of the presidency, were supposed to have been determined by
 the new, and presumably more representative, National Assembly
 to be elected-next year. However, the PAICV-dominated
 Assembly granted greatly enhanced powers to President
 Pereira. Specifically, the President was authorized to
 appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister subject only to
 Parliamentary confirmation, to dissolve the National Assembly,
 within certain restrictions, and to veto legislation. An
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 absolute majority was required for the legislature to override
 a veto.
 Traditionally, PAICV leadership has been restricted to a group
 credited with winning Cape Verde's independence from
 Portugal. In 1990 the PAICV made an obvious effort to give
 more prominent roles to women and other persons less directly
 involved in the independence movement; women became principal
 government representatives on the islands of Sal and Boa
 Vista. Nonetheless, women remain underrepresented in senior
 party and government posts. PAICV membership is young, (47
 percent under 30 years of age), disproportionately urban, (50
 percent in a nation which is two-thirds rural), and heavily
 representative of the bureaucracy (25 percent of the members
 are civil servants or employees of state enterprises).
 The MPD principally represents the private sector and is led
 by lawyers, medical doctors, and businessmen. The MPD
 advocates encouraging private investment and changing the
 Constitution to give the National Assembly greater power. It
 began as a fledgling association in February when the PAICV
 announced the move to a multiparty system and became a
 legitimate party in October when the National Assembly passed
 enabling legislation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged- Vialations
 of Human Rights
 The Government fully cooperates-with representatives of
 private human rights organizations who visit Cape Verde
 periodically to investigate alleged violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in- Cape Verde where the
 vast majority of the population shares Portuguese and African
 ancestry. Sex discrimination is banned by the Constitution,
 but traditional male-oriented Portuguese and African values
 predominate.
 The family code, enacted in October 1981, prescribes the full
 equality of men and women in law, including equal pay for
 equal work. However, women are in fact excluded from certain
 types of employment and are often paid less than men. The
 Government and the PAICV are making efforts to involve more
 women in political, economic, and social activities. A
 conscious effort is made to employ women in labor-intensive
 economic development projects financed by foreign grants. The
 Organization of Cape Verdean Women was founded in 1980, with
 party encouragement, to sensitize the Government and the
 citizenry to issues affecting women.
 Domestic violence against women, including wife beating,
 remains common, particularly in the rural areas. Crimes such
 as rape and spouse abuse are rarely brought to the attention
 of the police or tried in the courts. The Government conducts
 radio and.television programs to inform women of their legal
 rights, but these programs rarely reach the rural areas where
 women are most in need of such information. Neither the
 Government nor the PAICV women's-organization have
 specifically addressed the issue of violence against women.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 In September the National Assembly passed legislation granting
 workers the right to strike. All workers are free to join
 unions. Later that month, the employees of the state-owned
 shipyards exercised that right by striking for 1 day before an
 agreement was negotiated. While it is not mandatory, all
 unions are affiliated with the National Union Confederation
 (NUC), which is headed by a high-ranking PAICV member. About
 one-third of the active work force are nominal union members.
 The NUC participates in the International Labor Organization
 and is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity, but has not taken positions independent of those
 officially sanctioned by the Government. It maintains contact
 with and receives assistance from both Communist and
 non-Communist foreign trade union movements.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The legislation passed in September provides the right to
 function without hindrance. Workers and management reached
 agreement through collective bargaining in the shipyard labor
 dispute referred to above. As the largest employer, the
 Government sets wages and other benefits, but the NUC and the
 constituent unions influence this process.
 There were no export processing zones in 1990; however, Cape
 Verde began a feasibility study on establishing a major free
 trade zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is not practiced and is forbidden by law.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14, and children under 16
 are prohibited from working at night, for more than 7 hours
 per day, or in establishments where toxic products are used.
 There is, however, no organizational mechanism for enforcing
 these requirements.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are established by the Government for both the
 public and private sectors. As of January 1, 1987, the minimum
 wage for civil servants was approximately $84 per month. Wages
 for unskilled workers are considerably lower; in rural areas
 the daily minimum is approximately $1.62 for manual labor.
 All enterprises submit a yearly report to the Director General
 of Labor with information on salary and wages of each employee.
 This provides the Government with a vehicle for controlling
 employment practices. There does not appear to be an overall
 safety and health code, although some regulations exist in
 this area. The normal workweek for adults is 44 hours over 5
 1/2 days. A worker is entitled to at least 1 free day per
 week. While large employers generally respect these
 regulations and minimum wage standards, many employed in
 domestic service or by 9mall employers in rural areas do not
 enjoy legally mandated work conditions.
