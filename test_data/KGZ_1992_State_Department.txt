 KYRGYZSTAN
 A former republic of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan declared its independence on
 August 31, 1991. The Government is headed by President Askar Akayev, who as-
 sumed office in November 1990 before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A re-
 former and an ally of forme Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, he was originally
 chosen by the Supreme Soviet of Kyrgyzatan, which amended the Kyrgyz Constitu-
 tion and established Presidential rule. In October 1991, he was popularly reelected
 in a referendum-style election; he ran unopposed. Elections to the Supreme Soviet,
 Kyrgyzstan's legislative body, were last held in 1990, a time when the Communist
 Party retained a monopoly on power. Although the Communist Party itself was later
 banned, the Supreme Soviet is still dominated by former Communists. The party
 elite, or nomenklatura, also retains positions of influence in local politics and the
 central security apparatus. It is in these two areas that resistance to reform is
 strongest. A new constitution, which would redefine most if not all governmental in-
 stitutions, is under discussion in the Supreme Soviet. Other reforms, including those
 
 
 820
 of the legal and judicial systems, have been put off pending ratification of the new
 constitution.
 Kyrgyzstan's military forces are in a transitional stage. The forces of the Com-
 monwealth of Independent States stationed in Kyrgyzstan, including border guards
 and internal security forces, have been nationalized. Government leaders have dis-
 cussed the possibility, of doing away with military forces altogether and relying on
 a small national guard and a policy of neutrality to preserve the country's security.
 The Government took its first steps in moving from a centrally planned economy
 to one based on market principles. Before independence, Kyrgyzstan had few eco-
 nomic ties outside the Soviet Union. All state enterprises depended on materials
 from other parts of the Soviet Union and received orders from ministries in Moscow.
 Despite the breakup of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan's economy remained tied to the
 economies of Russia and other nations of the former Soviet Union. It deteriorated
 in 1992 as a result of increased unemployment and inflation. The Government in
 January adopted laws on the disposal of state-owned property, privatization and en-
 trepreneurship, and privatization of housing as part of the transition to a free mar-
 ket economy.
 President Akayev and his ministers have expressed strong commitments to
 human rights, democracy the rule of law, and a free market economy. Human
 rights appeared to be wel respected in 1992. Respect for democracy and human
 rights, however, came after over 70 years of Soviet rule and has not been codified
 and institutionalized. It is still uncertain to what degree this respect is shared at
 lower levels of government. Minority relations constitute the other significant
 human rights issue. Kyrgyzstan is home to over 80 ethnic groups, with the Kyrgyz
 comprising slightly more than 50 percent of the population. The Government is
 firmy in the hands of the ethnic Kdgyz, and members of minority groups have ac-
 cusedit, with some justification, of discriminating against members of other ethnic
 groups. Nationalist sentiment among the Kyrgyz, long suppressed, also ran high
 during the year. Interethnic tensions, which erupted into bloody rioting in the Osh
 district in 1990, linger below the surface. President Akayev and his Government
 have sought to reassure ethnic minorities while simultaneously trying to satisfy
 Kyrgyz aspirations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killings by government authorities or others.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no incidents of disappearance or abduction attnb-
 utable to government authorities or others.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 No reports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment were received.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-For the most part, Kyrgyzstan's judicial
 system retains the laws and procedures of the Soviet period. The procurator's office
 decides who ma) be detained, arrested, and prosecuted. Investigations are carried
 out by the Ministry of the Interior, the Committee on National Security, and the
 rocurator. Since 1990, everyone arrested or charged with a crime has the imme-
 diate right to defense counsel. The old procedure, however, in which the accused has
 access to a defense counsel only after a case comes to trial, is often followed.
 The Criminal Code permits the procurator to detain a suspect for up to 72 hours
 before releasing him or informing him of the crime he is suspected of having com-
 mitted. The accused remains in detention while the procurator investigates the case
 and prepares to present it to the court. At the procurator's discretion, the accused
 mayhe kept in pretrial detention for up to 1 year. After a year, the procurator must
 release the accused or ask the Supreme Soviet to extend the period of detention.
 There were no known instances of the Supreme Soviet voting for such an extension.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system is largely a product of the Soviet
 period. Once the procurator is ready, the case of the accused is brought to court and
 tried before a judge and two people's assessors (citizens chosen from labor collec-
 tives). The accused and defense counsel are supposed to have access to all evidence
 gathered by the procurator. They attend all proceedings, which are generally public,
 and are allowed to question witnesses and present evidence. The court may render
 one of three decisions: innocent, guilty, or indeterminate (i.e., the case is returned
 to the procurator for further investigation). Verdicts may be appealed by both the
 defendant and the procurator. However, the decision of a court to return a case to
 the procurator for further investigation may not be appealed, and the accused is re-
 turned to the procurator's custody where he or she may remain under detention.
 
 
 821
 During the Soviet period, the judicial system served the needs of the State and
 the Communist Party. The Government has recognized the need to reform this sys-
 tem but few reforms were adopted in 1992. The procurator's office indicated it had
 implemented certain Western practices, including the presumption of innocence of
 the accused, but delays in adopting a new constitution, a deteriorating economy, and
 a system exclusively staffed by officials trained during the Soviet period impeded
 reforms.
 Charges were often made by non-Kyrgyz citizens that the system was arbitrary
 and unfair and that courts treated ethnic Kyrgyz more leniently than members of
 other groups. These charges were based on the appointment of ethnic Kyrgyz to key
 positions in the judicial system. Although there was no evidence of systematic dis-
 crimination, it may have occurred in individual cases. Journalists and human rights
 monitors also accused the Government of politically motivated prosecutions. The
 case of Omurbek Suvanaliyev, a reformist police major sent to clean up an outlying
 region, Issyk-kul, was cited as an example. Suvanaliyev was arrested by local ofi-
 cials and taken to the capital, Bishkek, where he was charged with abusing his sub-
 ordinates. It is widely believed that the arrest was retaliation against Suvanaliyev
 because he arrested the son of a prominent local government oficial. Suvanaliyev
 remained in detention at year's end after a court was unable to render a verdict
 and returned the case to the procurator for further investigation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1978 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes of the
 occupant and states that a person's private life, privacy of correspondence, and tele-
 phonic and telegraphic communications are protected by law.
 Current law and procedures require the General Procurator's approval for wire-
 taps searches of homes interception of mail, and similar  rocedures. Since inde-
 pendence, personnel and organizations that were responsible for violations during
 the Soviet period have remained largely in place; however, no widespread and sys-
 tematic violations of the privacy of citizens were reported in 1992. Some citizens ac-
 tive in politics or interested in human rights issues reported visits from government
 security agents who asked them questions about their activities. The questioning,
 while not hostile or threatening, caused those questioned to suspect that their ac-
 tivities were being monitored and that possibly the privacy of their communications
 and homes had been violated. Evidence to this effect was not available.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Supreme Soviet on July 2, 1992, passed a
 law on the press and mass media which supports freedom of the press but also pro-
 vides guidelines proscribing publication of certain information. The law supports the
 right of journalists to work obtain information, and publish without prior restraint.
 It also guarantees a journalist's right to protect his or her sources. The law prohibits
 publication of state secrets, material which advocates the overthrow of, or changes
 to, the existing constitutional order in Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere. It also prohibits
 publication of material that advocates war, violence, or intolerance toward ethnic or
 religious groups. Desecration of national norms, ethics and symbols like the na-
 tional seal, anthem, or flag is prohibited. Publication of pornography is prohibited,
 as is propagation of untrue information.
 The law states that the press should not violate the privacy or dignity of individ-
 uals, although a law that would have prohibited insulting the dignity of the presi-
 dent was opposed by President Akayev and was not passed by the Supreme Soviet.
 The law requires all media to register with the Ministry of Justice andto await the
 Ministry's approval before beginning to operate. Since the law was passed, there
 were no reports of the Ministry refusing to register a publication or the law being
 used in any prosecutions.
 During 1992 the press was free to publish material without prior government ap-
 proval or restraint. Similarly, no prior restriction or censorship existed for the elec-
 tronic media or cinemas. The Government owned all radio and television facilities.
 While a few fully independerit newspapers and magazines existed, the Government
 continued to exert varying degrees of influence over most other publications. Inde-
 pendent publishers said they were disadvantaged because they paid higher prices
 or materials and did not have some of the resources available to the government-
 owned media, such as office space. There were no reports of government pressure
 or threats against journalists, but government involvement in and ownership of the
 media did raise concerns among journalists about self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens of Kyrgyzstan have
 the right to assemble and associate freely and generally did so without government
 interference. Permits were required for public marches and gatherings but report-
 edly were not denied arbitrarily.
 
 
 The 1991 Supreme Soviet law on public organizations includes labor unions, polit-
 ical parties, and cultural associations. All public organizations must register with
 the Ministry of Justice. Although most organizations registered without difficulty,
 the Ministry did ask some organizations to revise their charters and refused to reg-
 ister others. Among those denied registration was the Social Democratic Party
 (SDP), whose membership is made ur largely of Russian speakers. The Ministry al-
 leged that the Social Democrats di not meet all provisions of the law including
 a requirement that all political parties have at least 500 members. The SDP accused
 the Ministry of a violation of human rights and discrimination, but admitted that
 it did not have enough members to register as a political party. However, the Min-
 istry of Justice refused to register it as a political organization. A bureaucratic men-
 tality, which is a holdover of the Soviet period, is at least partly responsible for the
 Ministry's refusal to register some organizations. However, charges that interpreta-
 tion of the law on public organizations was not even-handed had some credence.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government has encouraged the practice and revival
 of all faiths in Kyrgyzstan. Missionaries and evangelists are not restricted, and all
 have access to facilities and are free to proselytize. For the first time, a Roman
 Catholic church was opened in Bishkek. Members of the Jewish community have
 complete freedom to teach Hebrew and practice their faith. Construction of mosques
 accelerated in Bishkek and elsewhere in the country.
 President Akayev and his ministers profess commitment to a secular government
 with no official ties to any religion. However, the preamble of the draft constitution
 supported by the President refers to Kyrgyzstan's commitment to the "moral prin-
 ciples, national traditions, and spiritual values of Islam." Government spokesmen
 explained that this phrase was intended only to awaken moral and spiritual values
 that had been long suppressed under Soviet rule. Nevertheless, this language raised
 concerns among members of other faiths and those committed to a complete separa-
 tion of religion from the State. At year's end, the Supreme Soviet voted to include
 a slightly modified reference to "Islam and other religions" in the preamble.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Government policy in 1992 supported free travel within and outside
 K~ygyzstan. However, certain policies imposed during the Soviet period remained in
 effect and continued to restrict internal migration and resettlement and impede citi-
 zens' ability to travel abroad. Citizens of Kyrgyzstan needed official government per-
 mission ("propiska") to work and settle in a particular area of the country. Home
 and apartment owners were legally restricted to selling their property to buyers
 with such permission. This policy, imposed during the Soviet period, was used to
 control and restrict internal migration. Its continued use in Kyystan restricted
 freedom of movement. In addition, members of minority nationalities accused the
 Government of partiality toward ethnic Kyrgyz while restricting the movement of
 those belonging to other ethnic groups. For example, ethnic Kyrgyz squatters who
 continued to live in Bishkek without official permission received government help
 to construct housing.
 Kyrgyzstan did not have a law on emigration, and no law had been adopted by
 year's end. The administrative procedures that were used permitted free movement
 of people without any evidence of discrimination. Citizens who apply for inter-
 national passports need to present a letter of invitation from the country they in-
 tend to visit or to which they intend to emigrate. This policy was instituted during
 the Soviet period and impedes free and unrestricted foreign travel. There were no
 reports, however, that citizens, after presenting such a letter, were denied a pass-
 port or an exit visa. Earlier in the year, citizens who were trying to emigrate com-
 plained that government officials, particularly customs agents, harassed them and
 impeded travel out of Kyrgyzstan, barring them from taking property such as auto-
 mobiles and currency out of the country. Thereafter the Government saw to it that
 the harassment stopped. Emigrants reportedly were not prevented from returning
 to Kyrgyzstan.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Kyrgyzstan continued to use the Constitution adopted in 1978 and amended in
 1990 to provide for a presidential system of government. President Askar Akayev
 was elected President by the Supreme Soviet in 1990 and reelected by popular ballot
 in 1991. Although he ran unopposed in 1991, his reelection appeared to reflect broad
 support. As President, he may issue decrees that are binding unless abrogated by
 a vote of no fewer than two-thirds of the Supreme Soviet. New presidential elections
 are scheduled for 1996.
 Most of the 350 members of the Supreme Soviet were elected in 1990 when the
 first multiple-candidate elections were held. However, the Communist Party, with
 
 
 its monopoly on power still intact, manipulated the elections to ensure the victory
 of candidates it favored. New elections for the Supreme Soviet are scheduled for
 1995. The ability of citizens to effect a peaceful, democratic change of government
 remains untested.
 President Akayev's suspension of the Communist Party in 1991 removed an appa-
 ratus which had monopolized all political power. During by-elections for the Su-
 preme Soviet several candidates for each seat appealed directly to the electorate,
 and debate, discussion, and dissent were increasingly heard in the Supreme Soviet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not restrict the activities of local human rights monitors or
 the delegations and representatives of international and nongovernmental human
 rights groups that visited Kyrpyzstan. However, in one case, the Ministry of Justice
 refused to register a human rights organization because, it said, one human rights
 organization was already registered and another was not needed.
 In December over 250 participants from at least 8 nations, including the United
 States, took part in an international human rights conference in Bishkek. The Gov-
 ernment of Kyrgyzstan welcomed the participants, and prominent government offi-
 cials addressed the conference. However, on the last day of the conference security
 officials from Uzbekistan abducted three Uzbek human rights monitors. Tie procu-
 rator in Tashkent had issued a warrant for the arrest of one of them, Abdumanov
 Pulatov, and this was given as the reason for the abduction. As of year's end,
 Pulatov remains under detention in Uzbekistan, charged with insulting the Presi-
 dent of Uzbekistan. The Uzbekistan security authorities released the other two.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kyrgyzstan said it permitted Pulatov's arrest
 because it was obliged to do so under the provision of an agreement signed by the
 Governments of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan that permitted extraterritorial arrest of
 criminals. After widespread criticism in the press and from human rights monitors
 the Ministry later softened its position and said it might have acted differently had
 it known there was a human rights dimension to Pulatov's arrest.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Government expressed strong commitment to protecting the rights of mem-
 bers of all ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups as well as those of women. Re-
 ported complaints of discrimination centered on the treatment of citizens who were
 not ethnic Kyrgyz. This group, which makes up over 40 percent of the population
 of Kyrgyzstan, is often called the Russian-speaking minority, although Russian-
 speaking Uzbeks comprise 12.9 percent of the total population. Members of this
 rup alleged discrimination in hiring, promotion, and housing. More generally,
 Russian speakers complained that government officials at all levels favored ethnic
 Kyrgyz when formulating policy or making decisions.
 Arthough complaints o1f discrimination were often p resented, documented and spe-
 cific cases were seldom cited. Most often the complaints were based on perceived
 discrimination. For example, Russian speakers pointed to ethnic Kyrgyz squatters
 in Bishkek who occupied land and who were later given government aid to build
 houses. Russian speakers cited this as an example of a policy that favored ethnic
 Kyrgyz at the expense of other groups, in that the authorities provided direct finan-
 cial assistance and authorities allowed the squatters to bypass the prpiska" sys-
 tem. Russian speakers also alleged that a Uglass ceiling" existed in government em-
 ployment which precluded their promotion beyond a certain level. The representa-
 tion of ethnic Kyrgyz at high and intermediate levels of government is proportion-
 ally much greater than the percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz in the general population.
 Russian speakers have been replacedin many positions in government, industry,
 and education by ethnic Kyrgyz. This gives credence to perceptions that career op.
 portunities are limited for those who are not ethnic Kyrgyz.
 A law adopted in 1989 designated Kyrgyz the language of government and Rus-
 sian the language of interethnic communication. Many Russian speakers, particu-
 larly ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, feel disadvantaged because they cannot speak
 Kyrgyz. They have called on the Government to adopt a policy of bilinguaism. The
 Government did not establish in 1992 a viable and universally available program
 of Kyrgyz instruction for adult non-Kyrgyz speakers, although some instruction was
 available. In general, adults who did not aeak the language were not interested
 in learning Kyrgyz and did not demand language instruction.
 President Akayev expressed his commitment to the rights of women, and a num-
 ber of high-level government positions are occupied by women, including the Gen-
 eral Procurator Minister of Education and Ambassador to the United States. The
 law gives equal status to women in Kyrgyzstan, and women are well represented
 
 
 824
 in the work force, professions, and institutions of higher learning. In rural areas,
 women are still seen only in the role of homemaker, mother, and wife. The press
 often reported abuse and violence against women which was frequently associated
 with abuse of alcohol. Normal law enforcement procedures were used in cases of do-
 mestic violence. More general programs to address these issues had not been estab-
 lished.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-In February the Government adopted a comprehen-
 sive law that includes provisions protecting the rights of all workers to form and
 belong to trade unions. The new law requires a minimum of five workers to form
 a union. There was no evidence that government policy tried to obstruct the forma-
 tion of independent unions. President Akayev stated his own belief that such unions
 were needed in Kyrgstan to ensure freedom and democracy.
 The Federation o Independent Trade Unions of Kyrgyzstan (FITUK), successor
 to the former official unions, remains the sole trade union umbrella organization in
 the country under the same leaders, continuing to manage the State's social fund
 and retaining possession of its previously held properties, as well as of the Soviet
 trade union-financed resorts and sanatoriums on its territory. It professes to be
 transforming itself from a passive recipient of orders from Moscow into a genuine
 defender of working people. The Federation regards itself as in a process of transi-
 tion in which it has yet to work out its relations with the Government, with unions
 in other former Republics of the Soviet Union, and with unions abroad. The Federa-
 tion remains affiliated to the Moscow-based General Confederation of Trade Unions,
 which succeeded the Soviet-era All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
 Nineteen of Kyrgyzstan's 20 union organizations are affiliated to the Federation
 with a claimed membership of 1.6 million. The exception is the 8,000-strong union
 of entrepreneurs and cooperative members, which is more like an association of self-
 employed.
 While the right to strike is not codified, strikes are not prohibited. There were
 a number of such actions during 1992 including FITUK strikes by taxi drivers,
 teachers, and air traffic controllers. In nearly every case, the workers' demands
 were met. There were no retaliatory actions against strikers, nor were there in-
 stances of human rights abuses directed at unions or individual workers.
 Unions are legally permitted to form and join federations and to affiliate with
 international trade union bodies. In April Kynaystan became a member of the
 International Labor Organization. The new labor aw called for practices consistent
 with international standards. Since independent unions were still in their infancy,
 no meaningful affiliation with international trade union bodies took place. There
 were no known prohibitions against such affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A law passed in April recog-
 nizes the right of unions to negotiate for better wages and conditions. Although
 overall union structure and practice remain consistent with the Soviet experience,
 there is growing evidence of active union participation in state-owned and nearly
 privatized enterprises. However, in most sectors of the economy, wage levels con-
 tinue to be set by government decree, although many factories have begun systems
 of bonuses and other incentives in keeping with the Government's commitment to
 develop a market economy.
 Union members are protected by law from antiunion discrimination, and there
 were no recorded instances of discrimination against anyone because of union activi-
 ties in 1992. However, because the old management/labor leadership continued to
 dominate the labor movement, anyone who wished to form an independent union
 faced formidable obstacles. This, along with a deteriorating economy, may have dis-
 couraged independent union activity, rather than direct discrimination or intimida-
 tion.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is for-
 bidden and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 18. Students are allowed to work up to 6 hours per day in summer or in part-
 time jobs from the age of 16. Restrictions on the use of child labor were largely ob-
 served.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a national, legally mandated mini-
 mum wage that is set at a level to provide what is regarded as required for minimal
 subsistence. In practice, even the higher median wage is also considered insufficient
 to assure a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The FITUK was re-
 a ponsible for enforcing all labor laws, including the law on minimum wages. As the
 Government provided the overwhelming proportion of employment, minimum wage
 
 
 regulations were largely observed. However, enforcement of labor laws was non-
 existent in the growing underground economy. Nevertheless, market forces helped
 wages in the unofficial sector to keep pace with official wage scales.
 The standard workweek was 41 hours, usually within a 5-day week. Safety and
 health conditions in factories were far behind Western standards. The deteriorating
 economy hindered enforcement of existing regulations and prevented investment to
 improve health and safety standards. The April law also established occupational
 health and safety standards as well as enforcement procedures. Besides government
 inspection teams, trade unions are assigned active roles in assuring compliance with
 these measures.
