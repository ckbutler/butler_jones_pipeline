 IRAN
 Over the last thirty years Iran has engaged in a program
 of rapid economic modernization which has transformed
 the lives of most citizens and sharply affected the na-
 tion's social structure and traditional institutions.
 The development of representative political institutions,
 however, did not keep pace with these significant
 changes. As a consequence, and because of skewed econ-
 omic priorities, 1978 was marked by serious and often
 violent demonstrations of popular discontent. During
 the last quarter of the year the social fabric and the
 authority of the Iranian Government seriously deteriorated.
 Since the end of World War II, the Iranian Government
 has felt endangered by external threats and subversion.
 Until roughly 1977 the Government relied on a rigid
 pattern of controls. These controls were often indis-
 criminately applied, and violations of human rights by
 security forces were fairly common-place.
 This pattern began to change gradually in recent years
 and particularly since 1977 as the government undertook
 some steps toward liberalization. Officially sanctioned
 torture in prisons apparently ended in early 1977 and
 later substantial numbers of political prisoners were
 released. During 1978 the Shah announced a series of
 steps to offer increased judicial protection to the in-
 dividual, to lift censorship and to permit more poli-
 tical expression. On August 5, 1978, the Shah announced
 that free parliamentary elections would be held in 1979.
 As unrest continued, government security forces some-
 times used extreme violence in attempting to control
 unarmed demonstrators, arbitrary arrests occurred, and
 restrictions on many civil and political liberties con-
 tinued. These tactics contributed to an atmosphere of
 confrontation and conflict.
 The imposition of martial law in September and its
 accompanying severe controls were both preceded and
 
 (549)
 
 
 550
 followed by periods of greatly relaxed restrictions on
 public debate. With the appointment of a military-led
 Cabinet in early November, martial law controls on all
 political activity again were enforced, but widespread
 protests against the regime continued.
 These demonstrations were met by armed force as the
 security organs of the Government sought to ban public
 protests. Possibly several thousand persons were
 killed, several times that number injured, and sub-
 stantial damage was done to property by both pro- and
 anti-Shah forces. Numerous arrests were made, and
 there was a recurrence of reports of mistreatment of
 detainees.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Iranian penal code prohibits torture and provides
 severe penalties for violators. This prohibition, how-
 ever, was frequently ignored by security forces in the
 past. Almost two years ago, the Shah announced that
 torture would no longer be used in the interrogation of
 prisoners. To the best of the Department of State's
 knowledge, its systematic use in prisons ended. Never-
 theless credible charges continue that torture is still
 being used during initial interrogations in police sta-
 tions, particularly outside Tehran. Amnesty Interna-
 tional reported that a mission it sent to Iran in November
 heard reports of numerous examples of torture used during
 interrogations and as punishment for political activities.
 These instances of torture did not appear to have govern-
 ment sanction at a high level, and their occurrence may
 have reflected an erosion of discipline. Partially in
 response to these reports of torture, the Government dis-
 missed over thirty senior officials of SAVAK, the secret
 police.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been numerous instances of harsh, often brutal
 treatment by security forces of demonstrators protesting
 against the Government. On occasion opposition demon-
 
 
 551
 strators made violent attacks on SAVAK and police offi-
 cials. These kinds of incidents, which became more
 frequent at the end of the year, occurred mainly in
 street clashes between government forces and opposi-
 tion supporters. No precise estimate of those killed
 in such clashes is yet available; rough estimates for
 1978 range between one thousand to over seven thousand
 killed with a substantially higher number of persons
 injured.
 The information available to the Department of State re-
 garding the conditions under which political prisoners
 are held is scanty. There were reports (some of them
 based on interviews with several former prisoners) that
 conditions improved during the year. Nevertheless, in
 the spring there was an extended strike by persons held
 in a prison near Tehran, suggesting that conditions are
 still unsatisfactory. Moreover, Amnesty International,
 in the report based on its November mission, noted "in-
 discriminate policy brutality following arrest or deten-
 tion." This appears to have been often the case.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The series of amnesties which began in 1977 continued
 through 1978. At the beginning of 1978, an estimated
 2,200 state security prisoners remained in jail, some
 said by the Government to have been involved in crimes
 of violence. As tensions grew and riots became more
 frequent, additional large-scale arrests were made; at
 the same time, there were frequent announcements of the
 release of prisoners. Following the imposition of mar-
 tial law in September, warrants for the arrest of 1,000
 persons were issued; many of these were withdrawn with-
 in a week--by the end of September one hundred of these
 remained under detention. In December, the Government
 announced that all political prisoners had been released,
 with the exception of slightly over 200 persons con-
 victed of crimes of violence.  (Private human rights
 groups believe the number to be significantly higher.)
 The Government also announced that it was reviewing the
 files of former political prisoners with a view to
 granting amnesties and pardons.
 Despite the stated intention of the Government to reim-
 force judicial protection of accused persons, SAVAK
 
 
 552
 
 still appears to combine the functions of both police
 and examining magistrate. Detainees have been denied
 counsel for extended periods and sometimes denied or
 permitted only minimal contact with family and friends.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civil and criminal cases, with the exception of those
 involving state security, are tried in a civilian court
 system in which civil rights are fully guaranteed.
 Persons charged with political and security offenses
 were until 1978 tried in military courts. The accused
 had no freedom to choose counsel and the proceedings
 took place in camera. Early in 1978, the Government
 announced reforms which included trials in civilian
 courts for political offenders and gave greater free-
 dom in the choice of counsel. While these reforms were
 not fully implemented, the number of the political de-
 fendants tried and subsequently acquitted increased.
 The effectiveness of the reforms is open to question,
 however. In Mahabad during the summer of 1978, 38 per-
 sons were arrested for political offenses, tried in a
 civilian court and acquitted. They were subsequently
 seized by SAVAK and ordered to stand trial in a mili-
 tary court. Fifteen of those arrested apparently re-
 mained in detention at the end of the year. In addi-
 tion, the International League for Human Rights reported
 that its mission to Iran in November had revealed that
 political offenders continued to be tried by military
 courts, the reforms notwithstanding. Moreover, during
 the strike of oil facilities which occurred during the
 fall, the Government announced that striking workers
 who refused to return to work would be charged with
 sabotage and tried before a "special tribunal"; this
 was, in fact, not done.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Iran's constitutional law of 1907 prohibits forced entry
 of a house and dwelling except in accordance with legal
 safeguards. In normal practice, police must apply to a
 local magistrate for a warrant if they wish to search a
 home.
 
 
 Security elements in some instances entered homes with-
 out a warrant. In May, for example, Iranian soldiers
 forced their way into a religious leader's home and
 killed two persons seeking refuge there. The Govern-
 ment immediately apoligized for this action and asserted
 that it was carried out by inexperienced troops who
 were disciplined for their misconduct.
 Earlier in 1978, bombs were placed outside the homes of
 dissident leaders and several were beaten or threatened
 with violence. While the malefactors were never identi-
 fied, they were suspected to be linked to the security
 police. The Government charged, in turn, that a sizeable
 number of homes and businesses were bombed during the
 year by oppositionists.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 For more than two decades the Iranian Government has em-
 phasized programs designed to fulfill the economic and
 social needs of the Iranian people. Large scale economic
 and social development plans have been pursued since the
 early 1960s, but the major impetus to development has
 come since 1973 when the dramatic increase in oil prices
 enabled the Government to invest more heavily in deve-
 lopmental activities. The Government has allocated
 two-thirds of budgetary outlays to economic development
 and social welfare programs. Per capita income had
 reached about $2,400 by the beginning of 1978. The
 major land reform program begun in the 1960s ended Iran's
 feudal land tenure system. Health services have been
 extended to rural areas and serious efforts to reduce
 illiteracy have been undertaken. Life expectancy has
 been raised from 41 to 53 years.
 The failure of the achievements to date to meet the needs
 and expections of Iran's people has contributed materi-
 ally to the strife which marked much of 1978. When emphasis
 was placed on industrialization, agricultural development
 lagged. The disparity between urban and rural income
 widened from 2:1 in 1959 to 3:1 in 1972. The population
 of Iran's cities has grown too swiftly for available housing
 and services. Income distribution is unbalanced; the most
 
 
 554
 
 prosperous twenty percent of the population received
 63.5 percent of income in 1975, up from 57.5 in 1972;
 the share of the middle forty percent decreased from
 31 percent in 1972 to 25.5 in 1975; and that of the
 poorest forty percent decreased from 11.5 to eleven
 percent. As the Congressional Research Service pointed
 out in a July 1978 study:
 "While Government revenues and expenditures, real net
 national income, and capital formation have increased
 considerably, growth has not been balanced, waste has
 been extensive and the physical and social infrastruc-
 ture has lagged behind objectives. Middle and low cost
 housing has been in short supply, and housing objectives
 have remained far from being met. It had been hoped
 that Iran's incipient inflation could be arrested during
 1975-1978 with price controls and fixed profit margins,
 but shortages and an accompanying black market developed."
 Inequities in wealth, income and opportunity have alien-
 ated youth and the intelligentsia. Corruption has done
 as much as any other factor to erode the accomplishments
 of development. Many Iranians believe that it has been
 widespread, reaching into the highest levels of the
 Government. There have been arrests of former cabinet
 ministers. The impact of corruption charges led the
 Shah to issue a code of conduct for the royal family
 which banned their involvement in any business or charity.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Iranian law prohibits the advocacy of communism, attacks
 on the monarchy or the basic tenets of the political
 system and the advocacy of violence. The interpreta-
 tions given by the authorities concerning what consti-
 tutes violations of these prohibitions have in most
 instances limited freedom of speech, press and assembly.
 In 1978, however, the Government periodically permitted
 critical comment in pamphlets, at public gatherings, in
 the media and in Parliament.
 
 
 555
 Foreign language publications espousing many viewpoints,
 including some critical of Iran and the Shah, circulate
 widely. Domestic newspapers and journals were, until
 1978, controlled closely by the restrictions noted
 above and received governmental guidance on foreign
 policy and security matters. While criticism of the
 Constitution, the monarchy and the "Shah-People Revolu-
 tion" remained proscribed, the press through much of
 1978 was permitted greater latitude to print articles
 and editorials critical of the Government. After a
 period of freedom, restrictions on newspapers and jour-
 nals were tightened immediately following the imposition
 of martial law in September. Controls were later re-
 laxed again. However, with the appointment of the mili-
 tary Government in November and the imposition of new
 controls over the press, journalists and other news-
 paper employees refused to work. Thus, during November
 and December, the regular Iranian press was effectively
 shut down.
 Radio and television are government-owned and government-
 controlled. However, during the course of 1978, they
 were allowed to broadcast comment critical of the
 Government; for instance, they aired the Parliamentary
 debate in September which was highlighted by severe
 criticism against the Government. When efforts to re-
 impose tighter control were made in November, staff at
 the radio and television facilities struck rather than
 accept censorship.
 Strikes in Iran are illegal, but a substantial number
 of wildcat walkouts occurred, and in the last quarter
 of 1978 much of the country was paralyzed by strikes in
 all sectors.
 The Shi'a sect of Islam predominates in Iran, but the
 country has had a long history of religious toleration
 which has allowed such religious minorities as Christians,
 Jews, Zoroastrians and members of the Baha'i sect to
 practice their beliefs. One consequence of the strife
 in 1978 has been pressure from conservative Shi'a reli-
 gious leaders against Baha'is, who are viewed by the
 Shi'as as heretics. As a result of this pressure, the
 Government removed several of its officials who are
 Baha'is. There have been instances of personal assaults
 
 
 556
 against Baha'is by mobs, especially in Shiraz. Other
 minorities continue to enjoy official protection and
 toleration, but they fear persecution under conditions
 of disorder.
 Women benefited from the Government's social and edu-
 cational policies during the last two decades. More-
 over, in the past few years several high-level women's
 committees were formed to design and implement programs
 which would further women's rights in Iran. In the fall
 of 1978 these councils were abolished. Women's rights
 thus received a setback.
 Restrictions on the right of assembly have been applied
 to persons seen by the Iranian authorities as advocating
 subversion, violence or Communist doctrines. These
 restrictions have been particularly tight on university
 campuses and have led periodically to clashes between
 security forces and student and other dissidents. The
 growth of popular discontent during 1978, however, made
 it virtually impossible for the Government and its se-
 curity forces to prevent, much less control, unauthorized
 assemblies.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The large majority of Iranians have normally enjoyed
 extensive freedom of movement within Iran and abroad.
 Some members of the opposition, however, perhaps as
 many as one hundred, were required to remain in villages
 and other points remote from their homes. The Govern-
 ment has on occasion denied passports to persons whom
 it suspected would, while abroad, engage in anti-govern-
 ment activities.
 During 1978, a few opposition figures were denied exit
 permits, but others were free to leave; several in the
 latter group visited the United States and countries
 in Europe where they publicly criticized the Iranian
 Government.
 The ability of the average citizen to travel abroad was
 restricted only by his or her ability to pay a $350 exit
 tax and, in the case of wives and children under 18, the
 need to obtain permission from the husband or father.
 
 
 557
 This latter provision of law reflects the strong influ-
 ence of Islamic culture in Iran.
 Iranian law does not provide for emigration. However,
 Iranians who acquire citizenship in another country
 without previously informing the Government of Iran may
 apply to the Government for recognition of their new
 citizenship status. Such applications are usually ap-
 proved. Also, Iranian citizens over 25 years old who
 have completed their military obligations may apply for
 a renunciation of citizenship, which requires the ap-
 proval of the Council of Ministers.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since 1906 Iran-has operated under a Constitution which
 establishes the monarch as chief of state. Iran has a
 bicameral legislature; the members of the Lower House,
 the Majlis, are elected by full adult suffrage as are
 one-half of the members of the Senate; the remaining
 one-half are chosen by the Shah. Candidates for office
 have, in the past, generally been permitted to run for
 election only if officially approved by the Government.
 In 1976, a single political party (Resurgence), encom-
 passing all Iranians, was created by fiat and until
 1978 was the only political party permitted to operate.
 The Resurgence Party was seen as a means to mobilize
 support for the Government's development and moderni-
 zation programs. In August, the Shah, in the face of
 growing unrest, lifted the prohibition on other politi-
 cal parties. The formation of thirty new political
 groups was immediately announced; over one hundred were
 eventually announced. The imposition of martial law
 in September, however, curtailed formal party activities.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Iranian Government cooperated during the year with
 the International Committee of the Red Cross and the
 International Commission of Jurists, both of which sent
 representatives to Iran to inquire into human rights
 conditions. The Government has not exhibited the same
 
 
 558
 spirit of cooperation towards Amnesty International.
 However, an Amnesty International Mission visited Iran
 in November and was able to conduct numerous interviews
 which led to charges of continuing torture and brutality
 by Iranian security elements. A two-member team from
 the International League for Human Rights also visited
 Iran in November where it found discrepancies regarding
 the release of political prisoners and the right of
 political offenders to be tried by civilian courts.
