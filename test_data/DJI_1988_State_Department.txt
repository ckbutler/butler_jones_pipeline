 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti is a one-party constitutional republic with a
 civilian government. Since independence from France in 1977,
 Djibouti has been ruled by President Hassan Gouled Aptidon,
 whose Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progres (RPP) has been
 the only political party allowed since 1981. Political life
 in Djibouti is a subtle and dynamic balance primarily between
 two ethnic groups, the predominant issa (the tribe of the
 President and the party) and the sizable minority Afar.
 Smaller minority populations of Gadaboursi and Isaak (like the
 Issa, these are Somali peoples) and Arabs are represented but
 are less influential in government. The presidency is
 considered to be reserved for an Issa (although there has been
 only one president so far) and the prime ministry for an Afar.
 The President wields considerable power beyond that suggested
 by his double role as both Head of State and Head of
 Government. The Prime Minister, who is appointed by the
 President, functions as a minister without portfolio. Real
 authority in the ruling party, Government, and armed forces is
 in Issa hands, even though cabinet ministries are shared among
 ethnic groups in rough proportion to the groups' size.
 Djibouti's armed forces have a total strength of about 3,500,
 primarily ground forces with small naval and air forces.
 France guarantees Djibouti's external security and maintains
 about 3,800 military and naval personnel in Djibouti. Laws
 are enforced and public order maintained by Djibouti's three
 national police forces: the Force National de Securite and
 the Police Nationale, both under the Ministry of the Interior,
 and the Gendarmerie, under the Ministry of Defense.
 Djibouti's narrow economic base consists almost entirely of
 services to its 10,000 expatriate residents (mostly French)
 and operation of the seaport, airport, and the Djibouti-Addis
 Ababa railroad. Since 1977 Djibouti has received tens of
 thousands of immigrants fleeing war, drought, famine, and
 political and economic conditions in neighboring Ethiopia and
 Somalia. At the end of 1988, approximately 2,000 of these
 remained in Djibouti registered as refugees with, and under the
 protection of, the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Reftgees (UNHCR); others remain as "illegal aliens."
 There was no change during 1988 in the human rights situation
 in Djibouti, which includes significant restrictions on
 freedoms of speech, press, association, and the rights to a
 fair trial and to change the government through democratic
 means. Women have full civil rights but are, in practice,
 treated as second-class citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or government-
 inspired killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance of persons for
 political reasons.
 
 
 DJIBOUTI
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment in 1988. Amnesty
 International's 1988 report notes that some of the 103
 Ethiopians rounded up in 1987 after a demonstration were beaten
 and all were then forced into a train which took them to the
 Ethiopian border under police guard.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 A person may be detained no more than 48 hours without an
 examining magistrate's formal charge. An accused has the
 right to legal counsel, and while awaiting trial may, by a
 judge's order, be released on bail or personal recognizance,
 or be jailed pending the final verdict. In practice, detainees
 are usually released with no ill-treatment within a matter of
 days, though not always within the legally mandated 48-hour
 period.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Djibouti's legal system is based on a mix of Djiboutian
 legislation and executive decrees, French codified law adopted
 at independence, Shari'a (Islamic religious law), and
 traditions of the native nomadic peoples. Crimes in urban
 areas are dealt with according to French-inspired law and
 judicial practice in the Cour Judiciare. Civil actions may be
 brought under either French-inspired law in the Cour Judiciare
 or in the context of traditional tribal customs in the Tribunal
 Coutoumier. Shari'a courts handle family matters only.
 Decisions of all three types of courts may be appealed;
 judgments within the Tribunal Coutoumier and Shari'a court
 systems are appealed directly to the country's Supreme Court.
 Proceedings in all courts except the State Security Court are
 open to the public.
 A special State Security Court, the Tribunal de Surete de la
 Republique, may hear in closed session cases of espionage,
 treason, and acts threatening the public order or the "interest
 of the Republic." The State Security Court was last convened
 in September 1986, when it condemned in absentia three men
 (one a former government minister) to life in prison for
 conspiracy to destabilize the State, attempted assassination
 of high officials, and possession of military arms and
 munitions. Three other defendants received prison sentences.
 The judiciary appears to be susceptible to government influence
 in cases of political interest. However, there were no reports
 that the Government held political prisoners during 1988.
 Those who express too vociferously in public views that are
 critical of, or perceived as threatening to, the Government
 face prosecution. On May 31, some 400 Isaaks were arrested in
 Djibouti-ville for an unauthorized public demonstration in
 celebration of Somali National Movement (SNM) military
 successes against the Somali Government. Most of the 400 were
 released over the next 2 weeks, but 18 were tried and
 convicted of unauthorized public demonstration and sentenced to
 6-months' imprisonment. The convictions and sentences were
 upheld on appeal.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is restricted. The radio and
 television stations and one newspaper (French-language weekly)
 are all government owned and operated. The Government
 controls, directly or indirectly, the dissemination of all
 information. The news media do report on problems within
 Djibouti, but the Government ktself, government officials, and
 the party are free from criticism. The media largely avoid
 reporting on crime, violence. ethnic strife, and domestic
 politics in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Somalia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political protest is prohibited by selective enforcement
 of laws requiring permits for mass public assembly and by short
 detention of persons without charge. The required permits are
 not issued for public political meetings outside party
 auspices. Nonpolitical peaceful assembly is allowed.
 Religious, cultural, social, and commercial associations are
 free from government interference.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Djibouti is a secular republic and respects freedom of
 religion for all faiths. Nearly the entire population is
 Sunni Muslim. Holy days of Islam are legal holidays, and
 Government observes the month of Ramadan with a shortened
 workday. Persons are free ta dhoose whether to observe or
 ignore Islamic teachings on diet, alcohol consumption,
 religious fasting, and the like. The expatriate community
 supports Roman Catholic, French Protestant, Greek Orthodox,
 and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Foreign missionaries are
 free to operate.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians travel freely within Djibouti and may live and
 work where they choose. Djiboutians leave for, and return
 from, international travel without restriction or interference.
 Passports are available to all Djiboutians but are invalid for
 travel to Israel and the Republic of South Africa.
 Djibouti cooperates with the UNHCR to assist and protect the
 approximately 2,000 registered refugees in Djibouti. The
 number of registered'refugees in Djibouti decreased from
 approximately 13,000 at the beginning of 1988 to approximately
 2,000 at the end of the year due to voluntary repatriation to
 Ethiopia under UNHCR auspices and due to removal from the
 refugee rolls of Djiboutian nationals improperly identified as
 refugees. In a number of cases, notably in 1987, registered
 refugees were deported by error together with Ethiopian
 illegal aliens by the Djiboutian authorities. In each of
 
 
 98
 DJIBOUTI
 these cases, the registered refugees returned to Djibouti
 safely. Djibouti asserts its right to deport illegal aliens.
 The police routinely detain illegal aliens in the capital city
 for deportation, sometimes daily; aliens who claim to-be
 refugees are allowed to present their documents or to see a
 UNHCR representative.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Djiboutians have neither the right nor the ability to change
 their government peacefully. The Issa-dominated Rassemblement
 Populaire pour le Progres (RPP) jealously guards its position
 as Djibouti's only political party, a status it has enjoyed
 since the Afar-dominated Movement Populaire Djiboutien was
 outlawed on the grounds of preelection civil violence in 1981.
 The RPP chooses candidates for election to the presidency and
 the 65-member National Assembly, a legislative body with no
 independent power. Citizens are encouraged to vote, but their
 only choice is to vote for or against the party's candidates.
 The two different ballots must be cast in different boxes,
 effectively making it obvious who votes against the party.
 No woman holds a senior position in either the party or the
 Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been responsive to inquiries concerning
 human rights practices. During 1988 such inquiries included
 one from a member of the U.S. Congress, to which the Government
 replied through the U.S. Embassy. In addition to cooperation
 with the UNHCR, the Government has given access to the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to instruct
 the Djiboutian army in international agreements governing
 conduct of nations at war. There are no private human rights
 organizations in Djibouti. No private international human
 rights organizations are known to have approached the
 Government in 1988 with inquiries into human rights practices.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The predominant status of the Issa in the party, the civil
 service, and the military discriminates against the Afar, the
 Isaak, and Gadaboursi.
 Women in Djibouti have equal status with men under the
 codified law. However, in practice women suffer from
 discrimination in education, in work, and in family matters.
 On questions of family, law such as inheritance and child
 custody, men are favored over women. Women may file for
 divorce. Men are not paid significantly higher wages than
 women for the same work, but there are few women in the
 professions. Women are active in small trade, and many women
 are employed in offices and stores. Nomadic traditions of
 genital mutilation of young girls (particularly clitoral
 excision and infibulation) are practiced widely. In November
 the Djiboutian National Women's Union (affiliated with the RPP,
 the ruling party) began a government-supported campaign
 against these practices; the campaign has been extensively
 covered in the government-owned press.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to join or not to join unions as they
 choose. There are 30 individual labor unions in Djibouti,
 many of which represent employees of only one private or
 state-owned'corporation. Few unions are truly independent,
 since the Government.organized and controls Djibouti's one
 labor federation, the Union Generale des Travailleurs
 Djiboutiens (UGTD--General Union of Djiboutian Workers),
 through which it exerts some control over-individual unions.
 Only a small percentage of Djiboutian workers are union
 members. Relations between labor unions -and employers are
 nonconfrontational on major issues; most disputes concern
 individual grievances such as a complaint about a specific
 instance of miscalculation of wages or benefits. Workers'
 rights;with regard to employers are generally viewed as
 employers' personal obligations in a traditional society
 rather than as a .political concept or institutional
 obligations. Employers try to assure (with a fair degree of
 success) that key positions in unions are held by persons
 sympathetic to.the employer.
 Workers are free to strike but in practice, labor action is
 limited to short, ad hoc protests directed against minor
 complaints about working conditions or miscalculation of wages.
 Unions are free to maintain relations and exchange programs
 with unions and labor organizations in other countries.
 Djibouti belongs to the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Djibouti recognizes labor's right to organize and bargain
 collectively in both law and practice. However, formal
 collective bargaining virtually does not exist; both labor and
 employers seem to prefer (and expect) more informal contact
 with each other. On questions of wages and health and safety
 conditions, the Ministry of Labor encourages direct, ad hoc
 resolution by labor and the employer. Either labor or the
 employers may initiate a formal administrative hearing at which
 the labor inspection service of the Ministry of Labor mediates.
 Wages are set by employers in consultation with the Ministry
 of Labor to assure adherence to mandatory minimum wage
 regulations. The Government determines a minimum wage
 appropriate for a particular activity. Given that the minimum
 wages were last adjusted in 1976 and given high inflation, the
 Government on occasion recommends a wage level higher than the
 minimum wage. In practice, many workers individually negotiate
 their wage with their employer. Labor legislation and
 practice is uniform throughout the small country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is neither forced nor compulsory labor in Djibouti.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age of 14 years for employment is respected
 
 
 100
 DJIBOUTI
 in practice. Children may and do work in their own family-
 owned businesses such as restaurants and small shops. There
 is almost no farming in Djibouti.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are specified by categories of workers. Minimum
 wage regulations are enforced by the Ministry of Labor.
 Increased most recently in 1976, the minimum wage is less than
 $80 a month for watchmen and unskilled laborers to nearly
 $1,400 a month for "Directors" and medical doctors. The
 minimum wage does not provide a decent living for a worker and
 his family. A Western-educated professional with a scarce
 skill generally is able to negotiate a higher salary.
 Unskilled workers, in an environment with a 55 to 75 percent
 unemployment rate, have less bargaining power. Mandatory
 seniority bonuses range from 4 percent of the worker's basic
 salary after 2 years of service to 52 percent after 26 years
 of service. Many workers receive housing or housing
 allowances, transportation allowances, and meals allowances to
 complement basic wages. The standard workweek is 40 hours.
 Maximum hours of work are regulated in practice by a strict
 enforcement of overtime pay regulations.
 The Ministry of Labor enforces occupational health and safety
 regulations through inspection and dispute mediation by the
 labor inspection service.
