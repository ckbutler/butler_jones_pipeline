 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy headed by Prime Minister Sheikh
 Hasina Wajed, leader of the Awami League, which came to power in 1996 in na-
 tional elections deemed generally free and fair by domestio and international observ-
 ers. Major opposition parties include the previous ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
 Party (BNP), the Jatiyo Party, and the Jamaat-E-Islami. A 1996 constitutional
 amendment requires a neutral caretaker government to conduct all general par-
 liamentary elections. Nevertheless, elections are often marred by violence and rig-
 ging. The judiciary displays a high degree of independence.
 The Home Affairs Ministry controls the police and paramilitary forces, which bear
 primary responsibility for maintaining internal security. The army and paramilitary
 forces are responsible for security in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), where a trib-
 al group has waged a low-level insurgency since 1974. In December government and
 rebel negotiators signed an accord to end the insurgency in the Chittagong Hill
 Tract (CHT). Police officers committed a number of serious human rights abuses.
 Bangladesh is a poor country. Annual per capita income is approximately $260;
 about 45 percent of the country's 124 million people exist on incomes insufficient
 to meet minimum daily needs. Seventy percent of the work force is involved in agri-
 culture, which accounts for approximately one-third of the gross domestic product.
 There is a growing industrial sector, based largely on the manufacture of garments,
 textiles, industrial goods such as rerolled stee , cement, and jute. There is a small
 wealthy elite, and a middle class is emerging. Efforts to reform the economy have
 been hampered by endemic corruption, political turmoil and the opposition of public
 sector enterprises, government bureaucrats, and other vested interests.
 The Government continues to restrict or deny many fundamental rights. Police
 committed extrajudicial killings, and some people died in police custody unde- sus-
 picious circumstances. Police routinely use torture and other forms of abuse in inter-
 rogating suspects. The Government rarely convicts and punishes those responsible
 for torture or unlawful deaths. Prison conditions are poor. Prime Minister Sheikh
 Hasina's Government did not repeal the Special Powers Act (SPA), which allows for
 arbitrary arrest and preventive detention; it used the SPA to harass political oppo-
 nents and other citizens by detaining them without formal charge. A large case
 backlog slows the judicial process, and lengthy pretrial detention is a problem. The
 Government sometimes infringes on citizens' privacy rights. The Government places
 some limitations on freedom of assembly. Women, minorities, the disabled, religious
 minorities, and indigenous people face societal discrimination. Violence against
 women and trafficking of women and children for prostitution remain serious prob-
 lems. The Government continues to limit worker rights, and child labor is a wide-
 spread and serious problem. Vigilante justice resulted in numerous killings.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were numerous extrajudicial
 killings during the year. In one instance in February, Ansars, a police auxiliary
 force, fired on a crowd of local villagers who had assembled outside the Ansar camp:
 4 people were killed and 11 others wounded. The villagers, from the village of
 Sadhpur in Savar, had come to investigate the shooting ofra lcal man who was at-
 tempting to stop his young niece from being molested by one of the Ansars.
 According to human rights monitors, a number of persons died while in custody
 in the first 9 months of 1996. According to newspaper reports, 23 persons died in
 police custody through September. Most deaths appear to have been due to mis-
 treatment, or illnesses aggravated by imprisonment. However, human rights reports
 concerning police abuse and deaths of prisoners indicate that this claim is inac-
 curate and masks widespread and serious abuse. For example, on February 7,
 Seema Chowdhury, a garments worker, died while in "safe custody" in Chittagong,
 5 days after charges were filed against four police officers for raping her in custody
 in 1996. An autopsy reported that she died of typhoid, but women's rights activists
 
 
 1615
 
 and some politicians asserted Chowdhury was murdered to prevent her testifying
 against the police in the rape case. Acting against customary practice, authorities
 burned her body after the autopsy, destroying any possible physical evidence of
 murder. In July the four police officers accused of raping her were acquitted for lack
 of evidence; the Government has appealed the verdict.
 In June a man was arrested for attempting to enter the grounds of the Prime
 Minister's office in Dhaka, and was later beaten to death by police. In August a man
 detained in Chittagong as a suspected thief died in custody; an autopsy report said
 that he died from torture (see Section 1.c.). These cases, and that of Seema
 Chowdhury, gained notoriety, and the Government initiated legal action against the
 police officers involved. Most abuses, however, go unpunished, and the resulting cli-
 mate of impunity remains a serious obstacle to ending police abuse and extrajudicial
 killing.
 Violence, often resulting in killings, is a pervasive element in Bangladeshi politics
 (see Section 3). Demonstrators from all parties, and even within parties, often clash
 with police and with each other during rallies and demonstrations. The Awami
 League and opposition parties used armed violence and intimidation to disrupt their
 opponents gatherings and rallies. Opposition parties also used armed violence to en-
 force general strikes. The violence perpetrated by both sides resulted in more than
 18 deaths and hundreds of injuries. Five persons, including one policeman, were
 shot and killed in clashes that erupted near the end of a joint opposition rally in
 Chittagong on November 11, which was held to protest the draft peace agreement
 between the Government and the CHT insurgents (see Section 5). The BNP stated
 that two of those killed were its members. The police claimed that there had been
 a premeditated attack on police by BNP activists who used guns, Molotov cocktails,
 and small bombs. BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia asserted that "goons" from the rul-
 ing Awami League had been responsible for instigating the violence. After the initial
 clash at the rally site, violent encounters between police and opposition activists
 took place elsewhere in Chittagong. After the Chittagong clashes, the BNP and
 other allied opposition parties (chiefly the Jamaat-E-Islami) announced a half-day
 general strike in Chittagong in protest against the claimed attack by Awami League
 goons." BNP activists also took to the streets in central Dhaka and reportedly set
 fire to more than a dozen vehicles.
 More than 300 persons were reported to have been injured in clashes during an
 8-hour road and rail blockage outside Dhaka called by opposition political parties
 on October 5. A BNP Member of Parliament (M.P.) was stabbed during the contin-
 ued clashes on October 6.
 Three people were shot and killed in Chittagong on November 27 During BNP-
 Awami League clashes, which occurred after Awarm League student activists sought
 to disrupt a visit by BNP leader Khaleda Zia to console victims of an earthquake.
 The BNP portrayed the events as a deliberate attempt to kill Zia, who barricaded
 herself in a hospital ward. At least four persons died in November 29-30 violence,
 during general strikes called by the opposition to protest the alleged "assassination
 attempt on Khaleda Zia. Arrest warrants on murder charges were issued against
 23 BNP officials, including at least 2 BNP M.P."s who were trapped along with
 Khaleda Zia during the November 27 incident.
 Violence is also endemic among the student political groups allied with the major
 national parties. It reportedly resulted in at least 6 deaths by October, hundreds
 of injuries, and the frequent closure of educational institutions.
 Murders of local-level political activists and activists of the student fronts of major
 parties are common occurrences; the distinctions, however, between politically moti-
 vated murders and purely criminal acts are blurred by the involvement of many
 politicians and political party activists in organized crime.
 In 1995 the Government charged former president Hossain Mohammed Ershad
 with ordering the 1981 murder of the alleged assassin of President Ziaur Rahman.
 Ershad was granted bail in January and later allowed to travel abroad. The murder
 case is not being actively pursued by the Government. Ershad was already serving
 a 20-year sentence for corruption (see Section 1.c.).
 In 1995 police in Dinaj ur abducted, raped, and murdered a 15-year-old girl
 named Yasmeen. The murser sparked riots in Dinajpur during which'police killed
 seven people. The case went to trial in 1997, and in August three police officers
 were convicted of the murder and sentenced to death. Another officer was sentenced
 toprison for concealing evidence.
 In 1996 the Government arrested under the Special Powers Act, and later for-
 mally charged, retired Lt. Colonel Farook Rahman, the self-confessed organizer of
 the 1975 assassination of Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In July he and
 four other accused persons went on trial in Dhaka for the murder of Sheikh Mujibur
 (see Sections 1.c., 2.d., 2.e.).
 
 
 1616
 On December 25, 1996, Subinoy Chakma, a tribal peace activist in the Chittagong
 Hill Tracts, was murdered at his house in Rangamati. His murder remained un-
 solved in 1997 but was generally believed to have been committed by the Shanti
 Bahini, a tribal insurgent group, which opposed Subinoy's efforts to promote better
 relations between tribals and Bengalis in the Hill Tracts (see Section Y.g.).
 There was a wave of mob lynchings of suspected criminals during the year. On
 May 30, six men suspected of stealing cows were killed in Dhaka. On June 25, in
 Dhaka a large crowd killed three alleged child traffickers, burning them inside the
 police vehicle sent to rescue them. A newspaper reported that nationwide there were
 50 similar murders during May and June.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the 1996 disappearance of Kalpana Chakma,
 central organizing secretary of the Hill Womens' Federation, an organization of trib-
 al people in the  t   on Hill Tracts. In 1996 the Government formed an inves-
 tigative committee that has yet to issue any findings.TeamnorP     ihet-
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradinor Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture and crue, inuman, or degrading pun-
 ishment, police routinely employ physical and psychological torture and other abuse
 during arrests and interrogations. Torture may consist of threats, beatings, and, oc-
 casionally, the use of electric shock. The Government rarely convicts or punishes
 those responsible for torture, and a climate of impunity allows such police abuses
 to continue.
 During two periods of detention between August and October, police reportedly
 tortured Shafiul Alam Prodhan, the leader of a small leftist party. During the sec-
 ond period of detention, Prodhan was allegedly subjected to electrical shocks. The
 case appears to have been politically motivated.
 Numerous press and human rights monitors' reports indicate that police abuse of
 detainees is a widespread problem and frequently results in death (see Section L.a.).
 Lt. Col. Farook Rahman, arrested in 1996 under the SPA and later charged with
 the 1975 murder of Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was reportedly sub-
 jected to various forms of torture, as were the four other persons accused in the
 case. Zobaida Rashid, whose husband was accused in the Mujibur murder and had
 fled the country, was arrested under the SPA after she publicly defended her hus-
 band's actions. She also was allegedly tortured and subjected to unusually harsh
 prison conditions before the Supreme Court ordered her released from prison. The
 Government also used police surveillance, raids on houses, and intimidation by rul-
 ingparty activists to harass her family and friends (see Section 1.d.).
 Rape in police custody is a common problem. For example in July police officers
 in Lalmonirihat reportedly raped a woman after unsuccessfully attempting to arrest
 her husband. The press reported 9 instances of rape in police custody, but women's
 rights activists estimate that the real number is several times higher.
 Prison conditions are poor. Most prisons are overcrowded and lack adequate facili-
 ties. The current prison population, over 46,000 in August, is more than double the
 official prison capacity. There are three classes of cells: A, B, and C. Common crimi-
 nals and low-level political workers are generally held in C cells, which often have
 dirt floors, no furnishings, and poor quality food. The use of restraining devices on
 prisoners in these cells is common. Prisoners in the C cells reportedly suffer the
 worst abuses, including beatings or being forced to kneel for long periods. Condi-
 tions in B and A cells are markedly better, A cells are reserved for prominent pris-
 oners.
 The five men arrested for the murder of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were held in
 class C cells. On July 8, the judge presiding over their trial ordered that they be
 moved to class A cells. The Government moved them on July 22, after the judge
 threatened legal action against prison officials for failure to comply with his order.
 A government-appointed committee of private citizens, who are prominent individ-
 uals in the various prison localities, monitors prisons monthly but does not release
 its findings. In general, the Government does not permit prison visits by independ-
 ent human rights monitors but does make occasional exceptions. Human rights
 groups reported that 8 persons died in custody during the year. However, news-
 papers reported 23 persons died in police custody.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Awami League Government contin-
 ued to use national security legislation, namely the Special Powers Act (SPA) of
 1974, to detain citizens without formal charges or specific complaints being filed
 against them. Past governments have vowed to abolish the SPA but did not do so.
 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed, before coming to power, advocated the aboli-
 tion of the SPA. As Prime Minister, however, she reversed herself, stating in March
 that retention of the SPA was justified by its proven usefulness to past govern-
 ments.
 
 
 1617
 Under the SPA, the Government or a district magistrate may, to prevent the com-
 mission of an act likely "to prejudice the security of the country", order anyone de-
 tained for 30 days. The Government (or magistrate) must within 15 days inform the
 detainee of the grounds for detention, and the Government must within 30 days ap-
 prove the grounds for detention or release the detainee. In practice, detainees are
 sometimes held for Ionger periods without the Government stating the grounds for
 the detention or formaly approving it. Detainees may appeal their detention, and
 the Government may grant early release.
 After 4 months, an advisory board composed of two persons who have been, or
 are qualified to be, high court judges, and one civil servant examines cases of de-
 tainees. If the Government adequately defends its detention order, the detainee re-
 mains imprisoned; if not, the detainee is released. If the defendant in an SPA case
 is able to present his case before the High Court in Dhaka, generally, the High
 Court will rule in favor of the defendant. Typically, the Court finds the Government
 is unable to "show cause." However, many defendants are either too poor, or because
 of strict detention are unable to obtain legal counsel. Without legal counsel or funds,
 they cannot move the case beyond the magistrate level. The magistrates, unlike
 High Court judges, are not independent. They are subject to the administrative con-
 trols of the Law Ministry and are less likely to summarily dismiss a case. As a re-
 sult, the defendant in many SPA cases will languish in detention without the case
 moving to trial. Detainees are allowed to consult with lawyers while in detention,
 although usually not until a charge is filed. They are not entitled to be represented
 by a lawyer before an advisory board. Detainees may receive visitors, and incommu-
 nicado detention is generally not practiced. However, the Government has held in-
 communicado some prominent prisoners, notably Lt. Col. Farook Rahman (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 According to the Government and press reports, the authorities detained more
 than 3,498 persons under the SPA through September. As of October 1, about 2,752
 detainees had been released. Government figures indicate that 2,000 persons were
 in detention under the SPA in July. There are credible reports from human rights
 monitors and political activists that the Awami League Government uses the SPA
 primarily as a tool to harass- and intimidate political opponents. They claim that the
 Government has arrested hundreds of opposition activists under the SPA, most
 being released later when no charges couldbe brought. Actual numbers of party ac-
 tivists arrested were not verifiable.
 On March 20, the Government arrested four senior opposition BNP leaders under
 the SPA. The Prime Minister later said that they were involved in acts of sabotage.
 On April 7, the Supreme Court ruled their detention illegal, ordered them released,
 and required the Government to pay them compensation for "political victimization."
 The judicial release of the SPA detainees is usually the result of a habeas corpus
 petition by the defendant to the High Court. The Court dismisses the cases, stating
 the Gvernment was unable to "show cause" for the detention.
 The Government and local authorities also detain people without use of the SPA,
 doing so either for personal vengeance or as a means to harass and intimidate per-
 ceived opponents and their families. For example, in July the Dhaka police detective
 branch raided the house of Shaquib Chowdhury the night before his marriage to a
 daughter of Khandaker Abdur Rashid, one of the accused in the Sheikh Mujibur
 murder case. According to press reports, the police had no warrant to search or ar-
 rest but claimed that the house's occupants had illegal arms. Chowdhury, his father,
 and five guests were detained for several hours, during which the police reportedly
 interrogated them on the whereabouts of Mr. Rashid, rather than on illegal arms.
 The previous Government allowed another widely used statute, the Anti-Terror-
 ism Act, to expire in 1994. However, some cases are still pending and are yet to
 be resolved. There are some differences of legal procedure under the law, such as
 limited bail and special tribunals.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The higher levels of the judiciary display a signifi-
 cant degree of independence, as mandated by the Constitution. The judiciary often
 rules against the Government in criminal, civil, and even politically controversial
 cases. Lower level courts reportedly are more susceptible to political pressure. Ex-
 amples of lower courts refusing bail in cases which higher courts granted bail or
 dismissed, include the case of BNP     leader Nazibul Bashar Maizbhandari.
 Maizbhandari was arrested during a BNP strike, on September 22. The Chief Met-
 ropolitan Magistrate's court (CMN) in Dhaka denied his requests for bail three
 times. The district and sessions judge granted bail on September 28, and
 Maizbhandari was admitted to a hospital for injuries alleged to have resulted from
 police abuse.
 
 
 1618
 On March 20, four ranking BNP leaders were arrested without warrant or
 charges. In the lower courts, bail was refused. Petitions were filed before the High
 Court challenging the detentions. On April 7, the court declared the detentions ille-
 gal, ordered the release of the BNP leaders, and ordered that the Government
 should pay compensation of $2,220 (100,000 taka) each.
 The court system has two levels, the lower courts and the Supreme Court. Both
 hear civil and criminal cases. The lower courts consist of magistrates, who are part
 of the administrative branch of government, and session judges, who belong to the
 judicial branch. The Supreme Court is divided into two Sections, the High Court
 and the Appellate Court. The High Court hears original cases and also reviews
 cases from the lower courts. The Appellate Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals
 of judgments, decrees, orders, or sentences of the High Court. Rulings of the Appel-
 late Court are binding on all other courts.
 Trials are public. The law provides the accused with the right to be represented
 by counsel, to review accusatory material, to call witnesses, and to appeal verdicts.
 In practice, the largely rural, illiterate population does not always understand these
 rights, nor do the authorities always respect them. There is a system of bail, and
 bail is commonly granted for both violent and nonviolent crimes. However, if bail
 is not granted, the law does not specify a time limit on pretrial detention. State-
 funded defense attorneys are rarely provided, and there are few legal aid programs
 to offer financial assistance. In rural areas, individuals may receive no legal rep-
 resentation. In urban areas, legal counsel is generally available if individuals can
 afford the expense. However legal education is poor, so most legal representation
 is inadequate.
 There is corruption within the legal process. Small sums must be paid to a num-
 ber of court officials in order for a civil suit to be filed. While these may appear
 to be processing fees, they are more in the nature of bribes; they are not established
 by statute or regulation, are paid to officials personally, and there is no accountabil-
 ity for failure to discharge duties paid for. Defendants can sometimes pay to avoid
 being served with a notice or suit. Because of the difficulty accessing the courts and
 because litigation is time-consuming, alternate dispute resolution by traditional vil-
 lage leaders is popular in rural communities.
 A major problem of the court system is the overwhelming backlog of cases. Accord-
 ing to the Government, about 575,000 cases were pending in criminal and civil
 courts in July, and about 32,000 people, or 68 percent of the country's total prison
 population, were awaiting trial or under trial. Government sources report that the
 period between detention and trial averages 6 months, but press and human rights
 groups report many instances of pretrial detention lasting for several years. These
 conditions, and the corruption encountered in the judicial process, effectively pre-
 vent many people from obtaining a fair trial or justice.
 The Government claims that it holds no political prisoners, but the BNP and
 human rights monitors claim that many opposition activists have been arrested and
 convicted under criminal charges as a pretext for their political activities (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a home. However,
 according to human rights monitors, police rarely obtain warrants, and officers vio-
 lating the procedure are not punished. In addition, the SPA permits searches with-
 out a warrant.
 The plice Special Branch, National Security Intelligence, and the Directorate
 General of Forces Intelligence employ informers and conduct surveillance of citizens,
 particularly those perceived to be political opponents of the Government. Human
 rights activists, foreign nongovermental organizations (NGO's), and journalists re-
 port occasional harassment by these organizations (see Section 2.a.). The Govern-
 ment reportedly opens international mail and monitors telephone calls on occasion.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 expression, and the press, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the interest of secu-
 rity, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency and morality, or to
 prohibit defamation or incitement to an offense. With some exceptions the Govern-
 ment generally respects freedom of speech and of the press. Since taking office, the
 Awami League Government has issued press guidance restricting coverage of a very
 limited number of stories. Opposition papers reported that the Government was giv-
 ing "press advice" asking government-owned papers not to carry news of the Free-
 dom Party, Juba (Youth) Command and BNP leader Anwar Zahid, Zobaida Rashid,
 wife of colonel Rashid, or statements from BNP leaders. News and statements of
 opposition leader Khaleda Zia and some BNP leaders were permissible. The govern-
 
 
 1619
 ment papers were also asked not to publish reports on rallies or processions of the
 BNPs student front, Jatiyatabadi Chatra Dal. This advice was not a binding regula-
 tion. The Awami League enjoys support from most major newspapers in the country.
 While supporting overall policies, many papers report critically on the activities of
 the Government and ruling party, including the Prime Minister.
 The Government owns and controls radio and television, which do not provide bal-
 anced coverage of the news. The activities of the Prime Minister occupy the bulk
 of prime time news bulletins on both television and radio, followed by the activities
 of. other members of the Cabinet. Opposition party news gets little coverage. The
 Government alleges that television crews assigned to cover BNP activities are pre-
 vented by the BNP from doing so. In. response, the BNP claims that news items
 about its party activities are purposely iguored or distorted. The British Broadcast-
 ing Corporation (BBC) and the C able News Network (CNN) international news are
 retransmittd live and uncensored for several hours each day. There are no restric-
 tions on the installation of satellite dishes, which are widely owned both in Dhaka
 and throughout the country, including in remote villages.
 There is one government-owned (BS). and one privately owned wire service, the
 United News of Bangladesh (UNB), which distribute stories nationally. In May a
 London-based Bangladeshi journalist launched a bilingual wire service called "Ban-
 gladesh News Service," which mainly caters to the needs of newspapers outside
 Dhaka.
 Newspaper ownership and content are not subject to direct government restric-
 tion. The press, numbering hundreds of daily and weekly publications, is a forum
 for a wide range of views. Papers that cannot obtain-enough government newsprint
 to meet their needs must buy it on the open market at higher prices. Many papers
 do so. There were no reports of papers not able to publish due to lack of newsprint.
 The Government controls the distribution of advertisements issued by. different
 government agencies through the Ministry of Information. This is a major source
 of revenue for all newspapers. The practice of using government advertisements to
 reward supporters and punish critical newspapers exists, although the Government
 claims that advertisements are allocated.solely on the basis of circulation.
 Foreign publications are subject to censorship. When enforced, this is most often
 for immodest or obscene photographs or perceived misrepresentation or defamation
 of Islam.
 In its.election manifesto, the Awami League called for the privatization of the
 state-controlled media. Upon taking power, the Government set up a committee to
 recommend- measures for authorizing private radio and television broadcasts. The
 committee has submitted a report to- the Government, but it has not been released
 to the general public, and no changes in the existing legal framework have been an-
 nounced. The League s manifesto also. vowed to privatize the government-run news-
 papers. In December the two government--newspapers Doynik Bangla and Ban-
 gladesh Times were closed and are expected to be sold to private buyers. Several
 newsmen working for the government-run wire service, BSS, were transferred to
 district towns. Many claim that they were transferred because they were perceived
 to favor the BNP. Journalists appointed in Bangladesh diplomatic missions as press
 ministers/counselors were recalled and replaced by pro-Awami League journalists.
 The Awami League Government reportedly advises the government wire service and
 government-run newspapers not to cover news of BNP leaders' activities, except
 those of the BNP leader, deputy leader, and secretary general.
 Several sources have reported that the State Minister for Information established
 an office at Bangladesh Television (BTV) to monitor or edit news items. The Govern-
 ment denies this -allegation, claiming that the office at BTV premises was renovated
 to be used as a VIP waiting room.
 Attacks on journalists and efforts to intimidate them by government officials,
 litical party activists, and others, occasionally occur. For example, the Rajshahi ?u-
 reau chief of Dinkal, the main opposition BNP daily, was physically assaulted in
 July by an armed group near his residence in Rajshahi and he was seriously in-
 jured. He reported the incident to police, and three persons were arrested. After the
 arrests, other persons attacked and ransacked his house and beat the occupants. Re-
 ports differ on whether this incident was politically motivated or the result of a pri-
 vate dispute.
 Another newsman, a reporter for the large circulation Bangladesh       daily
 Janakantha, published in Dhaka, was arrested in June by police at a small town-
 ship outside Dhaka following a complaint, of "journalistic slander." He was released
 on ball after 26 days' detention, and his case was pending in the courts at year's
 end.
 In July an armed group attacked the office of the Daily Comilla Barta, a vernacu-
 lar daily at Comilla, about 60 miles east of Dhaka. The newspaper is run by an
 
 
 1620
 Awami League group. An opposing Awami League group was upset with the news-
 paper's reporting of corruption in the local hospital. Some newspaper employees
 were assaulted, the office was ransacked, and death threats were made against the
 editor. No arrests were made by the police.
 An editor of another daily was apparently harassed for his critical reports on the
 performance of some ministries, including the Ministry of Finance. Income tax in-
 vestigators interrogated him, and revenue officials audited his tax records. He re-
 ceived telephone threats. The daughter-in-law of the Finance Minister sued him and
 his publisher in June for printing stories that alleged that she was involved in ma-
 nipulating the country's stock market.
 A journalist who writes critically of the Awami League Government's policies re-
 ports that he and his family have been harassed by government intelligence serv-
 ices, including surveillance and telephone threats. Another journalist said that he
 received telephone threats in February from a government security official, after re-
 porting on misuse of government resources by the Prime Minister's office.
 Feminist author Taslima Nasreen, whose writings and statements provoked death
 threats from some Islamic groups in 1993 and 1994, still lives abroad after her de-
 parture for Europe in 1994. The Government charged Nasreen in 1994 under a Sec-
 tion of the penal code that stipulates punishment for anyone convicted of inten-
 tionally insulting religious beliefs; the case is still filed against her. The Govern-
 ment has taken no action against those who issued death threats against Nasreen,
 even though such threats also violate the law.
 The Government's film censor board temporarily canceled the censor certificates
 of three English films and prohibited their screening on grounds of obscenity. In
 past years the board banned several locally produced and foreign films, usually on
 the grounds that the films promoted immorality. The film censor board also consid-
 ers issues of state security, law and order, religious sentiment, obscenity, foreign re-
 lations, defamation of a person, and plagiarism in deciding whether to ban a film.
 Academic freedom is generally respected by the Government. Teachers and stu-
 dents at all levels are free to pursue academic assignments except on extremely sen-
 sitive religious and political topics.
 The situation on public university campuses remains volatile, seriously inhibiting
 the ability of students to receive university educations, and teachers to teach.
 Armed clashes between rival student groups have resulted in closures of the univer-
 sities of Dhaka, Rajshahi, Chittagong, Jahangirnagar, and Islamic University on
 several occasions. The vice-chancellors of Rajshalu and Islamic universities ap-
 pointed by the previous BNP government were forced by the student fronts of the
 ruling Awami League and Jamaat-E-Islami to resign. Campus violence between stu-
 dent political factio ns has little to do with ideological differences, and more to do
 with physical contrl of dormitories and student concessions by nonstudent party ac-
 tivists. The result is that, on average, it takes 6 years or more to earn a 4-year de-
 gree.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, subject to restrictions in the interest of public order and public
 health. The Government sometimes prohibits rallies for security reasons, but many
 independent observers believe such explanations are usually a pretext.
 Both the Government and opposition parties frequently interfere with each other's
 rallies and public meetings. Throughout the year partisans of the ruling and opposi-
 tion parties used violence to disrupt political gatherings. In addition, both have used
 a statute that allows public assemblies to be prohibited-t prevent possible vio-
 lence--if two or more parties have scheduled rallies for the same time and place.
 Political parties, after learning of planned opposing-party public gatherings, sched-
 ule other rallies for the same time and place, in hopes o  orcing authorities to can-
 cel both events. For example, in June an opposition BNP rally was banned by au-
 thorities after the local Awami League organization called a rally for the same time
 and place. Similarly, in August a pro-Awami League organization called a rally in
 Dhaka for the same time and place as a previously scheduled rally by an Islamic
 gop opposed to the Government. In this case authorities did not ban the rallies,
 butattempted to prevent Islamic activists from attending. several people were in-
 tured in the resulting clashes between Islamic party activists, police, and Awami
 League activists (see Section l.a.).
 In September the Awami League mayor of Dhaka banned political rallies in public
 streets and required rallies to be held in seven designated sites instead, with the
 declared rationale of improving traffic flow in the capital. Opposition parties de-
 nounced the ban as a unlateral restriction on freedom of assembly but declined the
 mayor's offer to discuss alternatives to the designated venues. There were repeated
 clashes in Dhaka as opposition parties demonstrated against the ban, or sought to
 assemble prior to processions on public streets. Police enforcement of the ban on op-
 
 
 1621
 position gatherings was usually strict, while processions of the governing Awami
 ague were unmolested. Police and the opposition blamed each other for frequent
 violent clashes as the ban was enforced.
 The Constitution provides for the right of every citizen to form associations, sub-
 ject to-"reasonable restrictions" in the interest of morality or public order, and in
 general the Government respects this right. In practice, individuals are free to join
 private groups, but a local magistrate must approve public meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Islam as the state religion
 but also stipulates the right to practice the religion of one's choice, and the Govern-
 ment respects this provision in practice. Approximately 88 percent of the 124 million'
 population is Muslim. Some members of the Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist minori-
 ties continue to perceive and experience discrimination toward them from the major-
 ity community (see Section 5).
 The law permits citizens to proselytize. However, strong social resistance to con-
 version from Islam means that many of the missionary efforts by non-Muslims are
 aimed at Hindus and tribal groups. The Government allows various religions to es-
 tablish places of worship, train clergy, travel for religious -purposes, and maintain
 links with coreligionists abroad. Foreign, missionaries may work in Bangladesh, but
 their right to proselytize is not protected by the Constitution, and some missionaries
 face problems in obtaining visas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are able to move freely within the country. Travel by foreign-
 ers is restricted in the CHT, some other border areas, and in the military canton-
 ments. Citizens are generally free to travel abroad and emigrate. The right of repa-
 triation is generally observed.
 Approximately 250,000 Rohingyas (Muslims from Burma's Arakan State) crossed
 into, southeastern Bangladesh in late 1991 and 1992 fleeing repression. Since 1992
 approximately 238,000Rohingyas have voluntarily repatriated to Burma leaving ap-
 proximately 21,000 in two camps in Bangladesh. Following the expiration of its own
 self-imposed August 15 deadline, Burmablocked further repatriation, but few of the
 remaining Rohingyas have appeared willing to repatriate voluntarily. The UNHCR
 has encouraged Bangladesh to allow the remaining Rohingas to settle locally, but
 the Government has responded repeatedly that all the  ohinyas must eventually
 return to Burma. Severs thousand more Rohingyas arrived during the year. Esti-
 mates of their number vary from 5,000 to 18,000, and most are thought to be living
 in villages-and town in the southeast.
 During the year, incidents of physical abuse and other mistreatment of individ-
 uals were repedly prtrated bypoic and other refugees. In December locally
 hired workers with M~decines Sans Frontieres-Holland tF-H ) were fired for beat-
 ing refugees. Police abuse was a concern during the- forced repatriation in August.
 Abuse of refugees by other refugees in the camps is also a problem. With only
 21,000 refugees remaining from an original number of 250,000, some of the more
 difficult and criminal cases are concentrated in this residual population. To ensure
 that efforts at voluntary repatriation fail, some refugees intimidate and be at other
 refugees in the camps to stop them from cooperating with UNHCR or government
 officials. Intimidation by the militant refugee elements also included lengthy food
 strikes during which pregnant and lactating women, and the malnourished children
 were prevented from receiving supplemental feedings. The lack of supplemental
 feedings appears to have resulted in an increase in the child mortality rates in the
 camps.
 There are about 238,000 Bihari Muslims living in camps at various places around
 the country. They have remained in Bangladesh since 1971 awaiting settlement in
 Pakistan. B r s are non-Bengali Muslims who emigrated to Bangladesh during
 the 1947 partition. Most supported Pakistan during the independence war in 1971.
 They later declined to accept Bangladesh citizenship and asked to be repatriatedto
 Pakistan. The Pakistan government historically has been reluctant to accept the
 Biharis. In December a rresentative organization for the Biharis announced that
 the Pakistan government was willing to begin repatriating 5,000 stranded Paki-
 stanis from Bangladesh in the next year.
 Since March, in five separate phases, 26,063 Chakma tribals have returned to
 Bangladesh from refugee camps in the neighboring Indian state of Tripura. The re-
 patrtion is the result of an agreement between the Government and tribal leaders
 to repatriate those who had fled the internecine violence of tribals and Bengali set-
 tlers in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The sixth phase, which started in December, is
 to go until January 1998 and expected to result in the return of 7,505 more tribals
 (see Section 5).
 Bangladesh is not a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Government generally cooperates with
 
 
 1622
 the UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The law
 does not provide for first asylum or resettlement of asylum seekers. However, in
 practice the Government does grant temporary asylum to individual asylum seekers
 whom the UNHCR has interviewed and recognized as refugees, on a case-by-case
 basis. At the request of the UNHCR, the Government has allowed about 200 asylum
 seekers, mostly from Somalia and Iran, to remain in Bangladesh for several years
 until they can arrange their resettlement in a third country. In the case of the
 Rohingya arrivals and attempted arrivals in 1996 and 1997, the Government effec-
 tivelydenied first asylum by categorizing them as illegal economic migrants, deny-
 ing the UNHCR official access to those that did successfully enter Banglades,
 jailing many of them, and turning back as many as possible at the border. Non-
 governmental organizations and journalists said that the new arrivals had fled var-
 ious hardships and mistreatment, including forced labor.
 In July the Government forcibly sent approximately 400 Rohingya refugees back
 to Burma, including 67 children sent back without their parents. This was in viola-
 tion of its agreement with UNHCR and Burma to adhere to strict voluntariness in
 the repatriation program. These refugees had been cleared by the Burmese Govern-
 ment as Burmese nationals. However, the individuals were not willing at that time
 to return to Burma. Some of the refugees indicated they feared persecution in
 Burma. The Bangladesh Government apparently was anxious to meet the August
 deadline that the 1Burmese Government had set or repatriations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bangladesh is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which elections by secret
 ballot are held on the basis of universal suffrage. Members of Parliament are elected
 at least every 5 years. The Parliament has 300 elected members, with 30 additional
 seats reserved for women, who are in turn elected by Parliament.
 Bangladesh last held national elections in June 1996, after which the Awami
 League took office. That election was held under a neutral caretaker government.
 Domestic and international observers deemed it to be generally free and fair, and
 high voter turnout of 75 percent set new records for the country. In June a by-elec-
 tion was held in Manikganj, and also was judged generally free and fair. Neverthe-
 less, elections in Bangladesh are often marred by violence, intimidation of voters,
 and vote-rigging. The Government and activists of the major political parties fre-
 quently engage in violence and harassment against political opponents, practices
 that intensify in the period prior to elections. Thirty people were reported killed
 during the course of nationwide local government elections in December. Election
 officials noted that this death toll was less than in previous similar elections. Inde-
 pendent groups monitoring the elections described the polls as substantially free
 and fair, although they identified many instances of violence or malpractice, includ-
 ing some by election officials. Political activists, at the local and national levels, also
 reportedly engage in extortion from businesses and individuals. In the Maghbazar
 area of Dhaka, student political activists reportedly extort money from local shop
 owners and businessmen.
 In addition to the 30 parliamentary seats reserved for women (whose occupants
 are chosen by Parliament), women are free to contest any seat in Parliament. Seven
 women were elected in their own right in the 1996 national elections. Seats are not
 specifically reserved for other minority groups, such as tribal people. However, tribal
 people have some parliamentary representation; 8 members from minority groups
 won seats in the last elections.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Humnan Rights
 The Government generally permits human rights groups to conduct their activi-
 ties. In 1997 such groups publlshed reports, held press conferences, and issued ap-
 peals to the Government with regard to specific cases. However, the Government
 continues to refuse to register the Bangladesh Section of Amnesty International
 (AD. Since 1990 the Al Section has applied several times for registration under the
 Societies Regstration Act. Without this registration, a voluntary organization can-
 not receive funding from abroad. Observers attribute the situation to resentment of
 criticism of its human rights record by Amnesty International.
 The Government is sensitive to international opinion regarding human rights is-
 sues. It has been open to dialog with international organizations and foreign diplo-
 matic missions regarding issues such as detention of opposition leaders and prob-
 lems of trafficking in women and children.
 The Government has put pressure on individual human rights advocates. Father
 Richard Timm, an American Catholic priest and human rights advocate who has
 
 
 1623
 worked in Bangladesh for over 40 years, has faced long delays in obtaining reentry
 visas. At years end, Father Timm was still in Bangladesh on a 6 month visa. Other
 missionaries who advocate human rights have faced similar problems in the past.
 Human rights organizations report that the Government sometimes puts pressure
 on them, usually in the form of harassment by government intelligence agencies,
 and threats from activists of the ruling party (see Section .f.). No major incidents
 of attacks on NGO workers or human rghts activists were reported during the year.
 In past years representatives of local human rights groups have at times been phys-
 icaly attacked by religious extremists, who considered their activities un-Islamic.
 The Government has failed to bring to justice those who engaged in such violence.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "all citizens are equal before the law and are entitled
 to equal protection by the law." In practice, the Government does not strongly en-
 force laws aimed at eliminating discrimination. In this context, women children, mi-
 nority groups, and the disabled often confront social and economic disadvantages.
 Women.-Violence against women is difficult to quantify because of unreliable sta-
 tistics, but wife beating appears to be widespread. A growing awareness of the prob-
 lem is fostered by the Government, media, and by women's rights organizations.
 Much of the violence against women is related to disputes over dowries. According
 to one human rights group, there were 68 dowry related killings through September.
 Human rights groups and press reports indicate that incidents of vigilantism
 against women-sometimes led by religious leaders-are common occurrences, par-
 ticularly in rural areas. These include humiliating, painful punishments, such as
 the whipping of women accused of moral offenses. For example, in July in a village
 in Sylhet district, local leaders reportedly whipped an unmarried 16-year-old girl
 and her parents because the girl was pregnant. Few perpetrators of such
 extrajudicial punishments are prosecuted. Other examples of extrajudicial action
 against women include an incident in August at the Golachipa police station. Police
 arrested a woman and her husband based on charges filed by the woman's former
 husband. The police allegedly brought the couple in front of the station, and before
 a crowd of hundreds, stripped them and forced the wife to have oral sex with her
 husband. The police then reportedly beat the couple. A few days after the incident,
 the couple was granted bail by the courts. The police warned the couple not to file
 any complaints and local authorities have taken no action to punish the police. In
 September a 14-year-old Shapna Begum was reportedly beaten to death when her
 elder brother and sister caught her having an affair. In October newspapers re-
 ported three Bangladesh Rifles soldiers in Dinajpur detained a women as a sus-
 pected smuggler. They raped her and left her on the street unconscious.
 The law prohibits rape and physical spousal abuse, but it makes no specific provi-
 sion for spousal rape as a crime. The Government has enacted laws specifically pro-
 hibiting certain forms of discrimination against women, including the Anti-Dowry
 Prohibition Act of 1980, the Cruelty to Women Law of 1983, and the Women Repres-
 sion Law of 1995. Enforcement of these laws is weak, however, especially in rural
 areas, and the Government seldom prosecutes those cases that are filed. However,
 in 1996 the Government accepted a suit against the State by a women's activist
 group in connection with the 1995 rape and murder of Yasmeen, a 14-year-old girl,
 by police officers; in August 3 police officers were convicted of the murder and sen-
 tenced to death (see Section L.a.).
 There is extensive trafficking of women and children for prostitution, within Ban-
 gladesh and to other countries in Asia. The number of women trafficked is un-
 known; human rights monitors estimate that several thousand women and children
 are victims of trafficking every year (see Section 5). While the law provides severe
 penalties for trafficking, few perpetrators are ever punished. Human rights groups
 reported approximately 50 persons were prosecuted for trafficking in 1997. Exact
 numbers are difficult to obtain as charges against trafficking are usually for lesser
 crimes, such as crossing borders without proper documents. Human rights groups
 attribute this to lack of concern on the part of some local authorities regarding en-
 forcement of trafficking laws (see Section 6.c.).
 Women remain in a subordinate position in society. The Government has not
 acted effectively to protect their basic freedoms. Approximately 25 percent of women
 are literate, compared with 35 to 40 percent of the general population. In recent
 years, female school enrollment has improved. Approximately 50 percent of primary
 and secondary school students are female. Women are often unaware of their rights,
 because of continued high illiteracy rates among adults and unequal educational op-
 portunities. Strong social stigmas and lack of economic means to obtain legal assist-
 ance frequently keep women from seeking redress in the courts.
 
 
 1624
 According to the 1961 Muslim Family Ordinance, female heirs receive less inherit-
 ance than male heirs, and-wives are more restricted in divorce rights. Men are per-
 mitted to have up to four wives, although this right is rarely exercised. Laws pro-
 vide some protection for women against arbitrary divorce and the taking of addi-
 tional wives by husbands without the first wife's consent, but the protections gen-
 erally apply only to registered marriages. Marriages in the countryside are often not
 registered because of ignorance of the law.
 While employment opportunities -have -been stronger for women than for men in
 the past few years,-this is to a large extent due to the growth of the garment indus-
 -try, in which female workers are prevalent. Programs-extending credit to large num-
 bers- of rural women-have also contributed to- greater economic power for them. How-
 ever, women still occupy only a small fraction of other .wage-earning jobs, and hold
 fewer, than 5'percent of government jobs. The Government's policy to include more
 women-in government jobs has had limited effect.
 Children.-The Government undertakes programs in the areas of primary edu-
 cation, health, and nutrition. The Government made universal primary education
 between the ages of 6 and 10 years mandatory in 1991 but stated that it could not
 fully implement the law" because of a lack of resources. The Government has also
 iitiated programs that offer incentives for female children between the ages of 12
 and 16 to remain in school. According to Education Ministry figures, approximately
 -86 percent of the-children between the ages of 5 and 10 years are enrolled in school,
 including 84 percent of girls.
 Because of widespread poverty, many children are compelled to work at a very
 young age. This-results in abuse of children, mainly through mistreatment by em-
 ployers during domestic service, other labor servitude, and prostitution; this labor-
 related child abuse occurs commonly -at. all. levels of society- and throughout the
 country (see Section 6.d.).
 Reports from human rights monitors indicate that child.abandonment, kidnaping,
 'and trafficking for labor bondage and prostitution continue to be serious and wide-
 spread. problems. The United Nations Childrens'Fund (UNICEF) has estimated that
 there are about -10,0O child prostitutes in Bangladesh. Other estimates have been
 as high as 29,000. The law does not allow-anyone under 18 years of age to engage
 in prostitution and stipulates a maximunr sentence of life imprisonment for persons
 found guilty of forcing a child into prostitution. -However, procurers of minors are
 rarely prosecuted. Prostitution is legal for those over the age of 18 with government
 certilication, but this minimum-age requirement is commonly ignored by authorities.
 There are large numbers of child prostitutes in government-sanctioned brothels.
 There is extensive trafficking in both women and children, primarily to the Mid-
 dle East, India, Pakistan, and Souheast Asia, and also witi the country. The
 trade, which mainly is for purposes of prostitution and labor servitude, is difficult
 to quantify. Press reports and evidence from human rights monitors indicate that
 it is widespread. The connivance of officials at various levels allows the trade to
 function. Human rights monitors report that police and local government officials
 often either ignore trafficking of children and women for prostitution, or actually
 profit from it. Enforcement of laws against it is hampered by poor records and easy
 access to forged identity documents. Most trafficked persons are lured by promises
 of good jobs or marriage. The Government has expressed concern about the problem
 andhas worke     with U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations to seek
 ways to combat it. Awareness of the issue is increasing, and it receives frequent
 press coverage.
 People With Disabiities.-The aws provide for equal treatment and freedom from
 discrimination for the disabled, but they face social and economic discrimination.
 The Government has not enacted specific legislation or otherwise mandated acces-
 sibility for the disabled. There are not adequate facilities for treating the mentally
 ill or the retarded. Unless a family has money to provide personalized service or to
 send the mentally disabled overseas, a mentally ill person will find little treatment
 in the country.
 Indigenous People.-Tribal people have had a margal ability to influence deci-
 sions concerning the  se of their lands. Until 1985, the Government regularly par-
 celed out land   the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) to Bengali settlers. This led to
 the displacement of many tribal groups such as the Chakmas and Marinas.
 The Shanti Bahini, a tribal insurgency group, had waged a low-level conflict in
 the CHT since the early 1970's. The violence was to deter nontribal Bengali settlers
 who sought to exploit the Tracts' fertile and sparsely populated land. Government
 settlement programs increased the number of Bengali inhabitants in the CHT from
 3 percent of the region's total population in 1947 to approximately 50 percent in
 1997.
 
 
 1625
 During the periods of violence, all those who were involved-indigenous tribes,
 settlers, and security forces-accused each other of human rights violations. The
 specific incidents have been difficult to verify because the government travel restric-
 tions, tight security, difficult terrain, and unsafe conditions created by the insur-
 gency limited access to the area.
 In 1994 the Government and the Shanti Bahini agreed to a cease-fire, which was
 extended at regular intervals. Discussions began under the recently elected Awami
 League Government to find a permanent settlement to the conffict.
 On December 2, after several rounds of discussions, the Government signed a
 peae agremeat with the representatives of the Shanti Bahini. The terms of the
 pact include a strong Regional Council (RC), consisting of mostly tribal representa-
 tives; reduction of the nilitary presene in the CHT region; and a substantial com-
 pensation package for displaced tribal families. The Regional Council is to be the
 primy governing body of the Hill Tracts region. It is to consist of 21 members,
 15 of them tribal. The chairman is also to be a tribal. The Regional Council is to
 have a brad range of responsibilities, including control of local administration, elec-
 tions, law and order activties, taxes, and licensing, and must be consulted when the
 Government institutes any laws or amendments related to the CHT. The agreement
 is to lead to the gradual closing of all army and Bangladesh Rifles camps, except
 the larger, permanent cantonments. For compensation, the tribal families returning
 from refugee camps in the neighboring Indian state of Tripura are to receive ap-
 proximately $1,100 (50,000 taka), bank loans are to be written off, and each landless
 tribal family is to receive 2 acres of land.
 In conjunction with the peace agreement discussions, repatriation of tribal refu-
 gees from the neighboring Indian state of Tripura began in March. In the five
 phases of repatriation completed since March, 26,063 tribals have returned. All
 sides have complained of some problems in the repatriation, but no complaints have
 been significant enough to halt the process. With the signing of the peace agree-
 ment, the Shanti Bahini has been more supportive of the repatriation. As part of
 the agreement the Shanti Bahini has begun turning its weapons into the Govern-
 ment.
 Tribal people in other areas have reported similar problems of loss of land to Ben-
 gal Muslims through questionable legal practices and other means. The Garos, who
 live in the Madhapur forest region in north central Bangladesh, continue to face
 problems in maintaining their cultural traditions and livelihoods in the face of refor-
 estation projects. Human rights monitors in the region claim that the Garos are
 being harassed and intimidated into leaving their homes to make way for govern-
 ment-run, internationally financed economic development projects.
 The Government had indicated in 1995 that it would establish a national park
 of 400 acres in the Mymensingh district. Part of that land would be taken from the
 Garo tribals. Action is still pending on that proposal. The Government has not ruled
 out moving the tribals from the land.
 Religious Minorities.-Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists make up an estimated
 10 percent of the population. Although the Government is secular, religion exerts
 a powerful influence on politics. The Government is sensitive to the Muslim con-
 sciousness of the majority of its citizens. However, the Jamaat-E-Islami, the coun-
 try's largest Islamic political party, went from 18 seats in Parliament after the 1991
 elections, to 3 in the 1996 elections.
 Islamic extremists have occasionally attacked women, religious minorities, and de-
 velopment workers. The Government has sometimes failed to denounce, investigate,
 and prosecute perpetrators of these attacks. Attacks were made on Hindu temples
 in Choumuham, Tangail, and Patuakhali during the time of Durga Puja in October.
 Local political party activists allegedly attacked the temples and puja (worship) or-
 ganizers for failing to pay extortion fees. Fifteen people were injured and religious
 scriptures were desecrated during the attacks. In all, 33 people were injured in at-
 tacks around the country during the Durga Puja festivals.
 Religious minorities are in practice disadvantaged in such areas as access to gov-
 ernment jobs and political office. Selection board in the government services are
 often without minority group representation.
 Property ownership, particularly among Hindus, has been a contentious issue
 since independence in 1971, when many Hindus lost landholdings because of anti-
 Hindu discrimination in the application of the law. Prior to its 1996 election victory,
 the Awami League promised to repeal the Vested Property Act, the law used to de-
 prive Hindus of their property. However, the Government has so far taken no ac-
 tion. There have been in past years cases of violence directed against religious mi-
 nority communities that have also resulted in the loss of property. Such intercom-
 munal violence has caused some members of religious minority groups to depart the
 country.
 
 
 1626
 Section 6. Worker rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-The Constitution provides for the right to join unions
 and-with government approval-the right to form a union. Approximately 1.6 mil-
 lion members of the country's total work force of about 45 to 50 million workers be-
 long to unions. Only about 3 million workers are involved in the formal industrial
 sector. There is a large unreported informal sector, for which no reliable labor sta-
 tistics exist.
 For a union to obtain and maintain its registration, 30 percent employee partici-
 pation in the workplace is required. Moreover, would-be unionists are technically
 orbidden to engage in many labor "activities" prior to registration. Labor activists
 have prtested that this requirement severely restricts workers' freedom to organize.
 With the exception of workers in the railway, postal, telegraph and telephone de-
 partments, government civil servants are forbidden to join unions. This ban also ap-
 plies to security-related government employees such as members of the military and
 police. Civil servants forbidden to join unions, such as teachers and nurses, have
 formed associations that perform functions similar to labor unions, i.e., providing for
 members' welfare, offering legal services, and airing grievances. Collective bargain-
 ing, however, is prohibited. Some workers have formed unregistered unions, particu-
 lariy university employees and workers in the construction and transport (both pub-
 lic and private) industries.
 Ten to 15 percent of approximately 4,200 labor unions are affiliated with 23 offi-
 cially registered Nationalnade Union (NTU) centers (there are ase several unreg-
 istered NTU's). Thereqre no legal restrictions on political activities by labor unions,
 although, the calin of nationwide general strikes or transportation blockades by
 unions is onsiderea criminal rather than a political act and thus forbidden.
 While unions are not part of the government structure, they are hily politicized.
 Virtually all the NTU centers are affiliated with political parties, including one with
 the ruling Awami League. Some unions are militant and engage in intimidation and
 fvandaism. llegal blockades of public-transportation rutes by strikers occurred fre-
 quently euring the year. Pitched battlesh between members of rival labor unions
 occur regularly. Fighting often is over the control of rackets or extortion payoffs and
 typically involves knives, guns, and homemade bombs.
 Workers are eligible for membership on their unions' executive staff, the size of
 which is set by law in proportion to the number of union members. Registration of
 a union may only be canceled by the Registrar of Trade Unions with the concur-
 rence of the Labor Court, but no such actions were known to have been taken in
 1997. Several cases were filed, invariably by employers claiming a union's member-
 ship had fallen below the requisite levelbut, because of a backlog and other admin-
 istrative problems, these cases have- not come-under review.
 The right to strike is not specifically recognized in the law, but strikes are a com-
 mon form of protest. There were 4Jfull-day, and 2 half-day general strikes during
 1997. While such strikes were greatly-reduced compared with 1996, politically moti-
 vated strikes increased during the last months of the year. A nationwide industrial
 strike was called onJuly 30 by a confederation of 17. national-level labor organiza-
 tions. The demands included establishing a national minimum monthly wage of $68
 (3,000 taka), and increased investment in state-owned industries. Other prominent
 strikes, primarily over pay, included those by inland water transport employees and
 workers at Chittagong port, the country's major harbor. Some employees organized
 in rofessional associations or unregistered unions also went on strike during 1997.
 Umversity teachers struck for short periods from time to time over the continuing
 problem of campus violence.
 General strikes are standard tools of political opposition groups and are used to
 pressure the Government to meet political demands. Such strikes were greatly re-
 duced compared with 1996, but 2 full-day general strikes and 2 half-day strikes for
 political reasons had occurred by the end of August. Wildcat strikes are illegal but
 occur frequently, with varying government responses. Wildcat strikes in the trans-
 portation sector are particularly common.
 The Essential Services Ordinance permits the Government to bar strikes for 3
 months in any sector that it declares essential. This ban, generally obeyed, has so
 far been applied to national airline pilots, water supply workers, shipping operations
 employees, and electricity supply workers. The bans tend to be renewed every 3
 months. The Government is empowered to prohibit a strike or lockout at any time
 before or after the strike or lockout begins and to refer the dispute to the labor
 court. Mechanisms for conciliation, arbitration, and labor court dispute resolution
 were established under the Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969. Workers have
 the right to strike in the event of a failure to settle. If a strike lasts 30 days or
 longer, the Government may prohibit the strike and refer the dispute  the Labor
 Court for adjudication. This has not happened since 1993.
 
 
 1627
 There are provisions in the Industrial Relations Ordinance for the immunity of
 registered unions or union officers from civil liability. Enforcement of these provi-
 sions is uneven. In the case of illegal work actions, such as transportation block-
 ades, police have arrested union members under the Special Powers Act or regular
 criminal codes.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor organizations, and
 unions and federations maintain a variety of such links. Trade unionists are re-
 quired to obtain government clearance to travel to International Labor Organization
 (ILO) meetings, but no clearances were reported denied in 1997.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is legal
 only for private sector workers on condition that the workers are represented by
 unions legally registered as coliective bargaining agents by the Registrar of Trade
 Unions. Collective bargaining occurs on occasion in large private enterprises such
 as pharmaceuticals or jute and textiles, but with unemployment in the 30 percent
 range, workers' concerns over job security often outweigh wage and other issues.
 Callective bargaining generally does not occur in small private enterprises.
 Public setor workers' ay evels and other benefits are recommended by the Na-
 tional Pay and Wages Commission. The Commission's recommendations are binding
 and may not be disputed except on the issue of implementation.
 Under the Industrial Relations Ordinance, there is considerable leeway for dis-
 crimination against union members and organizers by employers. For example, the
 Ordinance allows arbitrary transfer of warkers suspected of union activities or ter-
 mination with payment of mandatory severance benefits (2 weeks' salary). Com-
 plaints that employers routinely engage in antiunion discrimination and harass-
 ment, including physical attack, are particularly common in the garment industry.
 In practice, private sector employers, sometimes working in collaboration with local
 police, tend to discourage any union activity. The Registrar of Trade Unions rules
 on discrimination complaints. In a number of cases the Labor Court has ordered the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. However, the Labor Court's over-
 all effectiveness is hampered by a serious case backlog, and there have also been
 allegations that some of its deliberations have been corrupted by employers.
 The law prohibits professional and industry-based unions in the two export proc-
 essing zones (EPZ's). A small number of warkers in the EPZ's have skirted prohibi-
 tions on forming unions by setting up associations. The BNP government stated in
 1992 that labor law restrictions on freedom of association and formation of unions
 in the EPZ's would be lifted by 1997. So far, however, this has not been done. In
 the burgeoning garment industry, there have been numerous complaints of workers
 being harassed and fired in some factories for trying to organize unions. In addition
 to the prohibition on unions, no collective bargaining takes place in the EPZ's. About
 48,000 persons are employed in EPZ's, primarily in the textile and apparel, elec-
 tronics component, and leather industries.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, including that performed by children. The Factories Act and
 Shops and Establishment Act, both passed in 1965, set up inspection mechanisms
 to enforce laws against forced labor. These laws are not rigorously enforced, partly
 because resources for enforcement are few. There is no large-scale bonded labor.
 However, some domestic servants, including many children, work in conditions that
 resemble servitude and may suffer physical abuse, sometimes resulting in death.
 There is extensive trafficking in toth women and children, primarily to the Mid-
 dle East, India, Pakistan, and Southeast Asia, and also within Bangladesh. The
 trade, which mainly is for purposes of prostitution and labor servitude, is difficult
 to quantify. The connivance of officials at various levels allows the trade to function.
 Human rights monitors report that police and local government officials often either
 inore trafficking of children and women for prostitution, or actually profit from it.
 nforcement of laws against it is hampered by poor records and easy access to
 forged identity documents. Most trafficked persons are lured by promises of good
 jobs or marriage. The Government has expressed concern about the problem and
 has worked wit U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations to seek ways to
 combat it. Awareness of the issue is increasing, and it receives frequent press cov-
 erage.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits labor by children, including forced or bonded labor. However, such prac-
 tices occur (see Section 6.c.). The Factories Act of 1965 bars children under the age
 of 14 from working in factories. This law also stipulates that young workers (chil-
 dren and adolescents) are only allowed to work a maximum 5-hour day and only
 between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
 Enforcement of these rules is inadequate. Because of widespread poverty, many
 children begin to work at a very young age. According to a 1996 labor force survey
 
 
 1628
 by the Government, the country has 6.3 million working children between the ages
 of 5 and 14 years, the great majority of whom performed unpaid labor for their fani-
 lies, especially in agricultural areas. UNICEF and ILO surveys indicate that, of chil-
 dren 6 to 17 years of age, 21 percent of boys and 4 percent of girls are working in
 paid employment. Children are commonly seen driving rickshaws, breaking bricks
 at construction sites, carrying fruit, vegetables, and dry goods for shoppers at mar-
 kets, and working at tea stalls. They are found as peelers, packers, and beach-
 combers in the shrimp industry. Also, children work side by side with other family
 members in small-scale and subsistence agriculture. Children routinely perform do-
 mestic work. Cases of children being physically abused and occasionally killed by
 heads of households where they work are reported in the press. Under the law,
 every child must attend school through the fifth grade, or to age 10 years. However,
 the Government continues to maintain that it does not yet have the resources to
 implement this law effectively.
 Protracted negotiations led to the July 1995 signing of a memorandum of under-
 standing (MOU) between the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters
 Association (BGMEA), UNICEF, and the ILO to eliminate child labor in the export
 Sarment sector. Under the MOU, the garment sector was to become child labor free
 yOctober 31, 1996, with former child laborers enrolled in UNICEF-run schools,
 and follow-up inspections of factories by ILO inspection teams. The children receive
 a small monthiy stipend while attending school to help replace their lost income.
 Under the MOU, more than 8,000 former child laborers were enrolled in over 300
 UNICEF schools during 1997. Since October 1996, follow-up inspection teams have
 consistently found more than 80 percent of factories child labor free. Violations of
 the ban on child labor were mimimal and declining. According to ILO inspectors,
 most violating factories had one or two laborers, and only about 1 percent of the
 factories more than this number. The almost 3,000 new child laborers who had been
 found by inspection teams by the end of November were subsequently enrolled in
 MOU schools. The BGMEA imposed some fines on members who were found to be
 violating the MOU, although an arbitration committee that imposed these fines
 functioned slowly. As of September 1, BGMEA began to assess violating factories
 charges equal to the cost of providing stipends and schooling to newly discovered
 laborers, and the ILO credited this development with causing a significant reduction
 in the violations. The number of children working in nonexport, or nonfactory gar-
 ment production, is unknown.
 The law allows prostitution for those over the age of 18 with government certifi-
 cation. The law provides a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for persons
 found guilty of forcing a child into prostitution. However, minimum age require-
 ments are commonly ignored by authorities, abetted by lax age documentation. Pro-
 curers of minors are rarely prosecuted. As a result, there are large numbers of child
 prostitutes in government-sanctioned brothels. Human rights groups have estimated
 there may be over 8,000 child prostitutes, most of them coerced, in the government-
 sanctioned brothels.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Instead,
 the wage commission, which convenes every several years, sets wages and benefits
 industry by industry. In most cases, private sector employers ignore this wage struc-
 ture. Organized jute and textile workers have called strikes in an attempt to win
 wageparity for their industry's private sector workers. The average monthly wage
 is sufficient to provide an individual with a minimal standard of living but is not
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The law sets a standard 48-hour workweek with 1 day off mandated. A 60-hour
 workweek, inclusive of a maximum 12 hours of overtime, is allowed. The law is
 poorly enforced in industries such as hosiery and ready-made garments.
 The Factories Act of 1965 nominally sets occupational health and safety stand-
 ards. The law is comprehensive but appears to be largely ignored by employers.
 Workers may resort to legal action for enforcement of the laws provisions, but few
 cases are actually prosecuted. Enforcement by the Labor Ministry's industrial in-
 spectors is weak. Due to high unemployment and inadequate enforcement of the
 laws, workers demanding correction of dangerous working conditions or refusing to
 participate in perceived dangerous activities risk losing their jobs.
