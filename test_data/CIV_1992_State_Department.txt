 COTE D'IVOLRE
 Power in Cote d'Ivoire is concentrated in President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the
 country's leader since independence, and in the political party he founded, the
 Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI). Genuine reforms have resulted in multiple
 nnlit,'nl nart.ipa nnd onnnqitjnn 'rouns as well as a vivorous free press, but
 
 
 Houphouet-Boigny and the PDCI, winners of the 1990 elections, continue to domi-
 nate all levels of government.
 Cote d'Ivoire's security forces include the National Police (SURETE) and the Gen-
 darmerie, a branch of the armed forces with responsibility for general law enforce-
 ment. The Gendarmerie is the primary plice organization outside the cities and is
 under the Ministry of Defense. The totsl of uniformed services, which includes the
 military forces and the gendarmes (but not the police) is 16,000. Total military ex-
 penditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disar-
 mament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $130 million. However, as part
 of major efforts to reduce public sector spending, the Government has tried system-
 atically since 1990 to cut defense budgets. The armed forces traditionally have ac-
 cepted the primacy of civilian authority. Security forces were responsible for a num-
 ber of human rights abuses in 1992, including extrajudicial killing.
 During the 1980's, Cote d'Ivoire was squeezed by a heavy debtTburden and fallin1
 prices for its exports, principally cocoa, coffee, and tropical woods. Per capita annua
 income slipped in recent years from well over $1,000 to below $800. After reaching
 agreement with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on a stabilization
 program in 1991, the Government reduced its budget deficit, instituted changes in
 the tax and labor codes, and launched an ambitious program of privatization and
 administrative reform.
 Despite some positive developments, there continued to be serious human rights
 abuses. The presence of opposition groups and a vigorous and viglant free press
 continued to mprove both awareness and observance of human rights on a day-to-
 day basis. On the other hand, the security forces carried out extrajudicial killings
 of criminal suspects, beat and abused detainees, and arbitrarily arrested political
 opponents of the Government. Police arrested at least 146 supporters of various op-
 position parties, including Laurent Gbagbo, a major opposition figure, in the wake
 of a riot on February 18 which coincided with an officially sanctioned march. Al-
 though some of those arrested were set free after several days, 52 were held for 52
 days before being released. Fifty-nine persons (of whom only 20 admitted having
 participated in the march), including several prominent opposition leaders, were
 convicted of having been responsible or the damage that occurred as a result of the
 riot and sentenced to prison for sentences of 1 to 2 years. The conduct of the trial
 and subsequent appeal raised serious questions about the independence of the
 Ivorian judiciary. Those convicted benefited from an amnesty announced by Presi-
 dent Houphouet-Boigny in July.
 Abidjan has one of the highest levels of crime in the world; in response, security
 forces relaxed restrictions in 1992 on the use of deadly force against armed crimi-
 nals. There were credible allegations that suspects were killed after being arrested.
 Security forces sometimes use beatings to extract confessions or as punishment.
 Further, five journalists (representing two newspapers) were sentenced to prison
 terms of up to 3 years and had their newspapers shut down for insulting the Presi-
 dent (see Section i.e.). They too were released as part of the July amnesty.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings by government forces in 1992. Relaxed restrictions on the use of deadly force
 against armed criminals have led to allegations that perpetrators have been killed
 by security forces after being arrested.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of officially sanctioned abduction or dis-
 appearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Detainees, whether political opponents or criminal suspects, are sometimes beaten
 by the police in order to extract a confession or as punishment. Simone Gbagbo, wife
 of the Secretary General of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), and at least one other
 person were hospitalized as h result of beatings received after their arrest on Feb-
 ruary 18. Prisoners are often treated in a degrading or humiliating manner. Non-
 Ivorian Africans residing in Cote d'Ivoire (who represent a third of the total popu-
 lation) are routinely treated more roughly by police on arrest than are Ivorians.
 There were no instances in 1992 of officials being punished for mistreatment of de-
 tainees or prisoners.
 Sanitary conditions in prisons are abysmal and are responsible for a high death
 rate. Common problems include overcrowding, malnutrition, infectious disease, and
 infestation by vermin.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a
 public prosecutor may order the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without
 
 
 bringing charges. The Code dictates that longer detention must be ordered by a
 magistrate, who may authorize periods of up to 4 months, but who must also pro-
 vide the Minister of Justice a written justification for continued detention on a
 monthly basis. However, the law is often violated. Police have held persons for more
 than 48 hours without bringing charges. Defendants are not guaranteed the right
 to a judicial determination of the legality of their detention.
 In addition to at least 146 people arrested after the February 18 riot (see above),
 several hundred students were arrested after a series of demonstrations in early
 February. Some were detained for extended periods without trial. Approximately
 100 were tried, and many were given prison sentences ranging from 3 months to
 3 years. All those still in prison were released under the terms of an amnesty de-
 clared by the President in late July.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public 7W.-The modern judicial system is headed by a Su-
 preme Court and includes a Court of Appeals and lower courts. The judiciary is
 theoretically independent of the executive branch in ordinary criminal cases. In
 practice, as well as under the Constitution's separation of powers provisions, the ju-
 diciary follows the lead of the executive in cases concerning perceived national secu-
 rity or political issues. Fifty-nine opposition supporters were convicted of having
 been responsible for the property damage that occurred when an opposition march
 became a riot on February 18. The prosecution failed to prove that 39 of those con-
 victed had taken part in the march. The lack of evidence linking the organizers of
 the march to the damage made their conviction appear to be based on political
 grounds.
 There is not a clear separation between the judicial and executive branches of
 government. The President of the Abidjan Court of Appeals was removed from the
 Court after having been prevented from rendering a decision on the appeal of the
 verdict which jailed opposition leaders after the February 18 march. There were also
 credible reports that the courts gave lenient treatment to individuals with personal
 connections to the Government.
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a public trial, although key evidence is some-
 times given in camera. Defendants have the right to be present at their trials, and
 their innocence is presumed. Those convicted have the right of a ppeal, though in
 practice, verdicts are rarely overturned. Defendants accused of felonies or capital
 crimes have the right to legal counsel, and the judicial system provides for court-
 appointed attorneys for indigent defendants. In practice, many defendants cannot
 afford private counsel, and court-appointed attorneys are not readily available.
 In rural areas, justice is often administered at the village level through traditional
 institutions which handle domestic disputes, minor land questions, and family law.
 Dispute resolution is by extended debate, with no known instances of resort to phys-
 ical punishment. These traditional courts are being increasingly superseded by the
 formal judicial system. Civilians are not tried by military courts. Although there are
 no appellate courts within the military justice system, persons convicted by a mili-
 tary tribunal may petition the Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and
 order a retrial.
 There were no credible reports of political prisoners being held after the Presi-
 dent's July amnesty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In Cote
 d'Ivoire's multiparty political system, citizens are free to join any political party or
 none at all. However, public officials and employees of state-owned corporations are
 subjected to pressure to become members of the PDCI. Party membership applica-
 tions are sometimes passed to employees by their supervisors, and those who fail
 to sign up are believed to suffer in terms of promotion.
 The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative mag-
 istrate may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is reason
 to believe that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official
 must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in the search and
 is required to have witnesses to the search, which may not take place between the
 hours of 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. The police sometimes use a general search warrant with-
 out a name or address. In addition, the police have entered homes of non-Ivorian
 Africans (or rounded them up on the streets), taken them to local police stations,
 and extorted small amounts of money for alleged minor offenses.
 There are credible reports that the police have used informers at the University
 of Abidjan to provide data on dissident political activity. Security forces monitor
 some private telephone conversations, but the extent of the practice is unknown.
 There is no evidence that private correspondence is monitored.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Free expression is provided for in the Constitu-
 tion, but until 1990, this right was significantly limited in practice. In 1992 public
 criticism of government policies and even of the President was common. However,
 it is a crime, punishable by 3 months to 2 years in prison, to offend the President,
 the Prime Minister, foreign chiefs of state or government or their diplomatic rep-
 resentatives or to defame institutions of the state.
 The Government operates the radio and television networks and uses these media
 to promote its policies. Much of the news programming is devoted to coverage of the
 activities of the President, the Government, and the PDCI, but an increasing
 amount of coverage has been given to the political opposition. The Government an-
 nounced a plan in October to allow nongovernmental organizations to operate FM
 radio stations and television channels.
 The number of newspapers being published expanded significantly in 1991 to a
 total of more than 20. There are now three daily newspapers. Those with the widest
 circulation, Fraternite-Matin and Ivoire Soir, are government-run. In 1992 both
 newspapers ran stories critical of government policies and increased significantly
 their coverae of the political opposition. A third daily, La Voie, is an organ of the
 FPI, Cote d'voire's principal opposition party. Most of the weekly newspapers are
 either affiliated with opposition political parties or, even if unaffiliated, are critical
 of the Government. Foreign publications circulated freely.
 Although criticism of government policies is tolerated, insults or attacks on the
 honor of the country's highest officials are not. A press law enacted in late 1991 cre-
 ated a new commission to enforce laws against publishing defamatory material or
 material "undermining the credit of the nation." The law imposes stiff penalties, in-
 cluding the seizure of offending newspapers. Five Ivorian journalists served jail sen-
 tences for offending the President, and the two newspapers for which they worked
 had their activities suspended in 1992 under the terms of the law.
 Many prominent Ivorian scholars are active in opposition politics and have not
 suffered professionally. The Government insists, however, that teachers separate
 their political activity from their work in the classroom. There has been almost con-
 tinual turmoil on college campuses as a result of student demonstrations. Support-
 ers of a banned student group were allegedly barred from taking their high school
 final examination.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, but in practice, that freedom is restricted when the Govern-
 ment perceives a danper to public order. Although opposition parties believe that
 the Constitution permits private associations of any sort, the Government disagrees,
 and all organizations must register before commencing activities. There were no re-
 orts in 1992 of registration being denied, although this has occurred in the past.
 further, Ivorian law prohibits the formation of political parties along ethnic or reli-
 gious lines. The Federation of Ivorian Students (FESCI) was banned in 1991. FESCI
 has continued its activities in spite of the ban, and some of its members were de-
 tained (see Section 1. d.) as well as expelled from educational institutions.
 Permits are required for public meetings and are sometimes denied to the opposi-
 tion but never to the PDCI. Gatherings occasionally are prohibited to prevent the
 expression of controversial views in public forums. On February 19, the Government
 banned all outdoor public meetings "until further notice;" that ban remains in effect,
 and the Government used force to break up demonstrations. The ban appeared to
 be selectively enforced. For example, there was a Government-encouraged outdoor
 public gathering to greet the President on his return from Europe in June. However,
 uslims were prevented from gathering in an Abidjan mosque in November when
 they sought to form a national Islamic Council.
 An "antivandal" law passed by the National Assembly holds organizers of a march
 responsible if any of the participants engaged in violence. The law was condemned
 by all major opposition parties and by the Ivoirian Human Rights League (LIDHO)
 as being unduly vague and for imposing collective punishment for the crime of a
 few.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There are no known impediments to religious expression.
 There is no dominant religion, and no faith is officially favored by the Government.
 The open practice of religion is permitted, and there are no restrictions on religious
 ceremonies or teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government exercises minimal control over domestic travel. How-
 ever, there are numerous internal roadblocks at which persons are frequently har-
 assed, and small amounts of money are extorted for contrived or minor infractions.
 During the period between February and April, there were credible reports that
 
 
 69
 members of the banned student organization, FESCI, were singled out at roadblocks
 for harassment.
 Ivorians normally can travel abroad and emigrate freely, and they have the right
 of voluntary repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 Cote dIvoire s refugee and asylum practices are liberal. In 1990, 180,000 refugees
 from the Liberian civil war entered the country, many voluntarily returned to Libe-
 ria in 1992. While in Cote d'Ivoire, refugees normally receive 1-year renewable resi-
 dent visas for their first 5 years in the country, after which they may apply for per-
 manent residence. The Liberians have been a special case; the Government expects
 that they will go back to Liberia as soon as that country becomes normal. The Gov-
 ernment was actively involved in managing Liberian refugee relief, though most re-
 sources come from foreign and international donors. Out of concern that relief was
 acting as a magnet, the Government established a committee to review the case of
 each new arrival to determine whether the person should be accorded refugee sta-
 tus. Although the Government was reluctant to implement self-sufficiency activities
 that might encourage refugees to remain in Cote d'Ivoire, several were started for
 the benefit of refugees unlikely to leave the country.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control. Political exiles
 from a number of countries have found Cote d'Ivoire a hospitable safe haven as long
 as they do not engage in political activities directed against their home govern-
 ments.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right, although many in the ruling PDCI continue to block
 needed reforms and to engage in practices which do not encourage further democra-
 tization. Multiple parties were permitted in the 1990 presidential, legislative, and
 municipal elections whose results were generally accepted as legitimate, despite nu-
 merous flaws and fraud. Although under the Constitution only Ivorian citizens are
 entitled to vote, the electoral law, which is promulgated for each election, has in re-
 cent years extended voting rights to non-Ivorian Africans living in Cote d'Ivoire, who
 constitute approximately one-third of the country's population and are presumed to
 suppr the P DCI. This anomaly persists because only the President of the Republic
 and the President of the National Assembly have the standing to challenge the con-
 stitutionality of the electoral law, and neither has chosen to do so. There is a secret
 ballot.
 President Houphouet-Boigny, who has governed since independence in 1960, is
 both Head of State and President of the PDCI. An appointed Prime Minister, who
 serves at the pleasure of the President, controls day-to-day governmental affairs and
 economic policy. The PDCI holds 165 of the 175 seats in the National Assembly,
 which in practice is subordinate to the executive branch. Effectively, therefore
 President Houphouet-Boigny and his PDCI control all aspects of Ivorian political
 life.
 There were four municipal and legislative by-elections in 1992 in which the oppo-
 sition Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) challenged the PDCI candidate. In one municipal-
 ity, after the opposition candidate had won a clear victory, the Government canceled
 the election claiming that opposition supporters had intimidated some resident for-
 eigners desiring to vote.
 The Government arrested four opposition members of the National Assembly fol-
 lowing a demonstration on February 18 (see also Section I.e., d., and e.). One was
 released after a few days; one was acquitted following a trial; the other two, includ-
 ing opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo, were found guilty of being "cosponsors" of
 acts of violence and served 5  months of a 2-year sentence before being released
 under an amnesty law.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 An internal, independent human rights organization, the Ivorian League of
 Human Rights (LIDHO), was formed in 1987 and was recognized by the Govern-
 ment in July 1990. The League has actively investigated alleged violations of human
 rights and issued press releases and reports, some of which were critical of the Gov-
 ernment. The LIDHO and a major opposition party organized the February 18
 march, which turned into a riot and was followed by the arrest and conviction of
 the LIDHO president as well as several other prominent members. All were re-
 leased as a result of the July amnesty. In 1991 the Ivorian Association for the Pro-
 motion of Human Rights was established for the purpose of improving Ivorians'
 awareness of their basic rights.
 
 
 70
 The Government has been cooperative in the past towards international inquiries
 into its human rights practices. Although the Government has not responded pub-
 licly to appeals from Amnesty International and the International Labor Organiza-
 tion (ILO), it has subsequently taken some action to correct abuses.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sev, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sex or religion is against
 the law. Although French is the official language and the language of instruction
 in the schools, radio and television programs are broadcast in major national lan-
 guages. Social and economic mobility are not limited by policy or custom on the
 basis of ethnicity or religion, but there are pronounced inequalities based on sex,
 with males clearly playing the preponderant role.
 Some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable political and eco-
 nomic power. In rural areas, although tribal customs dictate that menial tasks are
 performed mostly by women, farm work by men is also common. There is also a pa-
 rental preference for educating boys rather than girls which is noticeable through-
 out the country but more pronounced in rural areas. Sexual harassment of female
 students by male teachers is commonplace. Government policy encourages full par-
 ticipation by women in social and economic life, but there is considerable informal
 resistance among employers to hiring women, who may be considered undependable
 by virtue of potential pregnancy.
 Clitoral excision, which is illegal in Cote d'Ivoire, is nevertheless practiced, par-
 ticularly among the rural population in the north and west. The operation is usually
 performed on young girls or at puberty as part of a rite of passage; it is generally
 done outside modern medical facilities and can be extremely painful and dangerous
 to health. The Government does not make strong efforts to prevent the practice, and
 social pressures are sufficiently strong that it persists, particularly in small villages,
 where the tribal chief is the primary decisionmaker. According to an independent
 expert in the field, the percentage of Ivorian women who have undergone genital
 mutilation (circumcision) may be as high as 60 percent. Excision is becoming less
 common as the population becomes better educated.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, is neither widely practiced nor
 tacitly condoned. However, representatives of women's organizations state that wife
 beating does occur and often leads to divorce. Doctors state that they rarely see the
 victims of such violence. A severe social stigma is attached to such violence; neigh-
 bors will often intervene in a domestic quarrel to protect a person who is the object
 of physical abuse. The courts and police view such domestic violence as a family
 problem unless serious bodily harm is inflicted, in which case criminal proceedings
 do take place. The Government has no clear-cut policy regarding spouse abuse be-
 yond the obvious strictures against violence in the Civil Code.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form unions under the
 Labor Code of 1964, but union membership is not mandatory. For almost 30 years,
 the government-sponsored labor confederation, the General Union of Workers of
 Cote d'Ivoire (UGTCI), dominated union activity except for the independent univer-
 sity teachers', secondary school teachers', and doctors' unions. In 1991 several for-
 merly UGTCI-affiliated unions, including those representing transport, media, cus-
 toms, and bank workers, broke away and became independent. In 1992 a total of
 11 formerly independent unions joined together to form the Federation of Autono-
 mous Trade Unions of Cote d'Ivoire (FESACI). A third labor federation, Dignite, has
 attracted few members. The leader of the UGTCI occupies a senior position in the
 PDCI hierarchy. The UGTCI is a relatively passive coordination mechanism rather
 than an active force for worker rights, although it has had some success in improv-
 ing working conditions and safety standards. The UGTCI represents approximately
 one-third to one-half of the organizable work force. Non-UGTCI unions tend to be
 more activist than those within the UGTCI structure and to be identified with oppo-
 sition causes.            "1
 In response to a complaint, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association in No-
 vember criticized the arrest of trade union activists; repressive measures taken
 against union members and leaders of Dignite; and government interference in in-
 ternal union affairs. The ILO Governing Body called on the Government to take
 "concrete" measures and proposed to consider setting up a Commission of Inquiry
 during its next examination of the case.
 The right to strike is provided by the Constitution and by statute. The ILO's Com-
 mittee of Experts in 1991, however, reiterated earlier observations that the Labor
 Code gives the President excessive power to submit an industrial dispute to compul-
 sory arbitration in order to bring an end to a strike. The Constitution requires a
 
 
 rotracted series of negotiations and a 6-day notification period before a strike may
 held, effectively maing legal strikes   cult to organize. Strikes are seldom au-
 thorized by the UGTCI; however, non-UGTCI unions freely strike. In 1992 fisher-
 men, transit workers, postal and telecommunications workers, and taxi drivers held
 strikes.
 The UGTCI, which is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity, formally prohibits its individual trade unions from forming or maintaining
 affiliations with other international professional organizations in their fields. Inde-
 pendent unions may freely affiliate with international bodies. Dignite is a member
 of the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code grants all
 Ivorians the right to join unions and to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining
 agreements are in effect in many major business enterprises and sectors of the civil
 service. In most cases in which wages are not established in negotiations between
 unions and employers, salaries are set by job category in the Ministry of Employ-
 ment and Civil Service. A law prohibiting antiunion discrimination is enforced by
 labor inspectors.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There have been no reports of
 forced labor, which is prohibited by law. However, the ILO's Committee of Experts
 in its annual report requested the Government to take steps to bring its laws on
 prison labor into conformity with the ILO conventions on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Wage for Employment of Children.-In most instances, the legal min-
 imum working age is 16, and the Ministry of Employment and Civil Service enforces
 this provision effectively in the civil service andin large multinational companies.
 However, children often work on family farms, and in cities some children routinely
 act as vendors in the informal sector. There are also reports of children working in
 what could be described as sweatshop conditions in small workshops. Many children
 leave the formal school system at an early age; primary education is mandatory but
 far from universally enforced, particularly in rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Cote d'Ivoire has an administratively deter-
 mined monthly wage rate which was last adjusted in January 1986. A slghtlyhigh-
 er rate applies to construction workers. The minimum wage is enforced only with
 respect to salaried workers employed by the Government or registered with Social
 Security. Minimum wages vary according to occupation, with the lowest insufficient
 to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The majority of
 Ivorians work in agriculture or the informal sector where the minimum wage does
 not apply.
 Through the Ministry of Employment and the Civil Service, the Government en-
 forces a comprehensive Labor Code governing the terms and conditions of service
 for wage earners and salaried workers and providing for occupational safety and
 health standards. Those employed in the modern sector are reasonably protected
 against unjust compensation, excessive hours, and capricious discharge from em-
 ployment. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. The law requires overtime pay-
 ment on a graduated scale for hours in excess of the standard.
 Government labor inspectors are empowered to order employers to improve sub-
 standard conditions and, if the employer fails to comply, fines can be levied by a
 labor court. In the large informal sector of the economy, however, involving both
 urban and rural workers, the Government's occupational health and safety regula-
 tions are enforced erratically at best.
