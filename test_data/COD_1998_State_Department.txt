 DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO
 Most of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) continued to be ruled
 by President Laurent Desire Kabila, whose Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
 Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) overthrew the authoritarian regime of Mobutu
 Sese Seko by armed force in 1997. The State continued to be highly centralized for-
 mally-although in practice the country's dilapidated transportation and commu-
 nications infrastructure impaired central Government control-and Kabila contin-
 ued to rule by decree, unconstrained by a Constitution or a legislature. Although
 the Government finished a draft Constitution in March, only portions of it had been
 published by year's end, and Kabila continued to ban political party activity. The
 judiciary continued to be subject to executive influence and corruption.
 By year's end, the Government had lost control of more than one-third of the
 country's territory to a rebel organization, the Congolese Rally for Democracy
 (RCD), dominated by members of the Tutsi ethnic minority. The rebellion started
 in early August, when Kabila tried to expel from the country Rwandan military
 forces that had helped him overthrow Mobutu, and upon which the Congolese Tutsis
 and the governments of Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi all relied for pro-
 tection from hostile nongovernmental armed groups operating out of the eastern
 part of the country. These groups included: the Interahamwe militia of ethnic
 Hutus, mostly from Rwanda, which fought the Tutsi-dominated Government of
 Rwanda; Hutu members of the former Rwandan Armed Forces, believed to be re-
 sponsible for the 1994 genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda, which also fought the Govern-
 ment of Rwanda; the Mai Mai, a loose association of traditional Congolese local de-
 fense forces, which fought the influx of Rwandan immigrants; the Alliance of Demo-
 cratic Forces (ADF), made of up Ugandan expatriates and supported by the Govern-
 ment of Sudan, which fought the Government of Uganda; and several groups of
 Hutus from Burundi fighting the Tutsi-dominated Government of Burundi. In the
 ensuing civil war, elements of the armed forces of Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda
 operated inside the country in support of the rebels; elements of the armed forces
 of Angola, Chad, Namibia, and Zimbabwe operated inside the country in support of
 the Government; and the nongovernmental armed groups mentioned above operated
 inside the country on the side of the Government, often as guerrillas inside RCD-
 occupied territory.
 The Government's security forces consist of a national police force under the Min-
 istry of Interior, a National Security Council (CNS), the National Intelligence Agen-
 cy (ANR), and the Congolese Armed Forces (FAC), which includes an office for the
 Military Detection of Subversive Activities (DEMIAP). The police force, reorganized
 in 1997, handles basic criminal cases. The CNS shares responsibility for internal
 and external security with the ANR, including border security matters. The FAC re-
 tains some residual police functions. Military police have jurisdiction over armed
 forces personnel. The security forces committed numerous, serious human rights
 abuses.
 Most sectors of the economy continued to decline. Production and incomes contin-
 ued to fall and the modern sector has virtually disappeared. Physical infrastructure
 has suffered serious damage, financial institutions have collapsed, and public edu-
 cation and health have deteriorated. Annual per capita national income was esti-
 mated at $115. Subsistence activities, a large informal sector, and widespread bar-
 ter characterized much of the economy. The insolvent public sector could not provide
 even basic public services, and external economic assistance remained limited.
 The Kabila Government's already poor human rights record worsened in several
 areas after the start of the civil war in August. Security forces were responsible for
 numerous extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, beatings, rape, and other
 abuses. The Kabila Government continued its attempts to establish control over the
 security forces, and a special military tribunal tried and executed several dozen FAC
 members for various human rights abuses. Prison conditions remained harsh and
 life-threatening. Security forces increasingly used arbitrary arrest and detention
 throughout the year. Prolonged pretrial detention remained a problem, and citizens
 often were denied fair public trials. The special military tribunal tried civilians for
 political offenses, and executed civilians with limited due process protections. The
 
 
 judiciary remained subject to executive influence, and continued to suffer from a
 lack of resources, inefficiency, and corruption. It remained subject to executive influ-
 ence and largely ineffective as a deterrent to human rights abuses or as a corrective
 force. Security forces violated citizens' rights to privacy. Government security forces
 used excessive force and committed violations of international law in the civil war
 that started in August. Although a large number of private newspapers often pub-
 lished criticism of the Government, the Government restricted freedom of speech
 and the press by harassing.and arresting newspaper editors and journalists, and
 seizing individual issues of publications, as well as by increasing its restrictions on
 private radio broadcasting. The Government severely restricted freedom of assembly
 and association. The law continued to restrict the process for official recognition of
 religious groups. The Government increased its restrictions on freedom of move-
 ment, inaugurating exit visa requirements after the start of the civil war. Citizens
 do not have the right to change their government peacefully. The Government con-
 tinued to ban political party activity and used security services to stop political dem-
 onstrations, resulting in arrests and detentions. It also harassed and imprisoned
 members of opposition parties, and exiled a principal political opponent to his home
 village, although it later released him. The Government harassed human rights non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's). The Government banned the human rights
 group AZADHO, one of the leading human rights organizations, and seized copies
 of its annual report on human rights. It also established a commission to review the
 "good standing" of all human rights organizations. The Government strongly re-
 sisted efforts by the United Nations to investigate reports of massacres in 1996 and
 1997, leading to the withdrawal of the U.N. Investigative Team from the country.
 Violence against women is a problem and rarely is punished. Female genital mutila-
 tion persists among isolated populations in the north. Discrimination against ethnic
 minorities and indigenous Pygmies is a problem. After the start of the civil war,
 there was serious and widespread discrimination and violence and extreme official
 prejudice  against members   of the   Tutsi ethic minority. Security   forces
 extrajudicially killed or summarily executed ethnic Tutsis and suspected rebels in
 the capital, and detained civilian Tutsis at a Kinshasa military camp. There were
 credible reports of beatings, rapes and extrajudicial killings at this camp, and re-
 ports of killings and other abuses of Tutsis elsewhere in the country by both secu-
 rity forces and mobs. State-owned radio stations repeatedly broadcast hate mes-
 sages, sometimes issued by senior government officials, which may have contributed
 to official and societal violence against Tutsis. There are unconfirmed reports indi-
 cating that in August at least some government military units received orders to
 execute all Tutsis in those units or in the general population in the areas where
 those units were stationed. Child labor remained a common problem in the informal
 sector.
 Some nongovernmental armed groups fighting on the side of the Government,
 RCD forces, and mobs all committed many serious abuses, including many
 extrajudicial killings or summary executions in territories under their control.
 Rebel forces committed extrajudicial killings in territories under their control in-
 cluding the massacre of church and lay workers on August 23, and shot down a ci-
 vilian jetliner on October 10. RCD forces were responsible for disappearances and
 reportedly tortured, raped and detained many civilians. They also endangered the
 civilian population of Kinshasa by cutting electricity and disrupting the water sup-
 ply and commercial food shipments during an unsuccessful effort to take the capital
 in August.
 Although it often was difficult for victims and witnesses to distinguish RCD rebel
 forces from elements of the Rwandan army due to their close cooperation and com-
 monalities of language and equipment, Rwandan army personnel also reportedly
 committed many serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killing, tor-
 ture and rape. Although Angolan and Zimbabwean aircraft and artillery bombed or
 shelled areas inhabited by civilians in Kinshasa and Kisangani, there were few re-
 ports of human rights violations by the elements of some foreign government armed
 forces operating in the country, including the Chadian, Namibian, Ugandan and
 Zimbabwean armed forces; there were reports that foreign armed forces on both
 sides of the war sometimes restrained or mitigated the human rights abuses of their
 Congolese allies, in particular by safeguarding prisoners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The security forces executed many
 unarmed civilians in Butembo in North Kivu Province in late February for sus-
 pected collaboration with local Mai Mai militias then hostile to the Kabila govern-
 
 
 83
 ment. These killings occurred after the FAC recaptured Butembo from Mai Mai
 troops who earlier had taken it from government forces. Estimates of the number
 of civilians killed range from 40 to 800. Several local human rights groups put the
 death toll in the low hundreds.
 In March a teenage soldier killed a local volunteer of the International Committee
 of the Red Cross following a disagreement about the use of a plot of land for a soccer
 field. Within hours a special military tribunal sentenced the soldier to death. Presi-
 dent Kabila commuted the sentence in April (see Section I.e.).
 During the civil war, there were many credible reports of executions by security
 forces of ethnic Tutsis; these reports were particularly numerous during the first
 month of the war (see Sections 1.g. and 5). In Uvira, from August 2 to August 5,
 government troops and Mai Mai carried out systematic house-to-house searches for
 and killings of Tutsis. During the first week of August, local youths whom FAC offi-
 cers organized into paramilitary groups reportedly killed as many as 250 civilians,
 mostly Tutsis or persons thought to look like Tutsis, in the towns of Fizi and Uvira,
 on Lake Tanganyika near Burundi. According to credible reports, during the 2
 weeks before the rebels took Kisangani on August 23, the Government's provincial
 governor in that city, with the active collaboration of the senior local officials of
 seven Government agencies: organized a public hate campaign against Congolese
 Tutsis; organized the arrest, detention, and torture of up to 130 Tutsis, persons be-
 lieved to look like Tutsis, and persons from the Kivu provinces where the country's
 Tutsis are concentrated; and then directed the execution and burial in mass graves"
 near the airport of up to 100 of these persons. During the first 2 weeks of their occu-
 pation ofisangani, the rebels reportedly uncovered the bodies of about 150 persons
 killed during the days before the RCD too control of the city; most were Tutsis, the
 rest were members   other ethnic groups from the eastern region. Repeatedly dur-
 ing August, media owned and controlled by the State publicized messages by gov-
 ernment officials that may have contributed to violence against domestic Tutsi civil-
 ians (see Section 1.g.). On August 26, when rebel forces were approaching Kinshasa,
 the Government encouraged the civilian population of the capital to seek out pos-
 sible rebels and rebel sympathizers who might be hiding in the city. On August 27,
 mobs in the capital killed, often by brig, a number of persons thought to look
 like Tutsis or to be rebels in disguise, including some menaly ill persons; some vic-
 tims reportedly were buried alive in the Masina and Kintambo neighborhoods of the
 capital, and fishermen reportedly saw burned bodies floating in the Congo River.
 Government-organized and government-incited extrajudicial killings of Tutsis appar-
 ently diminished after the end of August, when the rebels were driven back from
 the capital and international criticism of these killings intensified. Nevertheless, ci-
 vilian deaths for which the Government and its supporters were responsible contin-
 ued to occur. On September 3, just before the rebels took Kalemi, in the southeast-
 ern region, government troops and civilian youth gangs reportedly burned to death
 a number of captured RCD rebels. Credible reports indicate that between the start
 of the war and year's end, about 28 persons detained by the military died of starva-
 tion aGfte being transferred from Kitona to a jail in Lubumbashi (see Sections 1.c.
 and i.d.).
 Unconfirmed but apparently distinct reports indicate that between August 14 and
 August 26 at least some government military units received orders, which some re-
 cipients allegedly believed to have been issued by the Government to all brigades
 nationwide, to execute all Tutsis in those units or in the general population in the
 areas where those units were stationed.
 Members of the security forces robbed, extorted and murdered civilians, particu-
 larly in the east of the country before they lost control of it. The military justice
 system, revised in 1997, prosecuted FAC members for individual incidents ranging
 from armed robbery to rape to murder, and several dozen were executed by order
 of a special military tribunal at various times in various cities (see Section i.e.).
 Harsh prison, conditions and abuse led to an undetermined number of deaths in
 prisons. Many prisoners died of iliness or starvation (see Section 1.c.).
 Mob violence, at times instigated by government officials, resulted in killings.
 During the civil war, rebel forces repeatedly committed mass extrajudicial
 killings. In early August, rebel forces operating in the eastern region reportedly exe-
 cuted large groups of captured government soldiers, including a group at the airport
 at Bukavu, aftr they refused to join the rebellion (see Section 1.g.). Adfer taking
 Uvira on August 6, the rebels committed a large but unknown number of
 extrajudicial killings of civilians, reportedly in retaliation for the Mal Mal and FAC
 massacres of Tutsis in Uvira a few days earlier. On August 23 and 24, RCD forces
 reportedly killed hundreds of unarmed civilians at and near Kasika, a Catholic
 church parish in South Kivu Province; the RCD forces began these killings during
 a religious service, shooting inside the church and killing the priest and three nuns.
 
 
 The Kasika killings were apparently reprisals for a nearby Mai Mai attack on ROD
 forces. On August 25, ROD forces reportedly killed between several dozen and 200
 unarmed civilians at Makobola, near Uvira. On Auust 27, in Kazimia, near Fizi,
 ROD rebels and members of the Burundian armed forces reportedly killed more
 than 300 unarmed civilians. On September 1, ROD rebels reportedly killed about
 300 civilians in -reprisal for a Mai Mai attack. On September 4 and 5, ROD rebels
 reported killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Kalemi, in reprisal for the killing of
 ROD prisoners of war by FAC forces and local youths on September 3. On Septem-
 ber 6, ROD rebels in Kabare reportedly killed about 150 civilians in reprisal for a
 nearby Mai Mai attack. Over a 3-day period begin    on December 30, ROD rebels
 at Makabola reportedly killed hundreds of civilians following a fight on December
 .30 between ROD forces and the Forces for the Defense of Democracy, a Burundian
 Hutu nongovernmental armed group. In addition to these mass killings, there were
 many reports of smaller-scale extrajudicial killings by members of the ROD forces
 from August through December. Throughout the year, there were reports of Tutsis
 killing Hutus in the eastern regions.  ,
 b. Disappearance.-There were many reported cases of disappearance, most occur-
 ring during the civil war. Both government and rebel forces reportedly were respon-
 sible for the disappearance of many persons. The bodies of many persons killed
 extrajudicially by both sides in the civil war were burned, dumped in rivers, or bur-
 ied in mass graves that remain unopened, and neither side is known to have kept
 or released records of the identities of the persons whom its forces killed
 extrajudicially.
 Throughout the year, security forces regularly held alleged suspects in detention
 for varying periods of time before acknowledging that they were actually in custody.
 Typical accounts described unidentified assailants who abducted, threatened, and
 often beat their victims before releasing them. Journalists and opposition members
 claimed that they were targets of such actions.
 In February the editor of the publication Economic Monitor reported an attempt
 in Kinshasa by six agents of the ANR to abduct him. According to the editor, when
 he resisted, the ANR agents attempted to obtain reinforcements from a local police
 station, but the policemen declined to assist them (see Section 2.a,).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law forbids torture, security forces and prison officials used torture,
 and often beat prisoners in the process of arresting or interrogating them.
 Authorities of the Kabila administration have not responded to charges of inmate
 abuse and repeated beatings by its security and prison officials.
 Members of the security forces also raped, robbed, and extorted money from civil-
 ians; some abusers were prosecuted (see Section l.a.). Incidents of physical abuse
 by security forces occurred during the arrest or detention of political opponents. Se-
 curity forces arrested Eugene Diomi, head of the political party Front for the Suir-
 vival of Democracy (FSD), at his home on December 11, 1997, raping two female
 relatives and stealing valuables. Diomi was held at a military camp, and reportedly
 severely beaten on a daily basis, until his provisional release under military guard
 for medical care January 8.
 InFebruary, at the time of the arrest and exile of Democratic Union for Social
 Progress (UDPS) party leader Etienne Tshisekedi (see Section .d.), security forces
 detained several members of the UPDS at his residence and physically abused
 them; they were released several days later.
 Also in February, Joseph Albert Mena," former member of the transitional par-
 liament during the Mobutu era, was arrested and beaten repeatedly in the base-
 ment of an unofficial detention facility, following his arrest during the transit of the
 presidential motorcade through Kinshasa. Mena was shot at, and then arrested,
 after failing to move his vehicle out of the way of the motorcade quickiy enough.
 Accused of attempting to assassinate the President, he was released after a visiting
 presidential deputy chief Of Staff recognized him at the detention facility and ar-
 ranged his release.
 On March 13, 5 members of the UDPS were arrested at the party headquarters
 and physically abused in detention before their release on March 14.
 There were numerous reports of torture of Tutsi civilians and captured rebels by
 government security forces during the civil war. There were repeated reports of tor-
 ture at a government detention center for Tutsi civilians, Camp Kokolo in Kinshasa
 (see Section 1.d.). In August, persons who were determined not to be Tutis and re-
 leased from Camp Kokolo reported seeing detainees there whose ears had been cut
 off, and one person who had been disemboweled. Members ofthe presidential guard
 beat and whipped persons evacuated from the Burundian embassy in August. Mili-
 tary officers beat and injured Ugandan diplomats being evacuated from the country
 at Kinshasa's airport in August. Government officials tortured many of the Tutis
 
 
 and other easterners whom they arrested and many of whom they killed at
 Kisangani before the city fell to the Rebels on August 23; some of more than 30 per-
 sons who were arrested but were not killed claimed to have been tortured.
 Civilians detained by RCD rebel forces during the civil war claimed to have suf-
 fered torture, including rape, whippings, severe beatings that in some cases broke
 bones, and being forced to drink their own urine. RCD forces reportedly arrested
 and raped more than 50 women and girls in the Katudu district of Bakuvu on Sep-
 tember 1.
 The Kabila Government operated 220 known prisons and other places of deten-
 tion. In all such facilities, conditions remained harsh and life threatening, although
 the Government undertook work at Kinshasa's main prison, Makala, to improve
 conditions. The Kabila administration provided food at some prisons, but not in suf-
 ficient quantities to ensure adequate nutrition for all inmates. About 28 persons de-
 tained by the military died of starvation after being transferred from Kitona to a
 jail in Lubumbashi (see Section l.a.). Prison conditions remained a threat to pris-
 oners' lives. Living conditions were harsh and unsanitary, and prisoners were poorly
 treated. The penal system suffered from severe shortages of funds, medical facilities,
 food, and trained personnel.
 Overcrowding and corruption in the prisons are widespread. There were reports
 of prisoners being beaten to death, tortured, deprived of food and water, or dying
 of starvation. Prisoners are wholly dependent on personal resources of family or
 friends for their survival. Inmates at Makala central prison in Kinshasa sleep on
 the floor without bedding and have no access to sanitation, potable water, or ade-
 quate health care. Tuberculosis, red diarrhea, and other infectious diseases are
 rampant. Although authorities do not target women for abuse, prison guards rape
 female inmates.
 The use of unpublicized and unofficial detention sites by the civil and military au-
 thorities circumvented humanitarian groups' access to many prisoners and detain-
 ees. The ICRC was denied access to these sites, and to regular detention facilities,
 including facilities where the Government incarcerated Tutsi civilians during the
 civil war.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal provisions governing arrest
 and detention procedures, the security forces were responsible for numerous cases
 of arbitrary arrest and detention.
 Under the law, serious offenses (those punishable by more than 6 months' impris-
 onment) do not require a warrant for a suspect's arrest. Only a law enforcement offi-
 cer with 'judicial police officer" status is empowered to authorize arrest. This status
 also is vested in senior officers of the security services. The law instructs security
 forces to bring detainees to the police within 24 hours. The law also provides that
 detainees must be charged within 24 hours and be brought within 48 hours before
 a magistrate, who may authorize provisional detention for varying renewable peri-
 ods.
 In practice these provisions often were violated. The security forces, especially
 those carrying out the orders of any official who could claim authority, used arbi-
 trary arrest to intimidate outspoken opponents and journalists. Charges rarely were
 ed, and the political motivation for such detentions was often obscure. When the
 authorities didpress charges, the claims they filed were sometimes contrived or
 recitations of archaic colonial regulations.
 Detention without charge has been a frequent problem under the Kabila adminis-
 tration. On December 4, 1997, British Broadcasting Company journalist Mossi
 Mwassi, reputedly a South African citizen, was arrested by security forces and
 charged with endangering state security, apparently for having attended a press
 conference given by opposition politician Arthur Z'Ahidi Ngoma. Mwassi was re-
 leased on April 11.
 On December 26, 1997, security forces detained 123 Congolese citizens, expelled
 en masse from Angola for lack of proper legal status, on suspicion of being members
 of the Mobutu-era military. They were held without charge and shuttled through
 various detention facilities prior to their release on January 18.
 On January 19, the Government detained three members of the Solidarite trade
 union after one of them criticized officials of the transportation parastatal on tele-
 vision, regarding treatment of parastatal workers. The Government released the
 unionists in May.
 On January 20, security agents arrested Joseph Olenghankoy, head of the politi-
 cal party Innovative Forces for Unity and Solidarity (FONUS), on unspecified
 charges (see Section I.e.). Two other FONUS officials, Paul Kasongo and Athenase
 Oyumbo, were arrested on January 28, then released on January 30, while Oyumbo
 was re-arrested on January 31, all without explanation by authorities. Oyumbo sub-
 sequently was tried by a military tribunal and acquitted May 19. Olenghankoy, who
 
 
 86
 escaped briefly in April with two other prominent prisoners, Z'Ahidi Ngoma and
 Commandant Masasu, from aprison in Lubumbashi, subsequently was tried by a
 military tribunal and sentencedto 15 years' imprisonment in May (see Section i.e.).
 On January 27, security forces arrested several traditional leaders of the Bashi
 ethnic group in South Kivu province, together with three academics from local uni-
 versities and several opposition party officials, on suspicion of sympathizing with
 Ma Mai militia. Most were released within several days, but the academics were
 transferred to Kinshasa, and held without charge until mid-April.
 On February 12, security agents arrested UDPS leader Etienne Tshisekedi at his
 home, 2 days after he met with a foreign envoy, and 2 days before a scheduled rally
 in honor of the 1982 founding of the party. He then was sent into internal exile at
 his home village of Kabeya-Kamwanga in East Kasai province. A number of UDPS
 officials were arrested subsequently, held without charge, and released within sev-
 eral days. The Government released Tshisekedi from internal exile in early July,
 and he returned to Kinshasa.
 The Government arrested journalist Albert Bonsange Yema on February 12 for an
 article he published in the newspaper L'Alarme that criticized the arrest of Joseph
 Olaghankoy. In May the State Security Court tried him for endangering state secu-
 rity and sentenced him to 1 year in prison.
 On February 25, security forces arrested Modest Mutinga, editor of the newspaper
 Le Potential, after he claimed in an article that some Kasaians in Kabila's Govern-
 ment were unhappy over the arrest of Tshisekedi.:Mutinga was set free on February
 28.
 On March 13, five members of the UDPS were arrested at the party headquarters,
 supposedly for flying the party flag, and released the following day (see Section 1.c.).
 Furniture and documents also were seized by government agents.
 On April 11, five ANR agents arrested Michel Ladi Luya, editor of the newspaper
 Le Palmares, at the newspaper's offices, apparently for publishing an open letter
 from Etienne Tshisekedi on April 9. Luya was released without explanation on April
 13.
 On April 27, ANR agents arrested Paul Nsapu and Sabin Banza of the Elector-
 ate's League (Ligue des Electeurs), following their departure from the Belgian em-
 bassy, where they had just signed an aid project- contract and received embassy
 funds for that purpose. They were held on suspicion of being "spies" for foreign gov-
 ernments and remained in custody until early September.
 On May 8, government security forces briefly detained two NGO leaders in North
 Kivu, Immaculee Birliaheka of PAIF (Promotion of Women's Initiatives), and
 Brigitte Mutambale of GEAD (Study and Action Group for Development). Birhaheka
 was arrested briefly after having met  with a representative of an international de-
 mocracy NGO, but was not held.
 Also on May 8, authorities detained Human Rights Watch researcher Suliman
 Baldo at the end of a 3-week official mission to the country, was detained for 24
 hours at the airport in Kinshasa before they allowed him to leave (see Section 4).
 On May 15, Pascale Kambale, vice president of the Zairian Association for the De-
 fense of Human Rights (AZADHO) and an AZADHO colleague were arrested by se-
 curity agents May 15, following a press conference held by the two activists. The
 government had banned AZADHO formally in April (see Section 4), and apparently
 considered the press conference a violation of that-banning order. The two were re-
 leased May 16.
 On May 18, the director of Congolese National Television and Radio (RTNC) and
 four colleagues Were arrested by government agents following a televised program
 on atrocities in Africa that apparently was considered an affront to President
 Kabila. Three of them were released June 3, with the director and one other held
 until June 10.
 On May 21, security forces arrested Thierry Kyalumba Kabonga, managing editor
 of The Vision newspaper, and charged him with propagation of false rumors, for an
 article about the not-yet-released Congo franc. He was released on June 23.
 On May 23, DEMIAP detained Kidimbu Mpese and Awazi-Karhomon of the news-
 paper Le Soft for an UDPS-sponsored article critical of Kabila that appeared in the
 Brussels edition of Le Soft. They were detained until June 8, 1998.
 Also on May 23, security forces arrested several government ministers on corrup-
 tion charges: Information Minister Raphael Ghenda, Minister Florent Kambale, En-
 ergy Minister Pierre Lokombe Kitete, Plan Minister Etiene-Richard Mbaya, and
 Vice-Minister for Portfolio Biselele Kanumutambi. At year's end they remained in
 detention.
 In early July, following the release from internal exile of Etienne Tshisekedi, se-
 curity forces detained without charge approximately 40 of his followers and senior
 UDPS party officials in raids on his residence and elsewhere in the capital. All but
 
 
 one (UDPS advisor Marcel Mbayo) were released within 1 or 2 weeks. Mbayo re-
 mained in detention until early September, 1998.
 On August 20, government security forces reportedly arrested two Agence France
 Press reporters at Kasumbalesa, a crossing point on the Zambian border, accused
 them of being spies, and detained them until August 22, when they expelled the
 journalists from the country.
 Government security forces in Kinshasa reportedly arrested seven journalists em-
 ployed by the state-owned radio station, La Voix du Peuple, on September 9 and
 again on September 18, detaining them for 10 days on the second occasion, on sus-
 picion of having links with the RCD.
 Former Finance Minister Fernand Tala Ngai was detained without charge in a
 Kinshasa prison from mid-October until the end of the year on suspicion of having
 used his office to pay contracts to members of President Mobutu's Mouvement
 Populaire de la Revolution (MPR) party, instead of paying civil servant salaries.
 On October 13, police reportedly arrested and detained Belly Bosange and Albert
 Tumba, two journalists of Alerte, a Kinshasa newspaper, for publishing a false re-
 port that the Interior Minister had defected to the rebels. On October 30, DEMIAP
 officers reportedly arrested and detained a third Alerte journalist, Jean-Marie
 Nkanku, after Alerte published a photograph showing the Interior Minister with an
 RCD leader. Of these Alerte journalists, only Bosange remained in custody at year's
 end, serving a 1-year sentence pursuant to a trial in a military court.
 On October 29, security forces in Kananga reportedly arrested and detained Baya
 Mukotso, a journalist for La Destinee newspaper, after the newspaper criticized the
 governor of Kasai Orientale Province. Also on October 29, ANR officers arrested and
 detained Bayard Kabango Mbaya, a journalist with La Flamme du Congo, a
 Kinshasa newspaper, after the newspaper published an article alleging corruption
 on the part of Kabila's Chief of Cabinet. He was freed on November 4, when security
 forces arrested and detained another La Flamme journalist, Gustave Kalenga, in
 connection with the same article.
 On November 5, security forces -in Kinshasa reportedly arrested and briefly de-
 tained Awozi Kharomon, editor-in-chief of Le Soft, a Kinshasa newspaper owned by
 former Mobutu aid and RCD supporter Kin-Kiey Mulumba, and two other journal-
 ists employed by the newspaper, after it reported that a Western government had
 suggested that Kabila either resign or negotiate with the RCD. All three journalists
 were released on November 7.
 On November 13, Minister of Health Jean-Baptiste Sondji was dismissed from his
 ministry and arrested for telling a Western government's international radio news
 service that the Minister of Justice alone had determined which opinion groups were
 consulted about a proposal for a new Constitution. He was detained for 3 days and
 released on November 16.
 In mid-November authorities arrested former Finance Minister Tala Ngai. He re-
 mained in custody at year's end. His case was to be heard by a military tribunal,
 but no date had been set.
 On December 15, authorities arrested activists of the PALU opposition party; they
 were released the following day.
 Several dozen high officials of the Mobutu regime, arrested by the Government
 in June 1997 for corruption, were released during the year. The Government re-
 leased 26 on February 18, 16 were set entirely free, but subject to further legal ac-
 tion, and 10 were kept under a form of house arrest. In March another 11 were re-
 leased, at least 1 after reportedly paying a substantial sum of money as restitution.
 Professor Kalele Ka Bila and free-lance journalist Jean-Francois Kabanda, both
 UDPS supporters, were detained in October 1997 for allegedly distributing a docu-
 ment calling on citizens to overthrow the 'Tutsi invaders." They were convicted in
 May by a special military tribunal and given 2-year sentences (see Section i.e.).
 Roger Sala Nzo Badila and Professor Nyabirungu Mwene Songa, leaders of the
 National Human Rights Center (CENADHO), were detained in November 1997 for
 publishing an unflattering report of the Kabila Government's human rights record.
 They were on released uncharged February 12.
 Arthur Z'ahidi Ngoma was arrested on November 24, 1997 with three colleagues
 from the political think tank Forces du Futur for violating the ban on public politi-
 cal activities. He was convicted by a military tribunal in May and given a suspended
 12-month sentence and released (see Section I.e.).
 Commandant Enselme Masasu, a founder of the ADFL, was arrested on Novem-
 ber 26, 1997 and later accused by President Kabila of a series of crimes, including
 drug trafficking and maintaining private prisons. He was tried by a military tribu-
 nal in May and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment (see Section i.e.).
 
 
 Pastor Theodore Ngoy was arrested on December 17, 1997 after he accused Presi-
 dent Kabila at a church-run seminar of generating a cult of personality. He re-
 mained in detention until July 2.
 In August the Government systematically arrested and detained Tutsi civilians
 throughout the country. Many were killed (see Section l.a.) and some were tortured
 (see Section 1.c.). However, many survived. At year's end, at least 130 Tutsis re-
 mained detained without charge at Camp Kokolo in Kinshasa, and at least 520
 more remained detained without charge in Katanga, President Kabila's home prov-
 ince. Hundreds-perhaps thousands-of Tutsis remained incarcerated, ostensibly for
 their own protection. The Government granted the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) access to at least some of these detainees. The Government also
 held prisoners of war after August, but little is known about its treatment of them.
 However, the ICRC did have access to prisoners of war.
 At year's end, the Government held fewer than a dozen political detainees, exclud-
 ing Tutsis and prisoners of war.
 During the civil war, RCD rebel forces reportedly detained persons repeatedly.
 Many of those whom the rebels detained were Hutus. The rebels also detained, and
 allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit, many prisoners of
 war. However, the RCD was not reported to have held large numbers of persons in
 prolonged detention on the basis of their ethnicity.
 Although the law prohibits and the Government did not practice forced exile, the
 Government sent UDPS party leader Etienne Tshisekedi into internal exile at his
 home village in East Kasai on February 12, releasing him in July.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Transitional Act of the Mobutu regime and
 Kabila's Decree Law No. 3 provide for the independence of the judiciary; however,
 in practice the judiciary was not independent of the executive branch, which could
 and did manipulate it. The Kabila administration did not establish mechanisms to
 ensure the independence of the judiciary by year's end. A judicial reform decree, re-
 portedly awaiting presidential approval since 1997, was not promulgated. The judi-
 iar aso is ineffective and suffers from corruption.
 The judiciary includes lower courts, appe ate courts, the Supreme Court, the
 Court of State Security, and a new military tribunal organized in August 1997. This
 tribunal ordered the executions of dozens of soldiers and civilians in Bukavu, Goma,
 Kinshasa, and Lubumbashi during the year for various violent criminal offenses, in-
 cluding murder and armed robbery. Local human rights groups expressed concern
 at the summary nature of the justice dispensed by this military court, with no auto-
 matic right of appeal to a higher court, and many of the accused apparently lacking
 defense counsel. The tribunal also began to sentence civilians for nonviolent offenses
 with political overtones.  t
 In May a university lecturer, Kalele Ka Bila, and a free-lance journalist, Jean-
 Francois Kabanda, received 2-year sentences for spreading false rumors, affer origi-
 nally being charged with endangering state security. They allegedly published an
 article appealing to ethnic prejudices in advocating resistance to Tutsi invaders"
 (see Section 2.a.).
 Also in May, the special military tribunal tried Commandant Anselme Masasu,
 co-founder of the ADFL, Arthur Z'Alidi, head of Forces du Futur, and Joseph
 Olenghankoy, head of FONUS, on various charges. Masasu received a 20 year sen-
 tence for treason, Z'Ahidl, a 12-month suspended sentence for violating the political
 ban, and Olenghankoy 15 years also for violating the ban on political activity. Many
 observers considered all three sentences to be politically motivated; Olenghankoy
 and Z'Ahidi were heads of opposition political parties, and Masasu was a potential
 rival to President Kabila within the ADFL.
 Also in May, journalist Albert Bonsange Yema, who was arrested by the Govern-
 ment February 12 for an article criticizing the arrest of Joseph Olenghankoy, was
 convicted by the State Security Court on the charge of endangering state security
 and sentenced to 1 year in prison (see Section 2.a.).
 Civil and criminal codes are based on Belgian and customary law. The Legal Code
 perovides for the r aght to a speedy pubic trial, the presumption of innocence, and
 lgal counsel at all stages of proceedings. Defendants have the right to appeal in
 all cases except those involving national security, armed robbery, and smuggling, all
 of which are adjudicated by the Court of State Security, and cases adjudicated by
 the special military tribunal, whose jurisdlction appears ill defined. The law pro-
 vides for court-appointed counsel at state expense in capital cases, in all proceedings
 before the Supreme Court, and in other cases when requested by the court. The
 Kabila administration has not stated a position on providing counsel, but has done
 so at its discretion.
 Corruption remains pervasive, particularly among magistrates, who are very poor-
 ly and intermittently paid and poorly trained. The system remains hobbled by major
 
 
 shortages of personnel, supplies, and infrastructure. The Kabila Government has ac-
 knowledged that the judiciary is dysfunctional, and took one step to improve it by
 firing 315 magistrates in October, and hiring others.
 At year's end there were fewer than a dozen known political prisoners, including
 Anselme Masasu and Joseph Olengansky.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Secu-
 rity forces routinely ignored legal provisions for the inviolability of the home and
 of private correspondence. They ignored the requirement for a search warrant, en-
 tering and searching homes at will. Opposition party leaders' residences often were
 raided by police, with arrests made andfies seized (see Sections 1.e. and 1.d.). The
 headuaters of various poltical parties were under surveillance (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government is widely believed to monitor telephone communications.
 According to an Amnesty International Report, the FAC, the ROD, and the Rwan-
 dan Armed Forces used forcible conscription, and many of those forced to enlist were
 children. However, most such abuses were attributed to the rebels and the
 Rwandans.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-During the last 5 months of the year, there was a civil war with external
 intervention on both sides. The war began in early August, when Kabila tried to
 expel from the country Rwandan military forces that had helped him overthrow
 Mobutu. Congolese Tutsis and the governments of Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi
 all relied on these Rwandan forces for protection from hostile nongovernmental
 armed groups operating out of the eastern part of the country. These groups in-
 cluded: the Interahamwe militia of ethnic Hutus, mostly from Rwanda, which fought
 the Tutsi-dominated Government of Rwanda; Hutu members of the former Rwandan
 Armed Forces believed to be responsible for the 1994 genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda,
 which also fought the Government of Rwanda; the Mai Mai, a loose association of
 traditional Congolese local defense forces, which fought the influx of Rwandan immi-
 grants; the Alliance of Democratic Forces (ADF), made of up Ugandan expatriates
 and supported by the Government of Sudan, which fought the Government of Ugan-
 da; andseveral groups of Hutus from Burundi fighting the Tutsi-dominated Govern-
 ment of Burundi. Consequently, Kabfla's attempt to expel the Rwandan armed
 forces was frustrated by the outbreak on August 2 of a rebellion, led by a group
 that called itself the Congolese Rally for Democracy. The ROD was dominated by
 members of the Tutsi ethnic minority, but from the outset depended heavily on
 troops, materiel, and direction from the Government of Rwanda and, to a lesser ex-
 tent, the Governments of Uganda and Burundi. The rebellion began in the eastern
 provinces of the Kivus and spread to the rovince of Lower Congo immediately to
 the southwest of Kinshasa. as rebels and their allies attemp ted to capture the cap-
 ital and overthrow the Kabila Government in late Auust. Milibery intervention by
 Angola, Chad, Namibia, and Zimbabwe on the side of the Government resulted in
 the defeat of the rebel drive on Kinshasa and the rapid extirpation of rebel forces
 in Lower Congo. However, the rebels continued to win ground in the eastern prov-
 inces. At yeas end, the ROD controlled more than one-third of the country's terri-
 tory. Elements of the armed forces of Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda continued to
 operate inside the country in support of the rebels; elements of the armed forces of
 Angola, Chad, Namibia, and Zimbabwe operated inside the country in support of the
 Government; and the nongovernmental armed groups operated inside the country
 on the side of the Government, often as guerrillas inside ROD-occupied territory. In
 this conflict, both sides repeatedly used excessive force and committed numerous
 abuses.
 There were reports that in August some government military units received or-
 ders instructing them to kill all Tutsis in those units or in the civilian population
 of the areas in which those units were stationed (see Section l.a.). There were re-
 tOrts, at least some of them credible, of mass killings of ethnic Tutis by security
 forces in cities and towns in the eastern regions, typically days or hours before these
 towns or cities were captured by the rebels (see Section l.a.). Government security
 forces conducted mass arrests of Tutsis at many locations in August and detained
 at least hundreds of Tutsis in Kinshasa and Katanga Province through the end of
 the year there were reports of torture and killings of some of these detainees (see
 Sections l.a., .c., and Z.d.).
 During the rebels' August march on Kinshasa, and for several days in late August
 when rebel troops successfully infiltrated the city and fought street battles with gov-
 ernment troops, there were many credible reports of executions by security forces
 of ethic Tutais and of suspected rebels. Although precise estimates are unavailable,
 these included the random killing of those suspected of being Tutis, or of aiding
 the Tutsi rebels. In many cases, suspected rebels were stopped at impromptu check-
 points and killed on the spot. Mobs of civilians also took to the streets, burning sus-
 
 
 pected rebels alive with tires around their necks filled with gasoline (see Section
 l.a.).
 During the rebel march on Kinshasa in August, government and private media
 publicized remarks by government officials calling on the general population to fight
 and kill the "Tutsi" or "Rwandan" invaders. Some of these appeals called for the
 eradication of Tutsis in the Congo. These statements may have contributed to wide-
 spread societal and official extrajudcial killings of Tutsi civilians in August. How-
 ever, later public statements by the FAC called for civilians to turn over suspected
 rebels to the FAC unharmed. The FAC later reportedly arrested some soldiers in-
 volved in abuses of civilians, subjected them to corporal punishment, and began in-
 vestigations of their acts through the military justice system. However, it was not
 known at year's end whether the Government had punished any soldiers or officials
 for killing unarmed Tutsi civilians or unarmed suspected rebels during the civil war.
 Security forces also began round-ups of ethnic Tutsi civilians during the early
 days of the rebellion, holding approximately 170 civilians at the FAC's Camp Kokolo
 in Kinshasa, and reportedly holding more civilians at other detention facilities in
 the city (see Section l.d.). Credible reports of beatings, rapes, and killing of civilians
 at Camp Kokolo and the other facilities were received throughout the rebel offensive
 on Kiunshasa (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government recruited soldiers as young as 10 years old. There were also
 credible reports that during August government authorities in some areas hastily
 organized youth paramilitary groups and urged them to seek out and destroy sus-
 pected rebels, notably including Tutsis. According to credible reports, the RCD de-
 ployed hastily conscripted and poorly trained child soldiers, some only 10 to 12
 years old. In May the U.N. Secretary General's Investigative Team for the Congo
 issued its report on serious human rights and humanitarian law violations from
 March 1993 to May 1997. Regarding allegations of massacres during the 1996-97
 rebellion, the report concluded that in October and November 1996, ADFL troops
 played a lead role in attacking refugees camps in North and South Kivu that housed
 both unarmed civilians and armed soldiers and militia. The report notes that senior
 Rwandan officials have admitted publicly that Rwandan forces participated in the
 attacks.
 The attacks caused heavy casualties among the civilian population. In some cases
 attacking troops deliberately executed unarmed persons, including women and chil-
 dren. In Magunga camp, hundreds of unarmed persons were captured and executed
 by attacking troops. The report further concludes that many of the Hutu refugees
 who fled the camps into the interior of the Congo were hunted down and killed de-
 liberately by ADFL troops and Ma Mai militia. In February, March and April 1997,
 ADFL troops deliberately killed groups of unarmed civilians during attacks on refu-
 gee camps set up in the Congolese interior to receive those fleeing North and South
 Kivu. The report acknowledges that the number of victims, and the extent of Rwan-
 dan participation ,in these attacks, is unknown. The report concludes that in May
 1997, ADFL troops, apparently under the effective command of the Rwandan army,
 killed hundreds of Rwandan Hutus in Mbandaka and Wendji.
 The report also notes the impediments raised by the Kabila Government to the
 investigation (see Section 4), which resulted in little testimony and made it impos-
 sible to confirm or disprove most of the allegations concerning serious violations of
 human rights and humanitarian law.
 There were reports of indiscriminate bombing of the city of Kisangani, after its
 seizure by rebel forces, by several Angolan and/or Zimbabwean jets in late August,
 with loss of life among the civilian population.
 There were many reports, at least some of them credible, that rebel forces com-
 mitted mass extrajudicial killings on several occasions, usually in reprisal either for
 mass killings of Tutsis in the same area by government forces and local para-
 military groups, or for attacks in the same area on RCD forces by local paramilitary
 groups such as the Mai Mal (see Section l.a.). For example, there were credible re-
 ports that rebel troops killed Catholic clerics and lay persons at a mission in South
 Kivu August 23 and 24,    an indiscriminate reprisal attack for an earlier ambush
 of rebel forces. Estimates of the number of persons killed ranged from several dozen
 to over 200 (see Section l.a.).
 During their August operations in Lower Congo province, rebel forces seized Inga
 Dam, the principal source of electricity for Kinshasa, and the port of Matadi, the
 capital's principal source of foodstuffs. Rebels subsequently cut the ower to
 Kinshasa several times, and disrupted the normal course of commercial s pments
 to the city, causing serious shortages of food supplies and endangering medical serv-
 ices and the water supply. On October 10, a civilian airliner was shot down near
 Kindu, killing approximately 40 passengers whom the Government claimed were ci-
 
 
 91
 vilians, mostly women and children. Rebel leaders admitted downing the aircraft,
 but claimed that it was ferrying government troops.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Statutes that predate Decree-law No. 3 provide
 for these rights, and remain in effect; however, in practice the Government re-
 stricted these rights. Incidents of harassment, intimidation, and detention of jour-
 nalists declined immediately after Kabila overthrew Mobutu, but increased toward
 the end of 1997. The increased harassment and arrest of journalists continued
 unabated into 1998 (see Section 1.d.). Of the many journalists who were arrested
 and detained, few were tried; most were released after a few days. However several
 journalists were sentenced to jail terms by the special military tribunal or the State
 Security Court (see Section .e.). Charges in these courts were usually for treason
 or offenses against state security. Criminal libel laws exist, but were not used
 against journalists.
 Almost 400 newspapers were licensed to publish, but only a score appeared regu-
 larly in Kinshasa. There was also an active private press in Lubumbashi, and some
 private newspapers published in other provincial cities. Of the Kinshasa-based
 newspapers, seven were dailies; the rest of the newspapers that appeared regularly
 were published between one and three times a week. Most private news publications
 relied on external financing, often from political parties and individual politicians.
 News publications tended to emphasize editorial commentary and analysis rather
 than factual descriptions of events; many are highly critical of the Government.
 Government security forces sometimes seized individual issues of various news-
 papers or printing equipment. In January soldiers seized three printers from the of-
 ces of the magazine Le Moniteur de L'Economie. In February and again in March,
 several thousand copies of Le Soft International, printed in Brussels and distributed
 in the Congo, were seized at the airport and burned. Also in March, authorities
 seized 1600 copies of AZADHO's annual report on human rights in the Congo (see
 Section 4). In May, authorities pressured opposition newspapers into running a se-
 ries of progovernment articles supposedly authored by a foreign professor. In No-
 vember, security forces arresting journalists at the offices of Le Soft (see Section
 1.d.) also seized much of that newspaper's equipment, leaving it virtually unable to
 operate through year's end.
 The newspaper industry is regulated by a press law enacted in 1996. Publishers
 must continue to deposit copies of their publications with the Information Ministry.
 However, there is no longer a formal censorship regime.
 Due to limited literacy and the higher costs of newspapers and television, radio
 remained the most important medium of public information. At year's end, seven
 private radio stations operated in Kinshasa alone. In 1997, the Kabila Government
 lfd the Mobutu regime's ban on news programming on private radio. However,
 private radio was markedly less critical of the Government than private news-
 papers. The Governmenfs licensing of radio broadcasting appeared to be nonrestric-
 tive and nondiscriminatory. However, the Kabila Government has closed down pri-
 vate radio stations because they broadcast news unfavorable to the Government or
 commentary critical of the Government. In April the Government shut down Radio
 Amani, a privately-owned radio station affiliated with the Catholic Church, because
 it carried British Broadcasting Company news programming and commentary unfa-
 vorable to the Government.
 Five television stations broadcast in the Kinshasa area. One was state-controlled,
 four were privately owned.
 Foreign source broadcasts were also available through local outlets. In the spring
 the Government attempted to restrict access to foreign source news broadcasts.
 However, after protests from independent media and dissention within the govern-
 ment, the broadcasts resumed.
 At year's end, there were two domestic Internet service providers. Because of tech-
 ncal difficulties and high costs, the Internet is not widely used.
 There are no overtly government-controlled newspapers. However, the editors of
 at least two newspapers, L'Avenir and L'Ouragon, work respectively at the Presi-
 dency and the Ministry of Justice. Le Forum and Les Palmares have close ties to
 the security services. Only Les Palmares appears daily, its editor traveled to Europe
 with Kabila in December. State-owned radio and television operate throughout the
 country; some of its broadcasting facilities were in rebel hands between August and
 year's end. Government radio and television did not exercise editorial independence.
 The head of the state-owned broadcasting company and several colleagues were ar-
 rested briefly after the company broadcast a television program on human rights
 atrocities in Africa (see Section l.d.). Opposition parties were unable to gain access
 to state-owned broadcast media.
 
 
 During the civil war, members of the government security forces repeatedly have
 detained foreign journalists, including employees of the Associated Press, Reuters,
 and the World Television Network, and reportedly have beaten some of them. In Au-
 gust government security forces detained two Agence France Press journalists and
 expelled them from the country (see Section 1.d.).
 Academic freedom generally is respected. In January three academics at regional
 universities in the province of South Kivu Were detained without charge until mid-
 April on suspicion of sympathizing with Mai Mai militia.
 Little reliable information on freedom of the press and academic freedom in rebel-
 held areas was available. However, RCD authorities reportedly restricted these
 rights. Amnesty International reported that many university campuses were closed
 and students threatened after some students reportedly verbally challenged Ernest
 Wamba dia Wamba, the RCD political leader, during a public meeting in Bukavu.
 b. Freedom of Peacefl Assembly and Association.-There is no legal protection for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government continued to restrict this right severely.
 The Government considers the rights to assemble and associate subordinate to the
 maintenance of "public order." The Government requires all organizers to apply for
 permits, which are granted or rejected at the Government's discretion. Public activi-
 ties generally are dispersed by government security services. After the arrest of
 UDPS leader Etienne Tshisekedi and several other party officials in February (see
 Section 1.d.), the Ministry of the Interior issued an announcement reminding the
 public that demonstrations disrupting public order were strictly banned- and would
 be punished severely.
 The law provides no protection for freedom of association, and the Government
 severely restricted this right. Upon assuming power in 1997, the Kabila government
 suspended political party activities, but not political parties themselves. Kabila an-
 nounced in November that the ban on political party activity would be lifted in Jan-
 uary, 1999. Individuals from parties outside the ADFL served in Kabila's Govern-
 ment, but in their individual capacities (see Section 3). Political party offices by and
 large remained open and parties continued internal administrative functions, al-
 though the headquarters of the UDPS were closed at mid-year and were used as
 a police station. At different times and for different periods, the headquarters of var-
 ious political parties were under surveillance, padlocked, or patrolled by soldiers.
 The Government effectively prevented public political gatherings, although opposi-
 tion party leaders remained able to conduct small, private meetings. The effect of
 the party suspensions varied widely throughout the country, but was enforced less
 strictly in some provinces.
 In theory anyone wishing to form a new political party would be able to do so
 by registering with the Minister of Interior. No one has tried to do so since Kabila
 overthrew Mobutu. Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) are required to register
 with -the Minister of Justice, filing copies of internal regulations and organizational
 structure. Following the banning of AZADHO in April (see Section 4), the Govern-
 ment announced that a commission would review the registration of other human
 rights NGO's to determine their "good standing" with the Government. These NGO's
 were given 3 days to update materials on file at the Justice Ministry. Of 132 organi-
 zations that complied, the Government subsequently declared only 22 to be in good
 standing. The legal status of those not approved by the government was unclear;
 many continued to function.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is recognized, and the Government
 generally respected this right in practice, with the reservation that the expression
 of this right neither disturb public order nor contradict commonly held morals. The
 process for official recognition of religious groups is simple and was not abused; ex-
 emption from taxation is among the benefits of official recognition as a religious or-
 ganization. There is no legally established or favored church or religion. The popu-
 lation is believed to be about 50 percent Catholic, 20 percent Protestant, and 10 per-
 cent Muslim.
 Security forces detained Pastor Ngoy Ilunga for 4 days in December 1997 for criti-
 cizing President Kabila and his Government during a church-sponsored seminar.
 Ngoy was taken into detention again on December 16, 1997, and was released on
 July 2.
 In April, the Ministry of the Interior banned the operations of Radio Amani, the
 Catholic Church station in Kisangani, ostensibly because it lacked -proper operating
 licenses (see Section 2.a.).
 A 1971 law regulating religious organizations grants civil servants the power to
 establish and dissolve religious groups. Although this law restricts the process for
 6fficial recognition, officially recognized religions are free to establish places of wor-
 ship and to train clergy.
 
 
 93
 Many recognized churches have external ties, and foreigners are allowed to pros-
 elytize. The Government generally did not interfere with foreign missionaries. There
 has been no known persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses or any other groups for prac-
 ticing their faith in recent years.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although the law allows for freedom of movement, the Government,
 and in particular the security forces acting independently, continued to restrict this
 freedom and the Government increased its restrictions after the civil war began.
 The civil war also brought new restrictions on internal travel even within the gov-
 ernment-controlled and rebel-controlled zones, and made movement between the two
 zones difficult and dangerous.
 Even before the civil war, security forces throughout the country established and
 manned many roadblocks at which they demanded that travelers produce docu-
 ments and bribes. There were far more such roadblocks than could be justified by
 public safety considerations; both their numbers and the conduct of the security
 force members manning them indicated that their main function was to enable secu-
 rity force members to supplement their below-subsistence official wages. This made
 internal travel costlier, more time-consuming and more dangerous, since violence in-
 cluding shootings was not uncommon at these roadblocks. However, before the out-
 break of the civil war, the number of such roadblocks and the extortion committed
 by those who manned them had diminished after Kabila overthrew the insolvent
 Mobutu regime.
 After the start of the civil war, the Government began to require exit visas for
 all foreign travel. No data on the refusal rate for exit visa applications was avail-
 able; there was one known case in which a political leader was denied an exit visa
 during the year. Security forces occasionally hindered foreign travel by citizens, in-
 cluding journalists. For example, on July 11, the editor of Le Potential, Modest
 Mutinga, was detained for 4 hours at Njili International Airport in Kinshasa; his
 papers were confiscated, and his luggage was searched. The Government imposed
 a curfew in Kinshasa from midnight to 6 a.m., and prohibited vehicles from entering
 the city after dark. These restrictions were still in effect at year's end.
 There reportedly was substantial freedom of movement within the rebel-controlled
 territories. However, travel across the war front was often inconvenient and some-
 times impossible.
 The significant risk of rape, sometimes perpetrated by uniformed persons, re-
 stricts freedom of movement at night for women in many neighborhoods. Groups of
 citizens implemented neighborhood watch programs, but women in many parts of
 Kinshasa and Lubumbashi do not leave their homes at night for fear of attack.
 The country is a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status
 of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, as well as to the Organization of African Unity's
 1969 Refugee Convention. The Government continued to provide first asylum. Tens
 of thousands of refugees were accepted into the country following the outbreak of
 civil war in the Republic of Congo in June 1997. Refugees from Uganda and Angola
 also continued to live in the country.
 The Governments cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other international agencies fluctuated widely. The Government de-
 nied the U-NHCR access to various groups of refugees scattered around the country.
 During the High Commissioner's February visit, she was not allowed to visit Goma.
 In April three local UNHCR staff members were arrested, briefly detained, and mis-
 treated.
 The Governments policy toward Burundian Hut refugees often has varied from
 its stated view that the situation in Burundi precludes forcible repatriation. On
 April 1, Government military authorities delivered an ultimatum to the local
 UNHCR office, threatening expulsion of all 6,500 Burundian refugees who had re-
 cently arrived, "unless they were repatriated by April 5. On April 3, the authorities
 agreed to allow the refugees to stay but required male refugees to transfer to an-
 other location. Approximately 250 of these refugees, including men, women, and
 children, were returned forcibly to Burundi on April 6. This action may have been
 taken by the military without consultation with the central Government.
 The UNHCR signed two tripartite agreements concerning the mutual return of
 refugees on April 25 and 26, the first with the Government and Uganda, and the
 second with the Government and Burundi. The Government's insistence that no new
 camps be constructed for refugees in the east complicated the ability of the UNHCR
 to assist new refugees. However, the Government agreed that those determined to
 be refugees by the UNHCR would be "treated according to international accords,"
 and it apparently accepted the concept of temporary sites. Another accord between
 the Government and Burundi on June 13 formulated plans for the return of Congo-
 
 
 lese refugees in Burundi and Burundian refugees in South Kivu, including those
 who did not wish to be repatriated.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government peacefully. Citizens
 have not been able to change their government through free elections since inde-
 pendence in 1960.
 In his May 1997 inaugural address, President Kabila promised a constitution and
 elections by 1999. After several months of delay, in October 1997 the Government
 completed the first series of steps in the Government's announced election calendar,
 including the creation of a Constitutional Commission. The Commission finished a
 draft constitution in March, accompanied by a list of approximately 250 persons who
 were potentially excludable from public office for commission of economic crimes or
 human rights abuses. Many prominent politicians from the Mobutu era were listed,
 as were some political opponents of the Kabila regime. The Government subse-
 quently disavowed this list as -a personal effort by the President of the Constitu-
 tional Commission that did not reflect the official recommendations of the Commis-
 sion. By amendments in May to Decree Law No. 3 of 1997 the Government estab-
 lished a Constituent and Legislative Assembly to consider the draft constitution,
 and adopt a final version for submittal to the population by referendum. The Assem-
 bly also would establish election laws, and act as a quasi-parliamentary body during
 the remainder of the transition period. In June the Government accepted applica-
 tions for positions in the Assembly. Selections were to be made by the President,
 but when-war broke out in August, it was impossible to form a constituent assembly
 with countrywide representation. In September, President Kabila appointed a 12-
 member Presidential Commission of Institutional Reforms to take the place of a
 Constituent Assembly. The Commission reviewed the draft constitution and pre-
 sented its recommendations to the President-in November. However, as of year's
 end, the Government had not yet published the draft constitution, although the Gov-
 ernment had send copies to the leaders of various NGO's and political parties, and
 purported versions of it had been printed-in some private publications.
 The suspension of opposition political party activities, announced soon after the
 Government's assumption of power in May 1997, continued; President Kabila an-
 nounced in November that he would lift the suspension in January. Political parties
 themselves have not been banned, but their operations are restricted to internal ad-
 ministrative functions. At various times and for various periods, headquarters of
 various political parties were under surveillance, padlocked, or patrolled by soldiers
 (see Section 2.b.). The effect of the party suspensions varies widely throughout the
 country, but is less strictly enforced in some provinces.
 The Kabila Government's -ministers and other senior officials were drawn from di-
 verse ethnic groups, geographic regions, and political parties. Those drawn from out-
 side the ADFL are required by opposition parties to serve as individuals and not
 as party representatives. During the 1997 military campaign through the Congolese
 countryside, the ADFL held quasi-electoral selections-by acclamation-of provincial
 leadership (governor, vice-governor, mayor) in most provinces, where candidates,
 some drawn from-outside the ADFL, were approved in public meetings of the local
 population.
 The State continued to be highly centralized in many ways. Governors were gen-
 erally appointed by the central Government executive, but once in the provinces
 they had considerable autonomy, due in part to poor communications -and transpor-
 tation infrastructure. During the year, presidential appointees gradually replaced
 governors popularly elected during Kabila's overthrow of Mobutu in 1997. Terri-
 torial administrators are also appointed from Kinshasa. Provincial government re-
 sources, both financial and logistical, have come almost exclusively from Kinshasa
 since Kabila took control of the Government.
 There are no official restrictions on the participation of women or minorities in
 politics. However, in practice there are few women or Muslims in senior positions
 in the Government or in political parties. There were six female ministers and vice
 ministers in the Cabinet at year's end.
 Section 4. Governmental-Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Kabila Government showed increased hostility to effective human rights orga-
 nizations, local or international, operating in the country. Local human rights
 NGO's continued to investigate and publish their findings on human rights cases,
 but.these activities took place in the context of significant government harassment.
 
 
 95
 Local human rights activists were subjected to frequent harassment, arrest and
 detention by security forces (see Section 1.d.). The legality of such arrests was often
 unclear, as was the authority of the security forces members effecting the arrests
 and detentions.
 In March authorities seized 1,600 copies of the annual report on human rights
 of AZADHO, one of the principal human rights organizations in the country. On
 April 3, the government banned AZADHO for allegedly violating the prohibition on
 political activities. This banning order was issued while AZADHO vice president
 ascal Kambale was in attendance at the U.N. Human Rights Commission session
 in Geneva, where a resolution critical of the Kabila Government's human rights per-
 formance was under consideration. Later in April the Government announced that
 a commission would review the registration of other human rights NGO's to deter-
 mine their "good standing"with the government. These NGO's were given 3 days to
 update materials on file at the Justice Ministry. Out of 132 organizations, 22 were
 subsequently declared to be in good standing. The legal status of those not approved
 by the Government was unclear; many continued to function. After AZADHO was
 banned, its staff formed a substantially similar organization called the Association
 Africaine de Defense des Droits de 1'Homme (ASADHO), which continued AZADHO's
 work with the same staff and operating out of the office of the organization's vice
 president. In May security forces briefly detained Pascal Kambale and an ASADHO
 colleague (see Section 1.d.).
 In May Suliman Baldo, a foreign researcher for Human Rights Watch on a 3-week
 visit to the country, was detained for 24 hours by security forces at the Kinshasa
 airport, who seized documents in his possession, and then expelled him from the
 country.
 In June the Government established an official NGO, Solidarity Among Us (SEN).
 The stated purpose of the NGO, among others, was to "coordinate the activities" of
 local and international NGO's. At year's end, the exact nature of SEN's responsibil-
 ities and authority remained unclear.
 The United Nations Investigative Team appointed by the U.N. Secretary General.
 to investigate reports of mass extrajudicial killings by ADFL forces and Rwandan
 forces supporting it during the 1996-97 rebellion against Mobutu recommenced its
 investigation in Mbandaka in February, following its withdrawal to the capital in
 December 1997 for security reasons after the team faced local protests. In March
 a forensics team that was attempting to investigate a reported massacre site at the
 village of Wendji outside Mbandaka met with protests from villagers, and withdrew
 to Kinshasa. Also in March a small investigative team deployed to Goma in North
 Kivu province to begin investigations. In April an investigator on this team was ex-
 pelled from Goma, and detained at Njili airport in Kinshasa by members of the se-
 curity forces, who seized investigation documents in his possession. On April 20, the
 U.N. Secretary General withdrew the Investigative Team from the country, citing
 a pattern of obstruction on the part of government authorities. In May the Inves-
 tigative Team issued its report, which concluded that ADFL troops, with the partici-
 pation of Rwandan forces, deliberately killed hundreds of unarmed civilian refugees
 in various incidents from October 1996 to May 1997 (see Section 1.g.).
 Members of RCD forces also reportedly used violence to impede the work of
 human rights advocates. On August 6, RCD soldiers in Lemera reportedly killed
 Jacques Semurongo, a Protestant Christian clergyman and member of a Bukavu-
 based human rights NGO called Heretiers de la Justice; his killers allegedly told
 his wife that he was killed for passing information to foreign human rights organi-
 zations. On August 9, RCD authorities reportedly arrested and detained another
 member of the same organization, Jean Paul Bengehya. Armed RCD personnel re-
 portedly were stationed outside the office of Heretiers de la Justice starting on Au-
 gust 23, and two members of the organization reportedly received threats and fled
 the RCD-controlled zone in September.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The previous Constitutions forl~ade discrimination based on ethnicity, sex, or reli-
 gious affiliation, but the Government did not enforce these prohibitions effectively,
 and acted with extreme official prejudice against members of the Tutsi ethnic group
 after the start of the civil war. Societal discrimination remained an obstacle to the
 advancement of certain groups, particularly women, Tutsis, Muslims, and the indig-
 enous Pygmy (Batwa) people.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including rape, is common, but there
 are no known government or NGO statistics on the extent of this violence. The po-
 lice rarely intervene in domestic disputes. Rape is a crime, but the press rarely re-
 ported incidents of violence against women or children. Press reports of rape gen-
 
 
 96
 erally appear only if rape occurs in conjunction with another crime, rarely because
 of the act of rape itself.
 Women are relegated to a secondary role in society. They comprise the majority
 of primary agricultural laborers, and small-scale traders and are almost exclusively
 responsible for child rearing. In the nontraditional sector, women commonly receive
 less pay for comparable work. Only rarely do they occupy positions of authority or
 high responsibility. Women also tend to receive less education than men. Women
 are required by law to obtain their spouse's permission before engaging in routine
 legal transactions, such as selling or renting real estate, opening a bank account,
 accepting employment, or applying for a passport. A 1987 revision of the Family
 Code permits a widow to inherit her husband's property, to control her own prop-
 erty, and to receive a property settiement in the event of divorce. In practice, some-
 times consistent with customary law, women are denied these rights. Widows com-
 monly are stripped of all possessions-as well as their dependent children-by the
 deceased husband's family. Human rights groups and church organizations are
 working to combat this custom, but there is generally no government intervention
 or legal recourse. Women also are denied custody of their children in divorce cases,
 but they retain the right to visit them. Polygyny is practiced although it is illegal.
 Father-child relationships resulting from polygynous unions are recognized legally,
 but only the first wife is recognized legally as a spouse.
 Children.-Government spending on children's programs is nearly nonexistent.
 Primary school education is not compulsory, free, or universal. In public schools,
 parents are required formally to pay a small fee, but parents often are expected in-
 formally to pay teachers' salaries. Dire economic circumstances often hamper par-
 ents' ability to cover these added expenses, meaning that children may not be able
 to attend school. Most schools function only in areas where parents have formed co-
 operatives.
 There are no documented cases in which security forces or others targeted chil-
 dren for specific abuse, although children suffer from the same conditions of gener-
 alized social disorder and widespread disregard for human rights that affect society
 as a whole. These conditions sometimes render parents unable to meet their chil-
 dren's basic human needs.
 Some children as young as 10 years of age were allowed to enlist as soldiers in
 the FAC. The Government has not taken comprehensive measures to remove all
 child soldiers from its armed forces. The number of very young soldiers appears to
 have declined as military training programs produced new adult recruits. However,
 child soldiers remain a very significant presence. Credible reports indicated that
 RCD rebel forces forcibly conscripted boys as young as 10 years.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not widespread, but
 it is practiced on young girls among isolated groups in the north. The Government
 has not addressed the problem.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for the disabled. There are some special schools, many with
 missionary staff, that use private funds and limited public support to provide edu-
 cation and vocational training to blind and physically disabled students.
 Indigenous People.-There is a population of fewer than 10,000 Pygmies (Batwa),
 who are believed to have been the country's original human inhabitants. Societal
 discrimination against them continued. Although citizens, most Pygmies continued
 to live in remote areas and took no part in the political process.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The last official census was taken in 1984.
 It is estimated that the population is now 45 to 50 million, and comprises more than
 200 separate ethnic groups. These groups generally are concentrated regionally and
 speak distinct primary languages. There is no majority ethnic group; the four larg-
 est ethnic groups are the Mongo, Luba, Congo and Mangbetu-Azande, who together
 make up about 45 percent of the population. Four indigenous languages-Kiswahili,
 Lingala, Kikongo and Tshiluba-have official status. French is the language of gov-
 ernment, commerce, and education.
 Societal discrimination on the basis of ethnicity is widely practiced by members
 of virtually all ethnic groups, and is evident in private hiring and buying patterns,
 and in patterns of de facto ethnic segregation in some cities; however, intermarriage
 across major ethnic and regional divides is quite common in large cities. There were
 accusations that President Kabila used disproportionate numbers of Katangans in
 his Government, but the distribution of ministerial and senior military positions did
 not appear to reflect such favoritism. The Government had representatives from all
 regions and major tribal groups before the August rebellion; afterwards, ethnic
 Tutsis were largely absent from the government.
 
 
 97
 Interethnic violence between Tutsis and Hutus in the east of the country, spilling
 over from neighboring Rwanda and Burundi, contributed both to the 1997 rebellion
 against Mobutu and to the civil war during the year, during which serious human
 rights abuses including mass extrajudicial killings were committed both by and
 against members of the Tutsi ethnic minority. The Mobutu government's failure to
 prevent Hutu nongovernmental armed groups from operating out of the country's
 eastern regions to attack Tutsis both in the country and in neighboring countries
 led Congolese Tutsi militias and the Tutsi-dominated Government of Rwanda to
 support Kabila's insurgency in 1996, and their support was instrumental to the suc-
 cess of that insurgency in 1997. The current civil war was precipitated by the Kabila
 Government's attempt to expel from the country Rwandan military forces on which
 Congolese Tutsis and the governments of Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda relied for
 security against hostile nongovernmental armed groups operating out the country's
 eastern regions, including several groups composed chiefly of Hutu refugees from
 Rwanda and Burundi.
 Birth on national territory reportedly does not necessarily confer citizenship. The
 Government continued not to recognize the citizenship claims of longtime residents
 whose ancestors immigrated to the country, including the Banyamulenge Tutsis. Ac-
 cording to some accounts, resentment of their noncitizen status contributed to the
 participation of many Tutsi residents of the country first in Kabila's rebellion
 against Mobutu and then in the RCD rebellion against Kabila.
 After the start of the civil war in August, ethnic Tutsis were subjected to serious
 abuses, including extrajudicial killings, both in the capital and elsewere, by govern-
 ment security forces and by some citizens for perceived or potential disloyalty to the
 regime (see Section 1.a.). In *inshasa and Katanga Province, Tutsis also were held
 in prolonged detention (see Section 1.d.). After the start of the civil war, ethnic
 Tutsis were largely absent from government. There were reports, several of them
 credible, that Tutsi-dominated rebel forces repeatedly committed extrajudicial mass
 killings of non-Tutsi civilians, sometimes including Hutus, in reprisal for
 extrajudicial mass killings of Tutsi civilians or local guerilla attacks on rebel units
 (see Section l.a.).
 During the civil war, Congolese Hutu militias increased their recruitment from
 populations of Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi in neighboring countries,
 including the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) and Zambia. Large armed groups of
 Hutus crossed into the country from the Republic of Congo; according to credible re-
 ports, these recruitments and movements occurred with the knowledge and consent
 of the Government, which welcomed the support of these Hutu groups in its fight
 against the Tutsi-dominated RCD rebels.
 Senior government officials reportedly represented the civil war as part of a larger
 supranational conflict between Bantus and Niotics; the Tutis speak a language
 that is part of the Nilotic language group, whereas most inhabitants of the country
 and of neighboring countries are members of ethnic groups whose languages are
 part of the Bantu language group. Similar Niltoic-Bantu rhetoric also appeared in
 private publications and broadcasts in the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Legislation in effect from the Mobutu period permits
 all workers except magistrates and military personnel to form and join trade unions.
 Before 1990 the law required all trade unions to affiliate with the National Union
 of Zairian Workers (UNTZA), the sole recognized labor confederation and which also
 formed part of Mobutu's Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR) party. When
 political pluralism was permitted in April 1990, the UNTZA disaffiliated itself from
 the MPR and reorganized under new leadership chosen through elections deemed
 fair by outside observers. After the ADFL takeover, the union renamed itself the
 National Union of Congolese Workers (UNTC). Although the UNTC remains the
 largest labor federation, almost 100 other independent unions are now registered
 with the Labor Ministry and two other large federations are active. Some affiliated
 with political parties or associated with a single industry or geographic area.
 The law recognizes the right to strike. However, legal strikes rarely occur since
 the law requires prior resort to lengthy mandatory arbitration and appeal proce-
 dures. Labor unions have not been able to defend effectively the rights of workers
 in the deteriorating economic environment. The law prohibits employers or the Gov-
 ernment from retaliating against strikers, but this prohibition rarely is enforced.
 Unions may affiliate with international bodies. The UNTC participates in the Or-
 ganization of African Trade Union Unity, and the Central Union of Congo is affili-
 ated with the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to bargain collectively, and an agreement between the UNTC and the Employers'
 
 
 98
 Association formerly provided for wages and prices to be jointly negotiated each year
 under minimal government supervision. This system, which functioned until 1991,
 broke down as a result of the rapid depreciation of the currency. The professional
 unions and the Congolese Business Federation signed a cooperative agreement in
 September 1997. While collective bargaining still exists in theory, continuing infla-
 tion encouraged a return to pay rates individually arranged between employers and
 employees.
 The collapse of the formal economy also has resulted in a decline in the influence
 of unions, a tendency to ignore existing labor regulations, and a buyer's market for
 labor. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, although this regulation
 was not strongly enforced strongly by the Ministry of Labor. The law also requires
 employers to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In the public sector, the
 Government sets wages by decree; public sector unions act only in an informal advi-
 sory capacity.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not known to occur, apart from forcible conscription (see Sec-
 tion 1.f.). The law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children,
 but such practices are not known to occur, apart from the forcible conscription of
 children (see Sections 1.f. and 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment is 18 years. Employers legally may hire minors be-
 tween the ages of 14 and 18 with the consent of a parent or guardian, but those
 under age 16 may work a maximum of 4 hours per day; those between the ages of
 16 and 18 may work up to 8 hours. The law prohibiting forced or compulsory labor
 does not specifically mention children, but there were no reports of such practices,
 apart from forced conscription (see Section 6.c.). Employment of children of all ages
 is common in the informal sector and in subsistence agriculture, which form the
 dominant portions of the economy. Such employment is often the only way a child
 or family can obtain money for food. Neither the Ministry of Labor, which is respon-
 sible for enforcement, nor the labor unions make an effort to enforce child labor
 laws. Larger enterprises do not commonly exploit child labor. The availability of
 education for children is extremely limited in practice (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Most citizens are engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture or commerce outside the formal wage sector. The minimum wage, last ad-
 justed by government decree in 1990, subsequently was rendered irrelevant by rapid
 inflation. The average wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a work-
 er and family. Most workers rely on the extended family and informal economic ac-
 tivity to survive. The maximum legal workweek (excluding voluntary overtime) is
 48 hours. One 24-hour rest period is required every 7 days.
 The Labor Code specifies health and safety standards. The Ministry of Labor offi-
 cially is charged with enforcing these standards, but it does not do so effectively.
 There are no provisions in the Labor Code permitting workers to remove themselves
 from dangerous work situations without penalty.
