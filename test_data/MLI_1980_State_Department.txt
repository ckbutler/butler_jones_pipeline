 MALI
 Mali is a one party state. Political power is concentrated
 in the Presidency. The year 1980 witnessed a retrenchment
 of the Malian leadership's attempts to restore full civilian
 control over the government and the inability of the single
 political party, the Democratic Union of the Malian People
 (UDPM), to mobilize broad-based political support for Presi-
 dent Moussa Traore's regime. 1980 thus contrasted unfavor-
 ably with 1979, which was a year of considerable promise in
 the area of general political liberalization. Disorder and
 dissent in the educational sector resulted from student
 demands for increased subsidies to compensate for inflation.
 The movement quickly turned political, and, late in the
 academic year, teachers joined in the protests. The govern-
 ment, hard-pressed to animate the UDPM to play an active and
 effective role in generating support for the regime, had
 little patience with the dissenting students and teachers
 and instituted measures which further exacerbated the
 problem. This situation, combined with the government's
 inability to pursue its commitment to liberalization and
 with the failure of the newly established national assembly
 to achieve significant influence in the decision-making
 process, contributed to a perceptible decline in the
 respect for human rights. The government is committed
 to addressing the needs of the poor, but an inexorable
 decline in the gross national product , corruption, and
 poor management pose enormous obstacles to these policies.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution reaffirms the rights and liberties ennunci-
 ated in the universal declaration of human rights. Never-
 theless, during 1980 the Malian government admitted that
 one student leader had died in detention, and it is reported
 that he died as the result of physical mistreatment. Other
 dissident students are reported to have been subjected to,
 very cruel treatment in order to extract information.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are credible accounts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment of student dissidents at the time of arrest or
 shortly afterward. On occasion police resort to physical
 abuse to extract information from suspected felons.
 Knowledge of prison conditions is limited. Conditions are
 severe. Prisoners usually have access to family, friends,
 attorneys, and others, except when, as is frequent with
 political prisoners, they are confined in remote northern
 areas where the terrain acts as a maximum security environ-
 ment. During September, an imprisoned teachers' union
 leader reportedly died in prison, apparently as a result of
 inadequate medical care. Malian law does not recognize the
 principle of habeus corpus or its equivalent.

 c. Disappearances
 Although arrests are often unpublicized, there are no
 reports of. instances of clandestine or unacknowledged
 incarceration or disappearance.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have been instances of arbitrary arrests and imprison-
 ment, traditionally in connection with "political offenses."
 In 1980 dissident students and teachers were also subject to
 such arrests. There have been instances of both limited and
 prolonged detention without formal charges, the former
 relating especially to students and teachers arrested
 this year and the latter pertaining to earlier cases of
 political leaders suspected of "treason."
 The confrontation between students and the government
 during the 1979-1980 academic year resulted first in random
 arrests of dissidents and later in harsh crowd control
 methods, and culminated in mass arrests and in mistreatment
 of selected dissident leaders. In December 1979, some 270
 students summarily were inducted into the Malian army and
 held for several weeks. In March 1980, certain student
 leaders were detained, and one died in detention, apparently
 as the result of physical abuse. Near the close of the
 academic year, teachers joined the confrontation and several
 dozen teachers also were reported summarily detained follow-
 ing a boycott of final examinations.
 There are probably several dozen long-term political pris-
 oners, most of whom also have been convicted on corruption
 charges pressed following arrests for "political offenses."
 Several of the prominent defendants arrested following the
 1978 coup attempt were retried on corruption charges during
 the past year after the original verdicts were challenged.
 During the trials, additional inculpatory evidence was intro-
 duced, and the convictions were confirmed. The number of
 prisoners is probably decreasing as those considered too
 old or too sick to pose a threat to the regime are released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Pretrial and trial proceedings conform, for the most part,
 to French practice. Pretrial proceedings are sometimes
 protracted, lasting up to a month and more. During deten-
 tion, defendants are made available to prosecuting and
 defense attorneys for prolonged questioning, and delays
 may also result from the institution of special courts.
 Trials, on the other hand, are often very short; the
 September 1980 trial of 12 leaders of an unauthorized
 teachers' union was completed in one day, and trials for
 high government officials convicted of treason in 1978 were
 completed in two days. The appeals process generally
 results in the presentation of important verdicts to the
 president, who may issue pardons or call for a new trial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Although article 12 of the constitution guarantees the invio-
 lability of the home, house-to-house searches sometimes take
 place in the context of some specific political incident
 
 
 165
 or iQesn hoarding of scarce mmucities is suspected. C a few thasions,e
 government has confiscated property to meet shortages in the
 public sector but has provided receipts for redemption when
 supplies are more plentiful.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Mali's government remains publicly committed to the goal of
 economic development and a better quality of life, and its
 policies are officially focused on responding to the needs of
 the poor. The general trend of real per capita GNP has
 drifted downward in the 20-year period since independence.
 Poverty is widespread and all-pervasive. Access to health
 care depends to some extent on proximity to the larger towns;
 a public health mechanism is provided for salaried government
 employees, but most people receive little or no help. The
 government has stated its commitment to provide health care
 at the village level and has encouraged several donor-
 supported projects with this aim.
 Education is listed in the constitution as a right of all
 Malians and is virtually free, but impact is limited to
 approximately 20 percent of the population. This percentage
 has been rising steadily in recent years, and Mali's largest
 budgetary expenditure (30 percent) is for education.
 Economic development programs are aimed at improving the
 lives of the country's overwhelmingly rural agricultural and
 nomadic population. Bamako's rapidly increasing indigent
 population, often unemployed and the victim of drought-
 induced dislocation, continues to be the subject of intense
 concern.
 Well-defined family responsibilities play an important
 role in supplying a buffer for many Malians against unemploy-
 ment, deprivation and old age. These responsibilities extend
 to other Malians who, although not part of the family, serve
 in a retainer status and are, in turn, extended assistance.
 Women have entered government employment in significant
 numbers in recent years and are represented in Mali's small
 processing sector.
 The steady deterioration in the economic situation of
 the general population has heightened the contrast with
 the enrichment of certain government officials by corrupt
 means. President Traore has sought publicly to reduce
 corruption through frequent warnings and periodic discip-
 lining of some government officials. Nonetheless, corruption
 remains a pervasive and persistent problem.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The new Malian constitution imposes constraints on opposition
 to the incumbent regime or to the national political party,
 and grants substantial powers to the president. Organized
 political activity is permitted only under the auspices of
 the single political party, the UDPM, headed by the president.
 
 
 166
 The party incorporates special organizations for women, youth
 and labor.
 Freedom of the press is not specifically guaranteed by the
 constitution. The state controls all Malian media and
 does not permit them to make any direct criticism of its
 authority. Private publication of unauthorized opinions
 on political or economic policy questions is not permitted
 and exposes authors, distributors and recipients to the
 possibility of arrest. Divergent views on government policy
 occasionally filter upward, but always with the risk of
 incurring official displeasure against those promoting such
 views. President Traore does, however, publicly encourage
 criticism of various government departments during his visits
 within Mali.
 The labor movement is weak and subject to close government
 monitoring. Although the constitution guarantees the right
 to strike and the right of all persons to organize and belong
 to unions or professional organizations of their choice, in
 practice this is not the case. In 1980, attempts by students
 and teachers to exercise these rights resulted in government
 repression.
 Malians are free to assemble for religious and social
 purposes. While the majority religion is Islam, Christian
 missionaries report that in recent years religious freedom
 has been more widespread than at any time in Malian history.
 Although the Baha'i sect is forbidden to propagate its views,
 its members and those of all other sects are free to practice
 their religion without hinderance.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Except for a ban on students' and teachers' travel during
 June through September 1980, freedom of movement in Mali has
 been generally unrestricted. Intercity travelers are some-
 times subject to police checks, especially at night; these
 are allowed by law, obstensibly to restrict movement of
 contraband goods. There are no barriers to emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The only legal political party, the UDPM, is endowed by
 the constitution with wide-ranging powers vis-a-vis the
 legislature and, to a certain extent, the executive. Presi-
 dent Traore's role as secretary general of the party permits
 him to exercise direct control over many aspects of the new
 legislative system as well as over the party itself. The
 party, established in 1979, is to function as the main
 vehicle for articulating the popular will but has yet to
 fulfill that role. There has been widespread dissatisfaction
 with the government's orchestration of the process of transi-
 tion to constitutional and civilian rule. This has resulted
 in apathy and some cynicism about the president's commitment
 to democracy. In the 1979 municipal elections, however, the
 single-party slates proposed for several major towns were
 rejected by the voters, who proposed and elected slates more
 to their liking.

 While women participate freely in Malian politial process
 and are represented at all levels of the government and
 the party, the paucity of women officials reflect women's
 traditionally subordinate status. Nevertheless, a woman
 cabinet minister (minister of information) was appointed
 late in 1980, there is a female member of the party's
 central executive bureau, and two female deputies in the
 82-seat national assembly. The woman's auxiliary of the
 party, the National Union of Malian Women, has strong
 leadership and plays an active role in defending the rights
 of women.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation
 of Human Rights
 There do not appear to be any currently outstanding requests
 for outside investigation of human rights conditions in Mali.
 Amnesty International Report of 1980 complains of brutal
 behavior by authorities and police toward student demonstra-
 tors in February and March 1980, in line with the descrip-
 tion given Section ld above. Amnesty International reports
 that such detainees were released at the end of March 1980,
 although it could not confirm the safe return of all students
 to their homes. Amnesty International also reports a meet-
 ing held between President Traore and its representatives in-
 Paris on April 17, 1980 during which Amnesty International's
 concerns were discussed.
