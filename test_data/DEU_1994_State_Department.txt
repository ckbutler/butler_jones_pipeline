 GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy.
 The head of the Federal Government, the Chancellor is elected by the lower house
 of Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor and of the Parliament are set forth in
 the Basic Law (Germany's Constitution). The 16 states enjoy significant autonomy,
 especially as concerns law enforcement and the courts, education, the environment,
 and social assistance.
 Law enforcement is primarily a responsibility of state governments, and the police
 are organized at the state level. The jurisdiction of the Federal Criminal Office is
 limited to international organized crime especially narcotics trafficking, weapons
 smuggling, and currency counterfeiting. Poice forces are well trained, disciplned,
 and mindful of citizens' rights. However, there were isolated instances of police
 abuse of prisoners, particularly foreigners, in several cities, including Berlin, Ham-
 burg, an Leizi.
 Gormany's highly advaned economy affords its residents a high standard of liv-
 ing. During 1994 the economic situation in eastern Germany improved significantly
 as adjustment to the market economy quickened. While there continued to be sub-
 stantial numbers of workers in the east who were unemployed, underemployed, tm-
 porarily employed or in training programs, or retiring early, each of these categories
 decreased Unemployment in the east continued to affect women disproportionately
 more than men. Unemployment in the west eased notably during the latter half of
 the year.
 The Basic Law provides extensively for the free exercise of individual rights, and
 various laws provide recourse against racial and ethnic intolerance. The Govern-
 ment enforces these provisions. However, violence or harassment directed at foreign-
 ers continued to occur. Official data show that the number of violent offenses by
 rightwing extremists decreased by over one-third in the first 11 months of 1994
 compared with the same period in 1993. Rightwing extremist violence, having risen
 sharply in 1991 after German unification, peaked in 1992 and has since been declin-
 ing. Still, attacks on property or persons numbered about five times higher in 1994
 than in 1989, and foreigners were the victims somewhat more often than not.
 Anti-smitic incidents increased but remained low in absolute number. Most in-
 volved graffiti or distribution of anti-smitic materials. Especially notorious was a
 firebombig which significantly damaged the Luebeck Synagogue; this was the firt
 attack on a synagogue in Germany since the end of World War II.
 The overwhelming majoity of the perpetrators of attacks on foreigners or anti-
 Semitic acts were frustrated, apolitic  yuh  and a small core of neo-Nazis. All the
 major political parties and all the higeat officials of the Federal Republic de-
 nounced violence against foreigners an anti-Semitic acts, as did hundreds of thou-
 sands of citizens in public demonstrations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN BIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other trajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killing by agents of the Government. Police claimed that their shooting
 and riing of a 16-year-old Kurd in Hannover, in the course of arresting him for
 putting up posters of the banned Kurdish Workers Party, was accidental; but the
 farnis lawyer insisted the police were negligent. Some murders occurred among
 rival factions of Iranians, Kurds, Turks, and other foreign nationals; the federal and
 state authorities sought to find and prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes, and
 pressed charges in several trials.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions or secret arrests by gov-
 ernmental or police authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police in Hamburg, Leipzig  Berlin, and several smaller cities were accused of mis-
 treating foreigners. In Ha~ug  the state Interior Minister resigned, and 27 police-
 men were under suspension pending further investigation of such charges. During
 1994 as many as 51 Berlin police were suspended; and courts sentenced one police-
 man to a 3:year prison term, fined another, and placed two on probation, for mis-
 treating a Vietnamese asylum-seeker. Some foreign residents charged that Berlin
 authorities are reluctant to investigate fully such cagso a use.
 Generally, however, authorities throughout Germany responded swiftly to accusa-
 tions of police brutality, and punished officers found guilty of it. Berlin's Chief of
 Police complained publicly about the overcrowding antother poor conditions under
 which rejected asylum-seekers are being held in detention awaiting deportation (see
 Section 2.d.).
 
 
 822
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-To make an arrest, police must obtain
 a judicial warrant. By the day after arrest, police must bring the suspect before a
 judge and lodge a charge. The court must then either issue a warrant stating the
 grounds for detention or order release.
 There is no preventive detention. If there is evidence that the suspect might flee
 the country, police may detain the suspect for up to 24 hours pending a formal
 charge The right of free access to legal counsel has been restricted only in the cases
 of terrorists suspected of havin  used contacts with lawyers to continue terrorist ac-
 tivity while in prison. Only judges may decide on the validity of any deprivation of
 liberty. Bail exists but is seldom employed; the usual practice is to release detainees
 unless there is clear danger of flight outside the country. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due proc-
 ess and probibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of government interference.
 There are no political prisoners.
 In the trial of a neo-Nazi leader charged with inciting violence because of his de-
 nial of the Holocaust, the court's decision provoked widespread criticism for its ap-
 parent sympathy for the accused's ideology. In explaining why it handed down only
 a suspended sentence, the court extolled the accused's integrity and showed under-
 standing for his motivations. The presiding judge was temporarily removed from his
 seat "for continuous health problems.!
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Mome, or Conespondence.-The
 Basic Law provides for inviolability of the home, and the authorities respect these
 provisions. Prior to forcibly entering a home, police must obtain a warrant from a
 judge or, in an emergency, a public prosecutor. For electronic surveillance of tele-
 phone lines or monitoring of mail, police must obtain a court order.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Basic Law, an independent press, an effec-
 tive judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure free-
 dom of speech and the press. There is no official censorship. However, Nazi propa-
 ganda and that of other proscribed organizations are illegal. Statements endorsing
 Nazism are also illegal.
 Newspapers and magazines are privately owned, with some companies controlling
 a significant part of the market. The major radio and television networks and sta-
 tions function as corporations under special public laws; they are governed by inde-
 pendent boards made up of representatives of churches, political parties, and other
 organizations. Alongside this system, commercial television and radio have become
 increasingly important since the late 1980's. The former East German broadcasting
 outlets have been integrated into an all-German system.
 b. Freedom of Peacef d AssembY and Association.-The law provides for free exer-
 cise of the rights of assembly and association, and the authorities respect these pro-
 visions. Organizers of demonstrations must first obtain police permits, and may be
 asked to pay a deposit to cover repair of any damage to public facilities. Permits
 are routinely granted. When demonstrators have not obtained permits, police have
 exercised restraint, showing concern primarily for the functioning of public facilities
 and for public safety.
 The Basic Law permits banning political parties found to be "fundamentally anti-
 democratic." A 1950's ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court outlawed a neo-
 Nazi and a Communist party. State governments may outlaw only organizations
 that are active solely within their state. If a group's activities cross state lines, the
 Federal Government assumes jurisdiction.
 Four far-right political groups, not organized as political parties, were banned in
 late 1992. The Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), along with 35 subsidiary organiza-
 tions, was banned in 1993. Also in 1993, the Federal Government asked the Con-
 stitutional Court to ban the far-right Free German Workers' Party; the Court's deci-
 sion is still pending. Several extremist parties are currently under observation by
 the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV, the internal security service),
 although such monitoring may not by law interfere with the organizations' contin-
 ued activities. The BFV reported that 42,000 people belonged to far-right organiza-
 tions in 1994, of whom some 5,600 were considered violence-prone.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government fully supports religious freedom. Most
 of the population belongs to the Catholic or Protestant Churches. These denomina-
 tions and the small Jewish community hold a special legal status as corporate bod-
 ies under public law, giving them, for instance, the rigt to partici pate in a state-
 administered church tax system. The Government subsidizes church-affiliated
 schools and provides religious instruction in schools and universities for those be-
 longing to the Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish faith.
 
 
 823
 Members of the Church of Scientology continue to complain of harassment such
 as being fired from ajob or   lied from (or not permitted to join) a political party.
 Scientlogists ontinued to take such grievances to ourt. Musician Chick Corea, a
 Scientologist, was permitted to appear in a government-subsidized concert hall in
 the state of Hesse only after an agreement with local officials that he would not
 proseyie during his performance.
 d. Freedom of Mooement Within the Country, Forgn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation--German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country, to trav-
 el abroad, to emigrate, and to repatriate, without restrictions that violate human
 ior ethnic Germans entering the country, the Basic Law provides both for citizen-
 ship immediately upon application and for legal residence without restrictions. Per-
 sons not of German ethnicity may acquire citizenship (and with it the right of unre-
 stricted residence) if they meet certain requirements, including legal residence in
 Germany for at least 10 years (5 if married to a German), renunciation of all other
 citizenships, and a basic command of the German language. Long-term legal resi-
 dents often opt not to apply; they receive the same social benefits as do citizens,
 and after 10 years of legal residency they are entitled to permanent residency. Rep-
 resentatives of the Turkish and Roma communities in G-ermany have criticized the
 citizenship picy as unjust and discriminatory, and have opposed in particular Ger-
 many's policy against dual nationality.
 The Basic Law provides for the right of foreign victims of political persecution to
 attain asylum in Germany. However, since an amendment of the asylum law took
 effect July 1, 1993, tightening the criteria for granting asylum, applications have
 dropped sharply. Indications are that applications in 1994 were fewer than in any
 year since 1989.
 Under the tightened criteria, persons coming directly from any country that Ger-
 man officials designate as a "safe country of origin" cannot normally claim political
 asylum, but can request an administrative review of their applications while in Ger-
 many. Persons entering Germany via a "safe third country"-any country in the Eu-
 ropean Union or adhering to the Geneva Convention-are also ineligible for asylum.
 The legislated changes also limited legal recourse against denials of asylum appli-
 cations. Critics argued that few countries can assuredly be designated as "safe third
 countries" and that the law unjustly fails to allow applicants to rebut such designa-
 tions. While the law permits appeals against designations of "safe countries of ori-
 gin," critics protested that the 48-hour period allotted for hearings is too brief.
 Asylum-seekers with applications under review enjoy virtually the full range of
 civil rights except the right to vote. While less than 5 percent of applicants have
 attained political asylum, denial does not automatically result in deportation; most
 rejected applicants are allowed to remain in the country for humanitarian reasons,
 especially those from the former Yugoslavia.
 However, applicants who have been conclusively denied asylum are placed in de-
 tention pending deportation; and some police lockups, particularly in Berlin, are
 overcrowded andlor otherwise seriously substandard. Seven asylum-seekers in the
 capital were held for several months in cells intended only for very brief detentions.
 To improve conditions for detainees, Berlin authorities began to use nonprison facili-
 ties vacated by departing U.S. military units, and proceeded with construction of a
 new detention center scheduled for completion in 1995.
 Deportation became rather more common, however, due not only to the amended
 asylum criteria but also to an agreement with Romania in late 1992 on the return
 of rejected Romanian asylum-seekers, primarily Roma. Under the agreement, Ger-
 many pays all transportation costs and provides financial assistance to Romania to
 help reintegrate those returning.
 Vietnamese asylum-seekers pose a special problem. Since the 1993 amendments
 of the asylum criteria, only 2 percent of Vietnamese applicants have been granted
 asylum; but the Government has been unable to repatriate the rejected Vietnamese,
 because Vietnam requires its returning citizens to hold re-entry visas but has re-
 fused to issue such visas to those in Germany.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Under the Basic Law, the Government is elected on the basis of universal suffrage
 and secret balloting. Members of the Parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, are
 elected from a mixture of direct-constituency and party-list candidates. The upper
 house, the Bundesrat, is composed of delegations from state governments. The Basic
 Law and the state constitutions stipulate that parties must receive at least 5 per-
 cent of the vote (or 3 directly elected seats in federal elections) in order to be rep-
 resented in the federal or state parliaments.
 
 
 824
 The law entitles women to participate fully in political life, and a growing number
 are prominent in the Government and the parties, but women are still substantially
 underrepresentd in those ranks. Slightly over 26 percent of the Federal Parliament
 is female, including its President. Women occupy 3 of 16 cabinet positions. One state
 minister president is a woman. On the Federal Constitutional Court, 4 of the 16
 judges are women, including the Chief Justice. All of the parties have undertaken
 to enlist mre women. The Greens require_ that women comprise half of the parys
 elected officials. The Social Democrats have a 40-percent quota for women on all
 party committees and governing bodies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Private nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely in all of Ger-
 many, as d international organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits denial of access to shelter, health care, or education on the
 basis of race, religion, disability, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or citizen-
 ship.
 Women.-The law generally treats women's rights as equal to men's, including
 property and inheritance rights. Women are beset by institutional and attitudinal
 barriers in some traditionally male fields, but recent court rulings and government
 programs have helped break down some of the barriers. On September 1 the 'Sec-
 on Law on the Implementation of Equal Rights for Women and Men' took force,
 mandating that government agencies establish promotion plans for women, appoint
 officials for women's issues, and take various other such measures; it also provides
 more stringent sanctions against sexual harassment in the workplace.
 Salaries for women in the private sector tend to be lower than for men in similar
 jobs. The Labor Ministry has acknowledged that unequal, sex-differentiated pay
 scales in the private sector violate the Basic Law's ban on gender-based discrimfna-
 tion. Several decisions by the National Labor Court in recent years have been in
 favor of women who initiated litigation to redress pay inequities. Such inequities are
 also thrashed out in collective bargaining between unions and firms.
 In 1994 the unemployment rate for women in the eastern states continued to
 climb faster than the rate for men. In that region women now comprise over two-
 thirds of all unemployed workers, and as of midyear (latest data) the rate of unem-
 ployment in the female work force was over 21 percent while the figure was 10 per-
 cent for the male work force.
 In 1993 the Federal Constitutional Court declared that abortion violates the Basic
 Law's prvision regarding right to life.
 The Court ruled that first-trimester abortions would not be prosecutable, provided
 that the women received counseling beforehand and that doctors performed the
 abortion. It also ruled that the Government could provide assistance for abortion
 only in cases of rape, mortal danger to the mother, or grave deformation of the
 fetus. The ruling struck down 1992 legislation which attempted to reconcile the
 former East Germany's liberal abortion laws with the Federal Government's strict
 paoicies. In 1994 the parties in the Parliament were unable to agree on an amended
 lw.
 Neither the law nor the authorities condone wife beating or other violence against
 women. In recent years the Federal Ministry for Women and Youth commissioned
 a number of studies to gain information on violence against women, sexual harass-
 ment, and other matters. Police statistics on rape showed a slight decrease to 5,527
 cases in 1993 (latest data) from 5 568 in the previous year.
 Children.-There is no culturally based pattern of abuse of human rights of chil-
 dren in Germany. The Government nevertheless recognizes that violence against
 children is a problem requiring its attention. The Ministry for Women and Youth
 released data in August 1993 (latest available) citing 16,442 reported incidents of
 sexual abuse and 1,732 reports of other physical abuse of children in the previous
 year. Officials believe that the numbers of unreported cases may be 10 to 20 times
 higher. They estimate that in about three-fourths of the cases of sexual abuse
 against children, the perpetrator is a family member-in one-third, the child's bio-
 logial father.
 V light of these figures, the Ministry for Women and Youth pledged to continue
 a cam p ign initiated in 1992 to foster public awareness of the scale of the problem
 and of its symptoms. The Child and Youth Protection Law stresses the need for pre-
 ventive measures, and the Ministry has taken account of this in stepping up its
 counseling and other assistance.
 
 
 825
 
 The German Criminal Code was amended in 1993 to further protect children
 against pornography and sexual abuse. For possession of child pornography, the
 maximum sentence is 1 year's imprisonment; for distribution, 5 years. The amend-
 ment made sexual abuse of children by German citizens abroad punishable even if
 the action is not illegal in the child's own country.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Police data show the number of violent of-
 fenses by rightwing extremists decreased by almost one-third in the first half of
 1994 compared with the same period in 1993, continuing a downtrend since 1992.
 As in previous years, most of these offenses (over 56 percent) were directed against
 foreign residents, but since 1993 there has been a sharper decline in xenophobic of-
 fenses (such as beatings of foreigners or arson attacks on asylum homes) than in
 other kinds of manifestations of rightwing extremist violence; the number decreased
 b 29 percent in 1993 and by 53 percent in the first half of 1994 compared with
 te firsit half of 1993.
 Since late 1993 officials and courts have generally dealt with extremist crimes
 more vigorously than previously. In December 1993 a court convicted two arsonists
 for a fatal attack in MoelIn and gave them the maximum sentences-life imprison-
 ment for one, and 10 years for his juvenile accomplice.
 After the most notorious incident in 1994, a rampage on May 12 in Magdeburg
 in which at least fifty youths chased five Africans through downtown streets and
 beat them while bystanders did little or nothing, the perpetrators were arrested,
 tried, and sentenced to even longer prison terms than the prosecution had re-
 quested. Also in Magdeburg, a court gave four youths 9- to 24-month jail terms for
 1991 attacks on foreigners and political activists.
 A court sentenced two participants in the 1993 attack on US. athletes in Oberhof
 to jail terms of 32 and �2 mofiths, respectively, without parole; for four others it
 ordered probation or community service.
 Three of the four suspects in a Berlin assault on a Ghanaian national, who was
 stabbe    d thrown from a moving streetear, were released; although the remaining
 detainee retracted a confession, he remains jailed.
 In another case, three young men accused of assaulting a Ghanaian in a street
 car in Halle in March were given jail terms of 2 to 4 years.
 In Potsdam, in a case of abuse of an Angolan worker and denial of his lierty,
 a court sentenced two of the three defendants to 4 and 2 years, respectively, the
 latter with added community service; the third, who was the apparent instigator of
 the offense, hanged himself in jaiL
 At year's end, authorities were still investigating the firbombngs of two private
 Turkish organizations in Baden-Wuerttemberg. Also continuing was the court trial
 of the alleged perpetrators of a fatal 1993 arson attack in Solingen.
 Perpetrators of rightwing violence were-predominantly young, male, and low in
 socioeconomic status, often committing such acts while inebriated. As in the past,
 most acts of violence against minority groups were committed spontaneously. Also
 as in the past, there was evidence tat noNaz groups were making effrts for
 greater coordination among themselves.
 In addition to voicing condemnation of the violence, the Government rec-
 ommended tougher anticrime legislation and law-enforcement measures, as well as
 measures aimed at the societal roots of extremist violence and other crime. In the
 eastern states, governments introduced several model social and educational pro-
 grams designed to counteract the root causes of xenophobia and intolerance, and
 they undertook efforts to reinvigorate enforcement of laws against violence by ex-
 tremists. For such projects, however, state governments have tus far allocated only
 limited funds in their tight budgets.
 Although police in the eastern states continued to become better versed in the fed-
 eral legal system, better trained, and more experienced, by years end they had not
 yet achieved the standards of effectiveness characteristic of the police in the rest
 of Germany. However, they did score greater success in combating rightwing vio-
 lence, in part due to special task forces created in many states. For example, after
 neo-Nazis in more than 30 cities were denied permission to hold gatherings to com-
 memorate the death of Rudolf Hess, there was concern that some neo-Naigo       s
 might nevertheless stage such rallies, as one had succeeded in doing inFla mn
 1993; but state and federal authorities cooperated closely, deployed police in force,
 and succeeded in completely preventing demonstrations.
 Sinti and Roma leaders accused the Government of discriminatory behavior in
 failing to deignate Sinti and Roma as a national minority (similar to the status ac-
 corded ethnic Danes and Sorbs) and of a generally hostile attitude toward them.
 Religious Minoritis.-Anti-Semitic acts increased, with 937 incidents reported in
 the first 9 months of 1994. The worst was the firebombing of the 100-year-old syna-
 
 
 826
 gogue in Luebeck on March 25. Police investigation led to quick arrest of the alleged
 perpetrators, who at year's end were awaiting trial.
 Over 90 percent of anti-Semitic incidents involved graffiti, the distribution of anti-
 Semitic materials or the display of symbols of banned organizations. There were
 three cases of bodily injury and 42 cases of monument desecration. In July, for ex-
 ample, 22 skinheads vandalized the former concentration camp at Buchenwald, but
 police were able to apprehend all the perpetrators before they left the scene. A fed-
 eral court ordered retrial of two youths who had been acquitted in October 1993 of
 a charge of arson in the September 1992 burning of the Jewish barracks at the
 former Sachsenhausen concentration camp. There were further incidents of vandal-
 ism at the Sachsenhausen site in 1994.
 People With Disabilities.-By law, anyone who is physically or mentally disabled
 is entitled to assistance to avert, eliminate, or improve the disability, prevent a de-
 terioration of it, or alleviate its consequences and secure a place in society (particu-
 larly in the workplace) according to his or her abilities. The authorities respect the
 rights of the disabled. The social system provides medical and financial benefits for
 persons who are or become disabled. The Government offers them vocational train-
 ag, and it offers grants for employers who hire the handicapped. Severely disabled
 persons may be granted spcial benefits, such as tax breaks, free public transport,
 special parking faciities, and exemption from radio and television fees.
 The Federal Government has established guidelines for attainment of "barrier-
 free" public buildings, and for modifications of streets and pedestrian traffic walks
 to accommodate disabled persons. While it is up to the individual states to incor-
 porate these guidelines into building codes, all 16 states now have access facilities
 for the handicapped.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to associate freely, choose representatives,
 determine programs and policies to represent workers' interests, and publicize views
 is recognized and freely exercised. Seine 39 percent of the total eligible labor force
 belongs to unions. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) represents 85 per-
 cent of organized workers, and participates in various international and European
 trade union organizations.
 The law provides for the right to strike, except for civil servants (including teach-
 ers) and personnel in sensitive positions such as members of the armed forces. In
 the past the International Labor Organization (ILO) has criticized the Government's
 definition of 'essential services" as overly brad. The ILO was responding to com-
 plaints about sanctions imposed on teachers who struck in the state of H-esse in
 1989 and, earlier, the replacement of striking postal workers by civil servants. A
 combination of privatization and decisions by the Federal Labor Court may resolve
 at least some of the specific issues in a manner acceptable to the ILO.
 b. The Right to Organie and Bargain Collectively.-The Basic Law provides for
 the right to organize and bargain collectively, and this right is widely exercised. Due
 to a well-deveioped system of autonomous contract negotiations, resort to mediators
 is uncommon. Basic wages and working conditions are negotiated at the industry
 level and then are adapted, through local collective bargaining, to particular enter-
 prises.
 In 1994 some firms in eastern Germany refused to join employer associations, or
 withdrew from them, and then bargained independently with workers. Likewise,
 some large firnms in the west withdr~ew at least part of their work force from the
 jurisdiction of employer associations, complaining of rigidities in the centralized ne-
 gotiating system. The law mandates a system oa works councils and worker mem-
 bership on supervisory boards, and thus workers participate in the management of
 the enterprises in which they work. The law thoroughly protects workers against
 antiunion discrimination.
 Germany has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Basic Law prohibits forced or
 compulsory labor, and there were no known violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chthdren.-Federal law generally prohibits
 employment of children under age 15, with a few exceptions: those aged 13 or 14
 may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day, or may deiver newspapers for upto
 2 hours per day; those aged3 to 14 may take part in cultural performances, albeit
 under stringent curbs on the kinds of activity, number of hours, and time of day.
 The Federan Labor Ministry effectively enforces the law through its Factory Inspec-
 tion Bureau.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administratively de-
 termined minimum  wage. Wages and salaries are set either by collective ba raiing
 agreements between industrial unions and employer federations or by inevidua
 
 
 827
 contracts. Covering about 90 percent of all wage- and salary-earners, these agree-
 ments set minimum pay rates and are legally enforceable. These minimums provide
 an adequate standard of living for workers and their families. The number of hours
 of work per week is regulated by contracts that directly or indirectly affect 80 per-
 cent of the working population. The average workweek or industrial workers is 36.9
 hours in western -ermany and about 40 hours in the eastern states.
 An extensive set of laws and regulations on occupational safety and health incor-
 porates a growing body of European Union standards. These provide for the right
 to refuse to perform dangerous or unhealthy work without jeopardizing employment.
 A comprehensive system of worker-insurance carriers enforces safety requirements
 in the workplace. This system now applies in the eastern states, where lax stand-
 ards and conditions under the Communist regime created serious problems. The
 Labor Ministry and its counterparts in the states effectively enforce occupational
 safety and health standards through a network of government organs, including the
 Federal Institute for Work Safety. At the local level, professional and trade associa-
 tions-self-goveing public corporations with delegates both from the employers
 and from the unions-oversee worker safety.
