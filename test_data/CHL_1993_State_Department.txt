 CHILE
 Chilean democracy follows a Constitution written under the former military gov-
 ernment and approved by referendum in 1980, which places limits on popular rule.
 Chile held its second presidential and parliamentary elections under this Constitu-
 tion on December 11, and Eduardo Frei will assume the presidency on March 11,
 1994. Congress approved an amendment to the Constitution to limit presidential
 terms to 6 years-- the period he is expected to serve. The Congress is comprised
 of 120 Deputies and 18 Senators elected in December 1993, 20 Senators elected in
 1989, and 8 Senators appointed in 1990. While the governing coalition again won
 a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the eight senators appointed in 1990 by the
 former military government for 8-year terms continue to deprive the Government
 of a majority in the Senate. The constitutionally independent judicial branch re-
 mained largely dominated by appointees of the former military regime.

 The Constitution requires the armed forces to be subordinate to the President,
 with the Minister of Defense, a civilian appointed by the President, responsible for
 oversight of the military. In practice the armed forces remain larely, autonomous
 institutions, and the civilian Government lacks independent authority to remove
 their commanders. The army deployed a small number of troops around its head-
 quarters in Santiago on May 28, and its officers appeared in combat dress for sev-
 eral days to express displeasure with civilian authorities over several issues, includ-
 ing judicial processing of past human rights violations. General Pinochet, the 78-
 year-old leader and only member of the 1973 military junta still on active duty, re-
 mains as Commander in Chief of the army, a position he may by law hold until
 March 1998.
 The Carabineros, Chile's uniformed national police, have primary responsibility
 for public order and safety, crime control, and border security. The Investigations
 Police are responsible for controlling and investigating serious crime. Both police or-
 ganizations, although formally under the administrative jurisdiction of the Ministry
 of Defense, fall under the operational control of the Ministry of Interior. Elements
 of the police forces were again responsible for human rights abuses. The Govern-
 ment asked for independent judicial investigations when police were accused of
 human rights violations, including the use of excessive force to control violent dem-
 onstrations and of torture to extract confessions.
 Chile's free market economy enjoyed its tenth consecutive year of expansion in
 1993. Economic growth, though slowed bylower world prices for Chile's principal
 exports, was estimated at over 5 percent. Unemployment remained less than 5 per-
 cent, near 20-year lows, while inflation was 12 percent, slightly less than the rate
 in 1992. Copper remains Chile's most important source of foreign exchange, followed
 by fresh fruit and fish meal.
 Four years after the transition to democracy, the principal human rights issues
 still involved redress for human rights abuses that occurred during the former mili-
 tary government's rule. Efforts to redress the abuses were shaped by often conflict-
 ing requirements for justice and national reconciliation. The Supreme Court has
 been reluctant to confront the military over human rights, and one justice was im-
 peached by Congress and removed from office for "gross neglect of duties" for his
 handling of a human rights case. Another Supreme Court justice sentenced com-
 manders of the former National Intelligence Directorate (DINA) as intellectual au-
 thors of the 1976 assassination in Washington, DC, of Orlando Letelier and Ronni
 Moffitt. Disputes continue over the interpretation of the 1978 amnesty law and pros-
 ecution of military personnel and their collaborators for abuses not covered by the
 amnesty. Other human rights abuses include torture and excessive use of force by
 the police, arbitrary arrests, instances of prior restraint of the press, discrimination
 against ethnic minorities and indigenous people, and violence against women and
 children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrojudicial Killing.-The Government was not respon-
 sible for political killings in 1993. In an important step toward ending the impunity
 of military officers involved in the Letelier case, Adolfo Banados, a Supreme Court
 justice appointed by the current Aylwin Government, sentenced retired General
 Manuel Contreras and Colonel Pedro Espinoza to 7- and 6-year prison terms, re-
 spectively, as intellectual authors of the 1976 murder in Washington, DC, of former
 Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and his American assistant Ronni
 Moffitt. The Supreme Court is expected to rule early in 1994 on appeals of the sen-
 tences by all parties. This is the only case involving the now dissolved DINA-the
 Pinochet-era secret police-that the 1978 amnesty law specifically excluded.
 Chilean police were responsible for some extrajudicial killings. In January Juan
 Acevedo, a 23-year-old forestry professional died in the southern port city of
 Constitucion after interrogation by the Investigations Police. A local judge found evi-
 dence of torture, and the Supreme Court appointed a special judge to continue the
 investigation. In February Luis Alberto Caniulaf died after being arrested by
 Carabineros for rape. The investigating judge ordered the arrest of three civilians
 and four Carabineros who were family members of the victim. The Carabineros were
 subsequently discharged from the police force. Both cases remained active in the
 courts at the end of the year.
 Police were also responsible for two deaths when demonstrations in Santiago
 sponsored by leftist and human rights groups on September 11, the 20th anniver-
 sary of the 1973 coup turned violent. Demonstrators threw rocks at police, erected
 barricades, overturned cars, and set fires. When police responded, a 66-year-old gov-
 
 
 ernment worker died when he was run over by a police vehicle carrying a water
 cannon, and Jose Araya Ortiz, an 18-year-old member of the Communist Youth, died
 of gunshot wounds probably the result of Carabinero fire. At the Government's re-
 quest, the Supreme Court appointed Appeals Court Judge Humberto Espejo to in-
 vestigate the incidents, but at year's endhis report had not been made public.
 Two terrorist groups, the dissident wing of the Manuel RodriguezPatriotic Front
 (FPMR/D) and the Lautaro Youth Movement, were responsible for most political vio-
 lence. Police made important arrests among the top leaders of these organizations
 in 1993, but terrorists continued to conduct violent, well-armed operations. Chilean
 terrorists killed one policeman and one maintenance worker and according to press
 reports six terrorists died in confrontations with the police through December . On
 March 25, the Investigations Police captured Lautaro's number two leader, Delfin
 Diaz, who reportedly masterminded a 1992 attack on the police. On August 5, Inves-
 tigations Police captured Mauricio Hernandez Norambuena, number two leader of
 the FPMR/D, who was accused of participating in the April 1991 murder of Senator
 Jaime Guzmnan and three attacks on American government representatives in Chile.
 The former military government enacted an amnesty law in 1978, the prime bene-
 ficiaries of which were those responsible for human rights abuses committed during
 the first 5 years of the military government's rule. The Aylwin administration inter-
 preted the amnesty law to mean that the courts should first determine the authors
 of human rights abuses before applying the amnesty. Legal reforms in 1991 re-
 manded most human rights cases from military to civilian jurisdiction. However,
 when the investigation showed that a crime was committed on a military base or
 military personnel were accused of the crime, military tribunals reclaimed jurisdic-
 tion, and the military courts applied the amnesty law to close the cases without de-
 termining the facts or criminal responsibility. These decisions led critics to charge
 that Chile's Supreme Court impeded justice for victims of human rights abuses com-
 mitted by the military forces.
 For example, the extradition of Osvaldo Romo Mena, who fled to Brazil in 1975,
 was sought by Appeals Court Judge Gloria Olivares to testify about the 1974 dis-
 appearance of Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) leader Alfonso Chanfreau,
 in whose apprehension Romo allegedly participated. The Brazilian Government ex-
 pelled Romo to Chile in November 1992, but before he could testify, a chamber of
 the Supreme Court, with Justice Hernan Cereceda presiding, granted the military
 courts jurisdiction over the investigation. The military court closed the case (and
 later reopened it to apply the amnesty). In response, the Chamber of Deputies voted
 along strict party lines to impeach the three Supreme Court justices and the Audi-
 tor General of the army who voted to transfer the Chanfreau case to military tribu-
 nals. The Deputies found that they had committed a "gross neglect of duties" for
 having applied procedural technicalities in the Chanfreau case and ignoring con-
 stitutional reforms intended to give the tenets of the American Convention on
 Human Rights precedence over domestic law. The opposition-controlled Senate was
 expected to reject the charges, but on January 25 three opposition National Renewal
 Senators joined the governing coalition to vote on one count to remove Cereceda, the
 second-ranking member of the Supreme Court, from office.
 Criticism of the Supreme Courts handling of human rights issues continued. The
 Court failed to reverse a military appeals court ruling against a serious injury find-
 ing by a lower court in the case involving Carmen Gloria Quintana, who was seri-
 ously burned in a confrontation with a military patrol in 1986, and Rodrigo Rojas,
 who died of burns. This case was the first in which a military court had ruled in
 favor of human rights victims, and human rights groups pointed to considerable evi-
 dence demonstrating the responsibility of military personnel in the crime.
 The Supreme Court also unanimously rejected a request from the Chamber of
 Deputies to assist the Argentine judge investigating the 1976 murder of former
 Army Commander General Carlos Prats and initially, by a narrow majority, refused
 the Foreign Ministry's request that it appoint a member of the Supreme Court to
 investigate the 1976 death of Carmelo Soria, a Spanish citizen employed by the
 United Nations. Soria's death in 1976 was attributed to a traffic accident, but Mi-
 chael Townley, a key witness in the Letelier case, admitted that Soria had been tor-
 tured and killed at Townley's home. In 1991 the Foreign Ministry requested that
 the case be reopened, and the Supreme Court appointed Appeals Court Judge
 Violets Guzman to investigate. She found evidence that two active duty colonels and
 four other former army officials who worked in the DINA had participated in Saria's
 murder. When she called them to testify as possible suspects, the military courts
 requested jurisdiction over the investigation, and on November 18 the third cham-
 ber of the Supreme Court granted jurisdiction to military courts.
 The Spanish Government informed Chile that the case had affected relations be-
 tween the two countries, and recalled its ambassador in December. The Foreign
 
 
 386
 Ministry asked the courts to use procedures envisioned in the 1991 judicial reforms
 to have a Supreme Court justice investigate the crime. On December 2 by a narrow
 majority, the Supreme Court rejected the Government's request on the basis that
 relations with Spain would not be affected. The case led some on the left to explore
 the possibility of impeaching some or all of the Supreme Court justices who voted
 against the Government's request. The Government submitted more evidence of the
 damage the case had caused its relations with Spain, and the Supreme Court re-
 versed its decision, voting 10 to 2 to appoint 1 of its members to investigate the
 case. Since the 1978 amnesty would apply to the case, it is unlikely that those re-
 sponsible for the Soria murder will be convicted or punished.
 Special Judge Milton Juica on September 28 formally accused live former
 Carabineros and a civilian, Miguel Estay Reyno, of the 1985 throat slashing of three
 Communist Party leaders. Twelve other former Carabineros from the disbanded Di-
 rectorate of Intelligence (Dicomcar) were accused of being accessories in the murder.
 The Supreme Court dropped charges against former junta member and Carabinero
 Commander General Mendoza, saying he was not involved in the crime.
 Little progress was made on resolving the 1982 murder of Tucapel Jimenez. A
 chief suspect in the case, a former military officer, was in jail in Argentina pending
 extradition. Retired army Major Alvaro Corbalan, the commander of an intelligence
 unit accused of murdering a carpenter to cover up the Jimenez murder, was under
 house arrest on a military base, and another accomplice was still in jail. Corbalan
 is the only former military officer under detention in Chile.
 The National Reparation and Conciliation Corporation began operating in 1992 to
 compensate families of human rights victims. On September 30, 1993, it was paying
 pensions to 4,600 family members of victims who died of human rights violations
 committed before 1990. The Chilean State has paid $26.5 million to the victims'
 families including college tuition for offspring up to the age of 35 who wish to
 study. Wives, children, and parents of victims are eligible for pensions, and the
 amount for each family member is more than double that paid under the old social
 security system. The Corporation also continued the work of the Rettig Commission,
 investigating reports of human rights abuses where victims died. The President,
 Alejanro Gonzalez, expects the Corporation to reach conclusions on deaths or dis-
 appearances of the more than 3,200 victims by the time it finishes its work in 1994.
 b. Disappearance.-The Government was not responsible for disappearances dur-
 ing 1993. Disappearance cases from before 1978 cannot be closed and the alleged
 perpetrator amnestied until a court determines that the victim is dead. Since the
 bodies of many of the disappeared have never been found, the cases were an ongoing
 irritant in civil-military (particularly civil-army) relations because judicial processes
 against officers--who would inevitably be covered by the amnesty-were both dis-
 ruptive to army operations and embarrassing to the institution. An Aylwin adminis-
 tration proposal to permit confidential testimony in order to close the cases expedi-
 tiously was not pursued owing to the concern of some members of the governing coa-
 lition that it would result in impunity for human rights violators. It did not guaran-
 tee that civilian courts would undertake the investigations nor that the military
 would cooperate.
 In 1993 a court convicted five FPMR/D militants of the September 1991 kidnaping
 of Cristian Edwards, son of the owner of Santiago's prestigious El Mercurio news-
 paper. An FPMR leader captured in Augst is believed to be the intellectual author
 of the kidnaping, but police were not able to find any trace of the million-dollar ran-
 som the family paid.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the "use of illegal pressure" is forbidden, there continued to be mistreat-
 ment and torture by some Carabinero and Investigations Police units in 1993. The
 Defense Committee of the Peoples' Rights (CODEPU) had received 17 reports of tor-
 ture or cruel treatment by Carabineros and 6 by the Investigations Police through
 November 15, and filed 25 complaints with the courts. The abuses were mostly asso-
 ciated with interrogations, and included sleep, food, and water deprivation, threats,
 beatings, and forced standing for long periods of time. Allegations of the use of elec-
 trical shock were rare.
 The Government, which includes many human rights leaders and victims in im-
 portant positions, asked for independent judicial investigations of credible com-
 plaints. Investigations of torture seldom resulted in arrests, in part because mem-
 bers of the judiciary, many of them appointed by the military regime, are reluctant
 to pursue the issue vigorously.
 In one highly publicized case, a Brazilian woman, Tania Maria Cordeiro, was ar-
 rested and allegedly tortured after her boarder was detained for possession of arms
 used by members of the Lautaro Youth Movement in bank robberies. The Brazilian
 consul tried for months to call the Government's attention to the case before her
 
 
 387
 lawyer, a respected human rights defender, publicized the case in August. Soon
 thereafter, the Supreme Court designated Appeals Court Judge Alejandro Soils to
 investigate the complaint. In November he charged eight policemen with adminis-
 trative violations for psychological pressure to extract a confession and for illegal
 detention of Cordeiro and her 13-year-old daughter, but he did not find proof of tor-
 ture.
 Chilean prisons are strapped for funds and antiquated, but conditions are not life
 threatening. Food is provided to meet minimal nutritional needs, and prisoners may
 supplement their diet by buying food. Those with sufficient funds can rent space in
 a better wing of the prison. Although prison guards have been accused by some
 human rights gups of using excessive force to stop attempted prison breaks, the
 guards generally act professionally and do not mistreat prisoners. The Government
 permits monitoring of prison conditions, and the Minister of Justice who supervises
 the guards visits prisoners to hear their complaints. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross, which formerly visited politicalprisoners, closed its office in Chile
 because it felt there was no longer a need for a full-time presence.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution allows civilian and mili-
 tary courts to order detention for up to 5 days without arraignment and extend the
 detention for up to 10 days for suspected terrorist acts. By law, detainees are to be
 provided 30 minutes of immediate and daily access to a lawyer (although not in pri-
 vate) and to a doctor to verify their physical condition. The law does not permit a
 judge to deny such access. With few exceptions, this practice appeared to be ob-
 served by police authorities. It is quite common for the police to make "arrests for
 suspicion, particularly of youth in high-crime areas late at night. The Chilean
 Human Rights Commission reported that many of those detained were never
 charged and were released after a few days.
 There were no cases of forced exile in 1993, but some Chileans convicted of politi-
 cally motivated crimes during the military regime agreed to go abroad as a condition
 of their release from jail.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Although the Constitution calls for a judicial sys-
 tem independent of the other branches of government the judiciary, and particu-
 larly the Supreme Court, is dominated by appointees of the former military regime.
 Their rulings are often partial to the military and the police. Ten of the 17 Supreme
 Court judges were appointed by General Pinochet, 7 of them after he lost the 1988
 plebiscite. The court system is widely criticized for being antiquated and inefficient.
 Trial is not by jur. Reliance is on the written record rather than oral testimony,
 and the judge renders a verdict after directing the investigation. The investigative
 phase is considered secret, with limited access for the accused or his attorney to evi-
 dence or testimony which has been accumulated by the judge. There is a well-devel-
 oped, multistage appeal process leading ultimately to the Supreme Court. This
 lengthy process results in very slow final decisions; it is not uncommon for cases
 to linger in the court system or several years. In 1993, for example, the Supreme
 Court ruled in favor of heirs of the plaintiff in a case involving a 1967 land
 confiscation.
 Under the military government, a broad interpretation of state security laws
 greatly expanded the ju risdiction of military ourts over the prosecution of pro-
 scribed political activities. 1991 legal reform package (the "cumplido" laws) limited
 the jurisdiction of military tribunals and transferred most cases to the civilian
 courts. The Auditor General of the army may sit as a visiting justice in Supreme
 Court chambers that hear cases involving army officials.
 The court is often partial in decisions involving military personnel (see Section
 l.a.). For example, on May 28, aer a delay of more than a year, the Supreme Court
 upheld a lower court's order to detain active duty army Lieutenant Colonel Fer-
 nando Laureani, who had been a DINA squad leader when two MIR members dis-
 appeared in 1974. Laureani failed to appear in court and spent several months as
 a fugitive. In July as President Aylwin was proposing a change in judicial proce-
 dures, the fourth chamber of the Supreme Court voted unanimously to grant a mili-
 tary court jurisdiction, confirming the precedent that the military will take jurisdic-
 tion if an active duty officer is indicted for a human rights violation covered by the
 amnesty. The military court applied the amnesty to Laureani and closed the case.
 President Aylwin commuted the sentences in 1993 of 11 persons convicted for po-
 litically motivated crimes committed during the military regime, including the only
 woman in that group. Eight of the former prisoners were sent to live outside Chile
 for the remainder oftheir sentences as a condition of their release. At year's end,
 the number of persons remaining in jail charged with violating state security laws
 before March 11, 1990, had dropped to 10. (There had been 335 when Aylwin took
 office.) Those prisoners suffered extended periods of pretrial detention and torture
 and were colloquially known as "political prisoners.' However, they were involved
 
 
 388
 in Chile's more notorious terrorist incidents such as the death of five bodyguards
 in the 1986 assassination attempt of then President Pinochet. The judicial system
 has sentenced six of them, including three for the assassination attempt. They ap-
 plied for presidential pardons, and President Aylwin may commute their sentences
 as he has done in other cases. For the first time, a beneficiary of an Aylwin pardon
 was rearrested in 1993 for criminal activities committed after his release.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-
 Searches of the home and interception of private communications are prohibited by
 the Constitution, unless either a civilian or military court issues a search warrant
 for specific locations. The 1984 antiterrorist law provides for surveillance of those
 suspected of terrorist crimes, and for the interception, opening, or recording of pri-
 vate communications and documents in such cases.
 There were further developments in a 1992 political espionage case involving a
 cellular telephone conversation recorded and subsequently played on a national tele-
 vision program, destroying two candidates' presidential campaigns. The army ac-
 knowle ge  that an army captain had "misused" its espionage equipment to record
 a private conversation and leak it to the media. The Supreme Court ruled that the
 law on telephone intercepts only covered conversations carried on wire, not on cel-
 lular telephones, and ordered the defendants freed of all charges. The military
 courts punished the army captain only for neglect of duty, but he was discharged
 from the army in November.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and these rights are generally respected in practice. The press gen-
 erally maintains its independence and exercises responsible, professional judgment,
 including in its criticism of the Government. Issues sensitive to the military, includ-
 ing human rights abuses, are widely covered in the media. During 1993, military
 courts heard no new cases against journalists, but several cases were still pending
 from prior years. A military court confiscated one edition of a newspaper for report-
 ing on the Soria c'ase while a "gag order" was in effect, but it did not call the editors
 to court. Several attempts by Congress to transfer jurisdiction in such cases from
 military to civilian courts were not successful.
 Press debate focused on censorship on several occasions in 1993. In March the
 navy seized and prohibited circulation of a publication by a retired navy captain en-
 titled "Ethics and the Intelligence Servie." In April a Santiago ourt of appeals pro-
 hibited the sale or distribution of a book by Francisco Martreli entitled "Diplomatic
 Impunity."
 In August President Aylwin reignited the censorship controversy when he re-
 quested that the national television station delay the broadcast of an interview with
 Michael Townley in which the former DINA agent detailed how and why he put a
 bomb under the car of Orlando Letelier. The President asserted that showing the
 interview on the government-owned station at that time was needlessly inflam-
 matory. The program aired 10 days later, but the program's director was dismissed
 for adding to the debate about presidential influence over the state-owned television
 station and for allegedly asserting excessive independence from the board of direc-
 tors.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens have the right to
 peaceful assembly and association. Permission to hold rallies and demonstrations on
 streets and public plazas is issued according to police guidelines. Permission must
 be requested 72 hours in advance, and it is usually granted; however, authorities
 often suggest an alternate location to minimize inconvenience to other people.
 Prior to September 11, the 20th anniversary of the coup, the Government asked
 Santiago authorities not to authorize demonstrations near La Moneda presidential
 palace, the site where most of the fighting took place on the day of the coup and
 where former President Allende committed suicide. Anticoup demonstrators threw
 rocks at police, erected barricades, overturned cars, and set fires. When Carabineros
 responded, a police vehicle ran over and killed a 66-year-old man, and an 18-year-
 old member of the Communist Youth died of gunshot wounds, probably the result
 of Carabinero fire (see Section L.a.). Ten days after the incidents, an attorney rep-
 resenting the injured Carabineros asked the courts to prosecute the demonstrators
 who were responsible. Since he asked that the courts pursue the "instigators" as
 well as the material authors of the injuries, human rights groups (some of whom
 were among the organizers) claimed he was attempting to restrict freedom of assem-
 bly.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. Chile
 is predominantly Roman Catholic, but other denominations practice their faiths
 without restriction.
 
 
 389
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Chileans by law are free to move within and to enter and leave their
 country. The National Office of Returnees-established by the Congress in 1990 to
 facilitate the reincorporation into Chilean society of more than 26,000 Chileans who
 have returned from exile-has assisted more than 13,000 exiles and their families
 by providing special access to health care, housing, and information on job opportu-
 nities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Chile is a constitutional democracy, and citizens now have the right to change
 their government through periodic elections. There is universal suffrage for citizens
 18 years of age or over, and more than 95 percent of those eligible are registered
 to vote. Voting is compulsory for those who register. National elections for the Presi-
 dent and Congress were held on December 11, the second since the return to democ-
 racy. President-elect Frei won the biggest majority in modern Chilean history, cap-
 turing 58 percent of the vote in a six-candidate race, but Chile's unique binomial
 system allowed the rightist opposition to pick up strength in both the Senate and
 the Chamber of Deputies.
 The former military government wrote the 1980 Constitution and amended it
 slightly in 1989 after General Pinochet lost a referendum to stay in office. It pro-
 vides for a strong presidency and a legislative branch with more limited powers. The
 President has the authority to designate the "urgency" of bills and to determine
 time limits for Congress to consider them. In addition, the Constitution includes
 provisions designed to protect the interests of the military and the political right
 and, according to its defenders (and even some critics), to provide stability in the
 olitical process and encourage the formation of large coalitions. The center-left coa-
 lition which governed Chile in 1993 accepted the legitimacy of the 1980 Constitution
 but sought to amend elements characterized as "authoritarian enclaves" left over
 from the previous regime. These included limitations on the President's right to re-
 move chiefs of the armed forces, an electoral system that gives the political opposi-
 tion a disproportionate representation in Congress, and the existence of nonele=d
 "institutional senators" who deprive the governing coalition of an elected majority
 in the Senate.   z
 Women have had the right to vote in municipal elections since 1948 and in na-
 tional elections since 1952, and they are active in political life, especially at the
 grassroots level. Women make up a majority of the registered voters and of voters
 who actually cast ballots, but there are few women in leadership positions. Although
 some women lost their bids for reelection, 6 women won new seats in the Chamber
 of Deputies, increasing their numbers to 9 of 120 deputies. Chile's indigenous people
 are able to participate freely in the political process. Although relatively few mem-
 bers of Chile's Indian population are politically active, their participation has in-
 creased since the 1990 democratic transition. Of the nearly 1 million self-described
 indigenous people in Chile, there is one representative of Indian descent in the Con-
 gress.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Aylwin Government cooperated with nongovernmental organizations that
 seek to investigate continued human rights violations in Chile. A number of govern-
 ment officials were formerly active in the Catholic Church's Vicariate of Solidarity
 (which closed its offices in 1992). The Vicariate had taken the lead in defending
 human rights during the Pinochet regime and provided legal counsel to families of
 victims who were killed or disappeared between 1973 and 1990. The Social Aid
 Foundation of the Christian Churches hired many of the Vicariate's lawyers and as-
 sumed the bulk of the Vicariate's caseload of pre-1990 human rights violations.
 Several human rights leaders established the Foundation for Documentation and
 Records of the Vicariate of Solidarity to maintain the case files and assist in docu-
 menting human rights abuses between 1973 and 1990. The Chilean Human Rights
 Commission is affiliated with the International League of Human Rights and contin-
 ues to gather evidence of police abuses. The Defense Committee of the Peoples'
 Rights provides legal counsel to those currently accused of politically related crimes
 and to victims of human rights abuses. The Communist Party and the Group of
 Families of the Disappeared Detainees are working for the repeal of the 1978 am-
 nesty law.
 
 
 390
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-lgal distinctions between the sexes still exist, despite a 1989 law
 which eliminated many restrictions on women. Divorce is not legal in Chile; those
 who seek to remarry are required to seek annulments. The courts are relatively tol-
 erant on technicalities for dissolving a marriage, but since annulments imply that
 the marriage legally never existed, former wives and children are left without any
 legal recourse for financial support. A bill to create conjugal property as an option
 in a marriage passed the Chamber of Deputies but has not yet been voted on in
 the Senate. Inheritance laws provide strong protection for wives and protect female
 offspring, and a 1992 law accords children born out of wedlock the same civil rights
 as offspring born in wedlock. Many believe, however, that the changes in law have
 not been matched by a change in attitude by society, police, or the courts.
 Abuses such as wife beating continue to be tolerated or ignored. The National
 Women's Service (SERNAM), whose director was the only woman with cabinet rank
 in the Aylwin Government, estimated that one in four women had been subject to
 physical violence by her husband or partner but that 75 percent do not dare to re-
 port it. A 1992 survey conducted by SERNAM in metropolitan Santiago showed the
 highest level of violence in the lower economic strata where 34 percent of women
 reported that they had experienced physical abuse. SERNAM conducted courses on
 the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of domestic violence for Carabineros,
 who are often the first public officials to intervene in such incidents. More than
 5 000 have been trained in new techniques for assisting abused women. SERNAM
 also teaches courses (therapy) for wife abusers and allows free followup when the
 aggressor needs further support. SERNAM estimates that authorities are able to
 prevent further abuse in 70 percent of the cases that are reported.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, and
 strengthening the family was a prominent campaign theme across the politicel spec-
 trum. A U.N. Children's Fund study found that malnutrition among Chilean chil-
 dren was the lowest in the Western Hemisphere, affecting less than 1 percent. The
 National Minors Service (SENAME) found that sexual abuse of minors, some as
 young as 6 years of age, occurred but that few cases are reported. The Carabineros
 support the creation of a public defender for children's rights.
 Indigenous People.-In 1993 Congress passed a law that was drafted by a commit-
 tee composed of representatives of the various indigenous groups recognizing the
 ethnic diversity of the indigenous populations. It replaced a law that emphasized
 assimilation, and it gives them a greater voice in decisions affecting their lands, cul-
 tures, and traditions. The law allows for eventual bilingual education in schools
 with a large indigenous population. The population which identifies itself as indige-
 nous (nearly 1 million, according to the 1992 census) remains separated from the
 rest of society, largely because of historical, cultural, educational, and geographical
 factors. The Mapuches in southern Chile form the bulk of the indigenous population
 (over 90 percent) but there are small Aimara, Atacameno, Huilliche, Raps Nui, and
 Kawaskhar populations in other parts of Chile.
 A young Mapuche leader, Aucan Huilcaman, was convicted of inciting land take-
 overs but was free on bail pending the outcome of his appeal. At the World Human
 Rights Conference in Vienna, he advocated indigenous peoples' rights to "possess,
 control, administer, and manage a territory" while choosing the appropriate evelop-
 ment strategy to suit each culture. While the new law honors this principle, some
 Indian leaders would prefer more explicit reference to the right for community own-
 ership of land according to their traditional pattern. Huilcaman was not able to run
 for Congress because of his criminal record, but several other indigenous people
 were candidates. They tried to form a united front. urging Indians to vote their eth-
 nic origins rather than for political affiliation. However, most of the Indian can-
 didates were on the leftist ticket that won no seats in the Congress. One, Francisco
 Huenchumilla, a Christian Democratic moderate, ran for reelection and won easily,
 capturing more than 47 percent of the vote in a seven-candidate race.
 National/Ethnic/Racial Minorities.-Chile is a relatively homogeneous and iso-
 lated society and intolerance of small ethnic minority groups is evident. A Korean
 immigrant was banned from a local health club because the owner claimed that her
 "odor" would keep other customers from coming to use the sauna. She filed suit, and
 the Supreme Court ruled in her favor, but the courts have yet to fLx damages.
 Religious Minorities.-The number of bombings of Mormon churches declined this
 year, with 15 reported, apparently as a result of the success the police had in arrest-
 ing leaders of the Lautaro. Two of the incidents, however, were more violent than
 those in the past, with terrorists confronting worshipers in the churches. The terror-
 ists' motives for attacking the Mormons were not clear but were apparently more
 political than religious.
 
 
 B'nai B'rith International raised concern about the activities of a small "neo-Nazi"
 movement; its District 27 issued a report in July that noted groups of as many as
 200 Chileans had held ceremonies to declare their allegiance to the Third Reich and
 their opposition to democracy.
 People with Disabilities.-Chilean law does not require that public buildings pro-
 vide access for people with disabilities, and the Santiago metro, the pride of Chile's
 system of public transportation, has no provisions for wheelchair access. Chile has
 for many years conducted a telethon to assist people with disabilities in obtaining
 physical therapy. Groups connected with the telethon are beginning to increase pub-
 lic awareness of people with disabilities. For example, one group formed a dance
 company with several of the performers confined to wheelchairs. Reserved parking
 for the disabled is no longer a rarity.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Most workers have the right to form unions without
 prior authorization or to join existing unions, and 14.4 percent of the work force was
 organized at the end of 1992. Legislation was introduced to allow government em-
 ployee associations the same rights as trade unions. Such associations now partici-
 pate in labor centrals, but they do not enjoy the same legal protection as unions.
 Only the police and military are not allowed to form such employee associations.
 The Labor Code now permits the formation of nationwide labor centrals, and the
 largest and most representative one, the Unified Workers Central (CUT), legalized
 its status in April 1992. The Labor Code does not conform in key respects to Inter-
 national Labor Organization Conventions 87 and 98 on, respectively, freedom of as-
 sociation and the right to organize and bargain collectively, which Chile has not
 ratified. However, the Government actively encouraged labor to organize. The num-
 ber of labor unions increased by more than 40 percent under the Aylwin Govern-
 ment.
 Affiliations with confederations and federations (second-tier labor groups) contin-
 ued to increase, and many of them maintain ties to international labor organiza-
 tions. The CUT is not now affiliated with any labor international, but it scheduled
 an extraordinary congress in 1994 to reconsider the matter. Unions are independent
 of the Government, but most union leaders are elected from lists based on party af-
 filiation. The CUT has factions affiliated with the Christian Democratic (the larg-
 est), Socialist, and Communist parties.
 Reforms to the Labor Code in 1990 removed significant restrictions on the right
 to strike. Labor unions continue to object to the requirement that workers vote by
 secret ballot in the presence of a labor inspector or notary on whether to accept a
 company's final offer. Striking workers may no longer be fired after 60 days on
 strike without severance benefits. Employers are required to show cause whenever
 they fire workers but can claim 'needa of the enterprise" as a sufficient cause. Ob-
 servers believe that some employers invoke this clause to fire employees for at-
 tempting to form unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The climate for collective bar-
 gaining has improved, and the number of negotiated contracts has grown steadily;
 at the end of 1992, 16.7 percent of the eligible workers had collective bargaining
 agreements. The process for collectively negotiating a formal contract is heavily reg-
 ulated, and the Labor Code contains detailed rules for contract negotiations.
 Multicompany or sector negotiations require the prior consent of all affected compa-
 nies and unions so most negotiations take place at the company level. The Labor
 Code allows muitiple unions and worker committees to engage in parallel negotia-
 tions with the same company. Strikes may be called only if workers reject a collec-
 tive bargaining agreement. However, the law permits (and the Aylwin administra-
 tion encouraged) informal union-management discussions to reach collective agree-
 ments (convenios") outside the regulated bargaining process. These agements
 have the same force as formal contracts. Once a contract has been signed, workers
 must pursue grievances in the court system.
 The Labor Code specifies what can be "matters for collective bargaining" and pro-
 hibits collective bargaining over any issue that "can limit or restrict the ability of
 the employer to organize or direct the enterprise." Labor leaders say this is used
 by some employers to limit discussions of working conditions. Employers may also
 include a clause in individual employment contracts that some employees are super-
 visory personnel who are not allowed to participate in collective bargaining. In the
 telephone company, for example, most technical personnel have such contracts.
 Temporary workers-defined in the Labor Code as agcultural, construction, and
 port workers, as well as entertainers-may now form unions, but their right to col-
 lective bargaining continues to be restricted. Some 700,000 workers, including most
 
 
 392
 agricultural workers, are limited to informal negotiations, meaning they have no
 protection from unfair bargaining practices.
 The Labor Code provides sanctions for unfair bargaining practices that protect
 workers from dismissal during the bargaining process, but union leaders claim com-
 panies invoke the "needs of the enterprise" clause to fire workers after a union has
 signed a new contract. Although the law protects union officials from such dismis-
 sals, second-echelon leaders who do not hold union offices may lose their jobs. The
 Labor Ministry's Director General says this raises questions about the real cause
 for dismissals, but his legal authority only allows inspectors to assure that compa-
 nies make severance payments; they do not investigate the causes for a dismissal.
 If a worker proves in court that he was fired unfairly, this will raise his severance
 payment by 20 percent but not get his job back.
 The Labor Code also applies in Chile s duty-free zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited in the Constitution and the Labor Code, and there is no evidence that it is
 currently practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor is regulated by law.
 Children as young as 14 years old may legally be employed only with permission
 of parents or guardians after completing their compulsory elementary schooling and
 in 'estricted types of labor. Those aged 15 to 18 may be employed in a larger variety
 of jobs and at expanded hours, but only with their parent's or guardian's permission.
 Labor inspectors enforce these regulations and voluntary compliance is good in the
 formal sector. Economic factors have forced many children to seek employment in
 the informal economy which is more difficult to regulate. Carabineros have proce-
 dures to counsel arents who force their children to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages, hours of work, and occupa-
 tional safety and health standards are regulated by law. The maximum legal work-
 week is 48 hours, which must be worked in the course of either 5 or 6 days. The
 maximum length of any given workday is 10 hours. Since the Aylwin administration
 took office, there have been tripartite negotiations each year in which business and
 labor agreed to the minimum wage proposal sent by the Government to Congress.
 Since 1990 the minimum wage increased by more than 30 percent in real terms.
 Lower paid workers also receive a family subsidy (which employers deduct from
 their taxes) to help raise their earnings to an acceptable level. The formula for cal-
 culating the minimum wage considers projected future inflation and increases in
 productivity, and the minimum monthly wage is now about $115 (46,000 pesos).
 The Ministry of Labor has inspectors to enforce laws covering working conditions.
 Despite increases in resources, enforcement is difficult, especially in small enter-
 prises and the informal sector, but voluntary compliance is fairly good. Workers who
 remove themselves from situations that endanger their health and safety have their
 employment protected, provided they have asked a workers' delegate to bring the
 problem to the attention of labor inspectors.
