 MOROCCO
 Morocco is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King
 Hassan II, who succeeded his father on the throne
 in 1961. Moroccan citizens have considerable civil
 liberties and enjoy a moderately good quality of
 life but are less well protected with respect to
 rights of the person. The Congressional Research
 Service came to similar conclusions in a July 1978
 study.
 The Moroccan Parliament, since it resumed function-
 ing in 1977, has strengthened democratic institutions.
 In December 1977 it passed a unanimous resolution
 calling on the Government to release all political
 prisoners.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom'from:
 a. Torture
 Some European human rights activists have charged
 that torture is endorsed by law enforcement authori-
 ties. They have also alleged that torture is not
 confined to political prisoners.
 Serious abuses apparently did occur during the do-
 mestic unrest of the early 1970s. Reports of such
 abuses have subsequently declined in frequency and
 now are limited to intermittant instances of harsh
 interrogation methods by law enforcement authorities.
 Moroccan Government leaders do not appear to condone
 such practices. For example, during the June 1977
 Parliamentary election campaign, a senior police
 official of a major city was relieved of his duties
 following allegations that he had beaten an opposi-
 tion party campaign worker.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Prisons are old and overcrowded. The Government is
 seeking to improve them but lacks sufficient funds.
 Following hunger strikes in 1978 by prisoners over
 prison conditions, the'Government formed ad hoc com-
 mittees of inquiry to investigate the compTal-s and
 act as intermediaries. These committees, one of
 which included opposition parliamentarians and doc-
 tors and lawyers from the private sector succeeded
 in negotiating compromises which have ended hunger
 strikes on at least three occasions.
 Since 1973-74, when approximately thirty persons were
 tried and executed for high treason, no persons have
 been executed for crimes against the state.
 The Government does not use exile as a punishment,
 but some political dissidents are in self-imposed
 exile. In the summer of 1978 the Government allowed
 several prominent exiles, at least one of whom had
 been condemned to death in absentia, to return to
 the country without impri-sonment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 As many as several thousand Moroccans were arrested
 or detained during the period after the coup at-
 tempts of 1971 and 1972 and disturbances of early
 1973. Most of those accused in the coup attempts
 were tried in military tribunals. Many of those
 implicated in the 1973 disturbances were held for
 prolonged periods without trial.
 The number of detainees was significantly reduced
 by a series of trials, releases and amnesties be-
 tween 1974 and 1977. Although another 100 young
 Moroccans were arrested and detained without trial
 in the spring of 1977 on charges of taking part in
 clandestine and subversive leftist activities,
 twenty of these were released in early December 1977
 
 
 594
 and another eighteen in September 1978; no trials
 appear to have been scheduled for the remainder.
 In addition, 38 previously sentenced offenders, in-
 cluding prominent political prisoners, were released
 in November 1977 as a result of one of Morocco's
 periodic amnesties.
 One European human rights group reported in early
 1978 that there was evidence that Moroccan police
 made arrests without proper legal procedure. It
 further charged that many "prisoners of opinion" re-
 main in Morocco. The Department of State concludes
 that while there are still prisoners who were ar-
 rested or imprisoned arbitrarily, the number is a
 small fraction of what it was five years ago. Mem-
 bers of the major opposition party also make this
 assessment.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Some persons engaged in or directly implicated in
 the 1971 and 1972 attempts against the life of the
 King were summarily executed. An undetermined num-
 ber of persons detained after these incidents are
 still being held incommunicado. Most were tried in
 military courts; others have never been tried.
 With the notable exception of the young men arrested
 in June, 1977 (see above), persons detained for anti-
 government activities since 1972 have been tried in
 open court. A representative of Amnesty International
 who attended the trials in late 1976 expressed his
 satisfaction with the conduct of the court. On the
 other hand, an Amnesty International report alleged
 that at the 1977 trials the defend4ints' rights to
 testify, to be informed of the charges against them
 and to receive unimpeded representation by counsel
 were not respected. The Moroccan Ministry of Jus-
 tice responded to the report in a press release on
 November 21, 1977, pointing out that restrictions
 were necessary because both defendants and lawyers
 had violated court procedure by attempting to create
 disorder and confusion.

 e.  Invasion of the Home
 There are no known incidents of intrusions into pri-
 vate homes by officials without observance of legal
 safeguards protecting individuals from arbitrary
 searches.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government addresses social and economic prob-
 lems through programs such as redistribution of
 state-owned land, subsidies and liberal credit for
 farmers, social services and low-cost housing. The
 1978 budget allocated 28 percent of funds to educa-
 tion, five percent to health programs, five percent
 to agriculture, and .6 percent to housing and urban
 development. These allocations are likely to be con-
 tinued in the forthcoming three-year plan roughly in
 existing proportions, although newly launched auster-
 ity measures may reduce the amounts. The Government
 has not met its development goals, especially those
 involving the rural poor. Morocco's development
 strategies do not intentionally discriminate against
 the poor, but the emphasis on capital intensive pro-
 grams results in limited short-run benefit for
 Morocco's poorest citizens. An important exception
 is Morocco's major irrigation network program. In
 the education field, continuous efforts have been
 made to combat illiteracy, but with little success
 in reducing the illitercy rate (which remains about
 75 percent) in part because of the high birth rate.
 Morocco has a very complex tax system. There are
 sales taxes on products, sales and services. The.
 income tax system exempts individuals with incomes
 below approximately $5,000.  (Annual per capita
 income is $520.) The income tax rates increase
 progressively to 36 percent at the highest income
 levels. Housing and real estate taxes also have
 heavy impact on the higher income brackets. Income
 
 
 596
 and land distribution, however, remains severely
 imbalanced.  In 1973, for example, ten percent of
 the population owned roughly fifty percent of the
 land. There is no evidence to suggest that the sit-
 uation has changed greatly since then.
 Corruption exists. However, several institutional-
 ized forces operate as a brake. The local and na-
 tional representatives elected in 1976-77 have proved
 to be a positive force in reducing the incidence of
 corruption among officials. The opposition party
 press frequently publicizes individual cases of sus-
 piciously acquired wealth. In rare cases, including
 one in 1977 involving several officials, the Government
 has moved against both low and relatively high-ranking
 persons for misuse of their authority.
 In a May 1978 report the British Anti-Slavery Society
 criticized the employment of children in contraven-
 tion of Moroccan law; the rug industry was cited as
 a particular offender. Some opposition papers have
 noted the report, but the Moroccan Government has
 not reacted.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 -ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are all guaranteed under the 1972
 Constitution. Internal press censorship was lifted
 in 1977. Criticism in the media of the administra-
 tion, social conditions and all institutions, with
 the notable exception of the monarchy is commonplace.
 The Government prevented publication of a December
 1978 opposition party resolution reportedly calling
 for a modification of the King's authority.
 The Government tolerates a wide range of political
 and religious groups. During the 1976-77 electoral
 
 
 597
 campaign all parties were allowed to speak and to
 hold meetings, although the opposition was harassed,
 especially in the conservative countryside. In
 November 1978 the six-year old ban on the national
 Student Union was lifted.
 Morocco has a unique history of religious tolerance.
 Although large numbers of Moroccan Jews voluntarily
 left the country after the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli
 wars, about 18,000 remain in the country and the Gov-
 ernment has urged others to return.
 The Constitution guarantees to citizens the right to
 join trade unions and to unions the right to strike.
 The Confederation of Trade Unions (UMT) is one of the
 oldest labor movements in Africa. The two largest
 opposition parties are involved in labor activity in
 competition with the UMT. All of these groups con-
 ducted strikes in 1978 with virtually no interference
 from authorities.
 Discrimination against women is prohibited by law.
 French educational traditions have opened some doors
 to Moroccan women. Nevertheless, this partial liber-
 alization is limited for the most part to urban areas,
 while the role of women in the predominantly rural and
 traditional Muslim environment remains restricted, as
 it has been over the centuries. No woman has ever held
 a cabinet position in Morocco, nor is there any woman
 in the 264-member Parliament.
 The Parliament recently passed legislation protecting
 women's rights after divorce. The Government, with
 support from the Agency for International Development
 has also accelerated labor and family planning pro-
 jects designed to improve the lot of women. Some 36
 percent of children in primary schools are female, a
 slight improvement over the 32 percent in 1968.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 
 
 598
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout
 Morocco. Foreign travel for political reasons was
 sometimes restricted in years past, but it is not
 now restricted to our knowledge. However, persons
 without means or other influence frequently encounter
 delays in obtaining passports. Also, the difficulty
 in obtaining foreign currency imposes significant
 practical limitations on would be travellers. We
 know of no formal restrictions on emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is considerable opportunity for participation
 in Morocco's political life, given the diverse and
 well-organized groups now functioning. Suffrage is
 universal. Including the majority independent party,
 five political parties are represented in the cur-
 rent Parliament; two of these, a left-socialist
 party and a communist party, constitute the opposi-
 tion. The opposition vigorously criticizes the
 Government's policies in Parliament and in its press.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 We know of no incidents since 1973 of Morocco's
 refusing to permit outside groups to enter the coun-
 try to investigate alleged human rights violations.
 Amnesty International and other civil and human
 rights groups have been permitted to send observers
 to trials, and these observers have been received by
 officials of the Moroccan Government. In January
 1978, the Minister of Justice publicly invited
 Amnesty International or any other humanitarian or-
 ganization to send impartial observers to visit
 Moroccan courts and prisons. Apparently no such ob-
 servers have been sent to date.
