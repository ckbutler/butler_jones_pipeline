 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic
 system, free press, strong unions, and an ardent commitment to
 democracy. For the past 28 years, power has passed peacefully
 between the two major political parties through open elections.
 Venezuela has a mixed economy, dominated by the public sector
 The state-owned petroleum industry accounts for some 23 percent
 of the gross national product, more than any other industry.
 Venezuela has experienced economic problems resulting from
 declining petroleum revenues, a large foreign debt, and high
 government expenditures, including debt service. For the past
 8 years per capita income has been declining.
 Human rights violations, when they occur, tend to be well
 publicized and investigated. Venezuela is an active
 participant in international human rights forums and is noted
 within the Hemisphere as a proponent of civil liberties and
 democratic rule. The principal focus of human rights
 discussion within Venezuela is on deficiencies, including
 allegations of corruption, in the country's overtaxed judicial
 system.
 Venezuela maintained its good human rights record in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Authorities do not engage in or condone unlawful or arbitrary
 killing for political motives, and there were no reports of
 such killings. There have been instances of police and
 security forces shooting and killing criminal suspects. Such
 incidents are investigated when there is reason to believe the
 killing was illegal. Perpetrators may be charged with a cr.ime
 and prosecuted in the courts.
 b. Disappearance
 As a matter of policy, police authorities do not abduct,
 secretly arrest, or hold people in clandestine confinement.
 Reports of police abuse are publicized and investigated.
 Investigation of a case in March in which bodies were
 discovered in abandoned wells indicated local police
 involvement in the secret arrest and summary execution of
 chronic criminal offenders. Prosecutors are seeking 26-year
 sentences for the three policemen implicated. A congressional
 oversight committee is examining this case and related
 allegations of police abuse.
 Kidnapings for ransom are occasionally reported, especially on
 Venezuela's border with Colombia. Some of these may be
 attributable to small guerrilla groups from Colombia operating
 in western Venezuela.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Venezuelan law prohibits the torture of prisoners; this
 prohibition is respected in practice. Constitutional
 guarantees of the integrity of the individual are enforced.
 Laws prohibiting cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 
 
 651
 VENEZUELA
 punishment are generally respected. Some infractions occur,
 however, because of excesses on the part of local law'
 enforcement officials or inadequate supervision of prison
 guards. Prison conditions are spartan, at times very poor, and
 overcrowding is a serious problem. Discipline is sometimes
 inadequate, and violence by guards against prisoners
 occasionally occurs, especially in the more crowded prisons.
 Officials responsible for such violence are not known to be
 punished. The low educational level and limited training of
 many prison guards are contributing factors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The right to judicial determination of the legality of
 detention is guaranteed by law. Arrested persons legally
 cannot be held more than 8 days without formal charges. The
 limits are frequently exceeded, however, usually because of
 inefficiencies in the legal system.
 For example, the case of four persons charged with the bombing
 of a Cuban airliner and detained since 1976 has yet to be
 concluded. Three remain incarcerated; one escaped prison in
 1985. In a preliminary judgment, two of the suspects were
 found guilty and the third innocent. All three remain in
 prison pending confirmation of the ruling by a higher court.
 Illegal immigration, mainly from Colombia, remains a concern
 for Venezuelan authorities. Once in police custody, foreign
 nationals without documents are frequently held incommunicado
 and then deported without legal proceedings.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor; unremunerated labor is
 prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and a number of procedural
 safeguards are provided. The accused is presumed innocent
 until guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However,
 preventatIve detention is legal and common and accounts for
 a large percentage of the prison population awaiting trial.
 According to Ministry of Justice officials, approximately
 76 percent of the 28,000 persons in prison have not yet been
 tried. The same judicial authorities attribute the backlog to
 an insufficient number of qualified judges; automatic review
 of all lower court decisions by higher courts, which cannot
 limit their dockets; and failure to enforce procedural
 deadlines at each stage of the legal process. Delays of 2 or
 3 years in a normal case are not infrequent. Bail is only
 permitted for relatively minor crimes. A Judges Association
 study in 1980 revealed that there was one judge for each
 180,000 inhabitants in the Caracas area. The extraordinarily
 slow pace of justice appears to be a product of the system's
 complexity and the formality of criminal trial procedures.
 The judicial process is almost exclusively a written one,
 requiring costly and time-consuming production of voluminous
 reports--by judges, attorneys, and witnesses-- at every stage.
 ThE civilian judiciary is independent but connections to the
 two major political parties are important in the judicial
 selection process. The Judicial Council, an independent body
 responsible for the training, nomination, and disciplining of
 judges, actively investigates allegations of inappropriate
 conduct and has taken severe disciplinary action in a number
 
 
 652
 VENEZUELA
 of cases. The Government is aware that improvement of the
 judicial system is necessary to increase public confidence in
 the courts. Civilians charged with armed subversion are tried
 by military courts. These persons--numbering several dozen--
 are considered insurgents by the Government; there is no
 enforceable time limit on military adjudication of their cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution and law provide safeguards against arbitrary
 interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 These safeguards are honored in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Venezuela has a free and lively press; journalists frequently
 criticize the Government and denounce instances of government
 interference in the media. The Inter-American Press
 Association (IAPA), however, recently reprimanded the
 Government for allegedly intimidating El Diario de Caracas
 (EDC) for its investigative reporting and critical commentary.
 IAPA published an open letter to the Government to protest what
 it claimed were restrictions on the freedom of the press.
 Echoing complaints registered by journalists before a
 Venezuelan congressional committee, IAPA held Venezuelan
 authorities responsible for the suspension of radio programs
 and newspaper columns and judicial intimidation of journalists,
 including the jailing of the EDC editor Rodolfo Schmidt on
 charges of defamation.
 Venezuela has 3 nationwide television networks, a regional
 television station, over 156 radio stations, and numerous
 newspapers and magazines. The current administration's plans
 to invest in a newsprint plant have raised fears of enhanced
 government influence on Venezuela's privately owned print
 media. The Government currently subsidizes newsprint
 consumption through preferential exchange control and is a
 source of advertising revenue for the media. There is no
 evidence it has used economic measures to influence the press.
 Professional and academic associations operate without
 interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is respected.
 Public meetings, including those of all political parties, are
 held without interference. In the interest of public safety,
 permits are required for public marches.
 An object of "special protection" under the Constitution, labor
 unions are free, independent, and powerful. They have the
 right to strike and to bargain collectively. Unions associate
 with the recognized public and private international bodies in
 their fields. The Confederacion de Trabajadores de Venezuela,
 an affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions, dominates organized labor in Venezuela and has close
 ties to the ruling Accion Democratica party. Other
 confederations occupy a lesser role on the labor scene.

 VENEZUELA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, although
 other religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and
 proselytize actively. A number of Protestant evangelical
 groups in remote areas of Venezuela are performing
 humanitarian as well as missionary work among the local
 population.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens of Venezuela generally have freedom to travel within
 the country, abroad, and to return. Travel in the Amazon
 military zone is an exception and requires a special permit
 for security reasons. Venezuelans may emigrate without
 interference.
 Citizenship can be renounced. Recovery of nationality
 requires a residence period of 2 years for Venezuelan-born
 repatriates. The Constitution provides for revocation of
 citizenship for naturalized citizens on specific and limited
 legal grounds.
 Venezuela has traditionally been a haven for refugees and
 displaced persons from many European and Latin American
 countries. Refugees are given normal residence status and can
 be expelled only for criminal activities. A special family
 reunification program exists for Cuban refugees living in
 Venezuela. In September Venezuela acceded to the United
 Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is freely elected. As a multiparty democracy,
 the political process is open to all; opposition views are
 freely expressed and persons from the entire political
 spectrum contend for positions ranging from municipal council
 seats to the nation's presidency. Some of the minor parties
 are outgrowths of former guerrilla organizations, and they
 currently hold about seven percent of the seats in the
 national legislature. The two major centrist parties, Social
 Democratic and Social Christian, encourage and support
 participation of minority parties in the political process.
 This support reflects a widespread desire to have radical
 elements participate in the electoral propess rather than
 engage in armed insurrection. These minor, mainly leftist,
 parties have been unable to win the electoral sympathies of
 voters and have, therefore, been unable to increase their
 percentage of representatives in the national legislature.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Venezuela is a vocal critic of governments that commit or
 tolerate widespread human rights violations. It supports
 international human rights organizations. Amnesty
 International and the Latin American Foundation for Human
 Rights and Social Development have offices in Caracas.
 Venezuela is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.

 VENEZUELA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence that economic and social needs and
 cultural aspirations are denied on a discriminatory basis to
 any portion of the population.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex
 and accords women and children "special protection" in the
 workplace. Women workers receive extensive maternity leave
 benefits, and laws limit their amount of involuntary overtime.
 Women are heavily represented in many of the professions but
 continue to be underrepresented in the political and economic
 sectors. Differences still exist between men and women in
 wage and employment opportunities.
 Women are increasingly active in all political parties,
 professions, public administration, and the judiciary. Two
 ministers of state are women, and 11 were elected to the
 200-member Chamber of Deputies.
 Restrictions on property rights based on sex, religion, or
 social status do not exist, but there are some restrictions on
 ownership of business property based on nationality.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legal minimum age for employment is 14, with certain other
 restrictions applying. The Government establishes a minimum
 wage. The workday is 8 hours, and the workweek 48 for workers
 over 16.
 A complete overhaul of the industrial safety statutes was
 passed by Congress in September. In practice, enforcement of
 occupational safety regulations is inconsistent due to the
 lack of enforcement resources nationwide.
