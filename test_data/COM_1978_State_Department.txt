 COMOROS
 A new government was installed in the Comoros on
 May 13, 1978 when a conservative movement supporting
 former President Ahmed Abdallah overturned the regime
 of President Ali Soilih who had ruled since early
 1976. The overthrow and capture of Ali Soilih, who
 was subsequently killed, was accomplished by a band of
 about fifty European mercenaries under the command of
 Bob Denard, a European mercenary leader formerly
 active in other parts of Africa. Denard has left the
 Comoros, but approximately fifteen mercenaries remain
 as a presidential bodyguard. A new constitution was
 successfully submitted to popular referendum in early
 October, and Ahmed Abdallah was elected President on
 October 22, receiving virtually all of the ballots
 cast. Elections for governors of the separate islands
 and for a national Chamber of Deputies have also been
 held. The United States maintains no diplomatic
 mission in the Comoros and consequently has little
 first hand information on present conditions in the
 islands.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Department of State has received no reports of
 torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Five persons, including former President Ali Soilih,
 were reportedly killed during the coup.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 A recent press article reported fifty people were
 being detained for political reasons. The Department
 
 
 of State cannot confirm this report.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Department of State has no information on this
 subject.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Department of State has no information on this
 subject.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The economy of the Comoros has been in severe disarray
 since the French ended their subsidies in 1975 at
 independence. Under Ali Soilih, the situation deterio-
 rated even further. The new rulers have renewed ties
 with France, which is now providing both economic and
 military assistance. The new Government's economic
 policies have not yet been formulated, but can be
 expected to lean toward a free market economy in
 light of the publicly stated preferences of Ahmed
 Abdallah and others of the new ruling team for
 capitalism.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Reports indicate that considerable political activity
 has occurred, centering on the drafting of a new
 constitution, and that individuals have been free to
 voice their ideas about the future form of government.
 There is no press in the Comoros. The one radio
 station has always been government-operated. There
 is now full freedom of worship, whereas Ali Soilih had
 tried to reduce the influence of the Muslim clergy.

 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Department of State does not know of any difficul-
 ties being encountered in internal and external travel
 or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 See section 3.a. above.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is no record of the Government's attitude on
 this subject and we know of no requests for investiga-
 tion.
