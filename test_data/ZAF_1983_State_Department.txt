 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa is a multiracial country whose present constitu-
 tion codifies the system of apartheid under which the white
 minority holds a monopoly of power in the country's national
 political institutions. Under apartheid, the rights of
 ethnic groups are regarded as more important than individual
 rights. The result has been a parliamentary democratic sys-
 tem run by the 16.2 percent of the South African population
 which is white. Persons of "colored" (mixed blood) and Asian
 descent have had no legal right to political participation at
 the national level, though a new constitution recently approved
 by white voters would, if put into effect, permit a limited
 degree of power sharing at the national level, albeit with
 ultimate power in the hands of the whites. The overwhelming
 black majority has also been denied national political partici-
 pation, except through the device of tribally-based "homelands"
 or "national states" created by the South African Government
 without regard to whether blacks live in or even wish to be
 associated with these areas. Black political rights are not
 addressed by the new Constitution. Within this narrow "whites
 only" context, national elections have been free and fair. The
 South African system combines Western-style human rights
 practices with limits on these practices. The press is out-
 spoken, but circumscribed by government pressure. Free labor
 unions exist but, while the right of collective bargaining has
 been extended to a growing number of black unions, some of
 their leaders are subjected to official harrassment and persecu-
 tion. South Africa's judiciary is independent, but security
 legislation encroaches broadly on judicial power.
 In September 1983, Parliament approved constitutional reform
 proposals, introduced by the Government, which were then
 submitted to a referendum of white voters held on November 2.
 They were approved by a 66 percent majority of eligible
 voters and are scheduled to be implemented in 1984. The new
 Constitution, which occasioned extreme controversy during the
 referendum electoral campaign, will include a limited national
 franchise for South Africans of colored and Asian descent.
 Until now only white South Africans have been able to vote in
 national elections. Black South Africans have circumscribed
 political rights only in the context of the "homelands," losing
 in the process their South African citizenship. South Africa's
 colored and Asian populations are regarded as South African
 citizens. While not considered separate nations, the latter
 have had no formal place in the political system. The Govern-
 ment-sponsored new Constitution extends to these two groups
 limited political representation. Although these reforms do
 not allow for participation by blacks in the central government,
 the South African Government has stated that the constitutional
 reforms do not rule out further developments which could
 include extending participation in national political processes
 to South Africa's black majority. The new Constitution replaces
 the former Westminster model and creates a strong executive,
 the State President. It provides that existing legislation
 underpinning the legal separation of the races will continue
 in force. The results of the November 2 referendum nonethe-
 less indicate that the South African Government now has a firm
 
 (322)
 
 
 323
 and broad mandate to move--if it so desires--away from a system
 of governance based on political and physical separation of the
 races.
 Regardless of whether or not the new Constitution represents
 reform of apartheid or only its rationalization and moderniza-
 tion, the practice of apartheid remains the basis for the
 organization of South African society. Apartheid institu-
 tionalizes political and economic control by the white minority.
 Discriminatory laws and practices are woven throughout the
 fabric of South African society. Important examples include:
 (A) the Constitution itself (both old and new); (B) legislation
 which limits the citizenship of South Africa's 21 million black
 citizens to resource-poor "homelands" comprising 13 percent of
 the country's land area; (C) influx control or "pass" laws
 which prescribe the conditions under which black workers and
 their families may remain outside the homelands; (D) separate
 and unequal educational systems for the various race groups;
 (E) the Group Areas Act, which mandates separate residential
 areas for whites, coloreds, and Asians; (F) the Immorality and
 Mixed Marriage Acts, which make sexual relations or marriage
 between whites and persons of other races illegal; and (G) the
 Separate Amenities Act, which limits the use of public facilities
 to persons of a particular race group (without requiring
 equivalent facilities for other race groups).
 Through the years, the South African Government has also
 enacted legislation that, in the name of security, curtails
 the civil liberties of those persons (of all races) whose
 statements, actions or associations are viewed as a serious
 challenge to the established order. In 1983 improvements
 took place, but detention without charge or trial and "bann-
 ings' of individuals, organizations, publications and gather-
 ings continued. ("Banning" is defined at a later point in the
 report.) On July 1, 1983, however, 54 persons were unbanned,
 reducing the number of banned individuals to 11, the lowest
 number in recent history. The enforcement of security legislation
 is primarily a duty of the South African Police.
 Despite 1982 orders for more humane treatment and care
 of detainees held under security laws, several died due to
 mistreatment by police officials, or allegedly committed
 suicide in detention in 1983. For the first time, however,
 action was taken against police and prison personnel who
 abused their power.
 As South Africa increasingly industrializes, the need for
 skilled black labor requires a large resident labor force
 near existing urban industrial areas--creating a conflict
 with the basic aim of "grand apartheid," namely to perpetuate
 political and physical separation of whites from non-whites.
 A special cabinet committee has been-announced which will
 consider the overall question of political rights for blacks
 living near these urban areas. In recent years black workers
 have benefited from increasing wages and, according to
 latest statistics, the wide gap between white and black wages
 is gradually narrowing. There have also been improvements in
 
 
 324
 the education and on-the-job treatment of non-white South
 Africans, especially blacks, reflecting the changing needs
 of South Africa's economy.
 The conflict surrounding apartheid in South Africa has created
 an increasingly vicious cycle of violence involving African
 National Congress attacks against military and non-military
 targets in South Africa and South African raids against the
 African National Congress in neighboring states. South African
 armed forces carried Out attacks in Mozambique in May and
 October 1983. The African National Congress (ANC) claimed
 responsibility for a bomb blast which killed 19 people in
 Pretoria in May 1983. Although South African troops remain
 in parts of southwestern Angola as part of South Africa's
 defense of its occupation of Namibia, South Africa has indi-
 cated a willingness to withdraw these forces on January 31,
 1984, providing certain conditions are met. South African
 forces are fighting the Southwest African People's Organization
 (SWAPO), a Marxist-oriented liberation movement which seeks
 independence for Namibia. It is also widely believed that
 South Africa extends support to groups in Mozambique and Angola
 engaged in guerilla warfare against the governments of those
 countries.
 Although there were clear improvements, South Africa's funda-
 mental human rights situation did not change in 1983. There
 remained no effective judicial remedy against the denational-
 ization of blacks into "independent* tribal homelands or
 against forced resettlements. Indefinite detention without
 charge or access to attorney and other judicial acts without
 due process, such as. banning, continue. The 83.3 percent of
 South Africa's population which is not part of the white minority
 suffers from pervasive discrimination which severely limits
 political, economic, and social life.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Cases of deaths in detention or at the hands of police, prison,
 or security police elements included six known instances with
 nine deaths in 1983. Prison wardens responsible for deaths
 of prisoners beaten or forced to work in the heat received long
 jail sentences. A police officer who shot and killed a prisoner
 is to be charged. Police who shot a community leader will also
 be prosecuted.
 --  On April 2, 1983, Saul Mkhize, Chairman of the Driefontein
 Council of Directors was killed when South African Police
 opened fire on a meeting organized to oppose the Government's
 plan to resettle Driefontein residents back to rural *homelands.'
 -- One month after the Mkhize incident, Themba Timothy Manana
 and Zepheniah Sibonyone, two detainees at the Dirkiesdorp
 Police Station, were found dead.
 
 
 325
 -- In February security officials in Venda (a so-called
 "independent homeland') were acquitted in the November 1981
 death of their prisoner, T. Muofhe. His family was awarded
 civil damages of R150,000 ($140,000).
 -- Tembuyise Simon Mndawe was found hanged in his cell
 in March 1983, following his detention by police on suspicion
 of terrorism.
 -- Louisa Mareme died while unable to receive medication
 for diabetes after being charged and held on a pass law
 offense.
 -- Paris Molifi Malatji was shot by police shortly after
 his arrest on suspicion of involvement with terrorism. The
 security police officer responsible has been charged with
 murdering a detainee and will stand trial in the Rand Supreme
 Court on February 6, 1984, according to the orders of a
 magistrate's court. According to press reports, this is the
 first time a security police officer will be tried in connec-
 tion with*a detainee a death.
 -- In September 1983, six wardens from the Barberton prison
 were acquitted of murder or culpable homicide, but were
 sentenced to long terms in prison for their complicity in
 the mistreatment deaths of four prisoners. In the aftermath
 of the trial, Justice Minister Coetsee declared that a thorough
 investigation-of the South African prison conditions would be
 made.
 -- Two policemen went on trial in mid-October in Randfontein.
 They were charged with culpable homicide in the death of L.
 H. Mosiane and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm
 to W. Gwagwa.
 -- Several participants in a boycott of the Ciskei "indepen-
 dent" homeland's bus company were arbitrarily gunned down
 by Ciskei security forces apparently for refusing to board
 homeland buses. At least 10 people were killed.
 The African National Congress claimed responsibility for a
 string of sabotage acts during 1983. The African National
 Congress has professed a policy of avoiding civilian deaths,
 but, nevertheless, innocent civilians have been killed and
 injured in their attacks. Targets of sabotage acts were
 primarily installations and offices involved with the admini-
 stration of apartheid in both white South Africa and the
 "independent" homelands. However, two incidents call African
 National Congress policy into question. In the first, on May
 20, a car bombing in downtown Pretoria left 19 dead and 200
 wounded. In the second, the African National Congress claimed
 credit for the October 11 bombing of railway tank cars in Warm
 Baths. While that incident did not cause any deaths or inju-
 ries, it included planting mines on the doors of nearby
 municipal offices.
 
 
 326
 Three African National Congress members, sentenced to death
 in August 1982 for their attacks on three police stations in
 which four constables were killed, were hanged on June 9,
 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 South African law does not require notification of a detainee's
 family, lawyer, or other person when an individual is detained
 or released,.and people have simply disappeared into police
 custody for long periods. The Second Police Amendment Act
 of 1980 prohibits unauthorized publication of the name of
 any person detained for "the prevention of or combatting of
 terroristic activities.* Police spokesmen usually do not
 volunteer information on detainees, but will often respond to
 written inquiries about their status.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Security legislation allows police considerable latitude in
 the arrest of suspects and in the interrogation of detainees.
 Defendants and witnesses in a number, of political trials have
 testified in court that they were assaulted or abused by
 police during interrogation. In late 1982, the Minister of
 Law and Order announced the issuance of an administrative
 directive providing for the humane treatment of detainees.
 Failure to comply with the provisions of the directive could
 result in disciplinary, and possibly criminal, actions against
 those involved. Despite this directive, mistreatment of
 detainees during detention continued in 1983. The death
 of diabetic L. Mareme [noted under (a) above] suggests that
 the Minister's directive is not always implemented. In early
 1983 the Minister of Law and Order, responding to accusations
 by the Detainees Parents Support Committee, stated that of 42
 cases of complaints by detainees, the Attorney General had
 refused prosecution in 30; 11 were unfounded and in one case,
 (Hagan) the police were found not guilty.
 Sections 18-23 of the Internal Security Act authorize the
 Minister of Law and Order to issue banning orders. Any
 person judged by the Minister as endangering law and order,
 threatening state security, or promoting the aims of communism
 or an unlawful organization can be (1) made to resign as an
 officer or member of any organization; (2) restricted to or
 excluded from certain areas; (3) prohibited from meeting with
 more than one person at a time; (4) ordered to report regularly
 to police stations; (5) prohibited from being quoted or pub-
 lished. No court of law can challenge the Minister's power to
 issue banning orders, although the Internal Security Act does
 provide for administrative review of banning orders. According
 to the South African Institute of Race Relations over 1,400
 South Africans have been banned at one time or another since
 1950. Approximately 370 of these persons left the country. On
 July 1, 1983, the South African Government did lift 54 banning
 orders, reducing the number of banned persons to 11, the lowest
 in many years.
 
 
 327
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Four clauses of the Internal Security Act authorize detention
 without charge or trial for varying--in some cases unlimited--
 periods by senior police officials when offenses such as
 terrorism or sabotage are suspected. Access to the detainee
 is severely restricted, and no court may challenge arrests
 under the provisions of this law. According to the South
 African Institute of Race Relations, the Detainee Parents'
 Support Committee and the South African Council of Churches,
 304 people have been detained at one time or another in the
 first eight months of 1983. One hundred and thirty-two were
 still held, 58 were charged and 114 released. Most of those
 detained were students or labor leaders. Eighty-eight had
 been'held in the i6-called "independent" Ciskei homeland
 under legislation similar to the Internal Security Act,
 including Father S. Mkhatshwa, a Catholic priest who was
 detained on October 30 on charges of holding an *illegal"
 meeting.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 While the principle of habeas corpus is affirmed in South
 African common law, it is nullified in practice by various
 security law provisions.   If a person cannot pay for his
 or her defense, limited funds for legal assistance are avail-
 able through the publicly funded Legal Aid Board or various
 private organizations. However, these sources do not accept
 all cases nor do they meet more than a fraction of the total
 need. As a rule, the court will appoint counsel without
 charge only in cases involving capital offenses. Once legal
 assistance is obtained and paid for, a defendant has access to
 counsel throughout the court proceedings. While convicted
 prisoners are generally allowed access to their attorneys, the
 timing and frequency of such visits are at the discretion of
 local prison authorities.
 Because security detainees may be interrogated without access
 to counsel, they may admit to actions or charges the implica-
 tions of which they may not fully understand. However, such
 statements often are not admissable in court. Many trials are
 held *in camera or in distant parts of the country making it
 difficult or impossible for family or others to attend. If
 deemed necessary by the court, witnesses may testify without
 being publicly identified. Security and criminal trials are
 held before regular courts which are generally regarded as
 independent of executive or military control, although all
 judges and practically all magistrates are white and thus the
 black population has virtually no representation in the judicial
 system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The system of apartheid, or political and social separation
 of ethnic groups, necessarily implies extensive government
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 22
 
 
 328
 regulation of areas of social, personal, and family life which
 in most democratic countries are considered matters of free
 choice. A person's membership in an ethnic group or race is
 itself not a matter of a person's self-identification, but is
 based on a decision by the Government and is determined in
 doubtful cases through administrative procedures involving a
 Race Classification Board which is empowered to weigh evidence
 and issue a verdict concerning an individual's race when the
 parents' racial classification is not known.
 Under apartheid, the people with whom one associates are not
 a matter of free choice in many cases. The Immorality and
 Mixed Marriages Act, for example, prohibits marriage or
 sexual relations between the races, although the Government
 tolerates some instances of "mixed" marriages. The Separate
 Amenities Act allows public premises to be reserved for the
 exclusive use of persons of a particular race or class, and
 was the basis in 1983 for reinstating prohibitions on non-
 whites in Pretoria public parks as well as maintaining segre-
 gated beaches in Durban. In November, a non-white cricket
 player from a visiting West Indies team was forcibly ejected
 from a train carriage reserved for "whites only.'
 Freedom to choose one's own associates is comprehensively and
 systematically limited by the concept that the four officially
 distinguished racial categories--white, Asian, colored and
 African--must live in separate areas. In the case of black
 South Africans, this means residing in.one of the "homelands"
 unless employment and state permission to reside in an urban
 area can be obtained.
 Up to 1983, black home ownership outside the homelands was
 extremely limited by laws and restrictions. Most homes
 are rented from the Government which owns and subsidizes
 them. Some more prosperous blacks construct their own houses
 in urban areas, but they cannot own the land. In July 1982,
 the Government announced a one-year policy of encouraging
 tenants to purchase their houses at a considerable discount off
 market value--or face much higher rentals. Under this new
 policy, blacks may obtain 99 year leases on land for home con-
 struction but were not granted freehold rights. Nevertheless,
 several million blacks may be able, if the initiative is
 properly funded, to live in houses they will own, a significant
 departure from past restrictions on non-white ownership and
 residency in areas outside the "homelands."
 Since the pattern of group residence sought by the developed
 apartheid system does not correspond to the actual location
 of various groups that existed when apartheid was set up,
 the Government has forcibly removed many people from their
 homes. These forced resettlements of black and colored "squat-
 ters" in urban areas and removal of black settled communities,
 "black spots," from designated white areas to black tribal
 homelands is a major feature of government policy. Such
 removals often result in violence, as in the October 1983
 attempt by officials to move squatters from Katlehong. In that
 instance, journalists were beaten and detained briefly. At the
 
 
 329
 Driefontein "black spot" Saul Mkhize died from police gunfire
 while he was said to be calming villagers angered at the
 prospect of forced relocation [noted in (a) above]. Villagers
 in the settlement of Mogopa were scheduled for removal in
 December, and it appears they will not all be compensated for
 their property. Since 1961, an estimated two million blacks,
 coloreds, and Indians have been forcibly relocated either to
 "homelands" or other parts of urban areas. Relocation camps,
 particularly in the homelands, have received criticism for
 inadequate facilities or non-provision of tools and adequate
 land or water for agriculture. Some white farmers have also
 been required by the Government to sell their land and relocate
 in order to allow for formation of "homelands," although compen-
 sation paid by the Government in these cases has generally been
 viewed as adequate.
 Blacks' residences and travel are regulated by a system of
 "influx control" or *pass" laws which severely restrict the
 number of blacks entitled to stay in a given urban area for
 more than 72 hours at a time. Periodically the police conduct
 raids or sweeps of the restricted areas during which all passes
 are checked. All persons illegally resident are arrested
 and/or transported to their associated homeland. In May 1983,
 in a landmark case, the appeals court upheld a Supreme Court
 decision in the Rikhoto case that migrants who have worked 10
 years or more for the same employer or 15 years for different
 employers are entitled to permanent city residency. In June
 the Government agreed to implement the decision, but parliament
 amended the Urban Consolidation Act with the effect of tying -
 the influx of families of resident workers to the availability
 of housing. In practice, this limits the impact of the decision.
 The Black (Urban Areas).Consolidation Act allows police to
 enter homes without a warrant if any black is suspected of
 illegally residing or working in the area. The Criminal
 Procedures Act of 1977 authorizes a judge or magistrate to
 issue a search warrant if reasonable belief exists that "the
 internal security of the Republic or the maintenance of law
 and order is likely to be endangered by or in consequence of
 a 'meeting' being held in a given place."  Under this same act
 a police officer may enter, search, and question anyone in a
 place without a warrant if the officer has reason to believe a
 warrant would be issued but the delay caused by first obtaining
 the warrant would defeat the purpose of the search.
 Freedom of association is regulated by a complex set of laws
 (outlined in the introduction to this report), which prescribe
 separate schools, residential areas, and public facilities
 for different racial groups and prohibit interracial sex
 or marriage. In addition, the Political Interference Act of
 1968 makes it unlawful for a person of one racial group to join
 a political party which has members from another racial group;
 to participate in an election campaign for a person of another
 racial group; or to address a group for the purpose of promo-
 ting a political party.
 In recent years the Government has expanded the scope of
 administrative exceptions from apartheid laws allowing some
 
 
 330
 restaurants, drive-in theaters, private hospitals, parks,
 libraries, and other public amenities to admit persons of all
 races upon application. Certain legal barriers to inter-racial
 sport have also been removed, so that, while apartheid remains
 entrenched in sport under the new constitution, sport does
 represent an area in which some of the most visible instances
 of increased interaction between the races have taken place.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The press, although basically white and establishment-oriented,
 continues to be a vigorous critic of the Government of South
 Africa. Despite the progressive erosion of press freedom
 over the last decade, the press remains a vital channel of
 communication within South Africa and with the outside world.
 Creation of a media council in 1983 could change the terms of
 press freedom in an as yet undetermined manner. The Govern-
 ment has circumscribed the areas on which the press may report.
 Among the areas proscribed are energy supplies, including
 petroleum and nuclear energy, and protection of "official
 secrets."  In addition to restrictive legislation, the Govern-
 ment occasionally takes direct action to suppress press activi-
 ties, including banning newspapers and journalists. Direct
 government censorship of all other publications, films and
 public entertainment is authorized by the Publications Act of
 1974. However, this act does not apply to newspapers.
 Television and radio are not directly censored, but these media
 are government monopolies and reports and comment opposed
 to the Government, while permitted, are limited and controlled.
 The government-appointed Publications Committee established
 by the act may prohibit the distribution or possession of
 publications, films, or other public entertainment that in its
 view is "obscene" or "blasphemous* (interpreted more broadly
 than in the U.S.), brings any section of the public into
 ridicule, harms relations between sections of the public, or
 is prejudicial to the safety of the state. Decisions of the
 Publications Committee may be appealed to the government-
 appointed Publications Appeal Board, but not to the courts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Internal Security Act obstructs freedom of assembly as
 it gives magistrates the power to prohibit gatherings under
 certain conditions, to impose conditions on the holding of
 meetings and to close off areas to the public to prevent
 prohibited gatherings. In response to widespread unrest in
 1976, the Minister of Justice banned all outdoor gatherings
 except sports or specially authorized meetings. Though origi-
 nally invoked for a one-year period, the ban has been renewed
 each succeeding year and is still in effect.
 Freedom of association is discussed in Section 1(f) of this
 report.
 
 
 331
 With-regard to labor unions, the Labor Relations Act in princi-
 ple allows total freedom of association. However, this princi-
 ple does not as yet apply across the board. The mining sector
 is covered by the Mines and Works Act which still contains
 racially based employment criteria. More than two million
 agricultural and domestic workers are not covered at all.
 Problems still exist with the issue of union registration and
 job reservation. However, the numbers of recognition agreements
 and negotiated wage settlements continue to increase, providing
 greater leverage by non-whites in the nation's economic life.
 In a milestone case, the Chamber of Mines for the first time
 recognized a union of black mine workers, the National Union of
 Mineworkers. Negotiations on wages between the Union and the
 Chamber are underway. Workers of all races are prohibited by
 law from picketing. Virtually all strikes are illegal, but the
 Government has not usually prosecuted leaders in the vast
 majority of strike incidents.
 In 1983, two black trade unionists were banned and at least
 21 were detained. An unknown number of black trade union
 officials are serving time. In the last 18 months, six leaders
 have been sentenced to jail terms. A prominent trade union was
 banned and several of its organizers detained in the Ciskei
 *homeland* following political turmoil in that area of South
 Africa.
 Contact with international labor groupings and other national
 labor centers, including United States labor organizations, is
 monitored, but allowed. There has been some selectivity in the
 granting of visas to foreign trade unionists wishing to visit
 South Africa. The International Labor Organization through its
 Apartheid Committee has been highly critical of South Africa's
 detentions without charge and bannings of black trade union
 officials.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of worship is generally respected. Religious organiza-
 tions are allowed to hold meetings and other activities without
 interference as long as they do not seriously challenge govern-
 ment policies. Many churches do challenge apartheid as a matter
 of theological doctrine. Church groups were very active during
 the national debate on the proposed constitution, urging their
 membership to support or oppose reforms in the November 2 refer-
 endum. New legislation took effect January 1, 1984, which for
 the first time provides for non-combattant roles and community
 service alternatives for conscientious objectors who refuse
 military service on religious grounds only. Non-religious
 objectors will still be subject to a maximum six-year prison
 sentence for refusing to serve.
 Government Ministers often criticize the South African Council
 of Churches and its General Secretary, Anglican Bishop Desmond
 Tutu. Bishop Tutu's travel abroad has been limited since
 his passport was revoked in 1981. The Bishop was issued a
 special two-week document in late 1982 to attend an Episcopal
 
 
 332
 convention in the United States, and was granted documenta-
 tion in 1983 to attend a U.N. seminar in Geneva, a meeting
 in Canada, and, on another occasion, to receive a church award
 in the United States. He was subsequently denied a passport to
 attend another meeting abroad. Some clergymen who actively
 opposed government policy have been banned. C.F. Beyers Naude,
 Afrikaner apartheid critic, was served with a new three-year
 banning order in October 1982, which was not one of those
 lifted in July.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 White South Africans, other than banned persons, must obtain
 permits to visit some black areas, but are otherwise free
 to move about the country. Whites must possess valid travel
 documents in order to travel abroad and to emigrate legally.
 Legal restrictions exist for Asians who wish to reside in
 or visit the Orange Free State and certain parts of the Natal
 Province. These restrictions are lifted only with special
 permission.
 The influx control, or "pass law* system is described in
 Section 1(f) of this report.
 A citizen's access to a South African passport has been de-
 clared a privilege, not a right. According to a court ruling
 in 1982, the Minister of Internal Affairs has an *unchallenged
 right to revoke' a passport without *ascribing any reasons for
 his action.* The Government generally requires that an indivi-
 dual assigned to an "independent* homeland travel abroad on a
 homeland travel document. No country except South Africa
 recognizes the "independent" homelands as sovereign states
 which negates the validity of such passports. Many blacks
 refuse invitations to travel abroad to avoid appearing to
 accept non-South African citizenship through the acceptance of
 a homeland passport. Through its restrictive passport policies,
 the Government has blocked or hampered the travel from South
 Africa of some participants in U.S. Government-funded programs
 or private activities taking place abroad. Although emigration
 from South Africa is unrestricted for those with valid travel
 documents, it is in fact, discouraged somewhat by currency
 regulations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 For many decades, South Africa has had national democratic
 institutions, but for whites only. Under the Government reform
 proposals affecting coloreds and Asians which were approved by
 a two-thirds majority of white voters on November 2, 1983,
 political participation at the national level will no longer be
 strictly limited to white South Africans. However, national
 political rights for black South Africans, who comprise 72
 percent of the population continue to be denied. While the
 ruling National Party has a large parliamentary majority, three
 smaller opposition parties also hold seats. These opposition
 parties operate as freely as the ruling party.
 
 
 The proposals recently approved call for creation of a racial-
 ly based tricameral parliament with chambers for whites,
 coloreds, and Asians. Members of each house would be elected
 on separate voter rolls. Each chamber would have primary
 responsibility for legislation affecting its own racial consti-
 tuency. A strong executive, the State President, decides which
 issues of general concern should be treated by all chambers.
 Be may ask the President's Council, a multiracial consultative
 body, for an advisory opinion. The Supreme Court may review
 whether the State President followed prescribed procedures, but
 may not pronounce on an issue itself. The State President would
 appoint the Cabinet from the Parliament on the basis of a racial
 ratio which would ensure a white majority (whites: 4, coloreds:
 2, Asians: 1). The State President would be elected by an
 electoral college containing a substantial majority of whites,
 but also including coloreds and Asians. The State President
 would replace the Prime Minister in the current system as head
 of government and would have the power to dissolve parliament
 and to call new elections. The Government has not yet decided
 whether to hold a referendum whereby the colored and Indian
 communities would be given the choice of whether to participate
 in the new Constitution.
 Thus far,* the South African Government continues to require
 that national-level black political aspirations be realized
 in the "homelands,* that is, in new "states' nominally indepen-
 dent of South Africa. In townships near white areas, local
 black government bodies exercise some limited control over their
 community affairs. Since 1970, all blacks have been considered
 "citizens' of one of 10 designated homelands, created by the
 government and destined for eventual "independence." Each black
 is assigned to an ethnic group and to a homeland from birth--
 regardless of whether the individual was born, has lived in, or
 has ever.visited that homeland. When a homeland becomes "inde-
 pendent' all blacks assigned to it lose their South African
 citizenship and retain only the "citizenship" of the homeland.
 All "citizens* of the homelands are entitled to participate in
 the homeland political process, such as it is. However, except
 in Bophuthatswana, at least half of the so-called 'independent'
 homeland legislatures' members are appointed. A number of home-
 land opposition leaders have been restricted or imprisoned, and
 white civil servants seconded from the South African Government
 still wield considerable decision-making power. To a large
 extent, *independent' homelands have adopted *security* legi-
 slation modeled on that of South Africa. Transkei, Venda, and
 Ciskei have used these laws against political opponents of the
 Government. The 'Constitution' of Bophuthatswana contains a
 bill of rights patterned on the European Convention of Human
 Rights.
 Although all blacks are technically homeland citizens, approxi-
 mately 10 million live in so-called white areas, usually in
 townships in urban areas. Urban blacks may participate in
 elections for community council members who exercise some
 
 
 334
 control over township affairs. These elections have been
 heavily boycotted, and the role of these councils is circum-
 scribed by their continuing financial and administrative
 dependence on the South African Department of Cooperation and
 Development and the administration boards which oversee them.
 The Black Local Authorities Act of 1982 raised the rights and
 responsibilities of these black municipal authorities to the
 status of white municipal governments; this change has as yet
 had little effect.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 South Africa extends little or no cooperation to various
 United Nations bodies or private organizations, like Amnesty
 International, which investigate South Africa's human rights
 record. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is
 permitted access to convicted security prisoners and visits
 them annually. The Committee does not visit security prisoners
 sentenced to death because the South African Government refuses
 to permit the Committee to speak to the prisoners in private.
 Access to most but not all security detainees is denied. In its
 1983 report, Amnesty International expressed concern about the
 use of detention without trial and alleged torture and ill-
 treatment of political detainees, and also about the use of
 banning orders to restrict political opposition to the Govern-
 ment. However, Freedom House amended its 1983 assessment of
 South Africa to "partly free," from its 1982 "not free"
 assessment.
 A number of South African organizations observe, report, and
 contest human rights violations in the country. Black politi-
 cal organizations are active in calling for a society based on
 internationally accepted principles of human rights. In
 June 1980, a Lawyers for Human Rights Association was formed
 to monitor and suggest changes in the human rights situation
 in South Africa. The multiracial Black Sash organization
 reports extensively on the abuses of the influx control system
 based on its experience in assisting blacks who have run afoul
 of the pass laws. The South African Council of Churches speaks
 out on a wide range of human rights issues and is active in
 assisting persons incarcerated under security laws and groups
 denied their human rights. The South African Institute of Race
 Relations numbers among its activities the compilation of lists
 and statistical information on security detainees and banned
 persons. The Detainees' Parents Support Committee also com-
 piles statistics on persons detained under security legisla-
 tion and provides support for families of detainees.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The dualistic South African economy contains both a highly
 sophisticated modern sector and a large, underdeveloped rural
 sector where the vast majority of people are engaged in subsi-
 stence agriculture. Virtually the entire white and Asian
 populations, and a significant portion of the "colored" popu-
 lation, receive their income from the modern economy. Most
 
 
 335
 of the economically active black population of approximately
 seven million also participate in the modern economy, though
 generally at significantly lower rates of remuneration and
 skill/authority levels. Some progress has taken place in
 the area of wage levels at the behest of American firms in
 South Africa adhering to the Sullivan Code (a set of fair
 employment principles developed by the Rev. Leon Sullivan,
 an American cleric), which have also led efforts to provide
 non-white employees with housinq, education and other bene-
 fits equal to the advantages enjoyed by whites. Various
 apartheid regulations effectively prevent many blacks from
 fully participating in the modern sector. However, there have
 been reports that the Government intends to ease prohibitions
 on non-white business activity in heretofore all-white business
 areas. Roughly half of the black population resides in the
 various homelands which for the most part are resource-poor and
 lacking in job opportunities.
 Although there has been some economic development in a few
 homeland areas, subsistence agriculture, supplemented by
 remittances from relatives working in "white' South Africa,
 is the most prevalent source of livelihood. Since many, if
 not most, of the economically active males in the homelands
 seek employment in the modern sector of "white" South Africa,
 a disproportionate number of dependents (women, children, and
 elderly) actually reside in the homelands. Over 60 percent
 of the population aged 20-65 residing in the 10 homelands is
 female. Though agricultural progress is being achieved in
 some rural black areas, the homelands as a whole do not pro-
 duce enough food to feed their resident populations. Despite
 Government claims that the homelands are potentially self-
 sufficient agriculturally, overpopulation and inappropriate
 farming practices continue to result in a decline in agricul-
 ture. The extensive 1983 drought only served to underscore the
 economic vulnerability of rural blacks. Widespread malnutri-
 tion and occasional famine among rural blacks resulting from
 the drought received very little official attention. Private
 voluntary relief efforts were vastly outpaced by the extent of
 the crisis.
 Building on earlier decentralization schemes designed to
 induce more rapid economic development in the periphery, the
 South African Government launched a regional development pro-
 gram in April 1982. The development plan divided the country
 into eight development regions (cutting across "black' and
 .white" areas) and provided a range of economic incentives
 to firms or entrepreneurs willing to start or expand opera-
 tions in these areas. To date the program has been much more
 successful in attracting businesses to the homelands than the
 previous programs and thus has increased the number of avail-
 able jobs in these areas. Critics, however, charge that no new
 jobs have been created; work opportunities have merely been
 transferred from "white' urban areas to black homelands. They
 charge that too little emphasis is given to agricultural
 development, a vital need in the homelands, but which might
 hurt white farmers.
 
 
 336
 In June 1983, the Southern African Development Bank was
 launched to finance the infrastructure needed to facilitate
 decentralization. The total share capital of the bank is R2
 billion and the Government will contribute R300 million per
 year to the bank ($1 - 1.09 rand). The Small Business Develop-
 ment Corporation, a semi-private corporation, has spent over
 R50 million in the past year to help set up or expand businesses,
 largely black owned or run, with total investments of under
 R500,000. The South African Government has estimated that an
 annual real economic growth of five to six percent is necessary
 for the economy to absorb the approximately 250,000 blacks
 entering the labor market each year. An even higher rate of
 growth would be necessary to reduce present black unemployment.
 Economic growth will also, as it has in the recent past, help
 narrow existing income, employment, education, etc., gaps
 between whites and blacks.
 World Bank data indicate a relatively high per capita Gross
 National Product of $2,717 in 1983. Income distribution has
 traditionally been skewed along racial lines, though this
 phenomenon has diminished to some degree. A respected study
 by a South African university indicates that the black share
 of personal income has been rising in recent years, from 23
 percent of the total in 1970 to 29 percent in 1980. While
 the real increase in personal income was 10 percent from 1975
 to 1980 for the country as a whole, it was 3 percent for
 whites, 26 percent for Asians, 17 percent for coloreds, and
 23 percent for blacks, according to the same study. Between
 1970 and 1980, a period of impressive economic growth in South
 Africa, the average annual earnings of black wage-earners
 quadrupled, rising by more than five percent a year in real
 terms. This compares with a slightly negative trend in real
 earnings for white workers over the same period.
 A recent government statistical survey found that the aver-
 age salary for blacks has more than trebled since 1979 while
 white average earnings have not quite doubled in the same
 period. An average black salary, it found, is around R290 a
 month while the average colored person takes home R385, and
 the average Indian R540. Whites, on the other hand, have an
 average monthly salary of just more than R1,100. In the mines,
 a black worker earns an average of R272 a month; a colored
 colleague earns an average of R 470, Indians are paid R760,
 and whites R1,500. In the public service (including all
 homelands), the black average is R275 a month as opposed to a
 white average of R1,020.
 Black unemployment is not measured directly. Official figures
 show an increase in unemployment among the economically active
 population throughout 1982 and 1983. This does not reflect
 conditions of unemployment and underemployment in the rural
 areas. The unemployment rate among blacks was officially
 recorded at 8.4 percent (479,000 unemployed) in June 1983. As
 the economy continued to experience a downturn over the past
 two years, unemployment has risen generally and this phenome-
 non has been more serious among the black population. Unem-
 ployment among whites is less than one percent and is only
 marginally higher among Asians and coloreds. Private estimates
 of total black unemployment (including the 10 homelands) range
 up to 20 percent or more.
 
 
 337
 According to the World Bank, the South African population was
 30,938,000 in 1983 with an overall growth rate of 2.4 percent.
 The most recent census of the country's population, taken in
 1980, records average annual-population growth rates by racial
 groups from 1970 to 1980 as: white, 1.7 percent; coloreds, 2.2
 percent; Asians, 1.4 percent; and blacks, 2.7 percent.
 World'Bank statistics concerning infant mortality rates per
 1,000 live births, in 1983 were 90.2. Government statistics
 by racial group in 1978 were: whites, 14.9; coloreds, 80.6;
 and Asians, 25.3. Records for blacks are incomplete, but
 estimates of infant mortality among this sector of the popula-
 tion range up to more than 200 per 1,000 live births, especi-
 ally in rural homelands such as Ciskei. The higher rate of
 infant mortality among blacks is ascribed largely to poor
 sanitary conditions and lower standards of nutrition. These
 factors, combined with the lack of sufficient hospitals and
 doctors for blacks, especially in the homelands, account
 for the differences in life expectancy among the different
 population groups. World Bank statistics for 1980 show a
 life expectancy of 61.2 years for all South Africans. A 1983
 South African Government report indicates whites have a life
 expectancy of 70.3 years, Asians 65 years, coloreds 59 years,
 and blacks 57.5 years.
 The most recent World Bank data available indicate that, as
 of 1960, 57 percent of the adult population of South Africa
 was literate. Since for whites, coloreds, and Asians school
 attendance is compulsory, it is likely that virtually all
 adult members of these groups are literate. In 1981, black
 pupil enrollment was just over five million in regular primary
 through high school grades. Only slightly more than one
 percent of enrollment was in the last grade of high school,
 illustrative of a high drop-out rate. A private study indi-
 cated that of black school-leavers, some 54 percent departed
 prior to achieving literacy.
 The Government has reiterated its commitment to racially
 segregated education in responding negatively to recommenda-
 tions for establishment of a single system. However, within
 the present system, the Government has been devoting consider-
 ably increased funds to educating blacks. Annual expenditures
 on black education have increased 15-fold over the past decade.
 In the 1983/84 budget, spending on education for blacks rose
 18 percent, versus a 15 percent rise for white education
 expenditures. There remains, however, a huge disparity between
 spending on blacks as opposed to whites, with the Government
 spending approximately Ri0 on each white student for every Ri
 spent on each black student. Starting in 1981, free compulsory
 education began to be gradually Introduced for blacks. It is
 now in effect at 250 schools with a total of 100,000 students
 affected. Compulsory education presently goes up to fourth
 grade.
 
 
 338
 There are separate universities for each of the races. 'White"
 universities are permitted to admit students of other races, but
 the approval of the Minister of National Education is required
 for non-white students to obtain degrees in certain subjects,
 such as medicine or veterinary science, at such universities.
 Black enrollment at "white" universities has been growing slowly
 but is still low. The growth in enrollment became a contro-
 versial issue during the past year with the passage of a bill
 placing limits or quotas on the number of blacks who could
 attend white schools. Previously there was no limit, but each
 black wishing to attend a white university had to obtain special
 government permission. The Government claimed the new provision
 made things easier for blacks, but a number of white universities
 objected to the idea of having to enforce quotas. The contro-
 versy was defused in September 1983 when the Minister of National
 Education foreswore the enforcement of quotas. The statute,
 however, will remain on the books and the Government has
 expressed a desire to maintain the present *character" of the
 white universities.
 Women in South Africa suffer legal, cultural and economic
 discrimination. The latest South African statistics show
 that while women constitute 41.4 percent of the workforce, they
 hold only 13 percent of managerial positions. One Transvaal
 Education Department textbook lists eight negative aspects of
 women in the workforce. For white women, Minister of Finance
 Owen Norwood has disallowed the prior Building Society practice
 of asking married women for certificates of sterilization
 before joint salary of husband and wife would be taken into
 account for granting home loans. South African tax laws still
 view married women as virtual minors unless they make special
 contractual arrangements with their husbands to retain certain
 financial and legal powers which are normally given to the
 husband at marriage, although there have been reports that the
 Government will introduce legislation in 1984 to amend these
 laws for white, colored, and Asian women only. Black women con-
 tinue to suffer far greater differentiation than their white
 counterparts. Domestic workers, most of whom are black, are not
 protected by minimum wage laws and do not qualify for sick leave
 or maternity benefits. The law generally regards black women as
 perpetual minors which severely limits their ability to own
 property and rent accommodations in urban areas where they find
 employment. In October 1983, the Government announced plans to
 review the legal status of all women.
