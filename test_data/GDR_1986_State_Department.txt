 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The German Democratic Republic (G.D.R.) was created in 1949 as
 a Communist state out of the Soviet occupation zone of
 Germany. There are still approximately 380,000 Soviet troops
 stationed on its soil. The country is ruled by the Communist
 Party, known as the Socialist Unity Party (SED), which closely
 resembles the Soviet model. Four other parties, whose
 existence is tolerated, have no real power or independence,
 and the SED leadership makes all important political,
 economic, and social decisions.
 Despite such formidable barriers as the Berlin Wall, deep
 historical, cultural, linguistic, and family ties remain
 between the people of the German Democratic Republic and those
 of the Federal Republic of Germany. Concern that such ties
 and constant exposure to Western values could undermine
 support for the Communist system is a central reason for the
 Government's tight control over its population. For this
 purpose, the Government has an.efficient and pervasive
 security apparatus administered by the Ministries of the
 Interior and State Security. Together, they employ
 approximately 300,000 people.
 The G.D.R. has a centrally planned economy in which the bulk
 of industrial and agricultural property is state owned.
 Although holding private property is permitted, controls are
 placed on its acquisition, inheritance, and the income derived
 from it. Private businesses are few and tightly controlled.
 The G.D.R. continues to restrict the fundamental freedoms of
 thought, speech, religion, assembly, and travel. A large
 secret police apparatus, which is supplemented by informers,
 opens mail, installs listening devices, places people under
 surveillance, subjects them to interrogation and intimidation,
 and arrests them without due process.
 In 1986 the rate of emigration from the G.D.R. is expected to
 equal or slightly exceed the rate for 1985, which was the
 G.D.R.'s most liberal year for emigration with the exception
 of 1984, when 35,000 left in an unprecedented "emigration
 wave." In 1985 over 21,000 people left the G.D.R. with
 Government permission, most departing for the Federal Republic
 of Germany; however, it is estimated that another 300,000 to
 500,000 wish to leave.
 Since the beginning of 1986, the Government has allowed an
 unusually large number of G.D.R. citizens below retirement age
 to travel to the West on family matters. Although it has not
 formally relaxed its rigid restrictions and controls on
 travel, the Government is increasingly making exceptions to
 its own rules. In 1985 over 66,000 people from the G.D.R.
 were permitted such travel; it is estimated that the 1986
 figure will be more than 200,000.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Incidents of concern in 1986 involved persons attempting to
 leave the German Democratic Republic illegally. A 1982 law
 codified confidential orders to border guards that they should
 shoot, if necessary, to prevent a person from leaving the
 
 
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 country without permission. A number of shooting incidents
 along the Berlin Wall in 1986 served as reminders that this
 law is still in force, despite some press reports to the
 contrary. In early September, border guards continued
 shooting at a G.D.R. automobile, which had attempted to cross
 through the Drewitz control point, even after the vehicle had
 been brought to a stop. The driver was then carried away,
 apparently lifeless. This was the first apparent killing of a
 would-be escapee since 1984. Similarly, a young man was shot
 and killed by border guards as he attempted to cross the Wall
 on November 24. Individuals and police in West Berlin have
 reported hearing shots during a number of other escape
 attempts in the past 4 months.
 Unauthorized border crossings have decreased steadily since
 1982 to a low of 160 for 1985. Although the Government has
 claimed to have removed some of the more lethal barriers along
 its borders, such as automatic shooting devices and
 minefields, it has increased the height of the border fence to
 3 meters, set up 150 kilometers of dog runs, and begun
 expanding its system of barriers on the inner-German border to
 a depth of approximately 20 kilometers. Any who attempt
 escape still risk death. No exact figure for the number of
 unsuccessful escape attempts, and resulting deaths, can be
 given since border guards from the Federal Republic of Germany
 are not necessarily aware of all incidents.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of permanent disappearance.
 c. Torture, and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Specific laws state that life, health, and the ability to work
 of arrestees and prisoners must not be jeopardized. However,
 citizens who fled the country in 1986 have reported cruel
 treatment by prison officials, including the beating and
 hanging of prisoners by their hands for periods of several
 hours. In addition, former prisoners and detainees have
 reported excessively harsh conditions and psychological strain
 in G.D.R. prisons.
 In a special resolution in September 1986, the Council of
 Europe denounced prison conditions in the G.D.R. and called
 upon the Government to uphold the principles of the United
 Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
 which it ratified in 1973. The Council of Europe criticized
 such practices as denial of sleep, threats of repression
 against family members, unhealthful conditions during forced
 labor, inadequate food and medical care, and the placing of
 prisoners in overcrowded cells. The Council of Europe also
 claimed that female prisoners are often separated from their
 infants born in prison. There have also been reports of
 prisoners subjected to extended periods of solitary
 confinement. According to newspaper accounts, former border
 guard Bodo Strelow has been in solitary confinement for the
 past 6 years as punishment for a failed escape. Mr. Strelow
 was sentenced to life-long imprisonment despite injuries
 suffered during the escape attempt which resulted in the loss
 of an eye and his hearing.

 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The police have blanket authority to detain and interrogate
 G.D.R. citizens on suspicion alone. G.D.R. citizens who
 become particularly active in officially disapproved ways are
 sometimes subject to repeated harassment, such as regular
 police interrogations, despite the absence of formal charges.
 They may be arrested with or without warrants and merely for
 expressing dissenting views. When held in detention, a person
 does not have the right to a judicial determination of
 continued detention.
 Although the criminal procedure code sets a limit of 3 months
 on investigatory proceedings, prosecuting authorities appear
 to have no difficulty in extending this period. In most
 political cases it takes longer than 24 hours--often many
 weeks--before interested parties are notified of the arrest.
 Furthermore, the code does not specify a maximum time period
 which may elapse before a detained person may see a lawyer.
 Although the code guarantees access to a defense attorney, the
 prosecutor may monitor or restrict contacts between the
 defense attorney and his client as he sees fit.
 Ciarges filed in clearly political cases are often based on
 laws which are written in vague and general language. The
 penal code provides, for instance, that the transmission of
 information "detrimental to the interests of the German
 Democratic Republic," even if it is not secret, may be
 considered treason. Laws against "anti-State agitation" and
 "asocial behavior (parasitism)" are often applied selectively
 against citizens who become politically active. Their broad
 and vague wording severely restricts the possibility for
 defense. Amnesty International states that it has yet to
 learn of an acquittal when a prisoner has been brought to
 trial under these laws.
 Forced labor as a means of political coercion or education is
 not-practiced in the G.D.R.
 . e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In cases involving security and political issues, judges may
 bar individuals or groups from "open trials." Prisoners are
 allowed to choose a lawyer from a list of those available in
 their area. However, all attorneys are state employees, and
 only a handful are willing to take on political cases. Until
 investigatory proceedings are completed, prisoners may see
 their lawyers only in the presence of the police and may
 discuss only matters not relating to the case. Discussion of
 a case itself usually takes place in a brief interview shortly
 before a trial. Attorneys are not allowed to make photocopies
 or tape recordings of their clients' files; files may be
 reviewed only in court, and notes must be taken in longhand.
 Trials tend to be short and perfunctory. Constitutionally,
 the courts are under the control of the Council of State; in
 reality, they are controlled by the SED, which appoints the
 judges. Military courts try civilians only in military
 espionage cases.
 The Government does not admit to having political prisoners,
 nor does it publish statistics which would assist in
 determining the number of political prisoners held. However,
 in early December in Bonn, the Minister for Inner-German
 Relations announced that his Ministry had bought freedom for
 
 
 921
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 some 2,500 political prisoners from the G.D.R. At the same
 time, the Salzgitter center in the Federal Republic of
 Germany, which monitors G.D.R. human rights abuses, has
 registered 24,716 prosecutions for political offenses in the
 German Democratic Republic over the past 25 years. Such
 prosecutions generally result in a prison sentence of 18 to 24
 months. Most observers agree that approximately half of all
 political prisoners are in jail because of efforts to emigrate.
 The West German-based International Society for Human Rights
 estimates that there are 6,000 political prisoners, while
 Helsinki Watch reports estimates of political prisoners that
 range from 7,000 to 10,000. Sources at the Permanent
 Representation of the Federal Republic of Germany in East
 Berlin and Radio Free Europe have stated publicly that "over
 1,000" people in the G.D.R. are presently imprisoned for their
 desire to emigrate.  In a discussion in December with the
 press, the Minister for Inner-German Relations in Bonn-
 estimated that there are at present approximately 2,000
 political prisoners in the German Democratic Republic, 1,025
 of whom are known by name to his Ministry.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 By law, the police need authorization to enter and search a
 house. But they may authorize entry themselves, and the
 courts will retroactively give approval. It is routine and
 legal for the state security organs to tap telephones and open
 mail, solely on their own authority. Evidence thus obtained
 can be used in court. The Government has instilled a
 widespread belief that state security informants are
 ubiquitous and discovery of opposition to the State is certain.
 All printed materials require an official permit. Only
 magazines and newspapers bearing a postal license may be
 legally imported and distributed. West German television can
 be viewed by 80 percent of the G.D.R. populace, and Western
 radio broadcasts can be heard throughout the country. The
 Government does not attempt to jam or otherwise hinder these
 broadcasts.
 Young people are not forced to join the SED's youth movement,
 the Free German Youth, but school and government authorities
 make it clear that failure to join this group will limit
 educational and job opportunities. Helsinki Watch reports
 that 15- and 16-year-olds must attend a 2-week paramilitary
 training camp where they learn such skills as using weapons
 and throwing grenades.
 G.D.R. citizens must obtain government permission to marry
 foreigners. The Government appears to be following faithfully
 the letter of an October 1983 law which specifies that
 authorities should decide on applications for binational
 marriage within 6 months of submission of the application.
 Assembling documents for submission can be time-consuming,
 however.
 G.D.R. citizens in positions deemed "sensitive" by the
 Government may not be visited by or even maintain contacts
 with close relatives who live in the West.
 
 
 922
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is severely circumscribed. Unauthorized
 public expressions of dissent are often punished with prison
 sentences. According to church sources, in 1986 an
 electrician in Jena was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment for
 painting a slogan criticizing the G.D.R.'s elections on a
 house facade. Also in Jena, another citizen was sentenced to
 8 months' imprisonment for pasting an unauthorized collage
 made of G.D.R. newspaper cuttings on his apartment door.
 Other young citizens in Jena were fined for taking part in an
 unauthorized "open-air breakfast." Jena authorities are known
 to be particularly intolerant since their city was a center of
 dissent in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
 The authorities also seek to control the opinions citizens
 express while abroad. They recently refused permission to
 author Lutz Rathenow to visit the United States at the
 invitation of the University of Texas. In a letter to Mr.
 RatheRow, the Ministry of Culture justified its decision by
 stating that only cultural figures who will present a positive
 image of the country will be allowed to travel abroad.
 The Government controls and censors all media and licenses all
 publications before their distribution. Helsinki Watch
 reported that in 1986 even church newspapers, usually subject
 to less censorship, were delayed or withdrawn from publication
 for trying to publish material on such issues as the
 independent peace movement and state environmental policies.
 Western newspapers and magazines, other than politically
 acceptable publications such as those of Western Communist
 parties, are unavailable to the general public. Small
 quantities of Western journals are for sale for hard currency
 in international hotels upon request. Some libraries,
 university departments, and official institutes also receive
 Western journals, but circulation is highly restricted.
 G.D.R. and Western travelers may be interrogated or arrested
 simply for possessing unlicensed printed material. Contact
 with Western journalists is severely limited by law; for the
 average citizen, such contact is illegal.
 The SED conceives of art and literature as a means of
 promoting political goals. Works are judged on the basis of
 their conformity to "socialist realism," i.e., whether they
 convey a clear, optimistic view of Communist society and
 goals. Contrary views or perceptions are discouraged or
 censored. Professional associations for writers and artists
 are headed by party members and controlled by the State.
 Dissidents and critics have been expelled and deprived of
 important professional privileges. Publishing houses practice
 self-censorship, and works must receive official clearance
 before they are published, performed, or exhibited. Some
 works are banned completely; others may be published only
 outside the country under contracts negotiated by the
 state-run agencies; others are permitted to be published,
 performed, or exhibited in the German Democratic Republic only
 in edited form. Cultural figures continue to emigrate to the
 Federal Republic of Germany to escape these government
 restrictions.
 Individual academic freedom is severely limited and even
 formally restricted by law. The State views education as an
 
 
 923
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 instrument for "building socialism." All areas of academic
 inquiry are strictly controlled. Teachers who allow open
 classroom discussion of unapproved themes or topics or who
 deviate from the party line are disciplined. Many books are
 prohibited totally; others are permitted only in university
 libraries to which only carefully screened and authorized
 personnel are allowed access.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The formation of private organizations or clubs also requires
 state permission. Although the Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, only the Christian churches have
 maintained the ability to organize meetings without prior
 state approval, although even they exercise self-censorship to
 avoid unduly antagonizing the State.
 Workers do not have the right to establish and join unions of
 their own choosing. The Free German Trade Union is an
 appendage of the SED. It is made up of 16 unions covering all
 workers and professionals. Its role is to enforce and promote
 official government and party policies rather than to promote
 members' interests which might conflict with those policies.
 The right to strike does not exist; however, there are
 occasional reports of wildcat strikes. One such strike
 reportedly occurred in Karl-Marx-Stadt district in September.
 The workers' objective was the partial payment of wages in
 hard currency, which is increasingly necessary to obtain not
 only luxury goods but also many basic amenities. Reportedly,
 the workers were not punished for their illegal strike, as
 they had not "agitated against the Socialist State."
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief and
 worship, but the State officially promotes atheism. In
 practice, the State tolerates, although it does not encourage,
 religious activity. Overt adherence to religious beliefs may
 result in disqualification for preferred jobs and educational
 opportunities, although the largest religious community, the
 mainly Lutheran Evangelical Church, has had some success in
 pleading the cases of its members who have suffered such
 discrimination.
 Clergy and lay members of Western churches have been permitted
 to attend church synods and conferences at a national
 ecumenical level, and some religious leaders have been allowed
 to attend similar meetings in the West. The authorities
 prohibit official relations between congregations in the
 German Democratic Republic and Federal Republic of Germany,
 and they often do not permit personal visits by West German
 clergy when they suspect church business will be discussed.
 The churches remain under continuing government pressure to
 watch their words and deeds, and the secret police continue to
 monitor church-sponsored events closely. Nevertheless, the
 Evangelical Church remains the only institutional forum where
 divergent opinions can be expressed with relative freedom.
 New churches continue to be built in limited numbers with
 government approval. The Government has demonstrated some
 flexibility in its treatment of minority religions. However,
 it recently reaffirmed a ban on organized activities by
 Christian Scientists and Jehovah's Witnesses.

 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Most citizens can travel freely within the country, except
 near borders or military installations. They are not allowed
 to change their place of residence without government
 permission. All citizens must carry identification cards
 which the police have the right to check at will. Because of
 their criminal or political activities, including the filing
 of emigration applications, approximately 60,000 citizens
 carry a special identification card called PM-12, which in
 many but not all cases restricts domestic as well as foreign
 travel.
 Foreign travel is tightly controlled. Exit visas are required
 for travel to other Communist countries except Czechoslovakia,
 and travel to Poland is restricted.
 In general, travel to non-Communist countries is not allowed
 until citizens reach retirement age (60 for women, 65 for
 men). On a case by case basis, the Government also permits
 its citizens below retirement age to travel to the West,
 chiefly the Federal Republic of Germany, on urgent family
 matters, narrowly defined as births, deaths, marriages, and
 significant birthdays and anniversaries for first-degree
 relatives (spouses, children, siblings).
 Since the beginning of 1986, the Government has experimented
 with easing these travel restrictions. Although the
 regulations have not formally changed, the authorities are
 increasingly making exceptions to their own rules. Over
 200,000 citizens travelled to the Federal Republic in 1986,
 compared with 66,000 for all of 1985. Of these, less than 1
 percent have not returned to the G.D.R.
 The Inner-German Ministry in Bonn reported in mid-December
 that more than 24,000 G.D.R. citizens moved to the Federal
 Republic during the first 11 months of 1986. That figure
 compares favorably with the 21,428 who emigrated in 1985, the
 G.D.R.'s second most liberal year for emigration, but is
 considerably less .than the 35,407 who left the G.D.R. in
 1984. Nonetheless, only a fraction of those wishing to leave
 have been allowed to do so.
 A law effective October 15, 1983 narrowly restricts cases of
 family reunification to first-degree relatives (parents or
 children) and spouses. Though some citizens other than those
 with first-degree relatives have been allowed to leave, the
 narrow definition of eligibility for emigration has created
 difficulties for the large majority of applicants. Many
 successful applicants wait from 1 to 5 years for permission to
 leave, often in the meantime suffering loss of employment and
 even imprisonment.
 Those who left the country illegally before January 1, 1981
 are eligible to apply for permission to visit, but reportedly
 only half of those who have applied have obtained visas.
 Those who fled after 1980 face criminal prosecution if they
 return. Those who emigrate legally must generally wait 5
 years before they are permitted to return again.
 
 
 925
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is completely dominated by the Socialist Unity
 Party. Although four other parties are represented in the
 Government, they are not permitted to challenge Communist
 doctrine or control. All decisions are made by the SED
 leadership; lower-level representatives are expected only to
 approve and to carry out these decisions. The unicameral
 legislature, the Volkskammer (People's Chamber), never rejects
 government proposals. The SED also determines who will fill
 executive positions in the Government and ensures that its
 members fill a majority of the positions.
 All parties and mass organizations (such as trade unions) are
 represented in the National Front, which is controlled by the
 SED. For election purposes, the National Front prepares lists
 of approved candidates according to a formula which ensures
 the SED's complete domination. The list of candidates on a
 ballot exceeds the number of available seats, and a candidate
 high on the list may be rejected if more than 50 percent of
 voters cross his name off the ballot. In such a case, a
 candidate lower on the list may be elected. This is last
 known to have happened in a provincial election over 20 years
 ago.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although the German Democratic Republic is a signatory of the
 Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
 Europe, it has generally taken the position that inquiries
 into its human rights policies constitute interference in its
 internal affairs. Requests by private human rights groups in
 the West for information on human rights conditions go
 unanswered, and the Government does not permit visits by such
 groups. Unofficial human rights groups are formed from time
 to time, but their members face immediate surveillance and
 harassment by the secret police, as well as arrest if their
 activities are deemed threatening to the Government. These
 groups occasionally receive the attention of the West German
 press, but their influence inside the G.D.R. is negligible.
 Total membership in such unofficial human rights groups is
 probably not higher than 100 to 200. The government-sponsored
 Committee for the Protection of Human Rights does not attempt
 to safeguard the human rights of G.D.R. citizens but
 criticizes human rights conditions in other countries while
 claiming there are no problems in the G.D.R.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 An extensive social welfare system provides free medical care
 to the population without discrimination. Men and women are
 treated equally in most respects. The retirement age for
 women is 60, for men 65. As one of the many incentives to
 increase the birth rate, women are given extensive maternity
 leave with pay. Eighty-seven percent of women of working age
 are employed, and a comprehensive child care system exists for
 working parents. Women are given 1 day a month off to do
 household shopping, as are single or divorced fathers with
 custody of children. Women can be found in all professions
 except the military, from which they are exempt except in
 times of war. There are few women in high positions in the
 
 
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 party and Government and in most professions, although they
 are well represented in the medical profession.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The German Democratic Republic has a highly industrialized,
 centrally planned economy. All large industrial, retail, and
 agricultural properties are state owned, but small private
 businesses with fewer than 10 employees are permitted. Over
 90 percent of the farmland are collectivized or state owned,
 and only 2 percent of the labor force are still privately
 employed.
 The average workweek remains 43-1/2 hours, and a 2-day weekend
 is common. Shift work has become increasingly common. An
 average worker earns about $560 per month, with the lowest
 paid workers receiving between $305-405 per month at the
 official exchange rate. Minimum paid holidays total 18
 workdays a year, and certain persons, such as mothers with
 small children, have the right to additional days of paid
 holidays.
 Working conditions, especially in mining and industry, are
 often difficult. The Government has, however, had some
 success in reducing the relatively high rate of accidents in
 the workplace.
 Children may work part-time during vacations and to further
 their education from age 14 onwards, and full-time with
 permission of their parents between ages 14 and 18. Children
 under the age of 18 may not work between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
