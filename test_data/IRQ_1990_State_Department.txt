 IRAQ
 Iraq is a de facto one-party state governed in theory by the
 Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) through a Revolutionary
 Command Council (RCC) which is vested with both executive and
 legislative authority under the provisional Constitution of
 1968. In practice Saddam Hussein holds decisive power as
 President of the Republic, Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary-
 General of the Regional Command of the ABSP. In 1989 the
 Government announced its intention to adopt a multiparty
 system enshrined in a new constitution. However, the draft
 constitution published in July 1990, but not yet adopted,
 would alter the form but not the substance of Iraq's political
 system. In the new "Presidential Republic," the President
 would assume most of the current powers of the RCC, which
 would be abolished. Iraq's population comprises many
 disparate groups, most notably Shi'a and Sunni Muslim Arabs,
 Kurds, Turcomans, and various Christian sects, predominantly
 Assyrian and Chaldean.
 Iraq's armed forces are large, generally well trained and well
 equipped, and include a special component, the Fursan, or
 Kurdish tribal levies, with responsibility for security within
 the Kurdish autonomous region. A security apparatus
 consisting of militias attached to the President, the ABSP,
 and the Interior Ministry has beeh responsible for numerous
 human rights violations. The armed forces have been
 responsible for human rights abuses. Iraq's National Police
 is responsible for civil order.
 The Government exerts a high degree of control over the
 economy, dominated by the petroleum sector, and owns all major
 industries. The Government's program of divestiture and
 privatization in agriculture, tourism, services, and light
 industry stalled early in 1990 with the introduction of
 stricter currency and import controls. Iraq's staggering
 foreign debt (a minimum of $40 billion to non-Arab creditors),
 a product of the country's guns-and-butter policy, was a
 liability to its ambitious economic development plans as
 lender countries increasingly refused to reschedule debt.
 Iraq's abysmal record of repression of. human rights was even
 more flagrant in 1990. Following its invasion and takeover of
 Kuwait in August, Iraq flaunted the Fourth Geneva Convention
 on Civilians and other established norms of civilized behavior
 by arbitrarily detaining hundreds of foreign civilians in both
 'Iraq and Kuwait and dispersing many of them to strategic sites
 as "human shields" against possible military attack.
 Nationals of some other countries were also denied permission
 to leave. There were credible reports of mass extrajudicial
 killings, summary executions, and widespread arrests and
 torture of Kuwaiti citizens by Iraqi'forces.
 Almost every category of human rights dealt with in this
 report is severely restricted or nonexistent in Iraq.
 Freedoms of speech and press and of assembly and association
 are virtually nonexistent, and Iraqis do not have the right to
 change their government. The intelligence services continued
 to conduct extensive surveillance and to use extralegal means,
 including extreme forms of torture and summary execution of
 children as well as adults, to suppress antiregime activity.
 Other important human rights problems included continuing
 disappearances and arbitrary detentions, denial of due
 process, and widespread interference with the right to
 privacy.

 Having brutally crushed most vestiges of Kurdish guerilla
 resistance ih 1988, through the use of chemical warfare and a
 massive forced relocation of some 500,000 Kurds and Assyrians,
 the regime fced*little if any resistance from those groups in
 1990. -However, it donti-nied-to maintain a *no-man's land"
 along its border with Turkey, some villages were razed, and
 there were reports that some villagers were killed.
 President Saddam Hussein announced in April that Iraq would
 retaliate-withCW if Israel'attacked Iraq. He later extended
 that threat to any would-be attacker. Iraq initiated CW use
 during the Iran-Iraq war and used CW against its own Kurdish
 citizens after the Gulf War cease-fire in 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Secti6n 1 Respedt f6r the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 i. Politidal and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Execution has been an established Iraqi method for dealing
 with perceived political and military opponents of the
 Government, including; but not limited to, members of the
 outlawed Da'wa organization (an Iran-supported fundamentalist
 Shi'a Muslim group that has engaged in acts of international
 terrorism). In some cases, a family only learns that one of
 its members has been executed when the security services
 return the body, often showing clear signs of torture, and
 require the family to pay a fine.
 There were credible reports that hundreds of Iraqi Kurds, as
 well as Assyrians, Arabs, and Turcomans, having returned to
 Iraq and surrendered to the'authorities under official
 amnesties or after receiving assurances that they would come
 to no harm, had suffered torture or execution or "disappeared"
 while in custody. In June Amnesty International (AI) reported
 that 30 Turcomans, including 4 who had returned from Turkey
 under an official amnesty, had been executed in late January.
 The Iraqi military killed hundreds of civilians in Kuwait
 after the invasion. The possession of opposition literature,
 the Kuwaiti flag, or photographs of. the Emir of Kuwait were,
 according to numerous credible reports, treated as capital
 offenses.
 AI reported, based on interviews with witnesses who had
 escaped Iraq, that for the past several years the Government
 has imprisoned, tortured, and killed hundreds of children in
 efforts to silence or intimidate their dissident parents.
 While no direct reports of killings of children emerged from
 Iraq in 1990, there is no reason to believe the regime changed
 its policy. On the contrary, Iraqi forces in Kuwait engaged
 in reprisal killings, summarily and randomly executing
 civilians, including children as young as 12. The true nature
 of the regime was starkly outlined by the systematic looting
 of hospitals for equipment and supplies which resulted in
 patients being disconnected from life-support systems and, in
 one particularly ghastly incident, in killing 72 babies by
 dumping them from their incubators (see the report on
 Kuwait)."
 
 
 1459
 IRAQ
 b. Disappearance
 There were credible reports from multiple sources, including
 the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary
 Disappearances, of the "disappearance" of large numbers of
 persons while in the custody of Iraqi authorities. AI
 reported that thousands of people arrested over the years by
 Iraqi security or intelligence forces "disappeared" while in
 detention, with many feared executed. AI reported in June
 that five of six Kurdish refugees who had been returned to
 Iraq on January 2 and 3 and who had been members of the
 opposition Pesh Merga forces, as well as another 40 Kurdish
 refugees forcibly repatriated to Iraq on January 21, are
 currently unaccounted for.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Despite the constitutional prohibition against torture, the
 use by Iraqi authorities, especially the security police, of
 both physical and psychological torture is generally
 acknowledged. Given the rigid chain of command within the
 Government and the security services, torture could not be
 practiced without the knowledge or authorization of senior
 officials. Treatment is reportedly worst immediately
 following arrest and during the period of interrogation and
 investigation, which can last for months. Torture and brutal
 treatment are not limited to political cases. Security-
 related offenses are broadly defined and include such routine
 criminal matters as currency violations.
 In its 1990 Report, covering 1989, AI stated that the routine
 torture and ill-treatment of prisoners continued to be
 reported. It said the victims included children who were
 reportedly beaten, suspended from the ceiling by their wrists,
 and given electric shocks. The authorities forced dissidents
 to watch the torture of their children or other family members
 in order to silence or intimidate them, according to these
 reports.
 Methods of physical torture by Iraqi military and security
 personnel since the invasion of Kuwait included rape, electric
 shock, prolonged beatings on sensitive body parts, and the
 breaking of limbs. Psychological torture methods included
 threats of sexual assault or execution, mistreatment of family
 members, mock executions, and general degradation and
 humiliation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrestr Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and legal code prohibit arbitrary arrest and
 detention but, as with most other legal safeguards in Iraq,
 these provisions have virtually no weight in political or
 national security cases. Security police not only make
 arbitrary arrests but also secretly detain suspects, whose
 fate sometimes becomes known only after they have been
 executed. Security charges have included not only espionage,
 treason, and conspiracy against Iraq, often in collaboration
 with unnamed foreign enemies, but also ordinary criminal
 actions such as currency violations.
 AI and Middle East Watch reported that hundreds of Kuwaiti
 nationals were arrested for suspected opposition to Iraq's
 annpxation of Kuwait. A number of those released reported
 that detainees were routinely tortured during interrogation
 and that some were summarily executed.
 
 
 1460
 
 IRAQ
 Although the Government has stopped expelling Iraqis of
 supposed Iranian descent, most of the few remaining Iranians
 have been imprisoned or live under the fear of deportation or
 incarceration. Spouses of Iraqid of Iranian origin are
 required to obtain a divorce or suffer the same consequences.
 Moreover, othdr Tiaqis, whose grandparents are shown not to be
 of Iraqi origin, are subject to arbitiary detention and
 deportation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public-Trial
 Iraq's-legal system provides for inve'stigation by police and
 then by an inquiry judge who may refer a case to the courts or
 dismiss" it. Judges try criminal cases; there are no juries.
 Convictions may be appealed to the Court of Appeal and then to
 the Court of Cassation, the Supreme Court. There are no
 Shari'a courts per se in Iraq; however, family courts
 administer Shari'a law as modified by Iraqi custom.
 Trials of ordinary cases are held in civil, criminal, and
 religious courts -and are open. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel-tat government expense if the defendant is indigent.
 Charges and evidence are available for review by-the lawyer.
 Appellate courts hear cases not under the jurisdiction of the
 Revolutionary Courts.
 In contrast to ordinary cases, security cases are handled by
 the Revolutionary Courts, which usually hold closed trials.
 Security cases include espionage and treason as well as other
 political offenses (including peaceful dissent), smuggling,
 currency exchange violations, and drug trafficking. The right
 of defense in such courts is severely restricted. The
 "special courts" constituted by the RCC for specific
 incidents, such as-the reported conspiracy against the regime
 in 1979, are also closed. -These special tribunals are exempt
 from constitutional safeguards of defendants' rights;  -
 defendants are held incommunicado, and confessions extracted
 by torture are admissible and often serve as the basis for
 conviction. Appeals may be taken only to the Chairman of the
 RCC. However, the utility of this appeal is questionable,
 since there are reports that executions take place shortly
 after trial, many of them taking place secretly in the prison
 itself.
 The case of British-based Iranian journaiist Farzad Bazoft and
 a British nurse, Daphne Parish, demonstrated clearly the lack
 of fair trial in political or security cases. The two were
 arrested in Baghdad in September 1989 on espionage charges and
 held incommunicado for more than 6 weeks without access to
 either consular representatives or legal counsel. In October
 1989, Bazoft appeared on Iraqi television and "confessed" to
 spying for Israel. He and Parish, who was charged as his
 accomplice, were tried in March 1990. A British Embassy
 officer attended the trial. Bazoft was sentenced to death;
 Parish to 15 years in prison. Despite public and private
 appeals for clemency, Saddam Hussein refused to commute the
 sentences. Bazoft was executed a day after his appeal
 failed. Parish was released later in the year, following
 numerous international appeals.
 Political dissent, as defined by Iraqi authorities,
 encompasses an extremely wide range of activities and, in an
 environment where public acknowledgement of.arrest or
 imprisonment is rare, it is difficult to estimate the number
 of political prisoners. In its 1990 report, AI stated that
 
 
 1461
 
 IRAQ
 "thousands" of political prisoners continue to be detained
 without charge or trial or imprisoned after trials which did
 not satisfy international standards for a fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides protection for the inviolability of
 the home, and strong cultural values reinforce these
 protections in ordinary cases. Police must obtain a search
 warrant before entering the home of a criminal suspect.
 However, there are few if any restraints on the arrest of
 security suspects. Although most arrests occur outside the
 home, there have been credible reports of forced entry and
 arrest by the security police, particularly of suspected
 members of the outlawed Da'wa organization.
 Despite constitutional safeguards for the confidentiality of
 mail and telegraphic and telephone correspondence, the
 monitoring of telephones is a common practice and mail is
 subject to review by censors. The security services and
 Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of informers.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Elements of Iraq's Kurdish population have engaged in armed
 struggle with all governments of Iraq periodically since the
 1920's. The outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in. 1980 sparked a
 new antigovernment insurgency by Kurdish elements, many of
 whom fought with or aided Iran during the war. From 1981 to
 1989, the Government's efforts to crush the rebellion with
 armed force resulted in approximately 8,00a deaths, including
 civilians killed indiscriminately by chemical weapons in 1988.
 Although there was a diminished level of fighting in 1990 and
 the effectiveness of the Kurdish militia was significantly
 undermined by the security zone policy, the cycle of Kurdish
 rebellion and government repression remain unresolved.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.
 Freedoms of speech and press are not respected. The
 Government views political dissent as a threat to its security
 and strictly controls speech and all information media. All
 publications are subject to censorship. The Government and
 the Ba'ath party own and operate the press, radio, and
 television. The media do not criticize the Government, and
 news reporting is strongly biased in favor of the regime.
 There is no presentation of opposition viewpoints.
 Few foreign periodicals reach Iraq, and those that do may be
 censored. Western newspapers are not-sold, and magazines,
 newspapers, cassettes, cameras, and video cassettes carried by
 foreign visitors may be confiscated at the airport. To
 control the dissemination of political leaflets, word
 processors and computers must be registered. Failure to
 register is a criminal offense. Iraqis no longer need to
 register their typewriters or photocopiers, but foreigners in
 Iraq must do so.
 
 
 1462
 IRAQ
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are still severely limited. Public meetings
 may only be organized under the-auspices of the Government or
 the Ba'ath Party.- Association for nonreligious purposes and
 demonstrations without government approval have met with
 severe repression. Professional organizations are subject to
 control by the-Ba'ath Party Central Vocational Bureau.
 c. Freedom.of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society, and the
 Ba'ath Government, while carefully controlling religious
 groups, has enforced-tolerance of religious diversity, seeking
 to submerge religious differences in the promotion of secular
 nationalism. A 1981 law gave the Ministry of Endowments and
 Religious Affairs the authority to promulgate laws and
 regulations governing places of worship, appointment of
 clergy, publication of religious literature, and participation
 in religious councils and meetings. Muslim religious leaders
 operate under close government supervision, are considered
 government employees, and receive their salaries through the
 Government. There are no penalties under Iraqi law for
 changing one's religion, although there is-a social stigma for
 Muslims who convert to another faith.
 The Government has been less intrusive into the religious
 affairs-of Iraq's Christians, who number more than 500,000 and
 constitute'nearly 4 percent of the population. Their freedom
 of worship in churches of established denominations is legally
 protected, but they are not permitted to proselytize or to
 hold meetings outside church premises. Convents and
 monasteries exist, and some new churches have been
 constructed, in some cases with government financial support.
 The Jewish community has decreased from 150000 following
 World War II to under 300. There is no recent evidence of
 overt persecution of Jews, but the regime restricts their
 travel, particularly to Israel and their contacts with
 coreligionists abroad. One synaqogue in Baghdad still
 functions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqis are generally free to travel within the country and to
 change their residences or workplaces. However, they are
 likely to be constrained by social, cultural, and religious
 traditions which define the areas occupied by the various
 ethnic and religious groups. Sensitive border and other
 security areas are off limits. There are police checkpoints
 on highways and outside major towns. Iraqis and nondiplomatic
 foreigners travel freely in nonrestricted areas.
 The Government's harsh campaign to suppress Kurdish rebels,
 involving mass relocations of Kurdish and Assyrian'villagers,
 has nullified the right of hundreds of thousands to choose
 their place of residence. Since traditional Kurdish and
 Assyrian culture has been deeply embedded in the rural
 village, the forced removals of up to 500,000 people and
 razing of villages has had a destructive impact on their
 culture and way of life.
 In January the Government eased travel reqtrictions imposed in
 1982, but reimposed full restrictions after the invasion of
 Kuwait. During those 7 months, Iraqis of all ethnic and
 
 
 1463
 
 IRAQ
 religious backgrounds whose loyalty to the regime was not in
 question were permitted to travel abroad for tourism and
 privately funded education. The regime continued to restrict
 travel of anyone whose political views were suspect.
 Despite the January liberalization of travel regulations,
 certain restrictions remained. The Government retained the
 right to require prospective travelers to post a substantial
 bond to assure their return. The 1987 RCC decree, requiring
 Iraqi students abroad who refused to return to Iraqi to
 reimburse the Goverpment for all education received in Iraq or
 abroad at government expense, remained in effect. The decree
 is applicable retroactively to students who have refused to
 return since May 16, 1983, the date the Government began
 requiring employees leaving government jobs before 20 years of
 service to reimburse the State for the cost of their
 education. Amounts due can be recovered by confiscation;
 nonpayment may result in imprisonment. Each student must
 provide a guarantor before traveling abroad. This guarantor
 and the student's parents may be held liable if the student
 fails to return. A married woman must still have the
 concurrence of her husband to travel abroad.
 There is no specific ban on emigration or special restrictions
 for members of minority groups; however, emigration is
 discouraged. Until January almost all of those given
 permission to emigrate have been Christian Iraqi wives of
 former Iraqi citizens now living abroad as citizens of another
 country. Withthe travel liberalizations, great numbers of
 Iraqis began to emigrate with relatively little difficulty
 untii the August reimposition of travel restrictions. Many
 emigrants leave behind substantial property because of the
 difficulty of'exporting assets. Currency exchange violations
 are considered national security offenses, and penalties can
 be severe.
 Non-Iraqi spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq
 for 5 years are required to take Iraqi nationality or leave
 Iraq. 'Many people, including several Americans, have thus
 been obliged to accept Iraqi citizenship and are therefore
 subject to the present travel restrictions. In March 1984, an
 order by the RCC reduced the residency period before
 naturalization to I year for the spouses of Iraqi citizens
 employed in government offices. The Iraqi spouse faces
 penalties for noncompliance, including loss of job, a fine of
 approximately $10,000, and repayment of the costs of
 education. Iraq does not recognize the concept of dual
 nationality, and many Iraqi "dual nationals," especially the
 children of an. Iraqi father and a mother of non-Iraqi birth,
 have been denied permission to leave- Iraq to visit the country
 of their other nationality.
 Other persons of Iraqi origin have generally been permitted to
 enter and depart freely, within the limits of the present
 travel restrictions, including many admitted to other
 countries as refugees, since they are considered not to have
 violated Iraqi laws. A number of such people, especially
 Assyrian Christians, have returned on temporary visits.
 However, those who emigrated only after the beginning of the
 Iran-Iraq war in 1980, including several U.S. permanent
 resident aliens, have been unable to depart from Iraq after
 returning.
 In March the Government issued an amnesty for Kurds who had
 fled Iraq, particularly after the Iraqi Government used
 
 
 1464
 
 IRAQ
 chemic.l weapons-against Kurdish civilians in 1988, The
 amnesty was extended until.July. Several, thousand Iraqi Kurds
 returned from refuge in Turkey and Iran. Af estimated that
 about 11,000 returned to Iraq frbm Turkey as a result of this
 amnesty. The Kurdish and Assyrian former inhabitants of the
 special "security zone" established by the Government inside
 Iraq's borders with Turkey and Iran in.-1989 remained forcibly
 resettled around the cities of-Sulaymaniya, Arbil, and Zakho.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens'
 to Change Their Government
 Iraqi citizens do not have the ability to change their
 government-peacefully. President Saddam-Hussein and theRCC
 rule Iraq through the Ba'ath Party. It reportedly has some
 1.5 million adherents, representing about 9 percent of the
 population. The National Assembly and the legislative
 assembly of the Kurdish Autonomous-Region are totally
 subordinate to the executive authority.
 There are two other small legal political parties, both
 Kurdish. They and the Ba'ath Party constitute the Patriotic
 and Progressive NationalFront, essentially a vehicle of
 support for the Government. Members of the military or
 security services may engage in political activities only
 within the Ba'ath Party. Association with the Ba ath Party is
 not required for appointment to senior government positions or
 military ranks or election to the National Assembly, but it is
 normally necessary to attain-political influence. Opposition
 groups, including various Kurdish groups and splinter parties,
 are severely repressed. The Communist Party was removed from
 the National Front and declared illegal in 1979. The Da'wa
 organization, a violent Shi'ite group, is also proscribed, and
 its members are subject to incarceration and execution, as are
 members of other parties believed to be cooperating with
 Iran. The Government announced plans in 1988 to permit
 opposition parties. Several months of RCC reviews in mid-1990
 produced a draft envisaging a multiparty system, but
 implementation plans were halted following the invasion of
 Kuwait.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violation
 6f Human Rights
 The one authorized human rights group in Iraq operates largely
 under official control. The Government denies charges that it
 violates hiuman rights, and generally claims that the
 information on-which AI and other human rights groups base
 their charges comes from. pro-Iranian and Kurdish Iraqi exile
 groups in London and Paris. The Government has consistently--
 and successfully--resisted the efforts of t1ie United Nations
 Commission for Human Rights (UNHRC) to send a mission from the
 Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection
 of Minorities to investigate human rights in the country. The
 Government extended invitations through its human rights
 organization to UNHRC Subcommission experts to visit Iraq as
 private citizens whose reports would be unofficial; four
 experts visited.Iraq in April 1990-. The Government hosted a
 Swedish parliamentary delegation studying the Kurdish issue in
 March. That group, which was not allowed to visit prisons or
 interview political prisoners, reported that the Government
 cefused to answer any general questions about abuse of
 'cal prisoners and provided few or no details about
 .ic c~qes raised by the Swedes.
 
 
 1465
 IRAQ
 Iraq cooperates with the International Committee of the Red
 Cross in efforts to resettle Iranian civilian refugees in
 third countries, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 has had a permanent representative in Iraq since April 1988
 who registers Iranian refugees and works for their
 resettlement.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Ba'ath Party is committed to the equality of the sexes and
 has passed laws to protect women from exploitation in the
 workplace; grant subsidized maternity leave; permit women to
 join the regular army, popular army, and police forces; and
 equalize women's rights in divorce, land ownership, taxation,
 suffrage, and election to the National Assembly. In the
 197G's, the Government imposed legal penalties on families
 that opposed sending women to literacy schools and on men who
 were seen harassing women. while the application of these
 laws has resulted in significant tangible improvements for
 women, a number of problems remain. Married women may still
 travel abroad only with the permission of their husbands.
 School enrollment of females has been increasing in recent
 years, reaching 45 percent in elementary schools and 36
 percent in secondary schools An 1985-86.
 Women represent about 47 percent of agricultural workers and
 about 25 percent of the total work force. The Iran-Iraq war
 accelerated the Government's drive to elevate the status of
 women, and it appears to have significantly reduced, if not
 removed, barriers to the acceptance of women in traditional
 male roles. Women are increasingly employed as architects,
 construction engineers, oil engineers, air traffic
 controllers, and factory and farm managers. Their role in the
 armed forces is limited to the medical field.
 Violence against women, such as wife beating and rape, is
 known to occur, but little is known about its extent. Such
 abuse is customarily addressed within the tightly knit Iraqi
 family structure. There is no public discussion of the
 subject, and there are no official statistics. Excessive
 violence against women would be grounds for divorce and
 criminal charges, but suits brought on these charges in Iraq
 are believed to be rare.
 The Shi'a, who make up roughly 55 percent of the population,
 have historically been economically, politically, and socially
 disadvantaged. The Government has a declared policy to raise
 their living standards and equalize opportunities for their
 economic and professional advancement. For four centuries,
 political power in Iraq had been concentrated in the hands of
 the Sunni minority. Sunni Arabs, who comprise 20 to 25
 percent of Iraq's population, dominate the RCC, the Regional
 Commmand of the Ba'ath Party, and the Cabinet. However,
 increasinS numbers of Shi'-as hold prominent positions, and the
 economic status of the impoverished Shi'a masses has improved
 through intensive government investment in the economic and
 educational infrastructure of southern Iraq-.
 Although Christians sometimes allege discrimination in
 education and jobs, adherence to .their religion has not
 prevented many from obtaining wealth and professional
 advancement.
 
 
 1466
 IRAQ
 The use of minority languages in unrestrictied. Kurdish is an
 official -anguage used in'the schools and the media in Kurdish
 areas.- turcomans publish in their dialect of Turkish, and
 Chisltians often uge Aramaic as well as Arabic.
 Citizens considered to be oe Iranian origin carry special
 identification. They are often precluded from desirable
 employment.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions'-independent of government control do not exist in
 Iraq. Under the trade union organization law of June 2, 1987,
 a new single trade union structure was prescribed for
 organized labor. Workers in private and-mixed enterprises and
 in cooperatives--but hot public employees or workers in state
 enterprises-have the right to join a local union committee.
 The committees form trade unions which in turh are part of
 provincial trade union federations. At the top is an umbrella
 organizatipn, the Iraqi General Federation of Trade Unions,
 which is organically linked to the Ba ath Party and required
 to promote party principles and policies among union members.
 The General Federation is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the*Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions. It is also active in the
 tripartite Arab Labor Organization, headquartered in Baghdad.
 Although workers legally have the right to strike, after
 providing notice to the Labor Ministry, strikes rarely occur
 and none was reported in 1990.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to bargain collectively is not recognized. Salaries
 for public sector workers (i.e. the bulk of the employed) are
 set by the Government. Wages in the much smaller private
 sector are set by the employers or negotiated individually
 with workers.'
 Iraq has been criticized by the Committee of Experts (COE) of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) for the fact that
 its new Labor Code of 1987 failed to provide workers with
 protection against antiunion discrimination.' The COE also
 expressed regret that the 1987 Act on trade union
 organizations did not provide for collective bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones in Iraq.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Although compulsory labor is prohibited by law, during and
 shortly after the war with Iran and again after Iraq's
 invasion of Kuwait, the Popular Army, the militia of the
 Ba'ath Party, employed press-gang methods to draft recruits.
 ILO committees have noted that the Penal Code permits the
 punishment of civil servants with imprisonment, including
 compulsory prison labor, for breaches of labor discipline,
 which includes resigning from one's job. Reports in the
 government-directed press indicate that civil servants have
 had to buy their way out of government sprvice.

 IR~AQ
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Although the employment of children under the age of 14 is
 forbidden in all enterprises other than small-scale family
 enterprises, children are frequently encouraged to work as
 necessary to support the family. For children between the
 ages of 14 and 18 who are employed, the law stipulates that
 they work fewer hours per week than adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek in urban areas is 6 days, 7 to 8 hours a day, for
 workers in the private and mixed sectors. These provisions do
 not apply to agricultural workers whose workweek and hours of
 work per day can vary according to individual employer-
 employee agreements. Hours for government employees are set
 by the head of the ministry for which the employee works.
 Occupational safety programs are in effect in state-run
 enterprises, and inspectors make visits irregularly to private
 establishments. Enforcement varies widely. A government
 decree to extend occupational safety and health protection was
 issued and subsequently withdrawn in December 1988, reportedly
 resulting in the dismissal of the Labor Minister.
