 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo is a one-party state
 of Marxist political orientation. Many individual freedoms
 are constrained, but recent trends are encouraging. The
 Congo has allowed a major part of its economy to remain in
 private hands and is actively encouraging foreign private
 investment in an effort to improve economic conditions. The
 Congo has one of the highest literacy rates in the Third
 World and is in the middle range of African countries as
 regards per capita gross national product.
 Since independence in 1960, the country has experienced
 protracted periods of political instability often related
 to regional and ethnic animosities which have negatively
 affected human rights conditions in the past. The present
 government, in its second year, continues extensive
 efforts to achieve national reconciliation, economic
 rebuilding and regional cooperation.
 These efforts have often resulted indirectly in improvement
 in human rights practices. For example, in 1980 a blanket
 presidential clemency was granted. The prohibition on
 importation and sale of thirty foreign magazines was lifted.
 Most of the 80 political prisoners freed in the August 1979
 general amnesty were integrated into government service or,
 as in the celebrated case of former prime minister Pascal
 Lissouba, allowed to pursue academic and research interests.
 The government states that only two political prisoners remain,
 one of whom is former President Joachim Yhomby-Opango.
 On the May 7 visit of Pope John Paul II to the Congo, the
 Vatican and the Congo government reaffirmed the inviolabi-
 lity of religious freedom.
 National, regional and communal assemblies elected on
 single lists in July 1979 met regularly and addressed a
 broad range of grassroots economic issues. The 120-member
 National Assembly expanded political expression and evinced
 concern over economic rights by engaging in vigorous interpel-
 lation of ministers during its two sessions, particularly in
 regard to budgetary matters. Citizens' concerns were taken
 into account by the highest government officials in economic
 policy formulation. For example, rural peasants received
 some relief through price increases for their agricultural
 products and abolition of the heavy tax burden of the
 national solidarity fund.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 7 of the new constitution of July 8, 1979, guaran-
 tees the inviolability of the person and makes the State
 responsible for the respect and protection of the individual.
 There were no allegations of torture in the Congo during
 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 
 
 treatment or punishment in the Congo during 1980. It
 is not uncommon, however, for the public or the police to
 beat thieves when they are caught in the act. Prison
 conditions in general are poor and prisoners often lack
 adequate diet and health care. Penal conditions reflect
 more the depressed state of the economy, however, than -
 government policy. A commission was appointed in April to
 study and recommend reforms in penal legislation and the
 prison system. Results of the study are not yet available.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence of persons being abducted, secretly
 arrested, or held in clandestine detention in the Congo.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Article 7 of the constitution provides that "no one may
 be indicted, arrested or detained except in cases determined
 by laws promulgated prior to the infraction in question."
 In practice, however, a warrant is not required to make
 arrests. There is a habeas corpus provision, but it
 is not always honored. A general amnesty of eighty
 political detainees, most of whom had been imprisoned on
 charges of aiding and abetting or of direct complicity in
 anti-government actions, was declared in August 1979. The
 government states that following the amnesty, there are
 only two political prisoners in the Congo. One of these
 is former President Yhomby-Opango, who, accused of deviation
 from party directives and corruption, has been under house
 arrest since March 1979 in accordance with a resolution of
 the Third Extraordinary Congress of the Congolese Labor
 Party (PCT). Yhomby-Opango has not been tried in the
 courts.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to public trial exists in all cases. This has
 generally been adhered to in recent years, the notable
 exception being the case of Yhomby-Opango. Article 88 of
 the constitution provides for a Supreme Court, appellate
 courts, local people's tribunals, auditing courts, and
 military courts. In cases of necessity and to pass judgment
 in special matters, the same article empowers the National
 Assembly, on recommendation by the council of ministers and
 on the advice of the party central committee, to create
 special tribunals. The Supreme Court, the highest court
 in the country, rules on the constitutionality of laws
 passed (article 106) and controls the jurisdictional activi-
 ties of the lower courts and tribunals. The auditing courts
 oversee the financial transactions of the State, and public
 and para-statal enterprises. In 1980 the Congolese courts
 handed down numerous sentences on charges of diversion,
 fraud and embezzlement of public funds in an effort. to stamp
 out corruption in public life.
 Article 98 guarantees the right of defense. The right
 of counsel is assured in all circumstances including
 cases litigated in the military courts. Trial procedures
 are similar to those in other states with a Napoleonic code
 tradition. A fairly large corps of professional lawyers is
 assisted by judges elected by the communal assemblies.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 
 
 66
 Article 8 of the constitution declares that "the home
 is inviolable." The law requires a warrant to search a
 house, but the law is not always adhered to in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Because petroleum revenues have been climbing since 1977,
 the Congolese economy has been improving slowly in spite
 of stagnation in every other sector. Oil income, which in
 1980 provided 60 percent of government funds, has made
 possible employment and wage policies not otherwise feasible.
 Unemployment has been held to about 15 percent by a policy
 of government employment with much underemployment resulting.
 Wages are kept at a relatively high level, though recently
 the government has grown reluctant to raise salaries in the
 absence of an increase in productivity. This policy has
 contributed to restraining inflation which now runs at about
 14-18 percent. Overall, however, the oil-stimulated economy
 is in a severe state of disequilibrium. Output in manufactur-
 ing, construction, forestry, and above all agriculture, is
 falling. The government is attempting to arrest this
 decline by rationalizing management practices, attracting
 foreign investment, and streamlining the state enterprise
 bureaucracy.
 The Congolese population is highly urbanized. Over 75
 percent of the people live in Brazzaville, Pointe Noire,
 or along the connecting rail line. The population is
 growing at a rate of 2.3 percent annually. Average life
 expectancy is in the middle forties. Infant mortality
 runs at 200 per 1000.
 A large private sector functions but does not flourish.
 Much of the privately held property is owned by expatriates.
 Congolese citizens, while legally permitted to engage in
 most forms of commerce, are impeded by lack of capital, a
 problem generally beyond the control of the government.
 Nonetheless, numerous Congolese entrepreneurs have managed
 to begin small enterprises such as package stores, bars,
 restaurants, and other modest businesses. A few have
 succeeded and have become major employers.
 Congolese citizens, except for high-level government
 officials, are allowed to own and invest in real estate
 projects. This apparent freedom is effectively controlled
 by a set of real estate and income tax laws which have
 stripped housing construction of all profit. A severe
 housing problem in urban areas has resulted.
 Most Congolese workers are members of labor unions whose
 influence is limited by their lack of independence from
 the government. The para-statal enterprises are obliged to
 establish schools and health clinics for employees and
 their families. In some cases, the enterprises must pay
 for workers' vacations, clothing, and lodging. Every
 state enterprise is subsidized, a large portion quite
 heavily, and only a few operate profitability. Many
 private firms have left the Congo complaining of govern-
 ment and union "red tape."
 Pay scales are comparatively high and, until recently,
 have tended to rise despite declining productivity.
 
 
 67
 Well-paid hureaucrats in urban areas form A "middle class,"
 living in part on the European-style private economay This
 situation exists despite A decade-long decline in value add-
 ed in every sector of the economyexcept petroleum. In
 effect, oil revenues have made possible a standard of living
 that the Congolese economy could not otherwise support.
 Income distribution data do not exist. Extremes of wealth do
 not appear to he egregious. Nevertheless, while the commonly-
 used national gross domestic product per capita estimate is
 $540, the figure is probably close to $130 for rural residents.
 The bureaucratic middle class supports much of the lower
 income class through an informal welfare system based on bind-
 ing family ties. Only members of the expatriate community lead
 lives which are visibly far above those of the Congolese in
 material terms.
 The Congolese government is committed to the goal of a standard
 of living adequate for health and well-being. Technocrats
 occupy the ministries directly concerned with health and rural
 economy and enjoy a largely free hand in their efforts to
 redress the system's shortcomings. Moreover, these ministers
 are increasingly being given the financial resources they
 require to achieve their objectives. The ministry of rural
 economy for example, disposes of the largest share of the
 country's investment budget in line with the government's
 commitment to agricultural and rural development as its top
 priority. The government's efforts, however, to raise the
 standard of living are crippled by a legacy of underdeveloped
 infrastructure 'and excessive urbanization. Also, the country's
 socialist orientation has caused economic losses by eschewing
 production incentives and rewarding low productivity. Realizing
 this, the government recently moved to rationalize the manage-
 ment of state enterprises, attract private investment capital,
 and introduce an incentive system in agriculture.
 The Congo has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa,
 variously estimated at between 70 and 90 percent. This
 results in part from the Congo's former position as the
 administrative capital of French Equatorial Africa and from
 current government policy.  The government devotes 28 percent
 of the operating budget to the ministry of national education,
 by far the largest portion accorded any government agency.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 16 of the constitution provides for "freedom of
 expression, press, association, processions and demonstra-
 tions under conditions prescribed by the law." As a matter
 of official policy, these individual liberties are
 restricted in conformity with the government's perceived
 interests of state security and its Marxist-Leninist
 orientation. For example, political indoctrination is
 provided in schools, party and mass organizations,
 government media, and through village hierarchies. The
 state exercises regular censorship of the newspapers and
 movies. The government owns and controls the media,
 except for one newspaper. On March 26, 1980, a decree
 lifted the import ban imposed by the previous government
 
 
 68
 on some thirty foreign magazines and publications.
 Foreign journalists are permitted to visit the Congo
 freely. Several hundred western media representatives
 visited the Congo in 1980 in connection with the Pope's
 visit in May and Brazzaville centennial festivities in
 October.
 The constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 irrespective of religious or ethnic origins. Article 11
 states that "all Congoles& citizens are equal under the
 law" and that "any act which accords privileges to nationals
 or limits the rights by reason of difference of ethnicity,
 of origin or of religion is contrary to the constitution
 and punishable by penalties foreseen in the law." There
 have been no reports of ethnic-or religious discrimination.
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law and generally
 honored in practice. Article 18 of the constitution
 stipulates: "The People's Republic of the Congo guarantees
 freedom of conscience and of religion in the framework
 foreseen by the law. It is forbidden to use religion for
 political ends." Catholic and Protestant churches, the
 latter including the Salvation Army and the Kimbanguist
 Church, are active throughout the Congo. Although less
 widespread, Islamic mosques are also active. Several
 minor religious cults, such as the Croix Koma and Tenrikyo,
 a Japanese cult, are also thriving. The government,
 usually the interior ministry, sends a representative to
 major church conferences and other significant religious
 gatherings.
 Pope John Paul II and President Sassou-Nguesso jointly
 reaffirmed the principles of freedom of religion and
 church/state separation during the Pope's historic May 7
 visit to the Congo.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Although the constitution does not specifically address
 the question, the Congolese government does not restrict
 internal movement. Congolese citizens who wish to
 travel abroad require exit visas from the office of state
 security. In the past the right of return by citizens
 charged with anti-government activity has been withdrawn,
 especially in periods of political turbulence. In his
 amnesty speech in August 1979, however, the president
 reaffirmed the right of return to the Congo for all exiled
 citizens who were prepared to participate in the Congo's
 development.
 Article 14 of the constitution accords asylum rights to
 persons persecuted because of "democracy, national
 liberation, freedom, scientific and cultural work or
 defense of the rights of the working class."
 c. Freedom to Partipate in the Political Procbss
 Political power is centralized in the sole political party,
 the Marxist-Leninist Congolese Labor Party (PCT), which
 determines the opportunities for participation in the
 political process. PCT membership, which presently
 numbers about 7000, is highly controlled on the basis of
 
 
 69
 loyalty and performance. The PCT party Congress, which
 elects the sixty-member central committee and the President,
 is the highest party organ. It meets every five years.
 Although never referred to in the constitution, the
 politbureau, elected by and from the central committee, is
 an important decision-making body whose decisions (article
 24 of the PCT statutes) "are imposed on all party and
 state and all mass organizations." The party president,
 elected for five years, is also president of the republic,
 chief of state, and president of the council of ministers.
 The council of ministers is the highest executive organ of
 the state and consists of the president, the prime minister,
 and the other ministers.
 Opportunities for political participation other than
 activity in the PCT include the national, regional and
 local assemblies and the mass and elite organizations.
 The assemblies were elected July 8, 1979, in single-list
 elections. The National Assembly meets twice yearly with
 each session limited to a maximum of two months. Mass
 organizations, which are party appendages, include, for
 example, the Revolutionary Union of Women of the Congo
 (URFC) to which all women automatically belong. The Union
 of Socialist Youth of the Congo (UJSC) is an example of an
 elite organization whose membership requirements generally
 are as strict as those of the PCT parent party.
 Article 17 of the constitution stipulates that "woman has
 the same rightv as man in the private, political and
 social domains" and that "for equal work, a woman is also
 entitled to the same social welfare rights."
 Although no women are ministers at present, women occupy
 senior government and party positions such as counsellor
 to the president. Only one of the 60 members of the
 party's central committee is a woman. The 120-member
 National Assembly includes 12 women, one of whom is
 assembly vice president. A woman is appellate court
 counselor and another is president of the highest tribunal
 at Pointe Noire, the Congo's second largest city.
 The URFC has launched a campaign to make itself independent
 of government subsidies through dues and commercial
 endeavours. In 1980 the URFC launched three initiatives
 designed to improve the lot of Congolese women: a)
 raising the level of women's education; b) increasing
 women's economic activites; and c) combatting illiteracy
 among women. There are as yet few results to be seen from
 these new emphases.
 Economic, educational and social pressures from unremitting
 urbanization and modernization have contributed to a marked
 tendency toward monogamy. In secondary schools, increasing
 numbers of young women are enrolled in agricultural, mechanical
 and technical courses, and university attendance among women
 is on the rise. Young women writers and poets are beginning
 to figure importantly in the Congo's rich and flourishing
 literary tradition. A number of television and radio
 newscasters are women, and prime time media programs are
 devoted to, and run by, women and concern their interests
 and careers. Several of the Congo's dozen and a half
 embassies abroad are headed by women ambassadors.

 The Congolese Confederation of Trade Unionists (CSC)
 represents workers but, as an appendage of the state, is
 restricted in its right to strike, bargain collectively and
 lobby.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Congolese government has demonstrated its willingness
 to listen and respond to human rights inquiries on a
 case-by-case basis. Several political detainees of
 Amnesty International cited in its 1978 report on the
 Congo, including the celebrated case of Dr. Pascal Lissouba,
 were among those granted amnesty in 1979. Amnesty Interna-
 tional in its 1980 report expresses concern that former
 President Yhombi-Opango has been detained since March 1979
 without trial and expresses hope his trial would be fair,
 open, and held before an independent tribunal. In 1980,
 the International Committee of the Red Cross was permitted
 to inspect local prison conditions.
