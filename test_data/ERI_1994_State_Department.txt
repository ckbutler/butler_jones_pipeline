 ERITREA
 Eritrea became an independent single-party State in May 1993, following a U.N.-
 supervised election in which Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence from
 Ethiopia. President Isaias Afwerki and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
 (EPLF), renamed in February the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ),
 remained the dominating political and military force. The Government has been in
 de facto control of the country since 1991, when EPLF forces decisively defeated the
 Ethiopian army of then dictator Colonel Mengistu. At the 1994 Third Party Con-
 gress, the President and the EPLFIPFDJ outlined an ambitious program for estab-
 lishing a democratic form of government by 1996. In April the party-controlled Na-
 tional Assembly created a 50-member National Constitution Commission to draft a
 constitution.
 The ELPF armed forces, which in 1992 comprised over 100,000 regulars, contin-
 ued to serve as the main internal security force in 1994. There are intelligence com-
 ponents within the Ministries of Defense and Internal Affairs. The Government
 began in late 1993 to demobilize this force and by the end of 1994 had released over
 40,000 persons, some of whom formed the cadre for a new police force. At the same
 time, the Government began to face a new security threat by the fundamentalist
 Eritrean Islamic Jihad rebels who attacked Eritrea from base camps in Sudan in
 December 1993. President Isaias announced that his soldiers had killed 20 Jihad
 fighters in the December encounter, and there were several deaths on both sides as
 a result of additional Jihad forays. Sporadic terrorist attacks by fundamentalist
 1goups continue, but there has been no notable increase in the number of incidents.
 There were no known human rights abuses committed by the military forces.
 Approximately 95 percent of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture.
 The economy was decimated by years of war, but excellent rains have produced an
 abundant harvest of four grains. The commercial (wage) sector is small and largely
 centered in Asmara, the capital, and the Red Sea ports of Massawa and Assab. The
 Government continued to provide liberal access to the ports for the now landlocked
 Ethiopia. Port fees are an important source of revenue for the Government.
 The Government continued to have strong popular support, and it generally re-
 spected human rights. As in the past 3 years, the Government promised eventually
 to institute a democratic, multi party political system. However, it is carefully con-
 trolling the political process andallows little opportunity for dissenting voices to be
 heard in the controlled media. Although the Eritrean Liberation Front-Revolution-
 ary Council (ELF-RC) complained that the Government had excluded it from the
 constitutional review process, individual members of the ELF-RC and other opposi-
 tion groups actively participated in the work of the Constitutional Commission. The
 Covernment's continuing refusal to recognize the sole human rights organization,
 the Regional Center for Human Rights and Development, does not bode well for the
 Government's willingness to tolerate the expression of independent views (see Sec-
 tion 4). The Government continued to detain without charge or trial at least 50 per-
 sons for association with radical Islamic political elements or suspected terrorist or-
 ganizations. There were reliable reports that local police regularly picked up private
 citizens and sometimes held them for long periods without charging them. The
 President pardoned 130 (of the remaining 137) persons detained without charge
 since 1991 for alleged human rights violations during the Mengistu period.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. There was, however, an incident in which two persons died
 when ex-fighters took hostages and hijacked vehicles in a protest over demobiliza-
 tion benefits. During attempts to quell the protest, security forces killed two of the
 protesters. Under the circumstances, the
 use of force was not excessive.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances. There was no fur-
 ther information on the whereabouts of several officials of the ELF-RC who alleg-
 edly had been abducted in Ethiopia or Sudan and secretly detained in Edritrea since
 1992. A government official denied that they were in Eritrea.
 
 
 75
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of torture by security forces. There was, however, one case
 in which an Eritrean-American woman alleged that police beat her while in deten-
 tion. The woman was released and never filed a formal complaint. This is the first
 known incident of alleged abuse by security forces.
 Prison conditions are generally Spartan but not inhuman. Adeqaate food, bedding
 material, and sanitation facilities are available, and family members are allowed to
 provide food, clothing, and medicine to prisoners. There have been no instances of
 death due to prison conditions. In traditional prison facilities, the Government does
 not permit prisoners to correspond with family or friends and limits family visits
 to one a month, and then for only 10 minutes. It also does not permit independent
 monitoring groups such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to visit
 prisons although the Government did allow a U.S. diplomatic official to visit one of
 the prisons and conduct interviews with both male and female inmates. There is no
 evidence that political and security prisoners are treated differently from the gen-
 era prison population. Rape does not ap ar to a problem in prisons.
 Although the Government has refused to describe it as a prsn, security forces
 used the "Disabled Center" in Asmara to detein people in conditions bordering on
 cruel and inhuman. The Center is ostensibly a temporary holding facility for street
 _beggars and a permanent shelter for the homeless and the mentally ill. However,
 those arrested by urban police for other reasons are routinely held at the Center
 for long periods in overcrowded holding rooms. Detainees are left in semi-isolation
 and are not allowed to exercise or receive visitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Code provides that detain-
 ees may be held for a maximum period of 30 days without being charged with a
 crime. In practice the authorities frequently hold suspected persons for much longer
 periods without charge, in part due to a seriously overloaded judicial system  Polce
 in Asmara have arrested and arbitrarily detained ordinary citizens at the Disabled
 Center for up to 14 months without formal charges or a trial. The percentage of the
 total prison population consisting of pretrial detainees was unknown.
 Since _coming to power in 1991, the Government has detained two special cat-
 eaories of people: those suspected of hu man rights violations under the Mengistu re-
 gime; and persons allegedly associated with certain political or terrorist organiza-
 tions.
 In the first category, the Government pardoned 130 of the remaining 137 such
 persons on the occasion of the first anniversary of indepeence. There were no new
 arrests of persons suspected of human rights violations under Menglstu. The Gov-
 ernlent continued to hold on security grounds a number of detainees, but the exact
 number of th    Arreee Detis at year's endwas uown.
 It was also unknown if the Government continued to detain, without charge, three
 Eritreans, who had returned in 1993 from Saudi Arabia, to propagate political
 Islam.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Until a constitution is ado pted, the current civil
 law system, borrowed from Ethiopia, is derived from the Napoleonic Code. Most
 crimes are brought to the lower court which is presided over by a single judge. Seri-
 ous crimes are tried publicly by a panel of three judges, and defendants have access
 to legal ounsel at their own expense. There are no attorneys available at public ex-
 pense, although the Government has asked attorneys to work pro bno to represent
 defendants _accused of serious crimes who cannot afford attorneys. Defendants may
 appeal verdicts to the Appellate Court, which is composed of five judges and pre-
 sided over by the President of the High Court.
 Crimes committed by members of the military are handled by mnlitary courts. Al-
 though the Government did  set         special court would be established in
 Asmara o try all remaining political and security detainees by early 1995, it took
 no implementing stops to establish this special court by year's end.
 The judiciary is independent, and there were no known incidents of executive in-
 terfearence in the judicialprocess. However, the underdeveloped judicial system suf-
 fers from a severe lack of trained personnel, legal resources, and infrastructure. Of
 the 20 practicing judges assigned to the High Court, only 3 have law degrees. In
 the summer, 80 new trainees received a 2-month crash course in law before being
 assigned to rural areas to begin judicial duties. The Justice Ministry assigned others
 for internship with practicing magistrates.
 Since the population is largely rural, most citizens' only contact with the legal sys-
 tem is through traditional "ourts." The village judges, appointed by  a panel of gov-
 ernment magistrates, provdejustice in civil matters. Criminal cases are transferred
 to magistrates versed inn crimnal law. Many local issues, e.g., property disputes, and
 most petty crimes are adjudicated by local elders according to custom or, in the case
 of Muslims, the Korn. These traditional courts cannot give
 
 
 76
 sentences involving physical punishment. The Government held no known politi-
 cal prisoners at the end of the year (see Section 1.d.). No trials for political or secu-
 rity detainees have been conducted in the regular courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Criminal Code, warrants are required to monitor mail, telephones or other
 means of communication. Warrants are required in routine searches and seizures,
 except in cases where authorities believe individuals may attempt to escape or de-
 stroy evidence. In the past this restriction has often not been observed, but there
 were no reports of illegal surveillance or searches in 1994.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although Eritreans continue to express their
 opinions openly on various issues, there is some self-censorship, especially with re-
 gard to the President and the Government. The Government has not enacted any
 laws regarding press freedom, but in March the National Assembly extensively de-
 bated the role of the press and formed a committee to reformulate a draft press law.
 The Government controls the tiny media, which includes the biweekly govern-
 ment-financed newspaper Hadas Eritrea and one radio and television station. Hadas
 Eritrea carefully avoids criticism of the President or other government figures. Eri-
 trea Profile, a weekly English-language newspaper, owned by the Ministry of Infor-
 mation and Culture, appeared in 1994. The print media criticized the Government
 on numerous occasions but carefully avoided criticism of the President. There is no
 formal government censorship body. According to international human rights mon-
 itors, government reluctance to grant the Regional Center for Human Rights official
 registration as a nongovernmental organization has hampered the Regional Center's
 efforts to publish a private newspaper.
 There is full academic freedom at the University of Asmara.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-At year's end, the new Na-
 tional Constitutional Commission had begun consideration, among many topics, of
 freedoms of assembly and association. At present, a permit is required from the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs for a public meeting or demonstration. In general, the
 authorities grant these permits for nonpolitical meetings or gatherings.
 There is no legal provision for forming political parties, nor have any attempts
 been made to do so. In particular, there is no evidence of activities in Eritrea by
 such opposition groups as the ELF-RC. The Government asserts that the permanent
 constitution will provide for a multiparty system.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-All denominations and faiths practice freely without gov-
 ernment restriction. This includes the Jehovah's Witnesses, whom previous regimes
 had prohibited from worshiping publicly. In October, however, a Presidential decree
 barred Jehovah's Witnesses from government employment and from possession of
 business licenses or identification papers-thereby restricting their ability to travel
 and to engage in other activities. This step was apparently taken in retaliation for
 their refusal to participate in the 1993 referendum and in the National Youth Serv-
 ice Program.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general, all persons may live and travel freely abroad and within
 Eritrea, except or some areas restricted for security reasons. In particular, clashes
 between government forces and the Eritrean Islamic Jihad have left a tense security
 situation along the border with Sudan. The Government does not arbitrarily restrict
 the right of citizens who have left the country to return.
 Eritrea plays host to a small number of refugees, mainly Somalis residing in
 Asmara and Assab. A pilot refugee program has begun, and25,000 Eritreans are
 expected to return from the Sudan within the next several months. Planning for a
 further 135,000 returnees in 1995 is actively under way among the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees and the Governments of Eritrea and Sudan.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have this right although the Government has promised to intro-
 duce multiparty democracy by 1996. At present, the President and the EPLF/PFDJ
 completely dominate the political scene, including the National Assembly. The Gov-
 ernment is especially sensitive to maintaining a alance in the Cabinet and top po-
 sitions between Christians and Muslims, and ethnic groups (nine were represented
 in 1994).
 The Third EPLF Party Congress's decision to change names was intended to sig-
 nify its transition from an insurgent group fighting for independence to a political
 movement directed at the economic, social, and political development of the nation.
 To date, opposition groups--which often manifest themselves by sporadic terrorist
 
 
 77
 attacks in rural areas-have received little support. Eritrean Muslims in particular
 have opposed such violent opposition activities.
 In April the National Assembly created a 50-member National Constitution Com-
 mission to draft a democratic constitution. The Assembly selected some 42 members,
 including 20 women, from a representative cross-section of Eritrean society. The
 President appointed the remaining eight. Although the ELF-RC complained that the
 Government had excluded it from the process, individual members of the ELF-RC
 and other opposition groups actively participated in the work of the Commission.
 The Commission formed four committees, including a governmental institutions and
 human rights committee. It opened branch offices in the provinces and began a se-
 ries of hearings to promote public participation in the constitution-making process.
 The Commission is expected to prepare a draft document within the year and to
 complete the process within 2 years.
 The Government in 1993 began to develop interim political institutions by holding
 local elections involving multiple candidates, but no parties, in all 10 provinces for
 local legislatures. In turn, the provincial legislatures sent 3 members, 1 of whom
 had to be a woman, to the 150-member National Assembly. In addition to the female
 members of the regional delegations, 10 additional places for women are reserved
 in the National Assembly, thus assuring 20 seats for women.
 In addition to the positions in the new legislative bodies, women hold senior posi-
 tions in the Government, including the Ministers of Justice and Tourism. To further
 include women in the political process, the Third Party Congress named 3 women
 to the party's Executive Council, and 12 women to the Central Council. Women now
 occupy more than half the seats on the National Constitution CommisSion.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has not been receptive to the formation of domestic human
 rights groups. Since 1991 it has repeatedly delayed recognition of the Regional Cen-
 ter for Human Rights and Development, a human rights organization based in
 Asmara. As a result, the Regional Center has not become an effective organization
 for publicizing human rights abuses, and there are no other local human rights or-
 ganizations in Eritrea. However, the Government has given the leaders of the Re-
 gional Center a role in the work of the National Constitution Commission.
 The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Internal Affairs are responsible for all
 human rights inquiries but are frequently slow to respond to international inquiries
 concerning alleged human rights abuses. In individual cases, the Government has
 been helpful. For example, a senior Foreign Ministry official discussed a case involv-
 ing missing Eritreans with a concerned human rights group in New York.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Government has taken a consistently strong stand in favor of im-
 proving the status of women, many of whom played a significant role as fighters
 in the struggle for independence. In 1991 the then provisional EPLF government
 codified a broad range of rights for women, including guarantees of equal edu-
 cational opportunity, equal pay for equal work, and legal sanctions against domestic
 violence. The Third Party Congress advocated additional rights and programs for
 women, including the right of women to equal rights to use of land and to other
 proerty. A government proclamation confirmed that women have equal right3 of
 lan use, regardless of marital status; the proclamation specified that, while all land
 belongs to the State, it would grant leaseholds to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis.
 Nevertheless, despite the Government's attitude and some legal changes, the larg-
 er Eritrean society remains traditional and patriarchal, and women generally play
 a subservient role in the family and in the community. In practice, males remain
 privileged in terms of education, employment, and control of economic resources, in-
 cluding land. This disparity is even more visible in predominantly rural Muslim
 areas.
 The Government has taken a firm position against domestic violence. Neither
 health, police, nor judicial sources consider the problem to be extensive.
 Children.-The Department of Social Affairs is the agency responsible for govern-
 ment policies concerning the rights and welfare of children. However, the Depart-
 ment has few funds, and the Government does not generally look on child wefare
 as a serious social problem.
 Female genital mutilation, which is practiced widely on girls at an early age
 throughout Eritrea, is considered by international experts to be dangerous to both
 
 
 physical and psychological health. The Government, through the Ministry of Health
 and the National Union of Eritrean Women, actively discourages the practice.
 People With Disabilities.-As a result of the 30-year civil war, there are thousands
 of disabled male and female former fighters for whom the Government expends
 large amounts of money. Most physically disadvantaged Eritreans are viewed as he-
 roes; there is no discrimination in employment, education, or other state services
 against people with disabilities. However, there are no laws that mandate access for
 the disabled to public thoroughfares or public and private buildings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There are no government restrictions regarding the
 formation of unions in any segment of Eritrean labor activities, including the mili-
 tary, the police, and other essential workers; and labor association is encouraged by
 the Government. Under Proclamation Number 8 of the Transitional Labor Laws,
 workers now have the legal right to form unions and to strike and protect their in-
 terests.
 The National Confederation of Eritrean Workers (NCEW), which was part of the
 EPLF during the civil war, underwent reorganization and became formally inde-
 pendent of the Government and the EPLF/PFDJ in September. THe NCEW rep-
 resents over 20,000 workers from 129 unions, and it began forming these unions
 into 5 worker federations during 1994. The largest union is the Textile Leather,
 and Shoe Federation. There were no strikes in 1994. Proclamation Number 8 pro-
 hibits retribution against strikers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Both Proclamation number
 8 and the 1993 draft labor code provide for free collective bargaining. There were
 41 collective agreements in 1994.
 Eritrea is a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and worked
 closely with the ILO in preparing the 1993 draft, which, inter alia, prohibits
 antiunion discrimination by employers against union members and establishes a
 mechanism for resolving complaints of discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no law prohibiting forced
 or compulsory labor. A government summer work program for 15,000 teenagers be-
 came controversial as it mandated the participation of all high school students. Par-
 ticipants received $20 (120 birr) per month to work on community service projects
 such as road repair, farm work, and the planting of trees. In addition, all successful
 work program participants received a certificate that was later required for fall-term
 school registration.
 d. Minimun Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18 years, althoug apprentices may be hired at age 14. While the Com-
 mission on Social Welfare is responsible for enforcement, there is no random or sys-
 tematic inspection of factories and shops for compliance. Despite the high rate of
 adult unemployment in Eritrea, the number of children under 18 years of age work-
 ing in commercial enterprises continued to grow. Rural children often help on family
 farms. Urban children often sell small wares, such as cigarettes, on the street.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated minimum wage.
 Wages vary from a minimum of $25 up to $200 per month (birr 150 up to birr
 1,200), with factory workers earning the highest amount. Former fighters are enti-
 tled to a monthly wage of at least $75 (birr 450).
 The workweek is now 48 hours, but many people work less. While there is no
 legal provision, all employees receive at least 1 day off per week, and most receive
 11Y days. There are no mandated occupational health and safety laws or standards
 currently in force although some larger companies enforce their own health and
 safety standards. The draft law includes a number of provisions concerning women,
 including one that states that women, during pregnancy, will not be assigned to jobs
 that could endanger their lives or the lives of their unborn children.
