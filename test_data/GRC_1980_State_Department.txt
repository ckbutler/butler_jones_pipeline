 GREECE
 Since the collapse of the military junta and the restoration
 of democracy in 1974, Greece has given strong proof of its
 commitment to human rights, and its record in this area has
 been excellent. The full range of universally acknowledged
 human rights is protected by the 1975 constitution, which
 reflects the spirit and includes many of the provisions
 contained in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights.
 Parliamentary elections most recently were held in November
 1977 and were vigorously and freely contested. The judiciary
 is independent of both the executive branch of government and
 parliament and operates within a civil law framework with
 precedents from Roman law and French and German sources. An
 active and unfettered press functions throughout the country.
 Economic and social rights in Greece are guaranteed by the
 constitution and are fully observed by the government. Thus,
 through a combination of constitutional guarantees and admin-
 istrative practices, the Greek government is committed to the
 scrupulous observance of human rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the constitution in
 Article 7 which states that torture, and bodily maltreatment,
 impairment of health or the use of psychological violence, as
 well as any other offense against human dignity, are prohi-
 bited and punished as provided by law, and respected in
 practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is also guaranteed by Article 7 of the constitution, and
 has been respected in practice during the past year. Summary
 executions do not take place and physical punishments are not
 administered as sentences for crimes. Conditions in prison
 and detention facilities are not a form of intentionally
 degrading treatment. Adequate health care and diet are
 provided. There is no distinction in treatment among
 prisoners of different social class, race, sex, religion, or
 type of conviction. Cas~s requiring medical treatment
 receive special attention. Once sentenced, prisoners may be
 visited by family members three times per week.
 c. Disappearances
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested or held in clan-
 destine detention by the police who are the only law enforce-
 ment body in Greece.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by the constitution in Article 6, which states "no person
 shall be arrested or imprisoned without a reasoned judicial
 * warrant which must be served at the moment of arrest or
 detention pending trial, except when caught committing a
 criminal act." This provision is respected in practice.
 Preventive detention does not exist in Greece. A person
 arrested on warrant or while committing a crime must be
 brought before an examining magistrate within 24 hours, at
 
 
 801
 which time he is charged. This magistrate must issue a
 warrant of imprisonment or order the release of the
 detainee within three days of the examination, unless
 special circumstances warrant a two-day extension of this
 time limit. Article 6 further states that the maximum
 duration of detention pending trial "may not exceed a period
 of one year in the case of felonies or. six months in the
 case of misdemeanors." A decision of a judicial council is
 required to effect extensions of these maximum durations (by
 six or three months, respectively) in exceptional cases. In
 practice, despite crowded court calendars, trials generally
 take place within four months of the submission of charges.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and the
 military. Fair and public trials are guaranteed by the
 constitution and respected in practice, and defense lawyers
 are always available. Mandatory public court sessions are
 provided for, except for a few special exceptions involving
 juveniles or those charged with morals offenses when the
 privacy of the victim requires protection. There is also a
 legal provision for the possible in cmea treatment of a
 sensitive portion of cases dealing with public order. In
 such instances, none of which are known to have occurred
 during the past year, the court by law must publicly pro-
 nounce its "reasoned decision" on the matters heard
 privately. A defendant may appeal a court verdict to an
 appeals court. Article 96 stipulates that military courts
 shall have no jurisdiction over civilians.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home as well as of an individual's
 personal and family life are guaranteed by Article 9 of the
 constitution, which states "every person's home is a
 sanctuary." The personal and family life of the individual
 is inviolable. No house search shall be made except when and
 as specified by law and always in the presence of representa-
 tives of the judicial power. These constitutional guarantees
 are respected in practice. Warrants, issued by a district
 attorney, who is considered a judicial officer in Greece, are
 required for an official to enter a private home. No cases
 are kno,4n in which forced entry has been alleged or in which
 the government has practiced other violations of the home.
 The same article contains a provision requiring punishment
 and "liability to full damages to the sufferer' for violators
 of the sanctuary of the home and" for the abuse of power.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 From 1975-78 the government's expansionary fiscal, monetary
 and incomes policies, assisted by a relatively favorable
 international climate, led to unprecedented prosperity in
 Greece. During this period, real annual gross national
 product (GNP) growth averaged five percent. The 1975-78
 prosperity and growth was characterized on the one hand by
 increasing disposable incomes, high imports of cars and
 luxury goods and booming residential construction but, on
 the other hand, by lagging manufacturing investment and
 productivity and marked inflationary pressures. In the
 middle of 1978, persistent double-digit inflation prompted
 the government to begin moving gradually to less expansionary
 policies. In spite of the remedial measures, the consumer
 price index (CPI) more than doubled to 25 percent in 1979 and
 a similar increase is expected for 1980. in response, the
 
 
 802
 government has announced the continuation of its recently
 imposed stringent policies (at least until the beginning
 of 1981).
 The Greek constitution states that "work is a right and shall
 be placed under the protection of the state...all workers
 irrespective of sex or other distinction are entitled to
 equal renumeration for rendering services of equal value."
 While in theory the preceding passage dictates the status of
 women in the Greek economy, in practice the working woman's
 status in Greece is somewhat circumscribed by the cultural
 mores of this male-oriented society. Working women have
 made significant strides in the past decade regarding equal
 pay and entry into professions which were previously male
 strongholds.
 A large percentage of Greeks own their homes or a small shop
 or business; this right is protected by law.
 Urban wages in real terms in the past decade have risen 70
 percent while farm income also has risen substantially. The
 official unemployment rate in non-agricultural areas is esti-
 mated at around three percent. Deceleration in the growth
 of GNP has not yet created any significant unemployment
 problem because of a previously tight labor market and the
 large number of self-employed outside agriculture. Some under-
 employment exists in the rural, predominately agricultural,
 areas. A return to healthy growth rates in employment will
 be necessary, however, if jobs are to be provided for those
 entering the .labor market, including migrant Greek workers
 returning from abroad, and unemployed youth. In September,
 1980, the government announced tax cuts designed primarily
 to help low and medium-wage earners who have been hardest
 hit by inflation. The tax cut is intended to fill the gap
 between wage increases and the inflation rate for those in
 the lowest income categories. The average annual increase
 in worker income between 1974 and 1979 was 23.6 percent.
 Over the same period, consumer prices increased at an
 average annual rate of 14.1 percent.
 Free public health care is available throughout Greece. The
 ratio of doctors per 1,000 inhabitants is 2.1 and infant
 mortality rate (deaths in the first year per 1,000 live
 births) is 20.3. In crowded Athens, there are no shanty
 towns. Nationwide, virtually all dwellings have electricity
 and running water. An increasing, but still low, crime
 rate is a hallmark of Athens and Greece.
 Primary, secondary, and university education is free and
 nine years of education are compulsory. The government
 continues to work to make higher education, which is availa-
 ble to all citizens meeting academic entrance requirements,
 more accessible through the expansion of facilities.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech is guaranteed by Article 14 of the consti-
 tution which states that every person may express and propa-
 gate his thoughts orally, in writing, and through the press
 with due regard to the laws of the state.
 Freedom of the press is guaranteed by the same Article of
 the constitution, which states "the press is free. Censor-
 ship and all other preventive measures are prohibited."
 Opposition viewpoints are constantly ventilated in the active
 
 
 803
 Greek press and criticism of the government is tolerated.
 The constitution allows for the seizure, by order of the
 public prosecutor, of publications which insult the
 president, offend religious beliefs, contain obscene
 articles, advocate a violent overthrow of the political
 system, or disclose military and defense information. No
 books, periodicals, or newspapers were seized in 1980.
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by Article 11 of the con-
 stitution, which states "Greeks shall have the right to
 assemble peaceably and unarmed." Limits on outdoor public
 meetings do exist, however, if it is determined by police
 authorities that a serious disturbance of social and
 economic life is threatened. In 1980, no public assemblies
 were prohibited. Police -on occasion restrict areas where
 demonstrators-can gather if such gatherings pose a clear
 and present danger to public safety and order.
 The prevailing religion in Greece is Eastern Orthodox.
 There are several small minorities including Muslims, Jews
 and non-Orthodox Christians. Article 13 of the constitution
 guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits discriminatory
 practices against religious minorities. This provision is
 respected in practice.
 Minority groups have participated in the increasing prosperi-
 ty of Greece and enjoy full political rights. The Greek
 -government is committed to observe the provisions of the
 Treaty of Lausanne relating to the education and political
 rights of the Muslim minority. Currently there are two
 Muslim members of parliament. Occasional complaints by
 members of minority groups are made about alleged bureaucratic
 dels on such matters as driving licenses and land transfers,
 although these difficulties do not appear to reflect an
 official policy of discrimination.
 Another area of concern relates to Greece's small community
 of Jehovah's Witnesses and the provision in Article 13 which
 states that "no person shall be exempt from discharging his
 obligations to the state or may refuse to comply with laws
 by reason of his religious convictions." In deference to
 the Jehovah's Witnesses, in 1977, the government modified the
 compulsory military service law to provide for alternative,
 noncombat service. While courts of first instance have, on
 occasion, handed down lengthy sentences to conscientious
 objectors who refuse military or alternative service alto-
 gether, prison terms are sharply reduced in the appellate
 process. In addition, individuals convicted of refusing
 induction are offered the opportunity to serve their sen-
 tences at farm prisons where each day of work reduces the
 prison term by two days. The effect in practice is that a
 conscientious objector does not serve a sentence longer than
 his period of military obligation and, in many instances, is
 imprisoned for a considerably briefer period.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Article 5 of the constitution guarantees freedom of movement
 within the country, foreign travel, and emigration. It is
 respected in practice. Intending emigrants and those
 returning are treated-as any other Greeks and experience no
 discrimination.
 Persons- accorded refugee status by the Greek government
 (which recently have included Eastern Europeans, some Soviets,
 Ethiopians and Cubans) are permitted to remain in Greece
 pending permanent resettlement elsewhere. During the past
 
 
 804
 year 95 war-displaced Vietnamese refugees were granted
 permanent residency status in Greece with 105 more such
 permits promised. The government operates a refugee camp
 (with the capacity to accommodate approximately 120 persons)
 to house a portion of the refugees awaiting resettlement
 elsewhere while others are housed in hotels. The government
 also provides medical treatment, dental care and hospitali-
 zation for persons accorded refugee status. The United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) maintains an
 office in Athens and works with the Greek government, the
 Intergovernmental Committee on Migration (ICM) and four
 voluntary agencies which also have offices in Athens (World
 Council of Churches, Tolstoy Foundation, International
 Catholic Migration Committee, and Hebrew Immigration Aid
 Society) on refugee matters. There are presently a number
 of Iraqis, Iranians, and Afghans in Greece who have fled
 their countries. The Greek government, although not granting
 them formal refugee status, has.permitted them to remain in
 Greece pending settlement in third countries.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Greece is a multi-party democracy in which all citizens
 enjoy full political rights without regard to race, sex,
 religion, or political persuasion. All opposition parties
 function freely, have access to the media, and hold public
 meetings. Women have the same political rights as men
 and participate fully in the Greek society. At present
 there are ten women in the 300-member rarliament, five
 women mayors and one woman member of the Supreme Council
 of the State.
 Labor rights are guaranteed by the constitution and
 respected in practice. The right to bargain collectively
 and the right to strike are exercised freely.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Greek government has not objected to visits and investi-
 gations by human rights organizations. Amnesty International
 has a chapter in Greece.
