 THE MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands is a nation of 31
 low-lying coral atolls scattered over 750,000 square miles of
 the Central Pacific, comprising a total land area of about 70
 square miles. The population, of Micronesian origin, is
 estimated at 40,000 people, two-thirds of whom are
 concentrated on Majuro and Kwajalein atolls. The Marshall
 Islands constituted a district in a United Nations Trust
 Territory administered by the United States from 1947 to
 1986. In October 1986, the Republic of the Marshall Islands
 became a sovereign, self-governing nation under the Compact of
 Free Association with the United States.
 Political legitimacy in the Marshall Islands rests on the
 popular will expressed by majority vote in accordance with a
 constitution uniquely blending American and British precepts.
 The executive branch of the government consists of a president
 and his appointed cabinet, all of whom are elected members of
 the legislature. The legislature consists of a parliament,
 known as the Nitijela, and a Council of Chiefs (Iroij), the
 latter serving largely a consultative function. The
 Constitution established an independent judiciary. The
 economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the United
 States, coconut oil and copra exports, limited tourism, and
 the fishing industry.
 No human rights abuses were reported in 1988.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The privacy of the home is protected by law and respected by
 the Government. There was no known instance of arbitrary
 intrusion by the State into the private life of the individual.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 These are accorded in practice. There is one privately owned
 newspaper. In 1988 a law was passed prohibiting political
 activity by aliens. An offending alien is subject to
 deportation on the decision of the Cabinet. Although the law
 has never been invoked, its invocation could result in
 deportation without due process.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is provided for
 in the Constitution and observed in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Free exercise of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and observed in practice. There is no state religion. The
 majority of the population is Christian. Missionaries are
 free to seek converts and freely do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad.
 There are no restrictions on emigration or repatriation.
 There are no displaced persons other than those from Bikini
 Atoll who left that atoll in 1946 because of scheduled nuclear
 testing on their islands. Pending further rehabilitation of
 the environment, the Bikinians remain resident elsewhere in
 the Marshall Islands.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government of the Marshall Islands is chosen in free and
 open elections. There is no formalized party system. Parties
 have freely coalesced around political issues, such as the
 form of the new Marshallese relationship with the United
 States, and then dissolved when the issue was resolved.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Government or any known requests for
 investigations. There are no local nongovernmental
 organizations which concern themselves with human rights. The
 Government has not taken an active interest in international
 human rights matters. The Republic is not a member of the
 United Nations.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 gender, race, color, language, religion, political or other
 opinion, national or social origin, place of birth, family
 status, or descent. While this equal protection and freedom
 from discrimination clause is generally observed in practice,
 male dominance in the modern economy has hampered women from
 taking a more active role in the economic life of the
 country. This is changing and an increasing number of women
 are finding jobs in the skilled, semiskilled, and social
 occupations.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of free association in
 general. This freedom of association is interpreted as
 allowing the existence of labor unions, although none have yet
 been formed. The Marshall Islands is a largely nonindustrial
 society.
 b. The Right to Organize and, Bargain Collectively
 There is no legislation on collective bargaining or trade
 union organization. However, there are no bars to
 organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining.
 There are no special economic areas set aside, and labor
 standards and practices are the same throughout the islands.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits involuntary servitude
 and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no legislation concerning minimum age of employment
 in this.traditional society with its largely nonindustrial
 economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage is $1.50 per hour, which is adequate to
 maintain a decent standard of living by local standards.
 There is no legislation concerning maximum hours or
 occupational safety and health.
