 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique has a constitutional government headed by President Joaquim
 Chissano who was elected in the country's first multiparty elections in October
 1994. President Chissano and the leadership of his party, the National Front for the
 Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), which has ruled the country since independ-
 ence in 1975, control policymaking and implementation. The National Assembly,
 while providing a forum for reconciliation and public airing of issues, did not exert
 significant authority or independence from the executive. The extremely weak judi-
 ciary continued to be unable to implement constitutional provisions safeguarding in-
 dividual human rights or provide an effective check on the power of the executive
 branch. Although the foundations of democracy remain fragile, Mozambique's politi-
 cal transition continued to be largely successful, with far fewer human rights prob-
 lems than before the end of the war in late 1993. The country remained stable fol-
 lowing the departure of the last elements of the United Nations peacekeeping force
 (ONUMOZ) in early 1995. Reintegration of areas controlled by the Mozambican Na-
 tional Resistance (RENAMO) during the war remained contentious but limited to
 only a few districts. Tensions between the ruling FRELIMO party and RENAMO
 abated somewhat as the two parties began to work together in the newly elected
 multiparty legislature.
 Mozambique's internal security forces, which include the State Information and
 Security Service (SISE), the Criminal Investigation Police (PIC), the Mozambican
 National Police (PRM) and the Rapid Reaction Police (PIR), were a focus of con-
 troversy, with RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama repeatedly charging that they
 continued to act as arms of the ruling party. Members of the security forces commit-
 ted human rights abuses.
 Approximately 80 percent of the population is employed in agriculture, mostly on
 a subsistence level. A slow transition to a market economy continues in the small
 formal economy. Major exports are shrimp, sugar, cotton, and cashew nuts. While
 the absence of war has caused economic output to expand, extensive corruption at
 all levels of government and halfhearted acceptance of the principles of a free mar-
 ket hamper longer term economic development. The Government has not yet fully
 implemented major economic reforms. Starting from an extremely low base, the
 gross domestic product grew an estimated 5.4 percent in 1994 and was forecast to
 grow 5.5 percent in 1995. However, a high inflation rate continued to plague the
 country, and Mozambique's economy and the Government's budget remain heavily
 dependent on foreign aid. The annual per capita income of $90 remains one of the
 lowest in the world. Near normal rains and continuing peace meant that many
 Mozambicans, including returning refugees and the internally displaced, were able
 to farm their lands again, reducing dependence on food aid.
 
 
 Continuing the postwar trend of recent years, the status of political and civil lib-
 erties in Mozambique improved again, but the country's overalr human rights record
 was marred by a pattern of abusive police behavior and the corrupt and ineffective
 judicial system's inability to serve the average citizen. Ill-trained and undisciplined
 police forces, private security forces, and local officials continued to commit human
 rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and excessive use of force. Security
 forces and police routinely beat or otherwise tortured or abused detainees. Ex-
 tremely poor prison conditions resulted in the deaths of dozens of inmates. The
 media remained largely owned by the Government and manipulated by a retrograde
 faction within the ruling party. With increased press scrutiny, more a buses by secu-
 rity forces came to light than in previous years, and in some instances the Govern-
 ment investigated and punished those responsible. However, due to the common
 perception that the police force is inept and corrupt, many citizens resorted to mob
 justice. Arbitrary arrests, lengthy detentions, discrimination and violence against
 women, and violence against children remain problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known or suspected
 cases of political killings, but there were reorts of extrajudicial killings. According
 to the government-owned press, a district administrator in the northern province of
 Nampua was accused of ordering executions by firing squad. The administrator was
 suspended pending an investigation. In August in an outlying Maputo suburb, rath-
 er than halting a mob from lynching two suspected thieves, a policeman fatally shot
 the two men. The local police station declined comment. Also in August, according
 to an independent news facsimile the PRM in Maputo allegedly extorted money
 from the families of two suspected bandits but then summarily executed the men
 anyway. Witnesses claim that in July police called in to settle a dispute between
 neighbors over a chicken instead shot and killed one of the disputants, Fern
 Macongue Sitee. According to the press, the policemen continue to work in the local
 police station. In February Rapid Reaction Police in Inhambane opened fire on a
 crowd of unarmed protesters, killing two.
 From all indications, mob/vigilante killings continued to be common. In April a
 policeman was beaten to death in Maputo by a mob protesting police brutality. In
 August a mob chased and burned alive a man who had allegedy robbed a delivery
 truck. There were numerous but unverified reports during the year that regulos
 (traditional chiefs) and curadeiros (traditional healers) had imposed and carried out
 death sentences against persons accused of witchcraft.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The fate of thousands of Mozanmbicans who disappeared during the civil war still
 remains unresolved.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture, but the Mozambican police forces car-
 ried out serious abuses during 1995. The police often used excessive force, and there
 were continuing reports that, as a matter of routine, detainees were often beaten
 and whipped. Coruption in the poice forces extends throughout the ranks, and the
 PRM used violence and detention to intimidate people from reporting abuses. In Au-
 gust the Mozambican League of Human Rights reported that police in Nampula
 commit torture in jails, police stations, and public places.
 According to a 1995 investigation by the Mozambican League of Human Rights,
 security forces employed by the Commercial Bank of Mozambique beat and tortured
 (including use of electric shocks) employees of that institution during 1994. Accord-
 ing to a press report in February, members of the "Proteg" private security force
 beat Gabilel Jose Stefane and two of his relatives and detained them for 2 days in
 the fi-m's headquarters. In March police in Mutarara detained and beat two
 RENAMO members of the National Assembly. This lead to a parliamentary inquiry
 and disciplinary action against the police involved. RENAMO leader Dhlakama
 charged on numerous occasions that members of his party were being harassed, de-
 tained, and beaten by police. He also charged that police, under the guise of civil-
 ians, continue to steal from and intimidate his constituency in Manica Province. In
 June the Mozambican League of Human Rights reported that the "Lightning Bri-
 gade" of the Mozambique Armed Defense Force (FADM), sent to the Moamba area
 west of Maputo to deal with armed banditry, had detained, beaten, and tortured
 suspects without due process.
 The rise of criminal activity, combined with the ineffectiveness of the police forces
 and a weak judicial system (see Section 1.e.), led to increased instances of popular
 justice and vigilante activity. The local press frequently reported instances of sus-
 
 
 pected thieves being severely beaten or even lynched by angry mobs. Confiscating
 people's possessions under flimsy pretexts is a common police practice. On occasion,
 the Government has taken action to counter the abuses arising from police corrup-
 tion and excessive use of force. In February Nampula Province Governor Rosario
 Mualeia called on police in the province to stop beating citizens and confiscating
 their possessions. There were isolated instances of disciplinary actions in other parts
 of the country.
 Prison conditions throughout the country posed a serious threat to inmates' life
 and health. Medical and food supplies are more often than not insufficient, and it
 is estimated that some prisons hold up to four times their intended prisoner capac-
 ity. According to Justice Minister Jose Abudo, illnesses prevalent in the rison pop-
 ulation include diarrhea, malaria, scabies, and tuberculosis. Abudo madeahi
 publicized visit to Maputo jails in August and drew attention to the terrible condi-
 tions. He noted that with the exception of Niassa central prison, all other prisons
 in the country were overcrowded.
 According to a report by the Mozambican Legue of Human Rights, the central
 prison in Maputo houses nearly twie its capacity-,575 rather than 800 inmates.
 The civil prison in Maputo is currently housmng 550 prisoners rather than its stated
 maximum capacity of 250. In Nacala City, in Nampula Province, the prison is
 housed in the basement of the only hotel in town. As the Nampula Provincial Direc-
 tor of Prisons, Basilio Augusto, explained, the province does not have adequate
 buildings to house prisoners. Thus, prisoners, ill or not, are all placed in the same
 cell in inhumane conditions. For example, Nampula central prison, with a capacity
 of 90 persons, currently houses 400 prisoners.
 In September Radio Mozambique reported that 31 inmates had already died in
 Chimoio central prison in 1995 from illness, lack of food, and lack of sanitary condi-
 tions. According to the report, prisoners in Chimoio receive only one meal per day,
 and the prison authorities rarely provide inmates with medical attention. August
 press reports stated that 25 prisoners died in Manica central prison. In May the
 press reported that the Director of the Nampula prison had been accused of stealing
 prisoners' food and that 12 prisoners had died in the first 3 months of the year from
 malnutrition. In July 3 former detainees at the First Police Station in Nampula
 stated that at least 10 people died there over a 3-month period. The three men at-
 tributed the deaths to food shortages and lack of medical assistance. However, they
 also charged that police beat inmates as punishment for disobeying orders. They
 further alleged that some police guards asked for money in exchange for freedom.
 In January the Tanzanian Embassy requested that the Government investigate
 reports that 13 Tanzanian citizens had died of diseases caused by poor conditions
 in the jail in Beira. International human rights groups are given access to prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law requires that most detainees be
 charged or released within 30 days. However, persons accused of the most serious
 crimes, i.e., security offenses or those requiring a sentence of more than 8 years,
 may be detained for up to 84 days without being formally charged. With court ap-
 proval, such detainees may be held for two additional periods of 84 days while the
 police complete their investigation. In practice, however, these rules, as well as a
 detainee's constitutional right to counsel and to contact relatives or friends often are
 ignored. The Government has broad latitude to determine what constitutes a secu-
 rity offense.
 Most citizens are unaware of their rights, particularly those granted under the
 1990 Constitution, and detainees can spend many months, even years, in pretrial
 status. In some cases, detainees may be released from prison while the investigation
 proceeds, but the bail system remains poorly defined, with police and prison officials
 usually taking bribes to effect the release of those who can afford to pay. The law
 provides that if the prescribed period for investigation has been completed and no
 charges have been brought, the detainee must be released. In practice, however, this
 law is often ignored, in part because of the severe lack of administrative personnel,
 trained judges and sufficient lawyers to monitor the judicial system (see Section
 i.e.). A large backlog of prisoners continues to await trial. In March the Deputy
 Minister of Justice acknowledged that between 20 and 30 percent of some 4,000 de-
 tainees held in jails had been held without charge beyond the period stipulated by
 law but in July, the Minister of Justice stated that of 2,572 detainees awaiting
 trial, 1,451 had not been charged. In July it was reported that of 174 prisoners in
 the Xai Xai jail, only 25 had actually been convicted of crimes. The same month
 long-time detainees at the Gaza provincial prison in Xai Xai rioted, demanding that
 their cases be tried; 11 detainees were injured when police intervened.
 According to the Mozambican League of Human Rights, of the 1,575 people de-
 tained in Maputo central prison, 1,009 were awaiting trial. The League discovered
 that one person who was arrested for stealing cement has been jailed in Maputo
 
 
 180
 central prison since September 1992 but has yet to be taken before a magistrate.
 In another documented case a man in the central prison accused of stealing a kilo-
 gram of onions in 1989 still awaited trial at year's end.
 The 1990 Constitution expressly prohibits exile, and the Government does not use
 exile as a form of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.--The 1990 Constitution formally established an
 independent judiciary and specifically states that the decisions of the courts take
 Srecedence over all other authorities and individuals and must be obeyed. Neverthe-
 fess, the executive, and by extension the FRELIMO party, dominates the judiciary.
 In general, judges are beholden for their positions to the ruling FRELIMO party,
 which continues to exercise significant influence on all aspects of public life through
 the executive and party organs. Moreover, the President appoints the members of
 the most important tribunal, the Supreme Court, and prior to the October elections,
 these were automatically ratified by the FRELIMO-appointed National Assembly.
 The President also appoints the Attorney General, and after a delay of almost a
 year, in December, the President filled this long-vacant position. The new
 multiparty National Assembly has yet to assert its prerogatives in the judicial area.
 Mozambique has two complementary formal justice systems: the civil/criminal,
 which includes customary courts; and the military. A 1991 law empowered the Su-
 preme Court to administer the civil/criminal; it also hears appeals, including mili-
 tary cases, although the Ministry of Defense administers the military courts. Civil-
 ians are not under the jurisdiction of or tried in the military courts. Local customary
 courts handle matters such as estate and divorce cases. In regular courts, all ac-
 cused persons are in theory presumed innocent and have the right to legal counsel
 and the right of appeal, but the authorities do not always respect these rights, and
 in fact the great majority of the population does not possess the means to obtain
 any form of legal counsel following the disintegration of a government organization
 previously responsible for providing counsel for indigent defendants. The President
 of the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the judicial system is plagued by brib-
 ery and extortion.
 The Government, with international assistance, has developed a comprehensive
 plan for improving the professional level and efficiency of the judiciary. However,
 in 1995 little action was taken to put this plan into effect. The military is also dis-
 cussing new judicial institutions.
 Since the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1988 and the abolition of the
 Revolutionary Military Tribunal, persons accused of crimes against the State are
 tried in common civilian courts under standard criminal judicial procedures. A judge
 may order a trial closed because of national security interests or to protect the pri-
 vacy of the plaintiff in cases concerning rape.
 Efforts to reintegrate RENAMO-controlled zones into central administrative struc-
 tures continued, but RENAMO still administers a number of areas through a rudi-
 mentary form of civil administration and traditional courts, with extensive use of
 traditional authorities as judges. In a June Focus on Africa report, traditional chiefs
 were accused of sentencing to death persons accused of witchcraft and throwing
 them to the crocodiles.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1990 Constitution provides for the right to privacy and expressly forbids the use of
 surveillance techniques. By law, police need a warrant to enter homes and busi-
 nesses. Although there are fewer reports of such activity, incidents of illegal tele-
 phone wiretapping by government intelligence agencies allegedly still occur. In July
 RENAMO's Dhlakama accused the SISE of spying on him during a visit to Gaza
 Province.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, the 1991 Press Law, and the
 1992 Rome Peace Accords provide for freedom of expression and the press but with
 restrictions in cases involving national defense considerations. In practice, however,
 the Government restricts these freedoms. While criticism of the President is not le-
 gally prohibited, the 1991 Press Law holds that, in cases of defamation against the
 President, truth is not a sufficient defense against libel. Although this law had not
 been tested in court, it resulted in considerable self-censorship and almost no direct
 criticism of the President.
 The Government dominates the media through direct control of, and subsidies to,
 the most important means of reaching the public. The Government owns the coun-
 try's only two daily newspapers (Noticias in Maputo and Diario in Beira), the larg-
 est weekly news a er (Domngo), the main radio station, the only weekly news mag-
 azine andone of the two television stations. The Government also has its own wire
 
 
 service (the Mozambican Information Agency-AIM), which local journalists regard
 largely as an outlet for propaganda.
 While control of the media is not word-by-word and day-by-day, the official media
 know their limits and generally do not criticize government officials or policies. Two
 ministers did become the target of press campaigns, but this was less a break with
 past practice than evidence that they were out of favor with the retrograde faction
 of FRELIMO that has the most influence on the press. The government-controlled
 media not only avoids stories critical of the Government but also finds ample space
 for items that support it or that portray the opposition in a bad light. Recently, such
 activity included disinformation camp igns regarding RENAMO activities and exag-
 gerated reports on the degree of foodshortages in the country. Abolition of the Min-
 istry of Information in late 1994 did not result in greater independence for the
 media as the Ministry's functions were taken over by the Prime Minister's Office.
 Notwithstanding the dominance of the official media, the small, independent press
 carry opposition viewpoints and generally have far more credibility. However, the
 influence of the independent press and, for that matter, of the officia press as well,
 is limited largely to Maputo and the provincial capitals because of the logistical dif-
 ficulty of distribution of any publication in rural areas.
 The independent media consist of two weekly newspapers (Savanna and Demos),
 two daily fax newsletters (Mediafax and Imparcial), the second television station
 (RTK) and a few limited-range radio stations. RTK began its third year of broad-
 casting in 1995. While independent of the Government, the station is owned by a
 FRELIMO Central Committee member, and programming has not taken an inde-
 pendent political line. Both RTK and the government station broadcast only in
 aput and two other major cities, leaving the vast majority of the country without
 television coverage.
 Journalists of the independent as well as the government-controlled press who
 even obliquely criticized high-level officials were subject to threats and intimidation.
 In March Mediafax editors quickly were summoned to the prosecutor's office (even
 though such legal processes usually take months) after publishing a story about a
 vice minister's actions relating to a stolen car. Interior Minister Manuel Antonio
 made public threats against journalists of Diario de Mocambique, after that paper
 published reports linking the Minister's brother to a stolen car. In June a journalist
 with the government-owned AIM was detained by police for 8 hours, apparently in
 retaliation for press articles critical of police behavior.
 There are no formal restrictions on academic freedom, but, in practice, teachers
 routinely adhere to self-censorship since their employment depends on the State.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaton.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Legislation enacted in 1991 provided guide-
 lines for the registration of political parties, and 18 registered political parties were
 active during the 1994 election campaign, including RENAMO and FRELIMO.
 Throughout 1995 political groups were free to hold congresses and press con-
 ferences.
 Other groups and associations also have organized or become more active. For ex-
 ample, in mid-February the Order of Lawyers of Mozambique was established with
 the announced purpose of reorganizing the legal profession and redefining the na-
 tional standards for accreditation as an attorney. The Mozambican Christian Coun-
 cil has undertaken a project to collect arms throughout the country. It has held sev-
 eral rallies where people were able to exchange arms for agricultural equipment.
 The rallies were well-attended and faced no governmental obstacles or harassment.
 Under new legislation approved in October 1992, a political party must dem-
 onstrate that it has no racial, ethnic, or religious exclusiveness and secure at least
 2,000 signatures of support from within the country in order to be recognized le-
 gally.
 No groups were known to have been denied permission to hold public marches.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution mandates strict separation of church
 and state and provides for the freedom to "practice or not practice a religion." The
 Government does not require religious organizations or missionaries to register, and
 foreign missionaries are routinely granted visas. The Constitution gives religious in-
 stitutions the right to own property and operate schools. In May a radio station
 owned by a religious organization opened in Maputo, and in March a Muslim-owned
 weekly newspaper was launched. Relations between the Government and religious
 organizations, tense in the early years after independence, began to improve in 1992
 and have improved further as the Government has sought political support from
 these organizations in the multiparty system
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country. Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of travel within the country and
 abroad. The Government no longer requires citizens to obtain permits from local au-
 
 
 182
 thorities in order to travel within the country. The Government does continue to en-
 force a law fining foreigners who overstay their visas $300 per day.
 With the end of the civil war and the return of the rains after the record drought
 of 1992, internally displaced Mozambicans and those who had sought refuge in
 neighboring asylum countries began to return home at the end of 1992 and through-
 out 1993 and 1994. Under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) and with the assistance of the International Organization of
 Migration, by mid-1995 over 1.7 million refugees had returned, and most of the 3.6
 million displaced persons had moved back home. Travel to RENAMO controlled
 areas was generally not difficult, although in many cases RENAMO insisted that
 in order to ensure safety and prevent misunderstanding, relief workers and others
 should carry RENAMO letters.
 The numerous soldier mutinies which plagued the country during 1994 largely
 abated due to the demobilization of most of the former combatants, with relatively
 few such protests threatening freedom of movement. A more significant problem, es-
 pecially for truck drivers and foreign tourists, was harassment by police demanding
 bribes to escape trumped-up charges of minor infractions.
 At the end of 1995, there were few refugees from other countries in Mozambique.
 Between October 1992 and December 1994, the UNHCR registered 383 refugees,
 but the Government has subsequently lost track of the whereabouts of 200 of these
 persons. In January the Foreign Minister stated that the Government had received
 187 requests for asylum. There were no reported cases in which refugees were
 forced to return to countries where they might have a well-founded fear of persecu-
 tion.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens freely exercised for the first time their right to vote in multiparty elec-
 tions in October 1994, which U.N. and other observers declared to be free and fair.
 President Chissano was elected, with the ruling FRELIMO party winning 129 of the
 250 National Assembly seats. The newly elected Parliament, with its FRELIMO ma-
 jority, did not provide any significant check on the power of the executive branch.
 The President and the FRELIMO leadership continued to control policymaking and
 implementation, and FRELIMO members were appointed to all cabinet positions
 and provincial governorships, even in provinces where RENAMO had won over-
 whelming majorities in the 1994 elections.
 RENAMO, for its part, in Nampula Province raised money by imposing its own
 taxes and also carried out its own census. In other areas, FRELIMO administrators
 accused RENAMO officials of running parallel governmental structures, and
 harassing and even physically abusing central government appointed officials. By
 year's end, there were indications the Government was establishing itself in some
 RENAMO-dominated areas.
 In March the Government propsed local elections, limited to the 10 provincial
 capitals and Maputo, for 1996. The timetable and the areas to participate in these
 elections were still being debated at year's end however, and they were not expected
 to take place in 1996.
 While there are no legal restrictions hindering women's involvement in govern-
 ment, cultural factors and underdevelopment have inhibited their political advance-
 ment. Nonetheless, of the 250 newly elected National Assembly deputies, 62 are
 women (48 of 129 FRELIMO, 13 of 112 RENAMO and 1 of 9 Democratic Union Coa-
 lition), albeit, these female deputies are not believed to play a significant role in ei-
 ther the Parliament's or the individual parties' decisionmaking processes. One
 woman serves as a minister in the Government and five as vice ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal obstacles to the formation of local human rights groups in Mo-
 zambique, and two groups formed in 1993 continued to operate. Based on its belief
 that the great majority of human rights abuses in Mozambique never come to light,
 the Mozambican League for Human Rights has focused efforts on educating the pub-
 lic regarding its rights, with emphasis on the rights of prisoners. The Government
 has permitted the League access to Maputo prisons under the jurisdiction of the
 Ministry of Justice. The League has also publicly criticized widespread abusive be-
 havior of the Mozambican police and the Minister of Interior himself.
 The Mozambique Government has been receptive to international human rights
 monitoring groups, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution forbids discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or disability,
 but the Government does not ensure in practice that such discrimination does not
 occur.
 Women.-According to medical and other sources, violence against women, espe-
 cially wife beating and rape, is widespread, especially in rural areas. According to
 a local women's group, many women believe that their spouses have the right to
 beat them. The police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes, and cases are
 rarely brought before the courts. Furthermore, when victims of physical abuse are
 brought to the hospital, these cases are rarely registered as caused by domestic vio-
 lence. No official statistics exist with reference to the magnitude of domestic vio-
 lence. The Government has not specifically addressed the issue of violence against
 women. While rape can theoretically be prosecuted in the courts, cultural pressures
 would make it highly unlikely for most women to press for such action.
 Despite the constitutional prohibition of discrimination based on sex, women suf-
 fer from both legal and societal discrimination. Mozambique has civil and commer-
 cial legal codes which predate independence and frequently contradict each other
 and the Constitution. Among these laws are discriminatory measures based on tra-
 ditional African practices which limit widows' inheritance rights, with estates re-
 verting to the deceased husband's relatives. Also, the legal domicile of a married
 woman is her husband's house, and she may only work outside the home with the
 express consent of her husband. A married woman can use property as collateral
 for funds only with her husband's consent. The Government has not yet drafted any
 measures that would revise and update family law.
 Women continue to be underrepresented in the professions; a few women are ac-
 tive in the leadership of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). Women have less
 access than men to educational institutions above the primary level. Although
 roughly equal proportions of male and female children enter primary school, by sec-
 ondary school, males greatly outnumber females. Discrimination against women is
 most apparent in rural areas where over 80 percent of the population live and
 where women are engaged mainly in subsistence farming and childrearing, with lit-
 tle opportunity for schooling or access to health care.
 In July, in preparation for the U.N. Conference on Women in Beijing, the
 Mozambican Association of Women in the Legal Profession held a seminar which
 examined discriminatory elements in the law. They questioned Article 21 of the
 Constitution, which grants Mozambican citizenship to the foreign wife of a
 Mozambican male but normally does not grant citizenship to the foreign-born spouse
 of a Mozambican woman. They also examined several portions of the Civil Code
 which dictate a woman's residence and grant decisionmaking power to the fathers
 and husbands.
 In May the Mozambican Association of Demobilized Soldiers noted that demobi-
 lized female soldiers were not being given the same opportunitie3 as men for
 reintegration into social and economic projects.
 The Justice Ministry and an NGO, the Association of Women, Law, and Develop-
 ment (MULEIDE), which aims to promote and defend the legal rights of women, are
 collaborating to identify outdated laws that conflict with rights granted to women
 by the 1990 Constitution. This has been a slow process with few concrete accom-
 pishments.
 Children.-The Government has not made children's rights and welfare a priority.
 It has made ittle attempt to alleviate the pight of the increasing numbers of urban
 street children, many of whom were orphaned by the war. In a speech in April, the
 Minister of Social Action Coordination suggestedthat there were hundreds of thou-
 sands of abandoned children in urban areas. Such street children are routinely beat-
 en by police and are often victims of sexual abuse. The Government appears either
 unwilling or unable to deal with an increasingly corrupt and overcrowded edu-
 cational system in which it is widely reported that school children (or their parents)
 must bribe teachers for passing grades. Reportedly about half of the country's chil-
 dren do not attend school at all.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution expressly states that "dis-
 abled citizens shall enjoy fully the rights enshrined in the Constitution," few re-
 sources were available to make this a reality. In 1991 the Association of
 Mozambican Disabled (ADEMO) was created to address the social and economic
 needs of the disabled. Although poorly funded, ADEMO provides training, raises
 public awareness of the need to fully integrate the disabled into society, and lobbies
 the Ministry of Labor to initiate legislation to support the working rights of the dis-
 abled. The electoral law governing Mozambique s first multiparty elections specifi-
 
 
 cally addressed the needs of disabled voters in the polling booths. No special access
 facilities exist.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-There was no systematic persecution or dis-
 crimination on the basis of race or ethnicity. However, the FRELIMO Government
 has traditionally included at all levels a disproportionate number of southerners,
 mostly from the Shangaan ethnic group. The Government took some steps to ad-
 dress this imbalance-in a departure rom previous practice, new provincial gov-
 ernors appointed during 1995 were all natives of the respective provinces and more
 nonsoutherners were included in FRELIMO's parliamentary delegation.
 RENAMO leadership is predominantly from the Shona ethnic group. There is no
 indication that the conflict between the Government and RENAMO was primarily
 motivated by ethnicity, although ethnic and regional factors may have played some
 role and explain some of the civil war violence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies that all workers are free
 to join or refrain from joining a trade union. The Labor Law passed in December
 1991 further protects workers right to organize and to engage in union activity at
 their place of employment. The legislation gave existing unions the right to register
 independently from the then FRELIMO dominated Organization of Mozambican
 Workers (OTM). The three independent unions that broke away from the OTM in
 1992 formed a central union in 1994 but maintain working contacts with OTM. In
 December 1994, the National Peasant Union was created, and it specified that it
 is autonomous and unrelated to any political party.
 While still subject to strong government influence, OTM is seeking to develop a
 more democratic image. At its Third National Congress in May 1994, the OTM
 membership for the first time elected the President and the Secretary General. Pre-
 viously both OTM positions had been government appointments. New OTM statutes
 call for independence from any influences by companies, governments, political par-
 ties, and religious groups. The independent unions charged, however, that OTM still
 lacked sufficient independence from the Government and called for the establish-
 ment of a new central union structure.
 The Constitution explicitly provides for the right to strike, with the exception of
 government employees, police, military personnel, and employees of other essential
 services (which include sanitation, firefighting, air traffic control, health care, water,
 electricity, fuel, post office, and telecommunications). While there were frequent
 calls for a general strike to protest what was seen as an insufficient minimum wage,
 no such strike occurred. Some wildcat strikes were held, predominantly for payment
 of salaries in arrears.
 The 1991 Labor Law forbids retribution against strikers, the hiring of substitute
 workers, and lockouts by employers. There were no known instances of employer
 retribution against striking workers. Specific labor disputes are generally arbitrated
 through ad hoc workers' committees, formally recognized by the Government. The
 Constitution and labor legislation give unions the right to join and participate in
 international bodies. The OTM is a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Council. The
 Mozambican Parliament has ratified four International Labor Organization conven-
 tions on employment policies, tripartite negotiations, trade union legislation, collec-
 tive bargaining, and protection of trade union rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Law protects the
 ight of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. It expressly pro-
 hibits discrimination against organizedlabor, although antiunion discriminationhas
 not been an issue because, until recently, unions were government-controlled organi-
 zations. In late 1991, the Government decreed that it would no longer set all salary
 levels. Negotiation of wage increases was left in the hands of existing unions. Dur-
 ing 1994 and 1995, the OTM took an active role in negotiating an increase in the
 minimum wage. The OTM, the three independent unions, and business organiza-
 tions met with the Government to negotiate a "social pact," which resulted in an
 increased minimum wage and the setting of voluntary price ceilings on certain food
 staples. The more activist independent unions and, to a lesser extent the OTM, uti-
 lized the threat of a general strike to compel the Government and business organi-
 zations to negotiate. The resulting "social pact" committee has since been formalized
 to negotiate issues which im pact on workers. In September the OTM, the three
 independent unions, and the Teachers and Journalists Unions continued to nego-
 tiat with employers' associations and the Government for an increase in the ini-
 mum ware rate. They demanded a 75 percent increase in the minimum wage and
 an indexing of wages  the inflation rate. The Government agreed to a 37.5 percent
 wage increase.
 
 
 While Mozambique has enacted legislation for the establishment of export proc-
 essigzones, no zones have been created.
 Sc.Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and there have been no reports of such labor practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Child labor is regulated by the
 Ministry of Labor. In the wage economy, the minimum working age is 16 years. Be-
 cause of high adult unemployment, few children are employed in regular wage posi-
 tions. However children commonly work on family farms or in the urban informal
 sector, where they perform such tasks as guarding cars, collecting scrap metal, or
 selling trinkets and food in the streets.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage rates ad-
 ministratively. The minimum wage at year's end was less than $21 (218,143
 meticais) per month. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing the mini-
 mum rates in the private sector, the Ministry of Finance in the public sector. Viola-
 tions of minimum wage rates are usually investigated only after workers register
 a complaint. It is customary for workers to receive benefits such as transportation
 and food. The minimum wage is not considered sufficient to sustain an average
 urban worker and family. Many workers must turn to a second job, if available, as
 well as work garden plots to survive.
 The standard legal workweek is 44 hours, with a weekly 24-hour rest period stip-
 ulated. In the small modern sector, the Government has enacted health and envi-
 ronmental laws to protect workers. On occasion, the Government has closed firms
 for noncompliance with these laws, but the Ministry of Labor enforces these laws
 ineffectively. Workers have the right to remove themselves from work situations
 that endanger their health or safety without jeopardy to their continued employ-
 ment.
