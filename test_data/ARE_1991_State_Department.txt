 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 emirates established in 1971. Each emirate retains extensive
 control over such important matters as mineral wealth
 (including oil) and some aspects of defense and internal
 security. There are no popular elections, either local or
 federal. Most emirates are governed through traditional tribal
 mechanisms, relying heavily on the open majlis or meeting
 wherein citizens can express their concerns directly to their
 leaders. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi also has an appointed
 Executive Council, which is advised by an Abu Dhabi National
 Consultative Council, to manage its municipal affairs. In
 accordance with the 1971 Constitution, the seven emirate rulers
 comprise a Federal Supreme Council, the UAE's highest
 legislative and executive body. It meets officially only
 occasionally, although the leaders meet frequently in more
 traditional settings. In practice, the legislative and
 executive work is delegated to the Council of Ministers, which
 manages the federal structure. The Supreme Council selects a
 President and Vice President from its membership; the President
 in turn appoints the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. The
 Federal National Council, whose members are appointed by the
 rulers of each emirate in a ratio depending on the size of the
 emirate, serves as a consultative body. Certain types of
 legislation must go before the Federal National Council to be
 approved but, in reality, the Council has only advisory power.
 Only the Federal Government and the Emirate of Dubai maintain
 independent internal security organizations. The Emirate of
 Dubai has its own police force, which is active in
 antinarcotics and antiterroxist activity.
 The economy, based on oil and gas production and light
 manufacturing, has made the UAE's per capita income one of the
 world's highest. It is a largely free market economy. The
 Government owns the majority share (60 percent to 88 percent)
 of the oil enterprise in Abu Dhabi, with the other shares held
 by various private ail company equity-partners. A small UAE
 citizen population controls the country's economic life but
 depends heavily on. a much larger contingent of foreigners to
 provide manual labor and technical skills. The UAE's four
 emirates with small or nonexistent petroleum resources are
 dependent on federal government subsidies for such essential
 services as health, electricity, water, and education.
 The principal human rights problems continue to be restrictions
 on freedom of assembly and association, the right of citizens
 to change their government, and worker- rights. There was
 continued progress for women in education and the work force
 and somewhat freer expression of viewpoints in the press,
 although the press continues to avoid direct criticism of the
 Government and to exercise self-censorship on topics sensitive
 to the Government. Women continue to face certain types of
 discrimination. There were credible reports of cases of
 incommunicado detention of some foreign nationals as a result
 of the Gulf War.

 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect-for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No political disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture or degrading treatment of
 any person, and the physical or moral abuse of an accused
 person. 'However, there were credible reports that Iraqi
 nationals were detained and left on an uninhabited island for
 days during the Gulf War without shelter or adequate food and
 water. Shari'a dourts occasionally sentence convicted felons
 to flogging.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arrest, search, detention, or
 imprisonment except in accordance with the law, and the laws of
 each emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable cause.
 By law, the police must report any arrest to a judge within 48
 hours for his determination whether to charge, release, or,
 with sufficient police justifidation, allow limited further
 detention pending an investigation. Once charged, detainees
 are brought td trial reasonably expeditiously. There is no
 formal 'ystem of bail, but detainees sometimes are released
 upon the deposit of money or an important document such as a
 passport.
 There were credible reports of persons being held in
 incommunicado detention in 1991. These persons, mostly
 Palestinians and Iraqis, were sometimes held for 1 or 2
 months. -The Government has not denied its use of-incommunicado
 detention but denies detaining any person without cause.
 Some long-term residents of Palestinian and Iraqi origin, who
 have had their documents revoked and been ordered to leave the
 country, are being held in jail because they are unable or
 unwilling to return to their countries of origin.
 Exile'of citizens is prohibited by the Constitution and is not
 practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a (clerical) and civil
 courts, each of which deals with both criminal and civil
 cases. The Shari'a courts are administered by each emirate,
 but the civil courts are usually part of the federal system and
 are answerable to the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi.
 However, the Dubai and Ras al-Khaimah civil court systems are
 independent of the federal system. Each court system has a
 multilevel appeals process- The nature of the case determines
 which court system hears a particular case. Due process rights
 
 
 1629
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 are uniform under both Shari'a and civil court procedure.
 There is a presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.
 Legal counsel is readily available and permitted to represent a
 defendant in both court systems. The court may appoint legal
 counsel if counsel agrees to provide services free; no system
 of state payment of public defenders exists. However, the
 losing party may be required to'pay the winner's legal fees.
 The judge is responsible for looking after the interests'of a
 person not represented by counsel.
 There are no jury trials. All cases, except national security
 cases and those deemed by the judge likely to harm public
 morality, are open to the public. Most judges are foreign
 nationals, primarily from other Arab countries. There has been
 little evidence in recent years of rulers interfering in the
 judicial process.
 The criminal court system is generally regarded as fair and its
 judgments well considered. There is no separate national
 security court system. The military has its own court system
 based on Western military judicial practice. Military
 tribunals try only military personnel.
 There are no known political prisoners. However, there were a
 number of reports of'persons being detained on- the basis of
 their nationality during and in the aftermath of the Persian
 Gulf War (see Section l.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or'
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's
 permission, except in accordance with the law. Although the
 police may enter homes without'a warrant and without
 demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions in searching
 premises are subject to review, and he is subject to discipline
 if he acts irresponsibly. Anyone other than a police officer
 must have a court order to enter a private home. Local custom
 and practice place a high value on privacy, and-entry into
 private homes.without the owner's permission is rare., There is
 no surveillance of private correspondence. Except for rare
 instances involving national security, no cases of arbitrary
 interference with privacy have been reported in r~cent years.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 UAE citizens are constitutionally assured freedom of speech.
 In practice, however, most inhabitants, especially foreign
 nationals, are circumispect in public discussions of sensitive
 political topics or in criticizing the Government.
 Although many of the local English- and Arabic-language
 newspapers are privately owned, all but one receive government
 subsidies. Self-censorship by the press, following government
 guidelines, makes formal censorship rare, and'none was known to
 have occurred in 1991. Journalists in the UAE must also
 conform to the code of self-censorship in articles concerning
 the UAE destined for publication abroad.
 The UAE press, in keeping with long tradition, continues to be
 cautious in reporting on government -policy, the ruling
 families, national security, religious matters, and
 
 
 1630
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 relationships with neighboring states; however, during 1991
 there was a trend toward a somewhat more open expression of
 opinion and a fuller coverage of controversial subjects. For
 example, one of the leading Arabic dailies published a series
 of articles based on roundtable discussions of contemporary
 Gulf, Arab; and international issues. In these discussions
 several intellectuals voiced opinions strongly critical of
 existing political institutions and regimes.
 All television and radio stations are government owned and
 conform to government reporting guidelines. However,
 television Stations in Abu Dhabi and Dubai continue to
 broadcast the programs of the Cable Nes Network (CNN) with no
 apparent censorship.
 The censorship department of the Ministry of Information and
 Culture reviews all imported newspapers, periodicals, books,
 films, and videos, and bans items considered pornographic,
 violent, derogatory to Islam, favorable to -Israel, unduly
 critical of friendly countries, or critical of the Government
 or the ruling families. Authorities confiscate material
 written in the Hebrew lafiguage. The small publishing industry
 is subject to government censorship in accordance with the
 above criteria.
 The unwritten but widely accepted ban on criticism of the
 Government also restricts academic freedom. However, the
 recent trend toward more overt criticism of the Government by
 academics continued to be evident in 1991. This criticism
 appears in articles written by academics and published in the
 UAE press, as well as in viewpoints expressed by piofessors in
 their classrooms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Organized public gatherings require a government permit. Each
 emirate- determines its own practice on public gatherings, with
 some emirates taking a far more liberal approach to seminars
 dnd conferences on sensitive subjects. Citizens normally
 confine their political discussion and debate to the numerous
 "assemblies" (majlises), held in private homes, which are a
 local tradition. Political organizations are prohibited.
 There are no restrictions on the formation of private
 associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion. Non-Muslims are free to
 practice their religion, but may not publicly proselytize or
 distribute religious literature. By tradition and social
 custom, non-Muslims may worship in their own way, and several
 churches exist in the major cities. Several Christian churches
 in the capital, Abu Dhabi, were built on land which was a gift
 from President Zayed. Foreign clergymen are allowed to
 minister to expatriate congregations. Christian teaching is
 permitted in private Christian schools for Christian children.
 Religious groups'are allowed to engage in private charitable
 activities.
 d. Freedo. of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation
 within the country except for security areas such as defense
 and oil installations. Unrestricted foreign travel and
 
 
 1631
 
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 emigration are permitted to citizens, except those involved in
 financial disputes under adjudication. Exit visas are not
 required. All citizens have the right of return.
 In the past the UAE accepted large numbers of Palestinians and
 other displaced persons. In 1991, as a result of the political
 repercussions of the Persian Gulf War, that trend was
 reversed. The work contracts of a large number of
 Palestinians, Iraqis, Jordanians, Sudanese, and Yemenis were
 terminated, and would-be refugees of other nationalities were
 also affected by a more restrictive policy. A number of
 Ethiopians, who were awaiting action on their request for
 asylum in a third country, were deported in August. Those
 persons who seek refugee status are routinely jailed or
 detained while awaiting resettlement in a third country. The
 UAE has no formalized procedure for naturalization, and
 noncitizens are expected to leave the country at retirement age.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The UAE has no formal democratically elected institutions, and
 citizens do not have the right to change their government or
 even to form political parties. Despite consultative councils
 at the federal and national levels, most executive and
 legislative power is in the hands of the seven emirate rulers,
 their extended families, and those persons and families-to whom
 they are allied by historical ties, marriage, or common
 interest. These emirate political leaders constitute the
 dominant political force at the national level.
 Decisionmaking at the federal level is through consensus of the
 seven emirates and their leading families. This need for
 consensus tends to slow decisionmaking at the federal level.
 Male citizens have the opportunity to make their views and
 grievances heard through attendance at majlises held by the
 rulers of each emirate.
 Although the rulers and ruling families by tradition are
 presumed to have the right to rule, their incumbency ultimately
 depends on the quality of their leadership and responsiveness.
 to their subjects' needs. Emirate rulers are accessible, in
 varying degree, to citizens who have a problem or request. The
 choice of a new emirate ruler falls to the ruling family in
 consultation with other prominent tribal leaders. Women are
 free to hold government positions, and the government
 encourages women to get degrees and work. However, there are
 few women in high-level government positions because they are
 relatively new to government service and because there
 continues to be strong family pressure against entering the
 workplace.
 The political dominance of the ruling families is intertwined
 with their substantial involvement and influence in economic
 life. The ruling families and their close allies control and
 profit from petroleum production and, with important merchant
 families, have a major stake in the UAE's commercial life. A
 complex system of distribution of wealth, including through the
 federal and emirate governments, ensures generous subsidies and
 a high standard of living for most UAE citizens.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The UAE does not permit any internal groups that would monitor
 human rights. No outside human rights group is known to have
 sought permission to visit the UAE in 1991.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most UAE women still play a traditional family-centered role in
 UAE society because of the frequency of early marriage and
 traditional attitudes about women's roles. However, women's
 education continues to advance rapidly. Females far outnumber
 males at the UAE National University, constituting 70 percent
 of the enrolled student body. Opportunities for women are
 growing in government service, the media, education, and
 health. Women are officially encouraged to continue their
 education, and government-sponsored women's centers provide
 adult education and technical training courses. The UAE
 military service accepts women volunteers and is expanding its
 training program for female officers and enlisted ranks.
 There are no restrictions on the right of UAF women to own
 property or to engage in marriage contracts as equal partners.
 A woman's property is not commingled with that of her husband.
 A woman may not take her children out of the UAE without their
 father's permission. In cases of divorce, Islamic law.is
 observed. The woman gets custody of children until they are 7
 years of age. After this a child usually lives with his or her
 father unless there are circumstances which convince judicial
 authorities that custody should be given to the mother. A
 woman who remarries forfeits her right to the custody of
 children from a previous marriage. Polygamy is also legal,
 with the stipulation that all wives be treated equally. In
 practice, it .is rare to find a UAE man married to more than one
 wife.
 Little is known about the extent of violence against women in
 the UAE, although wife beating and abuse of domestic servants,
 for example, are known to occur. Abuse occurring within the
 family is seldom mentioned owing to the value attached to
 personal privacy in this traditional society. Excessive
 violence against women would be grounds for divorce and
 criminal charges, but suits brought on these grounds are said
 to be rare.
 There is no noticeable discrimination because of race or
 language. UAE citizens are almost all Arabs and speakers of
 Arabic. Although the UAE's Shi'a minority has had commercial
 success, few of them manage to reach top positions in the UAE's
 governing hierarchy. Their religious affiliation may be an
 inhibiting factor, but their largely Iranian origin also leads
 the majority of UAE citizens to view them as outsiders even
 though their families may have been residents for generations.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 UAE law is silent on the right of workers to organize unions
 and to strike, except that it is a criminal offense for public
 sector workers to strike.  In practice, there are no unions and
 
 
 1633
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 no strikes. Foreign workers who might attempt to organize a
 union risk deportation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legal provision for the right of workers to engage
 in collective bargaining. For the resolution of work-related
 disputes, workers must rely on conciliation committees,
 organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and on
 special labor courts. There is no official minimum wage or
 wage structure, but the Ministry of Labor reviews all contracts
 and does not approve any contract that stipulates a clearly
 unacceptable wage.
 There is manufacturing in the Free Port, but the same laws and
 regulations apply there as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor regulations prohibit employment of persons under age 15
 and have special provisions for employing those aged 15 to 18.
 Since the children of UAE nationals have little incentive to
 work and only adult foreign workers are allowed in the country,
 there is virtually no child labor. There is compulsory
 education of children to age 12.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no leqislated or administrative minimum wage. Supply
 and demand determine salardes. However, according to the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs there is an unofficial,
 unwritten minimum wage which would afford a worker and his
 family a minimal standard of living. As noted in Section 6.b.,
 the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry reviews all contracts and
 disapproves those it deems unfair.
 Work hours are restricted to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week,
 but these standards are not strictly enforced. The law
 provides for a minimum of 24 days per year of annual leave plus
 10 national and religious holidays.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, which are
 enforced by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, municipalities, and Civil Defense. Every large
 industrial concern is required to employ an occupational safety
 officer certified by the Ministry of Labor. If an accident
 occurs, a worker is entitled to fair compensation. According
 to the Labor Ministry, "illegal" workers (expatriates working
 without a contract or with an expired contract) are also
 covered by these laws. All workers have the right to complain
 to the Labor Ministry, whose officials are accessible to any
 grievant, and an effort is made to investigate all complaints.
 The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which oversees worker
 compensation, is, however, chronically understaffed and
 underbudgeted so that complaints and compensation claims are
 chronically backlogged.
 
 
 1634
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 Foreign nationals from Pakistan, India, the Philippines,
 Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka continue to seek work in the UAE in
 large numbers.
 There are many complaints that recruiters in the country of
 origin use unscrupulous tactics and entice foreign manual
 laborers and domestics to the UAE on the basis of false salary
 and benefits promises. Such cases may be appealed to the Labor
 Ministry and, if this does not resolve the issue, to the
 courts. However, many laborers are reluctant to protest or to
 engage in such a lengthy process because of fear of reprisals
 by their employers. Also, domestics and agricultural laborers
 are not covered by the UAE's Labor Code, which makes
 enforcement of their complaints more difficult. A foreign
 worker ihust get permission from the previous employer to move
 to a new job with a different employer.
