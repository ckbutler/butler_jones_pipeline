 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 A member of the Commonwealth of Nations, St. Vincent and the
 Grenadines is a parliamentary democracy with an established
 tradition of respect for the rights of the individual. After
 defeating the incumbent St. Vincent Labor Party in 1984
 elections, James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Party won
 all 15 parliamentary seats in general elections held in May
 1989. Although some concern was voiced about the absence of
 any parliamentary opposition, the elections were judged to be
 free and fair.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the
 country, includes a Coast Guard and a small Special Service
 Unit with some paramilitary training. The force is controlled
 by and responsive to the civilian Government and maintains
 traditions of professionalism that place a high value on
 respect for human rights.
 One of the poorer countries in the region, St. Vincent has a
 very young population, a relatively high rate of illiteracy,
 and serious unemployment problems. After several major
 setbacks in recent years (primarily due to poor weather), the
 nation's economy, centered on the vital banana industry, has
 largely recovered. Banana exports boomed during the first
 half of 1989, leveling off thereafter. The manufacturing
 sector suffered in 1990 from the closing of three factories
 and the loss of a substantial number of jobs.
 The country's human rights record remained good in 1990.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment are prohibited by the Constitution,
 and there were no reports of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary'Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 According to the Constitution, persons detained for criminal
 offenses must be provided legal representation and have their
 cases reviewed promptly. In most instances, cases are heard
 within a week. The Government strictly adheres to these
 provisions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides, for public trials before an
 independent and impartial court. Criminal defendants are
 
 
 765
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 entitled to select their own legal counsel; alternatively,
 counsel may be provided by the court. Defendants are presumed
 innocent until proven guilty and may appeal cases to a
 regional high court system and ultimately to the Privy Council
 in London. There are no separate security or military court
 systems.
 -f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or
 other government intrusions into the private life of
 individual citizens, and there were no reports of such abuses.
 Section I Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. There are two major newspapers and numerous smaller,
 partisan publications; all are privately owned, and most are
 openly critical of the Government's policies. In general, the
 Government does not censor or otherwise interfere with the
 operation of the press. In 1990, however, the Government
 withdrew its own-advertisements and official notices from the
 country's leading newspaper to protest its critical treatment
 of government officials. In 1988 the government-owned radio
 station canceled a program that the Government considered
 provocative; the station, with the Government's approval,
 agreed late in 1989 to reinstate the program, but, as of the
 end of 1990, the program had not been reinstated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are free to practice and proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Notwithstanding the New Democratic Party's clean sweep of all
 15 parliamentary seats in the May 1989 elections, St. Vincent
 has a genuine multiparty political system, with four active
 parties. In the last election the opposition garnered over 30
 per cent of the vote. Constitutionally, elections must be
 held at least every 5 years, by secret ballot, with universal
 suffrage.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often
 comment on human rights matters of local concern. The
 Government is responsive to public and private inquiries about
 its human rights practices. Until late 1989, the small
 Caribbean-wide human rights monitoring group CARICARE was
 based in St. Vincent. However, the organization moved to
 Trinidad for better access to transportation and communication
 facilities. One local organization, the St. Vincent Human
 Rights Association, closely monitors government and police
 activities, especially in the area of treatment of prisoners,
 publicizing any cases of abuse. In 1990 it published a
 booklet on the administration of justice in St. Vincent and
 the Grenadines which focused on police disciplinary problems
 and offered a number'of recommendations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under law
 regardless of race, sex, or religion, and the Government
 adheres to this provision. In 1989 the Government took a
 significant step forward in terms of wage scales for women by
 adopting a new minimum wage law calling for equal pay for
 equal work. The law went into effect during 1990.
 Violence against women occurs in St. Vincent, but there are no
 studies indicating its extent. Penalties for violent crimes
 against women are identical to those involving acts of assault
 perpetrated against men. For rape, depending on the magnitude
 of the offense and the age of the victim, the penalty is
 generally 10 or more years in prison. However, the House of
 Assembly in 1989 considered legislation specifically
 addressing penalties for violent acts against women, and
 subsequently agreed to the imposition of more severe penalties
 for acts of domestic violence; specific provisions of the new
 law were being worked out by the legislators at year's end.
 Although some victims of domestic violence such as wife
 beating are reluctant to press charges, women are increasingly
 willing to report such incidents to the police and the
 National Council of Women. The Government's Ministry of
 Education, Youth, and Women's affairs has a Women's Desk which
 assists the National Council of Women with seminars, training
 programs, and public relations. The Government provides some
 funding for the National Council of Women and has been
 supportive of radio call-in programs dealing with women's
 issues.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By law, Vincentians have the right to form unions, organize
 employees, and strike; these rights are generally respected in
 practice. Unions are independent of the Government and of
 political parties. Somewhat more than 15 percent of the labor
 force is unionized. No new unions were formed in 1990.
 Unions are free to form federations and confederations and to
 affiliate with international labor bodies. Only two trade
 
 
 767
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 union internationals had affiliates in St. Vincent in 1990:
 two unions are affiliated with the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions, and one, the National Workers Movement
 (NWM), is affiliated with the Confederation of Latin American
 Workers, the regional body of the World Confederation of
 Labor. St: Vincent has no legislation that prohibits forming
 union association. However, some companies offer packages of
 benefits with terms of employment which make unionization less
 attractive; the company package is better or comparable to
 what the union can offer.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no legal obstacles to organizing unions; however,
 employerd are not legally bound to recognize a particular
 union as an exclusive bargaining agent. During 1990, port
 workers engaged in negotiations aimed at changing their union
 affiliation. The Government acted strictly as an observer in
 these talks.- The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by
 employers against union members and organizers. Generally
 effective mechanisms exist for resolving complaints. In 1990
 the NWM, in a lengthy strike action, effectively shut down a
 restaurant which attempted to prevent its personnel from
 joining a union. According to a government -official, the
 matter was resolved, although the union was not recognized at
 the restaurant and no poll of the employees was taken. At
 year's end some former employees were still pressing for
 severance pay rather than reinstatement, but the union had
 ceased its efforts to secure recognition.
 There are no export processing or free zones in St. Vincent.
 Union organizing and collective bargaining is not legally or
 administratively discouraged in any productive sector of the
 Vincentian economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and-does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 By law 15 years is the minimum working age. This provision,
 which is monitored and enforced by the Ministry of Labor's
 Labor Inspection Office, is generally respected in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislation concerning the length of the workweek;
 however, the general practice is to work 40 hours in 5 days,
 before earning overtime.. Workers are guaranteed a minimum
 annual vacation of 2 weeks. Minimum wages, which are set by
 law for economic sectors, were raised substantially in
 1989-the first increase in the minimum wage since 1982. The
 main increase was in the small manufacturing sector, where
 daily-rates almost doubled from $3.85 to $7.40. No
 significant pay raises went into effect in 1990. In many
 sectors the minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for workers and their families, but most
 workers earn more than the minimum. According to the Ministry
 of Labor, legislation concerning occupational safety and
 health is very old. The Factories Act of 1955 has some
 regulations concerning only factories, but-even there
 enforcement is ineffective due to a lack of inspectors.

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 Employers report some on-the-job accidents, but many go
 unreported. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Labor
 states that a more comprehensive Safety and Health Act,
 modeled on the 1987 National Insurance Scheme Act, is being
 drafted and is expected to be in place within 2 years.
