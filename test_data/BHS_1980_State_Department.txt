 BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a democracy. Its political and legal
 traditions are similar to those of Great Britain and
 the United States. The governmental structure is
 patterned after that of Great Britian, with a prime
 minister, a cabinet, a parliament, an independent
 judiciary and national and local elections.
 The Bahamas has a dominant political party, the Progres-
 sive Liberal Party (PLP), which won independence for
 the country in 1973 without violence. Before indepen-
 dence the same party led the country for seven years
 of internal self-government. It has grown stronger
 over the years and now holds 31 of the 38 seats in
 parliament. Two small opposition parties to the right
 of the PLP hold the other seven seats. Two minor parties,
 the workers party and vanguard, are on the left, but
 have no seats. The PLP has used its authority and
 power of office to strengthen its political position
 and, conversely, to weaken the opposition through
 selective political appointments.
 The Bahamas continues to be seriously tested by the
 continued influx of illegal aliens, principally Haitians,
 but has for the most part maintained a reasonable,
 humane approach while insisting upon its sovereign
 right to repatriate illegals to their country of origin.
 Despite occasional instances in which the government
 has felt it necessary to employ non-lethal forcible
 methods, the repatriation of illegal Haitians has
 been orderly and within the framework of a Bahamas/Haiti
 repatriation agreement.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by Chapter III, Article 17 of
 the constitution and is not practiced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment or punishment is prohibited by the
 same provision of the constitution. There continue
 to be occasional reports that the police use excessive
 force when making arrests. The judiciary has reprimanded
 police officers when allegations appear to have founda-
 tior' in fact.
 Capital punishment is permitted by law and 3 persons
 were executed in 1979. Corporal punishment is not
 administered. Prison conditions are austere. The
 downtown Nassau holding cells, where persons can be
 confined 48 hours or more while awaiting preliminary
 hearing, are small, crowded and unsanitary. The similiar
 womens' institution appears to be less austere and
 more modern.
 c. Disappearances
 
 
 341
 There are no cases of abduction, secret arrests or
 clandestine detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited.
 There are no political prisoners.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public. The constitution entitles
 defendants to counsel, and access is freely permitted.
 The judiciary is independent of executive control.
 There are no military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is safeguarded by custom, law
 and tradition, and is respected in practice. The
 constitution permits searches to occur only with a
 warrant issued by a court.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education.
 According to World Bank statistics, the Bahamas, with
 a population of 242,000, has a per capita annual income
 of $3,450. If expatriates resident in the Bahamas
 are excluded frbm the calculations, the per capita
 income is around $2,000. The literacy rate is 93
 percent, and life expectancy is 66.8 years. Housing,
 health care, and education standards are generally
 adequate, although improvement is needed. The govern-
 ment and the ruling PLP emphasize the need for social
 programs, but expenditures in these areas are relatively
 low. There is no income tax and import duties provide
 60 percent of public revenue. Most of the balance
 comes from license fees and property taxes. The tax
 structure is not, therefore, progressive.
 A population growth rate estimated at approximately
 3.9 percent has resulted in increasing numbers reaching
 working age without a concomitant expansion of job
 opportunities. Estimates of unemployment, particularly
 heavy among Bahamian youth, range up to 30 percent
 of the work force.
 Government policy is to assist Bahamians desiring
 to own their own property, improve their education
 and health, enhance their living standards and well-
 being and engage in work which provides adequate renume-
 ration under fair conditions. Health care is a priority
 area of concern. Education is undergoing considerable
 restructuring with a new emphasis on the teaching
 of technical skills. The standard of living remains
 relatively good although some erosion is taking place
 due to inflationary pressures. The government has
 embarked on a policy of land reform intended to ensure
 that larger numbers of Bahamians will have the opportunity
 to own their own land and that development will take
 place on land owned by foreigners in such a way as
 to be beneficial to Bahamians. Women play a major
 role in the economy, especially in the tourist industry.
 Positions are more numerous on the two most populated
 islands, New Providence and Grand Bahama, but the
 
 
 342
 government is seeking to strengthen the economies
 of the other islands by encouraging agricultural produc-
 tion, fishing and tourism. These are long-term develop-
 ment programs which have only limited impact at the
 present time. Consequently, there continues to be
 emigration from the other islands to both New Providence
 and Grand Bahama.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 There is full freedom in all of these areas. Labor
 unions are active and are free to organize, bargain
 and strike.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is full freedom in all of these areas. A particu-
 lar problem of continuing and serious concern for
 the government is that of Haitian refugees. Attention
 was focused on this problem in October when the govern-
 ment received adverse publicity for using police officers
 to remove over 100 shipwrecked Haitians from Cayo
 Lobo for return to Haiti. Estimates of the number
 of Haitian illegals varies from 20-40,000. The govern-
 ment seeks to repatriate to Haiti all those who have
 illegally entered the country. The Haitian government
 however, has a complex and time-consuming procedure
 for identifying its nationals before they are permitted
 to return. The Bahamian government published an announce-
 ment of a 90 day amnesty during which illegal residents
 had to either regularize their status in the Bahamas,
 leave voluntarily, or be subject to arrest and repatria-
 tion.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political process is open to all sectors of the
 society. Notwithstanding the transfer of political
 power from the white elite to a black majority, Bahamian
 whites continue to play an active role in the political
 process, both elective and appointive. White Bahamians
 hold high-level civil service and political posts,
 including four members of parliament. Legally and
 in practice.women enjoy equal status. Several elective
 offices, including president of the Senate, are held
 by women. Key judicial and civil service posts are
 held by women. Women are represented in the professional
 and private sectors. The president of the Chamber
 of Commerce, for instance, is a woman.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Participation by the Bahamas in international organiza-
 tions and activities is limited by its representational
 resources. There have been no requests to investigate
 human rights conditions in the Bahamas.
