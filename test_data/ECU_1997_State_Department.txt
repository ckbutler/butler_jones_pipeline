 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and an 82-member unicam-
 eral legislature chosen in free elections. Interim President Fabian Alarcon was elect-
 ed by Congress to an 18-month term in February after Congress voted to dismiss
 his predecessor on the grounds of "mental incompetence." Congress also has sweep-
 ing powers to question and censure cabinet ministers; such censure results in auto-
 matic dismissal of the minister in question and often is used as a political tool by
 opposition party congressmen. Members of the Supreme Court preside over a judici-
 ary that is constitutionally independent, but in practice susceptible to outside pres-
 sure.
 The military enjoys substantial autonomy, reinforced by guaranteed revenues
 from the nation's oil exports, as well as from civil aviation, shipping, and other com-
 mercial sectors. The military has maintained a low profile in domestic politics since
 the return to constitutional rule in 1979. The National Police, responsible for domes-
 tic law enforcement and maintenance of internal order, falls under the civilian Min-
 istry of Government and Police. There continued to be credible allegations of human
 rights abuses by the police and, in some isolated cases, members of the military.
 The economy is based on private enterprise, although there continued to be heavy
 government involvement in key sectors such as petroleum, utilities, and aviation.
 The per capita gross domestic product of $1,669 provides most of the population
 with a low standard of living. The inflation rate for the year was 30 percent. The
 principal exports are oil, bananas, and shrimp, which are the country's leading
 sources of foreign exchange. Manufacturing for regional export markets is of grow-
 ing importance. Most citizens are employed in the urban informal sector or as rural
 agricultural workers; rural poverty is extensive, and underemployment is high.
 The most fundamental human rights abuse stems from shortcomings in the politi-
 cized, inefficient, and corrupt legal and judicia1 system. People are subject to arbi-
 trary arrest; once incarcerated, they may wait years before being convicted or ac-
 quitted unless they pay bribes. More than one-half the prisoners in jail have not
 been formally sentenced. Other human rights abuses included isolated instances of
 extrajudicial killings; torture and other mistreatment of prisoners and detainees by
 the police; poor prison conditions; and violence and pervasive discrimination against
 women, Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people. The Government failed to pros-
 ecute and punish human rights abusers. Following a referendum in May that called
 for the Supreme Court to be depoliticized, and in response to continued public de-
 mands for profound reform of the justice system, Congress replaced the entire
 Court, selecting the justices from a list of candidates nominated by designated civic
 groups and chosen by a panel of civic leaders. The Truth and Justice Commission
 was no longer active; an Ombudsman was chosen, but had not yet begun work by
 year's end.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. There continued to be credible reports of police involvement in
 extrajudicial killings. Through late September, the Ecumenical Committee for
 Human Rights (CEDHU) reported a total of nine extrajudicial killings. Seven of
 these involved individuals killed by police in pursuit of criminals; two involved sus-
 pects who died of injuries after being arrested by police.
 In January three prisoners charged with killing policemen "escaped" from the
 penitentiary in Guayaquil. A television news team filmed police recapturing all
 three alive and then showed one of them, who had been wounded by a gunshot to
 the leg, being beaten by police as he was put into a police truck while the other
 two were shown in handcuffs in police custody. The wounded prisoner was declared
 dead on arrival at a local hospital. Later television footage showed the dead bodies
 of the other two prisoners being loaded into a police vehicle. Despite video evidence
 that all three were recaptured alive, the police claimed that they were all shot while
 escaping. Police officials promised an internal investigation of the killings, but did
 not report publicly the results of the police inquiry. At year's end, no one had been
 charged with wrongdoing.
 InMarch police in the town of Machala, responding to a disturbance call at a bar,
 arrested an inebriated patron, Anibal Aguas. Aguas was beaten and taken into cus-
 tody. Later that night his wife was notified that he had died of a cerebral injury
 that an autopsy showed was caused by trauma. The authorities later detained one
 of two police sergeants involved in Aguas' arrest and remanded him to a police court
 
 
 506
 for a disciplinary investigation. The other failed to answer a summons and was a
 fugitive at year's end.
 In Chimborazo province the police stopped Mario Garcia in March and after a
 verbal exchange, severely beat him, according to several witnesses. Garcia aed sev-
 eral days later from trauma-induced brain damage. The authorities detained three
 police officer, and the case was before a civilian judge in Chimborazo at year's end.
 Tn August Guyaquil police shot and killed three men after mistaking them for
 wanted criminals. Police officials first claimed that the suspects had died in a fire-
 fight; then, after days of public protests led by the victims' families, the National
 Police Inspector General disclosed that police had planted evidence on the three
 men to cover up the mistake. As a result, the police commander in Guayas province
 was relieved of his duties and the policemen involved were suspended from duty
 pending disciplinary action.
 In October 1996, a Quito court ordered the arrest of police sergeant Ulvio Munoz
 in the killing of a 16-year-old in the La Toja neighborhood during a drug raid in
 September of that year. Charges against him were still under consideration at year's
 end.
 Investigation by judicial officials and human rights monitors of sites identified in
 1996 by a former policeman as clandestine graves did not reveal any human re-
 mains.
 There were also instances in which citizens took the law into their own hands,
 leading to mob violence that resulted in deaths (see Section I.e.). Despite a police
 program launched-in 1996 to crack down on such violence, there were continued re-
 ports of vigilante justice, often involving indigenous communities acting against pre-
 sumed criminals in their own community. In one particularly egregious case, on Au-
 gust 10 approximately 200 indigenous villagers in the province of Cotopaxi watched
 as some of their neighbors burned a 17-year-old boy caught stealing cattle. After he
 was set afire, someone in the crowd killed him with a pistol shot.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 In January Angel Heriberto Hinojoza was stopped in Pichincha province by three
 men, one in a police uniform; he attempted to flee, but was shot in the leg and
 taken away in the trunk of an unmarked car. Presented with a writ of habeas cor-
 pus, the police told family members that they had no information on Hinojoza's
 whereabouts. The family continued to press without success for news about
 Hinojoza.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits torture and similar forms of intimidation and punish-
 ment, police continued to physically mistreat suspects and prisoners, usually with
 impumty. The CEDHU regularly published detailed reports on suspects who
 charged the police with torture. In these reports the CEDHU frequently named po-
 lice officials alleged to be responsible and often included photographs of the victims
 with their wounds. In most cases, the police appeared to have abused such persons
 during investigations of ordinary street crime. According to the CEDHU and other
 human rights organizations, the victims reported that the police beat them, burned
 them with cigarettes, applied electric shocks, or threatened them psychologically.
 The law permits police or military courts to try police officers and military defend-
 ants in closed sessions, in accordance with the respective military and police court
 martial manuals. Only the Supreme Court may try cases involving flag-rank offi-
 cers. The police court does not announce verdicts or punishments, creating the
 strong impression that the police are immune from prosecution.
 Conditions in detention centers generally continued to be poor. Prisons in the
 tropical coastal areas tend to be worse than those in the temperate highlands. Over-
 crowding is a chronic problem, although conditions are notably better in the wom-
 en's prison in Quito than in other facilities. As of September, about 9,850 male pris-
 oners were crowded into prisons designed to hold 5,049. The Government announced
 a major campaign to reduce prison crowding by building more prisons, ensuring that
 prisoners eligible for release were released, and by pardoning prisoners over the age
 of 65 or who have terminal disorders. There are no separate facilities for hard-core
 or dangerous criminals, nor are there effective rehabilitation programs.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and the Penal Code
 provide that no one may be deprived of liberty without a written order from a gov-
 ernmental authority, but the authorities often violated these legal protections
 against arbitrary arrest or detention. By law, the authorities must issue specific
 written orders within 24 hours of detention-even in cases in which a suspect is
 caught in the act of committing a crime-and must charge the suspect with a spe-
 cific criminal offense within 48 hours of arrest. All detained persons may challenge
 the legality of their detention within 48 hours of their arrest, but in practice few
 
 
 507
 such petitions are brought. This review is conducted by the senior elected official
 (usually the mayor) of  e locality in which the suspect is held. Regardless of the
 legality of a detention, a prisoner may be released only by ourt order. In some
 cases, detainees who are unaware of this, or who do not have the funds to hire a
 lawyer, may remain in prison for an extended period before being released. Bail is
 not generally available, and the law prohibits it in narcotics cases. Families of de-
 tainees sometimes intervene in an attempt to secure the prisoners' freedom through
 illegal means.
 Human rights organizations reported occasional cases of incommunicado deten-
 tion, although the law prohibits this practice. Despite provisions of the Penal Code,
 the police ofen detained suspects without the required written order. Even when
 an order was obtained, those charged with determining the validity of detention
 often allowed frivolous charges to be brought, either because they were overworked
 or because the accuser bribed them. In many instances, the systm was used as a
 means of harassment in civil cases in which one party sought to have the other ar-
 rested on criminal charges. The authorities frequently detained suspects longer than
 24 hours before court orders were signed and often failed to bring charges against
 suspects within 48 hours of arrest. Preventive detention up to and including trial
 is legal under certain circumstances.
 The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled unanimously on November 12
 that the Government had violated due process provisions under the American Con-
 vention on Human Rights and Ecuadorian law in connection with the arrest, inves-
 tigation, and pretrial detention of Ivan Suarez Rsero. Without considering the mer-
 its of the drug charge against Suarez, the Court found unlawful Suarez's 4-year pre-
 ventive detention without a finding of guilt. The Court also held that a section of
 the Penal Code, which exempts those charged with drug violations from protection
 of a law that mandates otherprisoners' release from excessive detention, violated
 the Convention. The Court called on the Government to pay Suarez compensation
 and to prosecute those responsible for violatinghis rights.
 The    verment does not use exile as a method of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. In practice, however, the judiciary is susceptible to outside pressure.
 The regular court system tries most nonmilitary defendants, although some indig-
 enous groups try members independently for violations of tribal rules. Despite ef-
 forts begun in 1992 to depoliticize and modernize the court system, the judiciary
 continues to operate slowly and inconsistently. Judges reportedly rendered decisions
 more quickly or more slowly depending on political pressure or the payment of
 bribes.However, the norm is for lengthy delays before cases come to the courts.
 The May referendum approved by citizens included a call to depoliticize the judi-
 cial system and, in particular, the Supreme Court. In September Congress dismissed
 all 31 justices (many of them chosen during ousted president Bucaram's incum-
 bency), and elected new ones in early October. The 31 new justices were chosen from
 a group of 54 candidates compiled by an independent panel in a complex process
 intended to balance political and social interests.
 The failure of the justice system led to a growing number of cases of communities
 taking the law into their own hands. There continued to be reports of fatal
 lynchings and burnings of suspected criminals by enraged citizens (see Section L.a.).
 These occurred particularly in indigenous communities and poor neighborhoods of
 the major cities where there is little police presence. One of the most dramatic cases
 occurred in July in the town of Mana, Cotopaxi province, when an angry crowd
 stopped a police vehicle transporting a group of five alleged car thieves and, after
 wresting them from police custody, beat them to death and burned their bodies. The
 thieves reportedly had killed an individual in the course of stealing his car only
 days earlier, and the family of the victim and other townspeople ambushed the po-
 lice escort to exact their own justice.
 The law provides for internationally accepted due process rights for criminal de-
 fendants, but the authorities often did not observe these rights in practice. By law,
 the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and defendants have the right
 to a public trial, defense attorneys, and appeal. They may present evidence, refuse
 to testify against themselves, and may confront and cross-examine witnesses. Al-
 though a public defender system exists, in practice there are relatively few attorneys
 available to defend the large number of indigent suspects.
 The legislature amended the Constitution in 1995 to stipulate that no testimony
 taken from a prisoner may be used as evidence in court unless the individual's law-
 yer was present at the taking of testimony. Implementing legislation, however, re-
 mains to be passed.
 Trial is supposed to begin within 15 to 60 days of the initial arrest, but in prac-
 tice, initiation of the trial phase can take years. Less than 40 percent of all pris-
 
 
 508
 oners have been convicted and sentenced. In narcotics cases, unlike other crimes
 the law prohibits bail and stipulates that a police report and the defendant's pretrial
 statement constitute "a grave presumption of guilt' if supported by the facts of the
 case. The effect is to increase the number of defendants detained on such charges
 pending final resolution of their cases. In December the Constitutional Court ruled
 both provisions unconstitutional, but the impact on narcotics cases (40 percent of
 prisoners are detained on narcotics charges) was not clear at year's end. Indigenous
 people and other minorities are disproportionately affected by these delays as they
 are more likely to be poor and unable to buy their way out of pretrial detention.
 A foreign assistance program begun in 1994 has enabled the courts to computerize
 the National Register of Prisoners. Use of this system made it possible for the courts
 to track prisoners' status more easily. Since its inception, the courts released over
 1,000 prisoners, who had either completed their sentences or who had never been
 tried but had served the maximum sentence for the alleged crime.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 and the authorities generally respected this provision in practice, but with some no-
 table exceptions. There are frequent charges of slander and libel brought by and
 against public figures, but few result in final decisions or judicial relief. One former
 independent congressman was accused of treason and brought before a military
 court because of his criticism of the military. He successfully appealed to the Su-
 preme Court for relief, winning a decision that he could not be tried in a military
 court.
 All of the major media organs-television, newspapers, and radio-are in local,
 private hands except for two government-owned radio stations. The law limits for-
 eign investment in broadcast media. Using a law (promulgated by the last military
 regime) that requires the media to give the Government free space or air time, the
 Government can and does require television and radio to broadcast government-pro-
 duced programs featuring the President and other top administration officials.
 There is a free and vigorous press. Ownership of the media is broad based, and
 editorials represent a wide range of political views and often criticize the Govern-
 ment. However, some degree of self-censorship in the print media occurs, particu-
 larly with respect to politically sensitive issues or stories about the military and its
 related industries.
 The Government does not interfere in issues involving academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of free assembly and association for peaceful purposes, and the Govern-
 ment generally respected these rights in practice. Public rallies require prior govern-
 ment permits, which are generally granted, although exceptions occur. Numerous
 labor and student demonstrations took place without incident in the capital and the
 outlying regions. In general the security forces intervened in demonstrations only
 when there was violence against bystanders or property. During 2 days of wide-
 spread road blockages by groups demanding that theNational Assembly to consider
 constitutional amendments be elected and begin work in 1997, there were no reports
 of serious injuries resulting from confrontations between protesters, the military,
 and the police.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Numerous foreign religious orders and
 missionary groups are active.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humamtarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees. The issue of provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of
 forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Since the return to civilian rule
 in 1979, citizens have actively exercised their right to change their national and
 local governments. In February following widespread peaceful protests against the
 
 
 509
 Government, Congress voted to remove former President Bucaram on grounds of
 mental incompetence and to replace him with interim President Alarcon. Voters
 overwhelmingly ratified this peaceful transition in a May referendum that also
 called for a National Assembly to reform the Constitution prior to new presidential
 and congressional elections in May 1998.
 Voting is mandatory for literate citizens over 18 years of age and voluntary for
 illiterate citizens. The law does not permit active duty members of the military to
 vote. The Constitution bars members of the clergy and active duty military person-
 nel from election to Congress, the presidency, or vice presidency.
 On November 30, voters elected the 70 members of the new National Assembly,
 which is charged with a broad mandate to undertake political reforms. The makeup
 of the Assembly is similar to that of the Congss; the established parties won 54
 seats, and coalitions will be necessary in order to reach decisions. The Assembly
 convened on December 20 and elected former president Osvaldo Hurtado as its
 president. He said that the Assembly would tackle electoral reform first, and then
 turn to other issues such as modernization of the state, social security reform, and
 the promotion of foreign investment.
 Traditional elites tend to be self-perpetuating. Consequently, very few women,
 Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people are found in high positions in government,
 although no specific laws prevent women or minorities from attaining leadership po-
 sitions. Women hold 5 of 82 seats in Congress. In August Congress elected Alexan-
 dra Vela as the first female vice president of Congress in the country's history; how-
 ever, she resigned soon thereafter in order to run successfully for the National As-
 sembly, to which eight women were elected. One Afro-Ecuadorian serves as an alter-
 nate member of Congress and one was elected to the National Assembly, but there
 are no other Afro-Ecuadorians in any senior level government jobs.
 The indigenous movement, which long shunned traditional politics, formed an
 electoral movement called Pachakutik (which means "cataclysmic change" in
 Quichua) and ran candidates for national, provincial, and local office in the 1996
 elections. Pachakutik succeeded in electing a member of congress, seven provincial
 deputies, and mayors of several cities, including Cuenca-the third largest city. Al-
 though Pachakutik received only about 8 percent of the vote nationwide, its rep-
 resentation in Congress and at the provincial and municipal level assures the indig-
 enous community a greater voice in government. It won seven seats in the new Na-
 tional Assembly, three of which are held by indigenous leaders, including one
 woman. Pachakutik's success also forced traditional political parties to focus atten-
 tion on issues of importance to the indigenous population-long neglected by the po-
 litical process.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups, both domestic and international, operate with-
 out restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.
 Domestic human rights groups, such as the CEDHU and the Regional Latin Amer-
 ican Human Rights Association (ALDHU), were outspoken in their criticism of the
 Government's record on specific cases. Nevertheless, the Government contracted
 with the ALDHU to provide human rights training to the military and the police.
 The Truth and Justice Commission, established in 1996 to investigate reports of
 past rights abuse, is no longer active. The office of Ombudsman was created to en-
 sure ongoing attention to human rights issues. The elected Ombudsman resigned
 following a dispute with Congress over his term of office. By year's end, Congress
 had not accepted his resignation, nor had he begun to work.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or social
 status. However, women, Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people face significant
 discrimination.
 Women.-Although the law prohibits violence against women, including within
 marriage, it is a widespread practice. Many rapes go unreported because of the vic-
 tims' reluctance to confront the perpetrators. Women may only fMle complaints
 against a rapist or an abusive spouse or companion if they produce a witness. If
 a victim later marries her rapist, the victim often drops her complaint, and the
 State's case against the rapist continues slowly, if at all. While some communities
 have established their own centers for counseling and legal support of abused
 women, the Government only began to address this question seriously with the for-
 mation of the "Comisaria de Ia Mujer," or Women's Bureau, in 1994. Although this
 
 
 office can accept complaints about abuse of women, it has no authority to act on
 them.
 A 1995 Law Against Violence Affecting Women and Children, drafted by a coali-
 tion of women's organizations, criminalizes spousal abuse for the first time, includ-
 ing physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. It also creates family courts and re-
 forms the Penal Code to give courts the power to separate an abusive spouse from
 the home.
 Discrimination against women is pervasive in society, particularly with respect to
 educational and economic opportunities for those in the lower economic strata. The
 increasingly active women's movement blames culture and tradition for inhibiting
 achievement of full equality for women. There are fewer women in the professions
 and skilled trades than men, and pay discrimination against women is common.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to the welfare of children
 but has not taken effective steps to promote it. The Government rarely enforces the
 constitutional requirement of education through the age of 14.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children. Government resources to
 assist children have traditionally been limited, although it instituted a program to
 care for the children of the working poor called "Operation Child Rescue." Several
 Urivate organizations are very active in programs to assist street children, and the
 . Childrenas Fund also runs a program in conjunction with the Central Bank.
 Especially in urban areas, the children of the poor often experience severe hard-
 shi~p. It is common to see children as young as 5 or 6 years of age selling news-
 papers or candy on the street to support themselves or to augment the family in-
 come. Also, there are instances of prostitution by girls under 18 years of age in
 urban areas. In rural areas, young children often must leave school at an early age
 to help out on the family's plot of land.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no official discrimination against disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. However,
 there are no laws to guarantee disabled people access to-public buildings or services,
 nor are they provided any other special government assistance.
 Indigenous People.-While at least 85 ercent of all citizens claim some indige-
 nous heritage, culturally indigenous people make up about 15 to 20 percent of the
 total population. The vast majority of these people live in rural areas, and most live
 in varying degrees of poverty. Land is scarce in the more heavily populated highland
 areas where high infant mortality, malnutrition, and epidemic disease are also com-
 mon. In addition, electricity and potable water are often unavailable. Although the
 rural education system is seriously deficient, many indigenous groups participated
 actively with the Ministry of Education in the development of-the bilingual edu-
 cation program used in rural public schools.
 Indigenous people enjoy the same civil and political rights as other citizens and
 also have several special privileges designed to allow them to manage their own af-
 fairs within their own commumties. This is particularly true in the Amazon area
 where indigenous groups have claim to specific tracts of land. These groups also
 have begun to play an active role in decisionmaking with respect to the use of their
 lands for oil exploration and production, by lobbying the Government and enlisting
 the help of foreign nongovernmental organizations. Environmental groups and in-
 digenous organizations continued to blame oil companies for causing major environ-
 mental damage and to criticize their damage control efforts as insufficient.
 Despite their growing political influence (see Section 3) and the efforts of grass-
 roots community groups, which were increasingly successful in pressuring the
 central Government to assist them, Indians continue to suffer discrimination at
 many levels of society. In an August beauty pageant in the predominantly Indian
 town of Otavalo, young women of indigenous background were denied participation
 in the contest based on their Indian heritage. Even after this discrimination re-
 ceived national attention in the press (and a court had ruled the practice illegal the
 year before), organizers of the event refused to admit contestants of Indian back-
 ground.
 National Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Thepopulation of the rural, northern coastal
 area includes large numbers of Afro-Ecuadorian citizens. They suffer widespread
 poverty and pervasive discrimination, particularly with regard to educational and
 economic opportunity. There were no special government efforts to address these
 problems.
 There are five major Afro-Ecuadorian organizations active in the country; they es-
 timate that Afro-Ecuadorians account for 700,000 people, or about 6 percent of the
 total population. While the presence of Afro-Ecuadorians has grown in the fields of
 sports and culture (the country's most prominent soccer stars and 1996 Miss Ecua-
 dor were Afro-Ecuadorian), educational opportunities continue to be limited.
 
 
 The press has focused on lingering racism among all strata of society. Afro-Ecua-
 dorian organizations note that despite the absence of official discrimination, societal
 discrimination continues to affect them. For example, they assert that the police
 stop Afro-Ecuadorians for document checks with greater frequency than other citi-
 zens.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and Labor Code provide most
 workers with the right to form trade unions. Members of the police and the military,
 and public sector employees in nonrevenue producing entities are not free to form
 trade unions. The 1991 Labor Code reforms raised the number of workers required
 for an establishment to be unionized from 15 to 30, which the International Labor
 Organization's Committee on Freedom of Association considered too stringent a limi-
 tation at the plant workers' council level.
 While employees of state-owned organizations enjoy rights similar to those in the
 private sector, the law technically prevents the majority ofpublic sector employees
 from jominguions or exercising collective bargaining rights. Nevertheless, most
 public employees maintain membership in some labor organization, and there are
 frequent illegal" strikes. Despite official threats, the Government rarely takes ac-
 tion against striking public workers. In November Congress approved constitutional
 reforms that outlaw strikes that paralyze key p ublic services, including schools. Al-
 though the five umbrella organizations are politically independent, the two largest
 single labor unions, the Teachers' Union and the Union of Social Security Workers,
 are allied with the Democratic Political Movement, a far-left socialist party.
 Approximately 12 percent of the work force is organized. There are four large
 labor centrals or confederations, three of which maintain international affiliations.
 None of the main labor centrals is firmly connected to any one political party, and
 there are no ties between the Government and any labor union.
 There are few restrictions on the right of workers to strike, although a 10-day
 cooling-off period is required before a strike is declared. The Labor Code revisions
 limit solidarity strikes or boycotts to 3 days, provided that they are approved by the
 Labor Ministry. In a legal strike, workers may take possession of the factory or
 workplace, thus ending production at the site, and receive police protection during
 the takeover. The employer must pay all salaries and benefits during a legal strike;
 the Labor Code protects strikers andtheir leaders from retaliation. The on  signifi-
 cant strikes were by public sector employees such as teachers, social security, and
 medical workers. None of the strikes resulted in violence.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor market is highly
 segmented, with a minority of workers in skilled, usually unionized, positions in
 state-run enterprises or in medium to large industries. Most of the economically ac-
 tive population is employed in the agricultural sector or the urban informal sector;
 the vast majority of these workers are not organized. The Labor Code requires that
 all private employers with 30 or more workers belonging to a union must negotiate
 collectively when the union so requests. Although approximately 12 percent of the
 work force is organized, collective bargaining agreements cover only one-quarter of
 these workers.
 The Labor Code streamlined the bargaining process in state enterprises by requir-
 ing workers to be represented by one labor union only. It prohibits discrimination
 against unions and requires that employers provide space for union activities upon
 the union's request. The law does not permit employers to dismiss a worker without
 the express permission of the Ministry of Labor, whose rulings are not subject to
 judicial review. If the Ministry of Labor rules that a dismissal is unjustified, it can
 require the employer to pay large indemnities or separation payments to the work-
 er, although the reforms set a capon such payments. The Labor Codeprovides for
 resolution of labor conflicts through an arbitration and conciliation board comprising
 one representative of the Ministry of Labor, two from the union, and two represent-
 atives of management.
 The Maquila (in bond) Law passed in 1990 permits the hiring of temporary work-
 ers for the maquila industries only. While there is no express prohibition on associa-
 tion rights in the Maquila Law, in practice it is difficult to organize temporary em-
 ployees on short-term contracts. Since temporary workers are not recogmzed by the
 2r Code, they do not enjoy the same level of protection offered to other workers.
 The maquila system allows a company and its property to become an export process-
 ing zone wherever it is located.  any such "zones" have thus been established; most
 are dedicated to textiles and fish processing.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit compulsory labor, and there were no reports of it in general, nor of
 forced or bonded labor by children.
 
 
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution establishes that children must attend school until 14 years of age. How-
 ever, because of the lack of schools in many rural communities and the need for chil-
 dren to work, this provision is rarely enforced. The law prohibits forced or bonded
 labor by children, and there were no reports of such practices (see Section 6.c.). The
 law prohibits persons younger than 14 years old from working, except in special cir-
 cumstances such as apprenticeships. It requires those between the ages of 14 and
 18 years to have the permission of their parent or guardian to work. The law pro-
 hibits children between the ages of 15 and 18 years from working more than 7 hours
 per day or 35 hours per week, and it restricts children below the age of 15 years
 to a maximum of 6 hours per day and 30 hours per week. In practice, the Ministry
 of Labor fails to enforce child labor laws. In rural areas many children attend school
 -only sporadically after about 10 years of age in order to contribute to household in-
 come as farm laborers. In the city many children under 14 years of age work in fam-
 ily-owned "businesses* in the informal sector, shining shoes, collecting and recycling
 garbage, or as street peddlers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor has the principal role
 in enforcing labor laws and carries this out through a corps of labor inspectors who
 are active in all 21 provinces. The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek, a
 15-day annual vacation, a minimum wage, and other employer-provided benefits,
 such as uniforms and training opportunities.
 The Ministry of Labor sets the minimum wage every 6 months in consultation
 with the Commission on Salaries, but Congress may also adjust it. The statutory
 minimum wage is not adequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. As of September, the minimum wage plus mandated bonuses provided
 a gross monthly compensation of approximately $160 (S(646,167). Most organized
 workers in state industries and formal sector private enterprises earned substan-
 tially more than the minimum wage and also received significant other benefits
 through collective bargaining agreements. The majority of workers, however, work
 in the large informal and rural sector without recourse to the minimum wage or le-
 gally mandated benefits.
 The Labor Code also provides general protection for workers' health and safety
 on the job. A worker may not leave the workplace of his own volition, even if there
 is a hazardous situation. The worker is allowed to request that an inspector from
 the Ministry of Labor come to the workplace and confirm the hazard; that inspector
 may then close down the workplace.
 The Government enforces health and safety standards and regulations through
 the Social Security Institute. In the formal sector, occupational health and safety
 is not a major problem. However, there are no specific regulations governing health
 and safety standards in the agricultural sector and, in practice, there is no enforce-
 ment of safety rules in the small mines that make up the vast majority of the min-
 ing sector.
