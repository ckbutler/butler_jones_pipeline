 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania regained its independence in 1991 after more than 50 years of Soviet
 occupation. A parliamentary democracy, Lithuania has a popularly elected unicam-
 eral legislature, the Seimas, a popularly elected President, who functions as Head
 of State, and a government formed by a Prime Minister and other ministers, ap-
 pointed by the President and approved by the Seimas. The Government exercises
 authority with the approval of the Seimas and the President. In the free and fair
 1992 parliamentary elections, the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party (LDDP)-the
 successor to the Communist Party of Lithuania, which in 1989 broke away from the
 Soviet Communist party-won a majority of seats and formed the Government. On
 February 14, voters elected Algirdas Brazauskas, the then chairman of the LDDP,
 as President.
 The security structure includes the military forces administered by the Ministry
 of Defense, the domestic police subordinate to the Interior Ministry, two regiments
 of militarized police subordinate to the Interior Ministry and responsible for main-
 taining prison security and public order, and a security service charged with inter-
 nal security. All forces stationed by the Soviet Union in Lithuania were withdrawn
 by the end of 1993.
 Lithuania is gradually transforming a centrally planned economy into a market-
 oriented system. Most housing and small businesses are now in private ownership,
 but large enterprises continue to be state owned. The Government has been unable
 thus far to stem the general economic deterioration characterized by a steady fall
 in industrial output, rising unemployment, and declining per capita income. Infla-
 tion, however, has come down significantly with the introduction of a stable national
 currency and the reduction of government deficits. Over 100,000 new private farm-
 ers cultivate over a third of the arable land.
 There is respect for basic freedoms and civil liberties. The preventive detention
 law, aimed at those suspected of violent criminal activity, extended the period of in-
 vestigative detention from 72 hours to 2 months. Although it was broadly hailed as
 a useful tool in dealing with gangs of criminals, its possible extension beyond Janu-
 ary 1, 1994, while generally popular, caused some concern that law enforcement offi-
 cials might abuse its provisions. Reform of the judicial system still awaits the con-
 
 
 956
 Fletion of civil and criminal procedure codes. The holding of elections in February
 or two district councils in areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Poles eased re-
 lations between Lithuanian authorities and the Polish community
 Lithuania was accepted as a full member of the Council of Europe on May 14,
 1993.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings by Lithuanian authorities in 1993. The local press did report one
 instance' of a man who died in police custody as a consequence of police brutality.
 Otherwise, media reporting of alleged police brutality has been scarce. The Ministry
 of Internal Affairs generally has een reluctant to publicize statistics on reported
 cases of police brutality.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions or disappearances caused
 by Lithuanian officials.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports that Lithuanian officials engaged in or condoned torture and
 other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The press has occa-
 sionally reported on police beatings of travelers passing through Lithuanian border
 crossings, which often are choked with thousands of motorists awaiting their turn
 to go through customs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-By law, police may detain a person for
 up to 72 hours based upon reliable evidence of criminal activity. At the end of that
 period, police must decide whether or not to make a formal arrest, and a warrant
 must be approved by a magistrate. The authorities have a total of 10 days to
 present supporting evidence. Once a suspect is formally charged, prosecutors may
 keep the suspect under investigative arrest for up to 2 months before taking the
 suspect to court. In exceptional cases, investigative arrest may be extended by a fur-
 ther 6 to 9 months with the written approval of the Procurator General. The right
 to an attorney is protected by the Constitution from the moment of detention.
 In an effort to cope with rapidly growing organized crime, Parliament passed in
 July a temporary law on preventive detention of persons suspected of being violent
 criminals; it extended the period of investigative detention from 72 hours to 2
 months. Those apprehended must be released after 2 months if an investigation
 does not lead to formal charges. Local police commissioners must obtain the Procu-
 rator General's approval of each arrest carried out under the provisions of this law.
 Lithuanian legislators voted in December to extend the temporary law for 1 addi-
 tional year. Several new provisions were attached to the July version of the law in
 an apparent effort to improve the legal rights of detainees. The authorities must
 now inform a suspect within 3 hours following arrest about the length of preventive
 detention, which may not exceed 2 months. Within 48 hours of the arrest, the de-
 tainee must be brought before a district judge, who must rule on whether the sus-
 pect had been lawfully detained. A suspect is legally guaranteed the right to consult
 with an attorney during the period of detention.
 Although the law is widely perceived as useful in tackling the organized crime
 problem, its provisions give law enforcement officials wide latitude in making arrest
 decisions and may be open to abuse.
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Lithuanian legal system is in a state of tran-
 sition from a Soviet to a democratic model. To date, progress towards judicial and
 legal reform has been limited. The judicial system consists of a two-tier structure
 of district courts and the Supreme Court, which hears appeals from the district
 courts. Court decisions are arrived at independently. The. Procurator General exer-
 cises an oversight responsibility through a network of local prosecutors who work
 with police investigators from the Ministry of Interior in preparing the prosecution's
 evidence for the courts. Jury trials are not used in Lithuania.
 A law reforming much of the structure and procedures of Lithuania's judicial sys-
 tem, scheduled to take effect in November 1992, was suspended, pending the com-
 pletion of new civil and criminal procedure codes. The new civil procedure code
 should be ready for parliamentary consideration in mid-1994.
 The newly created Constitutional Court began its deliberations in September. The
 Constitution specifies that the Constitutional Court shall settle disputes about the
 constitutionality of official acts of the Government, Parliament, and the courts. Only
 official bodies such as the Government, Parliament, and the courts may appeal deci-
 sions to the Constitutional Court, in contrast to the Supreme Court, which hears
 appeals involving private citizens and organizations.
 
 
 957
 The Constitution provides defendants with the right to counsel. Public defense at-
 torneys are routinely assigned to persons charged with serious offenses. Defendants
 also have the right to hire an attorney of their choice. In practice, the right to legal
 counsel is constricted by the shortage of trained lawyers-only about 340 registered
 lawyers practice in Lithuania-who reportedly find it difficult to cope with the esti-
 mated 40-percent rise over 1992 in criminal cases before the courts in 1993. Outside
 observers have recommended the establishment of a public defender system to regu-
 larize procedures for provision of legal assistance to indigent persons charged in
 criminal cases. By law, defense attorneys have access to government evidence and
 may present evidence and witnesses. Routine, written requests for evidence gen-
 erally are honored by the courts and law enforcement agencies. There were no politi-
 cal trials.
 Government rehabilitation of over 50,000 persons charged with anti-Soviet crimes
 during the Stalinist era led to reports in 1991 that some people alleged to have been
 involved in crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation ha benefited from
 this rehabilitation. Such rehabilitation clears the person of any wrongdoing during
 the Stalinist period and is essentially of moral significance. A special judicial proce-
 dure was established to examine each case in which an individual or organization
 raises an objection that a rehabilitated person may have committed a crime against
 humanity. In 1993 the Supreme Court overturned the rehabilitation of four persons
 whose cases were pending from 1992. The Procurator General has appealed to the
 Supreme Court to annul the rehabilitation of an additional three persons suspected
 of committing war crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The au-
 thorities do not engage in indiscriminate or widespread monitoring of the cor-
 respondence or communications of citizens. With the written authorization of the
 Procurator General, however, law enforcement and national security agencies may
 engage in surveillance and monitoring activities on grounds of national security.
 The evidence collected in this way must be regularly submitted to a parliamentary
 committee for review and approval. Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of
 disappearance of evidence, police must obtain search warrants signed by a procu-
 rator before they may enter premises. It is, however, widely assumed that law en-
 forcement agencies have increased the use of a range of surveillance methods to
 cope with the expansion of organized crime. There is some question as to the legal
 basis of this police surveillance activity but there are no known legal cases chal-
 lengingthe legality of the surveillance. The former President of the Lithuanian Na-
 tional Bank, who claimed that eavesdropping devices were found in his office, pub-
 licly called on the Procurator General to investigate the incident.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is widely respected.
 Prior restraint over either print or broadcast media and restrictions on disclosure
 are prohibited, except in cases determined by the Government to involve national
 security.
 Investigative journalists reporting on the organized crime problem have been har-
 assed and have received death threats; a copublisher and editor of a widely read
 daily, who wrote extensively on organized crime, was murdered. Four persons sus-
 pected of killing the editor are being held in investigative detention.
 The Government made efforts to prevent private printing enterprises in Kaunas
 from printing two extreme rightwing German publications promoting anti-Semitism.
 By law, Lithuanian publications are prohibited from propagating racist views or in-
 citing hatred against ethnic groups. At last report, the Lithuanian partner of this
 printing venture withdrew his participation; the printing enterprises have ceased
 printing the two German publications.
 Five private radio stations, including one broadcasting in Polish, are on the air.
 Two private television stations also broadcast regular programming to a wide audi-
 ence. The owners of both the private radio and television stations, however, have
 complained about unfair broadcasting rates that are set by the Government and al-
 legedly favor the state radio and television stations.
 . Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are no laws thatpro-
 hibit public gatherings. During 1993 a large number of public meetings and dem-
 onstrations took place, with rightwing groups, blue-collar workers, pensioners, and
 farmers being especially active.
 The Constitution respects the right of Lithuanians to associate freely, requiring
 only that they inform local government authorities of planned demonstrations. Par-
 liament, however, outlawed the Moscow-backed Communist party in Lithuania in
 light of its support for the January 1991 military crackdown and the August 1991
 Soviet coup attempt. Other organizations associated with the Soviet occupation were
 
 
 958
 also banned. Former officials of Communist-era Lithuania were not arrested, except
 those charged with specific crimes.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There were no restrictions on the exercise of religious
 freedom in 1993. The Government recognizes no state religion, although the Roman
 Catholic Church has the largest following in the country, and its clergy are the most
 visible in public life. Religious instruction was widely introduced in Lithuanian
 schools in 1992, but parents have the right to enroll their children in secular 'eth-
 ics" classes as an alternative. Forty-one Russian Orthodox churches and an addi-
 tional 47 Old Believer churches are in use and mainly serve the spiritual needs of
 the ethnic Russian community (9 percent of the population). Protestant groups
 began proselytizing activity, organizing public prayer meetings and religious in-
 struction.
 Representatives of some Protestant religions and smaller religious communities
 protested against a draft law on religion that classifies religions according to wheth-
 er they are considered "established" or "unestablished." There is some concern that
 the draft law, if it is not amended, could result in preferential treatment (i.e., finan-
 cial aid and access to the state-owned media) of the larger and older religious com-
 munities by the Government, while the more recently introduced religions would be
 denied these benefits.
 The Government supports the small Jewish community by helping fund several
 schools and a Jewish cultural center and museum in Vilnius. Considerable progress
 has been made in restoring and maintaining Jewish cemeteries as well as memori-
 als that testify to the Jewish community's cultural life and tragic past in Lithuania.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -Under Lithuanian law, citizens and permanent residents are permitted
 free movement within, and return to, their country. There are no restrictions on for-
 eign travel.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy. Lithuanian election law requires that
 parliamentary elections be conducted by secret ballot. Suffrage is universal.
 Of 141 parliamentary seats, 71 are elected directly and 70 through proportional
 representation. In the October-November 1992 elections to Parliament, which inter-
 national observers determined were free and fair, 27 registered party, association,
 or coalition slates participated. Only 6 won enough votes to enter the new Par-
 liament. A party must draw a minimum 4 percent of the national vote to be rep-
 resented in Parliament. National minority slates are exempt from this rule. Two of
 the four Union of Poles representatives won their seats on a proportional basis, even
 though the Union slate captured only 2 percent of the nationwide proportional vote.
 The other two won in district races. In addition, two other ethnic Poles were elected,
 representing other political groups.
 The Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party (LDDP) won an absolute majority, with
 73 of the 141 parliamentary seats. The Homeland Union (which originated from the
 rightwing Sajudis), the mainstream Christian Democratic Party, the Social Demo-
 cratic Party, the Union of Poles, and one representative from a separate Christian
 democratic group make up the opposition.
 The generally inclusive citizenship law of December 11, 1991, extends citizenship
 to persons who were born in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, who were
 citizens prior to 1940, as well as their children and grandchildren, and who became
 citizens under the legislation in effect prior to the new effective date of December
 11, 1991. All applications for retention, restoration, and naturalization must go
 through a citizenship committee appointed by Parliament. In order to qualify for
 naturalization, an applicant must pass a Lithuanian-language examination, have
 been resident in Lithuania for the last 10 years, have a permanent job or source
 of income, and renounce his current citizenship.
 Moreover, the 1991 Lithuanian-Russian agreement offered Lithuanian citizenship
 to Russian residents who had taken up residence in Lithuania as of the date of the
 agreement's signing. Well over 90 percent of ethnic Poles, Russians, and others re-
 siding in Lithuania in 1991 were granted Lithuanian citizenship.
 There are no de jure restrictions on women's participation in politics or govern-
 ment, but for cultural and historical reasons they are underrepresented in political
 leadership positions. There are only 10 female deputies in the 141-member Seimas,
 and no female ministers serve in the current Cabinet.
 
 
 959
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Lithuania is an umbrella or-
 ganization for several small human rights groups, which operate without govern-
 ment restriction. However, the Association is not very well known nor particularly
 active. Lithuanian authorities actively encouraged international and nongovern-
 mental human rights groups to travel to Lithuania.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Lithuanian constitutional law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 disability, or ethnic background.
 Women.-The Constitution provides equal rights for men and women, and official
 policy specifies equal pay for equal work. Generally, men and women receive the
 same pay for comparable work, but women are largely underrepresented in some
 professions and in the managerial sector as a whole. Women enjoy maternity and
 ay-care benefits. There are, however, significant inequalities in Lithuanian society
 based on sex. A growing number of formal and informal women's organizations are
 active in promoting women's rights in Lithuania, but women's rights activists report
 that public awareness of women's issues is still at a rudimentary stage, and there
 are no known lawsuits charging discrimination.
 Abuse of women in the home is reportedly common, especially in connection with
 alcohol abuse by husbands, but institutionsl mechanisms for coping with this prob-
 lem are generally not available. Statistics on the incidence of abuse of women in
 the home are not filed separately from other categories of assault. Women's groups
 report some resistance among law enforcement officials to collecting and releasing
 such statistics. Persons convicted of rape generally receive sentences of from 3 to
 5 years in prison.
 Children.-The Ministries of Social Protection and Internal Affairs shared official
 responsibility for the protection of children's rights and welfare in 1993. As of Janu-
 ary 1, 1994, the Children's Rights Service of the Ministry of Social Protection will
 take on many of the functions formerly handled by the Internal Affairs Ministry and
 its subordinate police offices throughout the country, thereby presumably focusing
 more attention on the social welfare needs of children.
 The Soviet-era family code, which until recently has governed legal relationships
 between children and their families, is undergoing reform with a view to enhancing
 children's rights generally and improving adoption procedures and legal protection
 against child abuse specifically. Legal experts are working on a separate law regu-
 lating the rights and responsibilities of children vis-a-vis their parents. Lithuania
 is a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
 A number of private organizations are active in children's welfare issues, includ-
 ing monitoring and supporting the work of orphanages and distributing charity to
 children in socially deprived families (see also People with Disabilities below).
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Non-Lithuanian ethnic groups, comprising
 about 20 percent of the population, include Russians, Poles, Belarusians, Ukrain-
 ians, and Jews.
 Minority nationalities have ready access to primary and secondary education in
 their own languages. State radio and television programs include a fair selection of
 programs in minority languages. In addition, Lithuanian television regularly re-
 broadcasts programs from two television stations in Russia and one in Poland. Nu-
 merous periodicals are readily available in Russian and Polish. Relations between
 the Lithuanian authorities and the sizable ethnic Polish community in the southeast
 region of Lithuania have improved following elections on February 14 of two district
 councils that had been suspended immediately after the August 1991 Soviet coup
 attempt. The members of the councils, which represent predominantly Polish con-
 stituencies, had been charged with upholding Soviet rule during Lithuania's inde-
 pendence struggle and supporting the August 1991 coup attempt. Parliament also
 suspended on the same grounds a county council in Snieckus (now called Visaginas)
 representing a predominantly Russian community, but, despite repeated elections to
 the county council in late 1992 and February 14, 1993, local voter turnout was too
 low to elect new representatives under Lithuanian election law. The county re-
 mained under the authority of an ethnic Russian administrator appointed by the
 central Government.
 Polish special interest groups have long demanded cultural autonomy and recogni.
 tion of a Polish university. Non-Lithuanians, especially Poles, have expressed con-
 cerns about the possibility of job discrimination arising from implementation of the
 language law. Many public sector employees were required to attain a functional
 knowledge of Lithuanian within several years. Language-testing committees began
 
 
 960
 their work in early 1993. During the first 9 months of 1993, about 2,000 persons
 were tested for their Lithuanian language ability, of whom 1,786 were certified as
 language qualified. There is no documented evidence of dismissals based on this
 law. Lithuanian authorities have indicated that the intent of the law is to apply
 moral incentives to learn Lithuanian as the official language of the State; they have
 asserted that no one would be dismissed solely because of an inability to meet the
 language requirement.
 In its negotiations for a Friendship Treaty with Poland Lithuania has insisted
 on a declaration affirming its historic sovereignty over Vilnius. The Vilnius-based
 Union of Poles and the Warsaw-based Citizens Committee for the Defense of Poles
 in the Vilnius Region claimed that such a declaration could be used to legalize dis-
 crimination against the Polish ethnic minority in Lithuania.
 People with Disabilities.-A law on integrating disabled people, passed in 1991,
 provided for a broad category of rights and government benefits to which disabled
 people are theoretically entitled. A number of government agencies or government-
 supported public bodies are engaged in protecting the rights and defending the in-
 terests of the disabled, who number over 300,000, according to official statistics. The
 Hope Society promotes public awareness of the problems of disabled children
 through the mass media and raises funds to support the treatment and care of dis-
 abled children.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 law on trade unions and the Constitution
 recognize the right of workers and employees to form and join trade unions. The
 law on trade unions formally extends this right to employees of the police and the
 armed forces, although the Collective Agreements Law of 1991 does not allow collec-
 tive bargaining by government employees involved in law enforcement and security-
 related work.
 The Lithuanian branch of the U.S.S.R.'s All-Union Central Council of Trades
 Union (AUCCTU), grouping 23 of 25 trade unions, renamed itself the Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (CFTU) in 1990 and began asserting increased independence
 from its Soviet parent and promoting the interests of the Lithuanian state indus-
 trial sector. In March the CF *joined eight other unions that had also been a part
 of the AUCCTU to form the Lithuanian Trade Union Center (LTUC). The Lithua-
 nian Workers Union (LWU) was formed in 1990 as an alternative to and competitor
 of the CFTU.
 Since its formation, the LWU has adopted policies clearly supportive of the
 proindependence Sajudis movement and sought contacts with Western free trade
 unions. The LWU now claims a dues-paying membership of 50,000, organized in 35
 regional groupings. The LWU signed an agreement on February 26 with the then
 Prime Minister and several other labor unions (including its rival, the CFTU, now
 called the LTUC), setting forth a cooperative relationship between the Government
 and Lithuania's trade unions. Although the LWU and LTUC remain rivals on the
 national scene, there are indications that the two organizations cooperate on the
 local level.
 There are no restrictions on unions affiliating with international trade unions.
 The Union of Teachers (which is associated with the LWU) is affiliated with the
 International Federation of Free Teachers. The LWU and its component organiza-
 tions currently maintain loose cooperative contacts with the American Federation of
 Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the Polish Solidarity union,
 and other international labor organizations. The CFTU/LTUC has also begun pursu-
 ing closer contacts with Western labor unions.
 The 1991 law on trade unions and the 1992 Constitution provide for the right to
 strike although strikes by public officials providing essential services are not per-
 mitted. A nationwide strike of primary and secondary schoolteachers protesting low
 wages took place during April and May. Bus drivers in the port city of Klaipeda
 stayed off their jobs from March to April. Both the schoolteachers and the Klaipeda
 bus drivers called off their strike after agreement was reached to increase their
 wares. The teachers received an immediate 10-percent wage increase while the driv-
 ers pay went up about 30 percent.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining and the
 right of unions to organize employees are protected by the collective agreements
 law, although several provisions of this law reportedly hinder the establishment of
 new union organizations. According to the Collective Agreements Law, unions, in
 order to be registered, must have at least 30 founding members in large enterprises
 or have a membership of one-fifth of all employees in small enterprises. Difficulties
 commonly arise in state enterprises whose employees are represented by more than
 one union. LWU officials charge that managers in some state enterprises discrimi-
 
 
 nate against LWU organizers and have on occasion dismissed employees as retribu-
 tion for their trade union activities. The LWU also charges that the Lithuanian judi-
 cial system is slow to respond to LWU grievances regarding dismissals from work.
 LWU representatives charge that state managers sometimes prefer the old-style
 CFTU/LTUC over the LWU unions as collective bargaining partners.
 In general, trade union spokesmen say that managers often determine wages
 without regard to trade union wishes, except in larger factories with well-organized
 trade unions. The Government issued periodic decrees that served as guidelines for
 state enterprise management in setting wage scales. The LWU and the LTUC en-
 gage in direct collective bargaining over wages at the workplace level. Wage deci-
 sions are increasingly being made at the enterprise level, although government min-
 istries still retain some control over this sphere in state-owned enterprises. The
 LWU reports that it supplements its bargaining efforts with active lobbying in gov-
 ernment ministries that own enterprises. During the first 11 months of 1993, wage
 increases appear to have kept pace with price rises.
 No export processing zones have been established.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, and this prohibition is observed in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment of children without parental consent is 16. The legal minimum age with
 the written consent of parents is 14. Free trade union representatives assert that
 the mechanisms for monitoring minimum age legislation are rudimentary. Com-
 plaints about infringements of child labor regulations generally are referred to local
 prosecutors who investigate the charges and take legal action to stop violations.
 Available evidence suggests that child labor is not a widespread phenomenon.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage is $11 (43 litai) per
 month, while the average wage in the state industrial sector is $45 (180 litai) per
 month. The Council of Ministers and the Ministry of Social Protection periodically
 set the minimum wage. Every 3 months these two government bodies must submit
 their minimum wage proposals to the Parliament, which has the right to approve
 or revise the minimum wage level. Enforcement of the minimum wage is almost
 nonexistent, in part because the Government does not want to exacerbate the cur-
 rent unemployment problem.
 The Constitution provides that workers have the right to safe and healthy work-
 ing conditions. In October a labor safety bill went into effect, setting down the rights
 of workers confronted with hazardous conditions and providing legal protection for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. The State Labor Inspection Serv-
 ice, which was established by the law, has been charged with implementing the
 labor safety law. Regional labor inspection offices, each of which is staffed by two
 or three officials, have already been set up in four of Lithuania's largest cities and
 have begun their work. Nevertheless, severe financial constraints faced by both the
 state budget and state industrial enterprises will complicate efforts to rectify unsafe
 conditions caused by worn, outdated industrial technologies.
 Lithuanian labor safety experts estimate that 150,000 production workers are em-
 ployed in enterprises with substandard hygienic working conditions. Half of the na-
 tion's production work force is thought to be exposed to excessively high levels of
 noise, vibrations, and air pollution in factories and enterprises.
