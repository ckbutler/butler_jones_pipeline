 INDIA
 India is a secular republic with a multiparty political structure based on Indian
 political traditions and aspects of the British parliamentary system. National elec-
 tions held in 1991 in all states except Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab resulted
 in a Congress (I) party government headed by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
 By-elections and party shifts gave the Congress (I) and its allies a parliamentary
 majority in September 1992. Presidents Rule (direct rule from New Delhi) remained
 in force in Jammu and Kashmir, was declared in the states of Uttar Pradesh
 Madhya Pradesh, Himachel Pradesh, and Rajasthan following massive communaf
 violence in December but was lifted in Punjab on February 25, following the instal-
 lation of an elected state government.
 The 25 state governments have primary responsibility for internal security,
 though the central Government provides guidance and support, particularly through
 use of national paramilitary forces, and in law has ultimate responsibility for pro-
 tecting the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The Union Min-
 istry or Home Affairs controls the nationwide Indian police force, the paramilitary
 forces, and the internal intelligence bureaus and has increasingly assumed control
 of law and order operations. This tendency stems in part from the rapid growth of
 the internal intelligence bureaus, which function under the Home Ministry with lit-
 tle reference to the state governments, and in part from the increased use of para-
 military forces against armed separatist grups and communal unrest throughout
 the country. These forces, backed by the Indian army, have been deployed exten-
 
 
 1134
 sively in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and the northeastern states. Army, para-
 military, and police forces have been responsible for significant human rights
 abuses. Ultimately, these abuses are questions of the effectiveness of civilian over-
 sight and the extent of the Government's willingness and ability to prosecute offend-
 ers vigorously. According to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total
 military expenditures for 1989 were $8,174 million. During the past 4 years, the
 growth in military expenditures has been below the rate of inflation, and military
 spending is steadily decreasing as a percentage of the gross domestic product and
 government spending.
 India has a mixed economy, with the private sector dominating agriculture, most
 nonfinancial services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy industry. The
 Congress (I) Government pursued economic structural reforms begun in 1991. Trade
 and foreign investment restrictions were relaxed, certain government subsidies were
 reduced, foreign exchange and price controls were modified, and the deficit was re-
 duced. India's economic problems continued to be compounded by rapid population
 growth (about 874 million, growing by 2.2 percent per year). Income and wealth re-
 mained very unequal. Forty percent of the urban population and 51 percent of the
 rural population live below the poverty level.
 Although India is a functioning democracy with strong and legally sanctioned
 safeguards for individuals and an independent judiciary, there continue to be signifi-
 cant abuses of human rights, many of which are the product of violent ethnic, reli-
 gious, caste, communal, and secessionist activities and the Government's reactions
 to them. As in past years, the main problems continue to include: police, para-
 military, and army excesses against civilians, particularly in Punjab, Assam, and
 Kashmir in response to attacks by militants; political killing, kidnaping, and extor-
 tion by militants in Punjab and Kashmir, extrajudicial actions (beatings, extortion,
 torture, rape, and fake "encounter" killings) by the police against detainees through-
 out India; incommunicado detention for prolonged periods without charge under na-
 tional security legislation; general failure to prosecute police and security forces im-
 plicated in abuse of detainees; widespread intercaste, religious, and communal vio-
 lence; inadequate implementation of laws protecting women's rights; infrequent
 prosecution of "dowry deaths" (wife murder); and widespread exploitation of inden-
 tured, bonded, and child labor.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killing by both militant and
 government forces continued at an alarming rate, particularly in the states of Pun-
 ja b, Jammu and Kashmir, and Assam where separatist insurgencies continued in
 1992. Terrorist attacks by militant groups accounted for hundreds of killings, as did
 excesses by security force members in encounters with militants. Additional killings
 resulted from ethnic and communal strife in other parts of India. Security and police
 forces were also responsible for the extrajudicial killing of some prisoners in deten-
 tion. Extrajudicial killing of detainees by police received increased public attention
 in 1992, but there was little evidence that those responsible were punished. More-
 over, a September 1991 amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure granted
 broad protection to all public servants, including the security forces, from prosecu-
 tion for acts committed while discharging their official duties in states under Presi-
 dent's Rule; any such prosecution may now be pursued only after the central Gov-
 ernment's permission has been received. (See Section 4 for discussion of the case of
 Hirdai Nath Wanchoo, a human rights activist murdered by an unidentified gun-
 man).
 In Jammu and Kashmir state, militant groups seeking Kashmiri independence
 continued to carry out politically motivated killings on a wide scale, targeting gov-
 ernrent and police officials, alleged police informers, members of the press, and
 members of rival factions. Among the victims were the daughter of a former Mem-
 ber of Parliament, an employee of the state road transport corporation, and Nazir
 Siddiqui, who earlier mediated the exchange of militant detainees for a kidnaped
 Indian oil executive. Press reports indicate that 1,106 civilians died in insurgency-
 related violence in Kashmir during the year ending November 30, 1992. Combatant
 casualties during this same period numbered 982, many of whom died in encounters
 with security forces or under other suspicious circumstances.
 In Punjab, there were credible reports that police, in particular, continued to en-
 gage in faked "encounter killings." In the typical scenario, police take into custody
 suspected militants or militant supporters without filing an arrest report. If the de-
 tainee dies during interrogation or is executed, officials deny that he was ever in
 custody and claim he died during an armed encounter with police or security forces.
 
 
 1135
 Afterwards, the bodies reportedly are sometimes moved to distantpolice districts for
 disposal, making identification and investigation more difficult. The Armed Forces
 (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act of 1983 and the Punjab Disturbed
 Areas Act of 1983 grant army, paramilitary, and police members wide discretion in
 the use of lethal force, thus permitting easy claims by authorities of encounter
 killings. Indian human rights groups estimated that 1,350 people were killed in
 faked encounters in India during the first 9 months of 1992.
 In January at least a dozen bodies were found in irrigation canals in Punjab.
 Some of the bodies were reportedly found with hands and feet tied together, others
 with facial hair burned off, lending credence to accusations that the police were
 dumping militants into the canals following execution. The state government or-
 dered the police to conduct an investigation into the charges. The Police Inspector
 General responded by conducting a survey of district police superintendents to as-
 certain whether any of them had seen bodies in the canals in their districts. This
 survey uncovered two other incidents in which bodies were found in canals, but
 there was no followup to confirm identities or determine the causes of death. There
 was no indication that any police officers were held responsible and punished.
 Militant Sikh organizations engaged in random attacks on public sites and tar-
 geted civil servants, political activists, journalists, presumed government informers,
 members of rival groups, and police officials and their families. Their area of oper-
 ation spread from Puniab into the neighboring states of Haryana and Uttar
 Pradesh, as well as Delhi. Six principal militant groups carried out terrorist activi-
 ties in the name of the struggle for an independent Sikh state, Khalistan.
 On March 10, a militant gang entered a factory in Sangrur district, separated 18
 non-Punjabis and gunned them down, killing 15. They left a letter saying that the
 attack was punishment for the factory employees having ignored calls or general
 strikes and warning that only Punjabis should be working in Punjab. On March 14,
 militants went on a shooting spree in downtown Ludhiana, killing 18 shopkeepers
 and customers. Fifty other civilians were killed during similar incidents in March
 as militants sought to destabilize the newly installed Punjab state government.
 In August militants massacred 29 villagers in Pilibhit district, Uttar Pradesh.
 Sikh separatists have used the Pilibhit area as a corridor for transporting arms
 from Nepal, and the killings were reportedly carried out to keep other peasants from
 venturing into forests where the militants were hiding. Later that month, militant
 gany killed 47 policemen and family members during a 2-da spree in retaliation
 for the killing o several separatist leaders by police. A total o7133 family members
 of police were killed by militants during 1991. On October 30, militants killed 27
 Bihari migrant laborers in a shooting spree near Ludhiana. On December 1, seven
 armed militants boarded a bus near Jagraon and shot 22 passengers, mostly Hin-
 dus.
 Civilian deaths in Punjab were down about half from the 1991 rate, due mainly
 to a heavy army presence which helped keep militant activities in check. Neverthe-
 less, the Punjab insurgency remained one of the most violent in the world, with
 4,049 people killed during the year ending November 30, 1992.
 Press reports for this period indicates the following breakdown of insurgency-re-
 lated deaths: 2,036 civilians, 226 security force personnel, and 1,787 alleged mili-
 tants.
 The past 3 years have brought increased violence between police and Naxalites
 (militants using violence to bring about radical land reform and other populist poli-
 cies) in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and surrounding areas. Naxalites targeted politi-
 cians, landlords, and opponents, killing at least 1,200 since 1989. Incidents of
 Naxalite violence, according to government records, climbed from 901 in 1989 to
 1,876 in 1991. Paramilitary forces were deployed throughout Andra Pradesh follow-
 ing the December 1991 assassination of Con   ss (I) leader T. Hayagrivachary by
 the People's War Group, the most militant Naxalite faction. During sweep oper-
 ations, government forces claimed to have killed 40 Naxalites in armed encounters.
 Credible reports indicate that many of the encounters were faked to cover execu-
 tions by paramilitary forces. The most prominent case was the killing of Gulam
 Rasool, a local investigative journalist, in an encounter with the state police in De-
 cember 1991. Following publie protests by journalist unions and civil liberties
 groups, the Supreme Court ordered the Andhra Pradesh government to investigate
 the death. A retired High Court justice was appointed to lead the inquiry, but no
 report was issued. The editor's guild of India subsequently launched its own inves-
 tigation which concluded that Rasool was killed by the police in a fake encounter.
 Indian human rights groups cite credible reports of 97 Naxalites killed in encoun-
 ters during the first 4 months of 1992, the highest recorded rate of encounter
 killings involving Naxalites.
 
 
 1136
 In Assam, some 40,000 Army personnel were deployed throughout 1992 to combat
 terrorism by the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA). UEFA has been respon-
 sible for killings cf politicians, police officials, businessmen, and other innocent civil-
 ians. Under the Disturbed Areas Act and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act for
 Assam, the army and security forces were given wide discretion to use lethal force
 in Assam. According to government statistics, government forces apprehended some
 5,400 ULFA partisans during 1991 and early 1992, killing 24; human rights groups
 claimed the army killed at least 40 people under custody, charges denied by the
 army. In July a senior inqufry committee appointed by the Assam government held
 the Indian army responsible for the deaths of two persons who the army claimed
 were killed in crossfire on April 16. The state government accepted the report and
 initiated prosecution of the five soldiers involved. A pact signed in April between
 the Government and some ULFA leaders sparked factional violence. Two ULFA par-
 tisans who had attempted to reenter civilian life were found dead in July. In August
 the bodies of three ULFA activists who favored negotiations were found with their
 tongues and hands cut off. State authorities blamed these killings on a rival mili-
 tant group. Militants reportedly killed over 50 civilians after kidnaping them. Bodo
 separatists were also active in Assam, and were blamed for an October 13 train
 bombing that killed at least 27 people and injured 45, along with two November 21
 blasts that killed 30 and injured about 100.
 In Bihar, police killed over 20 people and injured many more in a number of inci-
 dents over a 4-day period in March. Police reportedly looted homes and beat or shot
 resisters after being refused "gifts" by villagers during the Holi holiday period.
 On the final day, villagers attacked a police convoy in retaliation; the police shot
 over a dozen people, and one police officer was seriously injured.
 b. Disappearance.-Disappearances are believed to occur on a wide scale, but indi-
 vidual reports are hard to verify. There are credible reports that police throughout
 the country and especially in troubled areas, often fail to file the required arrest
 reports, with the result that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of cases of un-
 solved disappearances in which relatives claim an individual was taken into police
 custody and never heard of again. Police usually deny these claims, countering that
 there are no records of arrest. (See Section 2 for discussion of the case of dis-
 appeared journalist Ram Singh Biling).
 For several years Kashmiri separatists have used kidnaping of prominent Indians
 to force the Government to release militants in detention. These kidnapings dropped
 off in midyear, however, reflecting an apparent change in the militant groups tac-
 tics. Militants in Assam kidnaped hundreds of civilians, and reportedly killed over
 50. In Andhra Pradesh, Naxalites also kidnaped local officials, trading the victims
 for persons being held by the police.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and cruel treatment or punishment are prohibited by law, there
 is credible evidence that torture of detainees is common throughout India. Some-
 times this abuse is part of interrogation procedures, sometimes it is to extort money
 from the victim or his relatives, and sometimes it is summary punishment doled out
 by individual police officials.
 Confessions or information extracted by force may not be admitted in court. How-
 ever, under Section 15 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
 (TADA), a confession made to an officer above the rank of superintendent of police
 is admissible as evidence, provided the police have "reason to believe that it is being
 made voluntarily." Press accounts and reports by human rights groups indicate that
 police brutality in extracting confessions under this law is common. Scheduled
 castes (Harijans, or untoucha les) and tribes remain particularly vulnerable to po-
 lice violence. There were persistent reports that police, usually drawn from the
 upper castes, deliberately targeted members of these backward castes for beatings
 and rape. In a highly publicized case in Haryana, a policeman was charged with
 dereliction of duty after reportedly castrating a lower caste detainee. Numerous In-
 dian human rights groups have detailed cases of torture during interrogation by po-
 lice and paramilitary forces in Kashmir, Punjab, and Assam, including beatings,
 burning with cigarettes, suspension by the feet, crushing of limbs with heavy rollers,
 and electric shocks.
 In theory, citizens may lodge a complaint for assault, wrongful confinement, and
 death in custody, but in many cases this requires authorization of the state govern-
 ment or other local authority. In the case of a death in police custody, magistrates
 are required under by the Criminal Procedure Code to hold inquiries. However, such
 inquiries may be carried out by an executive, not a judicial magistrate. Moreover,
 such inquiries are often not carried out and, when an investigation does occur, the
 results are generally not made public beyond a statement in some cases that depart-
 mental action was initiated against the concerned police officials. Human rights
 
 
 1137
 groups say most custodial abuses are directed at the poor and uneducated backward
 castes, who are unlikely to understand their right to redress.
 The army, paramilitary, and police forces in Assam arrested over a hundred sue-
 pected ULFA militants and sympathizers during the first several months of 1992,
 and were accused by opposition parties and student and civil liberties groups of tor-
 turing many of the detainees. The army denied specific charges but maintained that
 in cases in which personnel had been found guilty of wrongdoing, they were pun-
 ished. In July a senior inquiry committee appointed by the Assam government found
 an army officer responsible for "inhuman torture, cruelty, and consequent death" of
 a person held in army custody in April. A government doctor and a subinspector
 of police were found guilty of giving a false death certificate in this case. The report
 also recommended court-martial of one junior commissioned officer accused of raping
 a girl during an army operation on April 12. Army officials did not disclose if pun-
 ishments were meted out in these cases.
 The Government says many members of the police have been disciplined for abuse
 of detainees, though punishment is usually mild (suspension or transfer) and only
 occurs in a small percentage of abuse cases. A government review of seven custody
 deaths reported in Delhi during 1991, for instance, indicates that in two cases offi-
 cials were placed under suspension and charges were fied, in two cases officials
 were suspended without charges being filed, in two cases investigations were contin-
 ued, and in one case the magisterial inquest determined that no foul play was in-
 volved. In none of these cases has a conviction resulted.
 As of December, the Government had reviewed 230 of more than 400 cases docu-
 mented in Amnesty International's (AD 1992 report on "torture, rape, and deaths
 in custody." The Government claimed that 153 of the 230 were insufficiently docu-
 mented to allow any official followup or were not substantiated after inquiry. In
 many of these 153 cases, the Government's investigation determined that death was
 due to natural causes, suicide, or crossfire. In 14 cases, the government reported
 that the officials implicated were under investigation. Forty-two of the Al cases re-
 portedly remained before the court, while 15 have been formally acquitted. In some
 instances compensation was paid to victim's families before any judgment, and in
 others departmental action was taken even if guilt was not established. In only 6
 out of 230 cases that Al documented did the Government report that trials had oc-
 curred leading to the prosecution of the officials involved.
 Press reports about prison conditions include charges of sexual abuse of prisoners,
 the use of prisoners by prison officials for domestic labor, the sale of food and milk
 meant for prisoners on the black market and the sale of women prisoners to broth-
 els. Women constitute 2 to 6 percent of the total prison population, according to the
 1987 Justice Krishna Iyer report, which also noted that cells are seldom segregated.
 It wan only after a female inmate had been raped in custody that she could be
 transferred to a cell staffed by women, the report continued.
 At least 20,000 children and youngsters under 18 years old are reported to be in
 jail, comprising nearly one-eighth of the prison population. Although Parliament
 passed the hildren's Law in 1960 to safeguard young prisoners against abuse and
 exploitation, most states have not followed suit with their own laws to implement
 it. The Supreme Court has criticized the states for not providing separate facilities
 for children in jails and for not constructing reformatory institutions. It is estimated
 that at least 10,000 people with mental disorders who have committed no crimes
 are held in prisons throughout India.
 There are three classes of Indian prison facilities. Class "C" cells are the worst.
 They often have dirt floors, no furnishings, and poor quality food. They are over-
 crowded, and the use of handcuffs and fetters is common. Prisoners in these cells
 reportedly suffer the most abuse. Prisoners are designated class "C," not based on
 the nature or severity of the crimes involved, but on their standing in society. Those
 who cannot prove they are either college graduates or income taxpayers when they
 come before the magistrate are class "C."
 Class "B" cells are for college graduates and taxpayers, again regardless of the
 crimes involved. Crowding is less of a problem in "  cells, and the food and treat-
 ment of prisoners are reportedly better than in class "C." Class "A" cells are for
 "prominent persons," as designated by the Government. Such prisoners are accorded
 private rooms, visits, and adequate food, which can be supplemented by their fami-
 lies. In fact, very few prisons actually maintain class "A cells; class 'A" prisoners
 are usually held in government guest houses.
 The Minister for Jails in the state of Madhya Pradesh revealed in August that
 50 convicts and 125 detainees under trial had died from health problems in various
 state jails between July 1991 and June 1992. He also acknowledged that the num-
 ber of prisoners in these jails far exceeds their capacities.
 
 
 1138
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exi/e.-There were credible reports of wide-
 spread arbitrary arrest and detention. The Constitution requires that an arrested
 person be informed of the grounds for arrest, given the right to be represented by
 counsel, and (unless he is being held under a preventive detention law) to be pro-
 duced before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest. At this initial appearance, the
 accused must either be remanded for further investigation or released, provisions
 that have been upheld by the Supreme Court. However these provisions do not
 apply to persons arrested under national security laws and are not always respected
 even when national security is not involved.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention laws in the event
 of threats to public order and national security. Several such laws have been adopt-
 ed and provide for limits on the length of detention (up to 2 years) and for judicial
 review of such detention.
 The National Security Act (NSA) of 1980 permits detention of persons considered
 security risks; police anywhere in India (except Kashmir) may charge suspects
 under NSA provisions. The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safet Act (1978) covers
 corresponding procedures for that state. To be released from detention under the
 NSA, a court must determine that all grounds for detention are invalid. NSA detain-
 ees are permitted visits by family members and lawyers. Under NSA's strong special
 and preventive detention provisions, a person may be detained for up to 1 year with-
 out charge or trial (2 years in Punjab) on loosely defined security grounds, but must
 be informed of the grounds for detention within 5 days of arrest and brought before
 an advisory board of three high court judges within 7 weeks of arrest. At that time
 the detainee may be released on the basis of "insufficient grounds." 14,400 people
 have been arrested under NSA since 1990, and all but about 500 have been released
 on bail.
 The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), though enacted
 in 1985 to fight terrorism in Punjab, is applicable in all states and to all Indians
 abroad. In 1992, 23 of 25 state governments had formally invoked the TADA,
 though only a handful of states face actual insurgencies. The TADA is subject to
 renewal every 2 years and will next expire in May 1993. The law was promulgated
 to punish those found guilty of terrorist and disruptive acts with no less than 5
 years' imprisonment and up to the death penalty for certain terrorist crimes. Dis-
 ruptive activities are defined broadly to include speech or actions which disrupt or
 challenge the sovereignty or territorial integrity of India. In some cases, the Govern-
 ment has been accused of using the TADA in criminal proceedings in order to avoid
 the lengthy process of building a criminal case. The TADA extends the period to 60
 days during which a detainee may be held in police custody after remand by the
 court and allows additional administrative detention up to 1 year while an nves-
 tigation proceeds. Persons held under the TADA must be presented within 24 hours
 before an executive magistrate, but this requirement reportedly is often ignored.
 It is difficult to determine how many people are held at any one time under the
 TADA. Civil liberties organizations often use a figure of 37,000, the majority of
 whom are being held in Punjab and Kashmir. The Government stated in October
 1991 that about 48,000 people had been arrested under the TADA since its incep-
 tion. Of these, over 31,000 had been released and only a few hundred convicted. In
 March Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh announced that 13,535 people were being
 held under the Act in Punjab alone. In August the Government announced that 838
 people had been arrested in Delhi under the TADA during the previous 3 years. Of
 these, the Government said 144 were militants and that 1 was convicted. In Tamil
 Nadu, police said 143 people were arrested under the TADA in 1992, of whom 36
 have been released.
 There were widespread accusations that the Act was being misused in states not
 experiencing civil unrest, including Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and
 Maharashtra, as a convenient way to hold people without trial. In Tamil N4adu,
 there were credible reports that the state government was using the TADA to arrest
 political opponents under the pretext of combating terrorism by the Liberation Ti-
 gers of Tamil Elam (LTTE). In Punjab, state authorities on several occasions ar-
 rested Sikh political leaders for short periods under the TADA in order to prevent
 opposition rallies and demonstrations.

 e. Denial of Fair Public rial--India has an independent judiciary with strong
 constitutional safeguards. Supreme Court Justices are appointed by the President
 and serve up to age 65. Judgcs of the state high courts are appointed by the Presi-
 dent in consultation with the Chief Justice and the governor of the state, and may
 serve, up to age 6. India's legal procedures generally assure a fair trial when they
 function normally, but the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor.
 Defendants have the right to choose counsel from an Indian bar that is fully inde-
 
 
 1139
 pendent of the Government. Effective appeal channels exist at all levels of the judi-
 cial system.
 The Indian Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial in most cases.
 Under certain circumstances it allows significant exceptions, including in proceed-
 ings involving official secrets, trials in which statements prejudicial to the safety of
 the State might be made or under provisions of national security legislation such
 as the TADA. Sentences, however, must be announced in public. The TADA author-
 izes secret testimony to protect witnesses and suspends the usual restrictions on the
 use of evidence obtained during police interrogation. Persons charged under the
 TADA with certain categories of crimes are presumed guilty and carry the burden
 of proving their innocence. Human rights groups charge that these categories are
 so broad-including cases where weapons are recovered, where a codefendant has
 made a confession, or where there is strong incriminating evidence-that they can
 be manipulated to fit any case. TADA trials are held before special courts, which
 sit in closed session in any district of the state where the crime was committed.
 Some 450 petitions have been filed before the Indian Supreme Court challenging the
 constitutionality of the Act, but none has been heard.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive branch. Judges are selected by the
 Law Ministry following consultations with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
 Islamic religious law governs many noncriminal matters involving Muslims, includ-
 ing family law, inheritance, and divorce. The Government's declared policy is not
 to interfere in the personal laws of the minority communities, with the result that
 discriminatory personal laws, often against women, are upheld.
 In Kashmir and Punjab, where armed militants demand independence for their
 states, the legal system barely functions. In both states, threats against judges, wit-
 nesses and their family members have created a situation in which no court is will-
 ing to hear cases involving militants. As a result, there were no convictions of al-
 leged terrorists in these states during 1992, even though some militants had been
 in detention for years. Security forces appear on many occasions to have meted out
 their own hasty "justice" with deaths in custody and faked encounter killings, rather
 than rely on the liegal system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 Indian law, warrants are normally required for searches and seizures. In a criminal
 investigation, police may conduct searches without a warrant if obtaining one would
 cause undue delay, but they must justify such searches in writing to the nearest
 magistrate with jurisdiction over the offense being investigated. Under the dis-
 turbed areas legislation in Assam, Punjab, and Jammu and Kashmir, the authori-
 ties have special powers to search and arrest without a warrant and to shoot to kill
 suspected lawbreakers or disturbers of the peace.
 Surveillance of communications, including tapping of telephones and intercepting
 personal mail, is authorized under the Indian Telegraph Act "on the occurrence of
 any public emergency or in the interest of the public safety or tranquility." These
 powers have been used by every state government.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-Human rights abuses by both militants and security forces continued
 unabated in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. The Muslim
 p opulation in Kashmir valley has become severely alienated both by the central
 Government, because of the repressive tactics used by its forces to combat insur-
 gency, as well as by the militants for acts of wanton violence sometimes directed
 at innocent civilians. Hundreds of thousands of Indian army and paramilitary forces
 remain in the state to maintain law and order and check the militant separatist
 movement. Under the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act and the Armed
 Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, both passed in July 1990, secu-
 rity force personnel have sweeping powers, including authority to shoot to kill sus-
 pected lawbreakers or disturbers of the peace and to destroy structures suspected
 of harboring militants or arms.
 Paramilitary and army forces used excessive force against mass gatherings, as
 well as in retaliation against attacks on them by armed militants. On May 5, secu-
 rity forces killed four bystanders and wounded seven when returning fire in a mili-
 tant attack on a motorcade accompanying the Union Communications Minister in
 Srinagar. Kashmir observers report that house-to-house searches, torture, and gang
 rapes of innocent civilians (especially in remote villages) increased following the
 launch of Operations Tiger and Shiva by security forces in September and October.
 These operations reportedly involve intensive cordon-searches, large-scale burning of
 homes and businesses suspected of aiding militants, and faked "encounter" killings
 of militants in police custody. On October 1, nine people in and around a village
 north of Sopore were reportedly killed and three women (including a 60-year-old and
 an 11-year-old) were raped following a militant attack on an army convoy one-half
 
 
 1140
 mile away in which a security force member was killed. Homes and cattle reportedly
 were burned and apples recently harvested were destroyed. Kashmiris allege secu-
 rity forces steal food, money, and personal property. Kashmiri human rights activ-
 ists report that medical personnel also have been the targets of violence. The Indian
 Government reports that in Kashmir 33 army and paramilitary personnel were im-
 prisoned (27 received sentences of 1 month or less), 18 were dismissed, and 45 were
 demoted or reprimanded. In Punijab, 135policemen were dismissed and 75 were pre-
 maturely retired. In three cases, senior officers were given jail sentences.
 Except for granting a brief visit in 1990, the Government has resisted offers by
 the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Kashmir in order to monitor
 and report confidentially on prison conditions and treatment of civilians.
 Militants maintained a reign of terror in the valley throughout the year, targeting
 security force personnel, public employees, supposed police informers, members of
 rival groups, and others perceived as opposing their cause. Invariably, innocent ci-
 vilians were caught up in the violence. On October 7, for instance, 13 people were
 killed and about 50 injured when a bomb allegedly placed by militants destroyed
 an overcrowded bus in Jammu. Militants routinely planted bombs in and around
 military and paramilitary installations, as well as at bridges and communications
 targets. Militant groups kidnaped dozens of government officials, family members
 of prominent politicians, and businessmen, killing some of them. Kashmiri mili-
 tants, unlike their counterparts in Punjab, have not routinely engaged in mass
 killings. They also carried out extortion and protection rackets. (See also Sections
 L.a., L.b., and 2.a.)
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution protects these freedoms, and
 they are, with some limitations, exercised in practice. A vigorous press reflects a
 wide variety of public, social, and economic beliefs. Several major national publica-
 tions regularly publish investigative reports and allegations of government wrong-
 doing and the press as a whole champions human rights causes and criticizes per-
 ceived government lapses. However, this is not always the case in disturbed areas,
 such as Punjab and Kashmir. Press reports there often are based on official state-
 ments and frequently do not digdeeply into allegations of abuses by government
 forces. In troubled areas, journalists and editors are harassed and intimidated by
 terrorists, local government leaders, and special interest groups.
 The Press Council of India is an independent board of journalists, with the direc-
 tor appointed by the Government. Designed to be a self-regulating mechanism for
 the press it investigates complaints of irresponsible journalism and sets a code of
 conduct for publishers. This includes the avoidance of articles that might incite
 caste or communal violence. The Council publicly criticizes newspapers or journal-
 ists it believes to have broken the code of conduct, but its findings carry no legal
 weight. Many journalists complain that the Council's actions promote self-censor-
 ship, resulting in a "chilling effect" on investigative reporting.
 ational television and radio, which are government monopolies, are frequently
 accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of the Government. A 1990 par-
 liamentary reform intended to grant greater autonomy to the electronic media has
 never been implemented. However, international satellite television is widely dis-
 tributed in middle class neighborhoods via cable and is gradually eroding the Gov-
 ernment's mono ly on electronic media.
 Under the Oficial Secrets Act (OSA), the Government may restrict publication of
 sensitive security stories, but this is sometimes interpreted quite broadly to sup-
 press criticism of government policies. In Punjab, the Government frequently im-
 posed censorship or restrictions on the press and regularly impounded issues of
 newspapers because of what it considered objectionable reporting. Government offi-
 cials reviewed issues of local newspapers before allowing distribution. Censorship
 was heaviest in the period before the Punjab elections in February. In protest, the
 Punjab-based Tribune left blank spaces with "censored" or "removed by government
 orders" where stories would have been placed. The Government also seized several
 editions of the principal Punjabi language daily both during and after the elections.
 In August the Punjab Chief Minister provoked a minor furor by calling in local jour-
 nalists and threatening them with arrest under the TADA if they wrote stories fa-
 vorable to militant groups. At least one journalist, a correspondent for the tribune's
 Punjabi edition, was arrested and booked under the NSA. (See Section 4 regarding
 the disappearance of journalist Ram Singh Biling.)
 The 1971 Newspapers Incitements to Offenses Act was still in effect in Jammu
 and Kashmir throughout 1992. Under the Act, a district magistrate may restrict the
 media from carrying material resulting in "incitement to murder and other of-
 
 
 1141
 fenses." Punishment permitted under the Act includes forfeiture of newspapers and
 printing and other media equipment.
 On May 18, an All India Radio enieer, M.L Manchanda, was kidnaped by mili-
 tants who threatened to kill him if the station did not follow militant directives to
 broadcast all programming in Punjabi and eliminate programs from Delhi. When
 the kidnapers deadline passed, he was shot and beheade   His body was dumped
 in Punjab and his head in Haryana. In Kashmir, a hand gnade was thrown into
 the house of Yuuf Jameel, a journalist for the British  road       Corporation
 (BBC) and several other international news services. In response, journalists in
 Srinagar went on a 3-day strike to protest attacks and harassment of journalists
 by both militants and government forces.
 In Assam, two journalists from local weeklies and one high court lawyer were ar-
 rested in March under the National Security Act. The Assm Chief Minister stated
 the two were arrested for seditious activities. Most independent observers claimed,
 however that the journalists were jailed because they belonged to an organization
 that collected evidence of excesses by security forces and released a report on al-
 leged deaths and rapes in custody.
 In Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister Jayalalitha proposed a legal ban on "scurrilous
 writing" by the press in a pparent retaliation against what she called a press cam-
 paign against her. In April an arrest warrant was issued for one journalist, and two
 others were summoned to receive a reprimand from the speaker of the state assem-
 bly for "breach of assembly members- privileges." The journalists challenged these
 actions in the Supreme Court, and the court granted a stay of the arrest warrant.
 One reprimand order was upheld on grounds that the editor in question should have
 apologized to the assembly speaker. (See Section L.a. concerning the encounter kill-
 ingof Ghulam Rasool, a journalist in Andhra Pradesh.)
 Fils are reviewed by the Censorship Board before being licensed for distribution.
 The Board deletes material deemed offensive to either public morals or religious or
 communal sentiment. Producers of video news magazines in the private sector also
 are required to clear their products with government censors. This has resulted in
 numerous delays in the release and editing of a number of stories on controversial
 issues.
 Indians enjoy complete academic freedom, and students and faculty espouse a
 wide range of views. In addition to 10 national universities funded by the central
 Government and about 160 state universities, states are empowered to accredit lo-
 cally run private institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution protects the
 right of peaceful assembly and the right to form associations, and these rights are
 generally respected in practice. Government authorities sometimes require permits
 and notification prior to holding parades and demonstrations. At times of civil ten-
 sion, local governments may ban public assemblies and impose a curfew. Ordinarily,
 local governments respect the right to protest peacefully, including such traditional
 Indian forms of protest as "gherao," in which an official or his office is surrounded
 by protesters who allow no access, and sitdowns blocking public thoroughfares.
 Srinagar, in Kashmir continued under a night curfew throughout the year. In the
 northeast state of Mehlaya, an indefinite curfew was imposed in the capital on
 August 13, following the outbreak of violence involving tribal groups and local mer-
 chants. Three weeks later, the state governor promulgated an ordinance empower-
 ing the police to detain any person for the maintenance of internal security and pub-
 lic order. Despite these measures, at least 20 people were killed and over 50 were
 injured in ethnic violence during October. Government authorities routinely imposed
 day curfews on other cities experiencing violent disturbances as during the after-
 math of the December 6 destruction of a mosque in Ayodhya. In Punjab and Assam,
 also, night and day curfews were imposed sporadically in response to militant activi-
 ties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-India is a secular state in which all faiths enjoy freedom
 of worship. Government policy does not favor any religious group. Nevertheless, ten-
 sions over religious differences continue to be a serious problem and pose challenges
 to the secular foundation of the Indian State.
 Indian religious organizations may maintain communications with coreligionists
 abroad. Financial contributions from abroad are subject to scrutiny and licensing by
 the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Or-
 dinance makes it an offense to use any religious site for political purposes or to use
 temples for harboring persons accused or convicted of any crime. Although designed
 to deal with Sikh places of worship in the Punjab, the ordinance technically applies
 to all religious sites. In general, the Government exercises care to avoid placing re-
 strictions on Sikh religious practices or on the management of Sikh places of wor-
 ship.

 Hindu-Muslim tensions flared in December following the destruction of a mosque
 in Ayodhya by Hindu activists. Subsequent rioting throughout India left over 1200
 deadandsome 4,000 seriously injured. In an effort to stem this violence, the &ov-
 ernment invoked the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act to ban five communal
 gups (3 Hindu, 2 Muslim). The Government arrested over 5,000 people in a crack-
 down on the banned organizations, but all but a few hundred were quickly released.
 On August 6, unknown assailants attacked the chief of a hard-line Muslim group,
 the Islamic Sevak Sangh, outside a mosque in Kerala. Hindu-Muslim rioting after-
 wards left 1 dead and over 100 injured.
 There is no national law to bar proselytizing by Indian Christians, but the Gov-
 ernment limits the number of foreign missionaries, and laws in some states discour-
 age them from openly proselytizing. The rise in conversions among tribals of the
 northeast state of Arunachal Pradesh continued to create tensions; as in the past,
 state officials refused to issue permits for foreign Christian missionaries to enter the
 state.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Indian citizens enjoy full freedom of movement within the country, ex-
 cept in certain border areas where, for security reasons, special permits are re-
 quired. Foreigners (including diplomats) must obtain restricted areas permits to
 visit Assain as well as other sensitive border areas in the northeast. Foreign travel
 and emigration are without political restrictions. Millions of people of Indian origin
 live abroad.
 India admitted millions of displaced persons at the time of partition in 1947,
 granting them citizenship so they could integrate fully into Indian society. Subse-
 quent migration to India has been the result largely of upheavals in nearby coun-
 tries, and few of the refugees have been granted citizenship. Although India is not
 a signatory to the U.N. Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees,
 the Government follows the general principles laid down in those documents (includ-
 ing the principle of non-refoulement). India does not, however, offer permanent re-
 settlement. Refugees it recognizes are placed in camps. Afghans and Burmese are
 generally neither deported nor recognized as refugees. These and other nationalities
 either receive a renewable residence permit and are recognized as refugees by the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or are ignored.
 Bangladeshis formerly received the same benign treatment, but as internal political
 pressure increased during 1991 and 1992, the Indian Government began to bar their
 entry. During 1991, according to government statistics, 53,733 illegal immigrants
 from Bangladesh were apprehended on the border and pushed back. In September,
 in the face of political pressure from Hindu groups, the Government staged a "de-
 portation" of 132 Bangladeshis taken from shanty towns in Delhi. Government offi-
 cials say there is no firm figure, but estimates of the number of Bangladeshis living
 illegally in India range from 2 to 15 million.
 By 1989, at least 40,000 Chittagong Hill Tracts tribal people from Bangladesh had
 fled to camps in Tripura where they receive assistance from the Indian Government.
 Up to 15,000 of these refugees returned to Bangladesh over the years 1991-1992,
 following discussions between the two governments. Meanwhile, increased border
 patrols slowed the influx of ChittagonglHill Tracts tribal people to a trickle.
 About 88,000 Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka were living in 130 government-run
 camps, and up to 100,000 more lived with friends and relatives throughout Tamil
 Nadu. The state government, using central government resources, provided shelter
 and subsidized food to those in the camps. Between January and September, ap-
 proximately 24,000 Tamil refugees returned to Sri Lanka. There were initial reports
 that some of these refugees were being forcibly repatriated. These concerns largely
 disappeared once the Government agreed to allow the UNHCR to screen the return-
 ees.
 India continued to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to commu-
 nities of over 100,000 Tibetan refugees in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and else-
 where in India. There were credible reports that local governments forced Nepalese
 and ethnic Nepalese Bhutanese, who had moved to parts of Assam, Meghalaya, and
 Tripura in 1990 and 1991, to leave. Most of them moved to refugee camps in Nepal.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 India has a democratic, parliamentary system of government with representatives
 elected under full adult suffrage; the voting age is 18. Multiparty elections are held
 regularly at local, state, and national levels. A Parliament sits for 5 years unless
 dissolved earlier for new elections, except under constitutionally defined emergency
 situations. State governments are also elected at regular intervals except in states
 under President's Rule.
 
 
 1143
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may proclaim a state of emer-
 en    in any state in the event of war, external aggression, or armed aggression.
 Similarly, President's Rule may be declared in the event of a collapse of a state's
 constitutional machinery. The central Government has indicated its desire to re-
 place President's Rule with an elected state government in Jammu and Kashmir,
 but it states that law and order problems remain obstacles to the holding of state
 assembly elections. Kashmiri political leaders have also stated that they do not wish
 to have elections outside a negotiated settlement. President's Rule in Jammu and
 Kashmir remained in place throughout the year.
 President's Rule in Punjab was lifted on February 25 following the installation of
 an elected state government; it was imposed in Manipur on January 7 and lifted
 on April 8; and it was imposed in Nagaland on April 2 and remained in force
 through the rest of the year. Both northeastern states have suffered from problems
 of weak state administration, corruption, and political infighting. President's Rule
 was imposed in the opposition-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,
 Himachel Pradesh, and Rajasthan following the destruction of a mosque in Ayodhya
 on December 6.
 Polling in Punjab for the state assembly and the lower house of the National Par-
 liament took place on February 19. All but one of the Sikh Akali parties boycotted
 the elections. Overall voter turnout was around 20 percent, with participation neg-
 ligible in many rural areas. The low turnout was a response to the Akalis' boycott
 of the elections and militant threats to punish voters who participated. The result
 was a virtual sweep by Conss (I) candidates, who won 87 of 117 state assembly
 seats and 12 of 13 nationsI parliamentary seats. Municipal elections in Punjab a
 heavily Hindu urban areas were held in September amid a significantly improved
 security climate, with voter turnout over 70 percent. The majority of votes went to
 independent candidates.
 Indigenous peoples participate actively in national and local politics. Numerous
 political parties and tribal groups work to advance the interests of indigenous peo-
 les an  on several occasions have extracted specific concessions from the central
 Government. Under Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution, seats are reserved for
 "scheduled tribes" (historically disadvantaged indigenous peoples) in the Parliament
 and state legislatures in proportion to their population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent Indian human rights organizations are active and vocal. The in-
 lude the People's Union for Civil Liberties, the South Asia Human Rights Do-
 mentation Center, Citizens for Democracy, and numerous regional organizations. All
 these groups send out teams to study specific allegations of human rights abuses
 and publish reports on their findings, which are often highly critical of government
 authorities. All of India, including Kashmir and Punjab, is open to investigation by
 Indian civil liberties grups.
 Following a Chief Minister's conference on human rights in September, the Gov-
 ernment established a ministerial-level subcommittee to prepare authorizing legisla-
 tion for a national human rights commission. The power of this commission and its
 scope of work remained unclear.
 The central Government is generally tolerant of dissent within India. There have
 been, however, numerous instances of human rights monitors arrested or targeted
 for police harassment. Among the most notable was that involving Justice Ajit
 Singh Bans, a 70-year-old former High Court justice and human rights monitor,
 who was arrested after delivering a speech that authorities said was seditious be-
 cause it advocated an independent Sikh homeland. Justice Bains was released on
 bail in August after being held over 4 months under the TADA. In February two
 Gujarat human rights monitors were arrested under the National Security Act for
 protesting oppression of tribals. Other Indian human rights monitors have received
 threatening anonymous phone calls and have had their offices searched by govern.
 ment agents. Ram Singh Biling, a journalist and Punjabi human rights activist, was
 taken from a bus by uniformed gunmen on January 3 and was never heard from
 again. Although several local residents completed affidavits stating that Biling was
 abducted by police the state government denied that he was ever arrested. Hirdai
 Nath Wanchoo, a labor lawyer and Kashmiri human rights activist, was killed by
 unidentified gunmen on December 5. The Government, denying any involvement in
 his death, turned the case over to the Central Bureau of Investigation.
 The central Government is sensitive about international allegations of human
 rights violations. Amnesty International (Al), unlike some other international
 human rights groups, has requested specific government authorization to send re-
 search teams to Kashmir, Punjab, and several other states. A high-level delegation
 
 
 1144
 
 from AI visited New Delhi in November to discuss these requests. Government offi-
 cials stated afterwards that they were not opposed "in principle" to a research visit
 and hinted at an invitation to visit Punjab after further discussions, but ruled out
 such a visit to Kashmir.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of race, religion, and language
 severely divide Indian society despite laws designed to prevent discrimination. Spo-
 radic violence occurred throughout the year based on these differences, as well as
 longstanding Hindu-Muslim tensions. Despite several provisions in the Constitution
 promising equality before the law and prohibiting discrimination on the basis of
 gender, the family, marr-age, and inheritance laws of several of India's religious
 communities manifest legally sanctioned gender discrimination. In recent years,
 changes have been made in personal, criminal, and labor laws governing women, in-
 cluding the Dowry Prohibition Act, the Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of
 Immoral Traffic Act, and the Sati (Widow Burning) Prevention Act. Nonetheless
 deeply rooted traditions, often tied to religious or socil practice, continue to contrib-
 ute to uneven enforcement of these laws, particularly in the countryside.
 Existing laws relating to asset and land ownership give women little control over
 land use, retention, or sale. The Hindu Succession Act provides equal inheritance
 rights for Hindu women, although in practice married daughters are seldom given
 a share in parental property. Islamic personal law, while recognizing the right to
 inheritance of both sons and daughters, specifies that a daughter's share should be
 only one-half of a son's. Under the tribal land system, notably in Bihar, tribal
 women do not have the right to own land; the practice of putting women to death
 there as "witches" is closely linked to the denial of property rights. Female bondage,
 forced prostitution, and child marriage remain common in parts of Indian society.
 Child prostitution is rampant in the larger urban areas. In Bombsy alone, there are
 afproximately 100,000 prostitutes, many of them minors, held in bondage at broth-
 Sex-determination tests (amniocentesis) are widely used, resulting in a dispropor-
 tionate number of abortions of female fetuses and, in turn, resulting in discontinu-
 ation of such tests in many states. Coupled with a marked disparity between mor-
 tality rates of male versus female infants in the 0-5 age group, this has resulted
 in the unusually low ratio in the Indian population of 929 females per 1,000 males
 (the ratio varies considerably among states). Parents often 1ive priority in both
 health care and nutrition to male infants over females. Women s rights groups point
 out that the burden of providing an adequate dowry for girls is one factor in making
 female births less desirable to the parents. Human rights groups estimate that at
 least 10,000 cases of female infanticide occur each year throughout India, primarily
 in the poorer areas of the countryside.
 Women's rights groups challenge the claim that "dowry deaths" (usually by burn-
 ing) of young married women result from their inability to meet material demands
 from their husband's families. They contend that insufficient dowry is often used as
 an excuse for socially condoned violence against married women. Dowry crimes are
 a complex issue involving attitudes of parents toward daughters, the social and eco-
 nomic status of women, laws that do not adequately stipulate investigation and en-
 forcement procedures, and the failure of police to enforce existing laws.
 The overwhelming majority of female workers are employed in agriculture, where
 work is not adequately regulated by labor laws and where contractors customarily
 pay women lower wages than those fixed by the states.
 According to an Indian government study, which is borne out by press reporting,
 violence against women-including molestation, rape (including while in police cus-
 tody), kidnaping, and wife murder ("dowry deaths")--has inreased over the past
 decade. Whether this is due to more reporting, a higher incidence, or a combination
 of both is unknown. Government reports put the total number of dowry deaths dur-
 ing 1991 at 5,157, up about 7 percent from 1990. By law, ever unnatural death
 of a woman in the first 7 years of marriage must be investigated by the police and
 a magistrate. In Delhi, however, of 329 cases of dowry death between 1989 and
 1991, only 45 have come to trial resulting in 3 convictions. A member of the Indian
 police serving on the Union Public Service Commission stated in 1990 that about
 95percent of registered cases of dowry death end in acquittal because corrupt police
 and medical officers tam per with crucial evidence.
 Reports of rape were a so up about 3 percent, totaling 9,793, during 1991. In most
 cases, the perpetrators of these crimes were not brought to justice. In West Bengal,
 for instance, 322 reported rape cases during 1991 produced 1 prosecution. One nota-
 ble exception was the case of Nehar Bano, a 35-year-old street dweller raped by po-
 lice in Calcutta. The involvement of uniformed police in this incident sparked wide-
 
 
 1145
 spread Prott which was fanned by opposition politicians. In September the offi-
 cials involved were arrested and at years end were awaiting trial. About 150 wom-
 en's organizations in India are active in workinflor social justice and economic ad-
 vancement of women and in linkig women's problems to larger social concerns.
 The Scheduled Castes and Schedluled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989
 adds to the existing protective legislation by specifying a new range of offenses and
 providing stiffer sanctions with special courts. However, this law has not checked
 atrocities committed against these disadvantaged groups. According to government
 records, there were a total of 18 336 crimes (including murder, rape, robey burn-
 ing and beating) against schedled castes in 1991. The corresponding figure for
 seduled tribes was 4,168. The anti-Naxalite drive of the state governments in
 Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat often led to harassment of tribal peo-
 ples in western India. In Januarythe deputy speaker of the Maharashtra legisla-
 ture alleged that four tribals in te Chandrapur district were killed by police who
 wrongly identified them as Naxalites. In the Pangs district of Gujarat, one tribal
 woman died after allegedly being gang-raped by police in an anti-Naxalite drive in
 March. The leader of the opposition in the Maharashtra state legislature, himself
 atribal person, went on a fast protesting a police assault on indigenous people in
 Dhuia istictthat killed one woman. Some 25 tribal Sarpanchas-elected village
 heads-in- Madhya Pradesh resigned in protest against harassment of tribals or
 their alleged support of Naxalites.
 Many tribal activists were arrested in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and
 Maharashtra for opposing construction of the Narmada dam complex. They were
 never charged in a court of law but were kept in police custody for several days be-
 fore being released unconditionally. Many of those arrested say they were subjected
 to beatings and other forms of physical abuse.
 The Innerline Regulations, enacted by the British in 1873, still provide the basis
 for safeguarding tribal rights in most of the border states of northeastern India.
 Thes regulations prohibit any person, including Indians from other states, from
 gigbynd an inner boundary without a valid permit. No rubber, wax, ivory or
 othe forest products may be carried out of the protected areas without prior author-
 ization. No outsiders are allowed to hold land in the tribal areas without the ap-
 proval of competent tribal authorities.
 In the northeastern state of Meghalaya, tribal chiefs still bald sway in certain vil-
 lages. Under an agreement with the Government, the Nagaland government con-
 trols the rights to certain mineral resources. Autonomous District Councils (in
 Tripura, Assam, and Meghalaya) control matters such as education, rural develop-
 ment, and forestry within their areas and are supposed to work directly under the
 state governors.
 Despite constitutional safeguards, the rights of indigenous groups in eastern India
 are often ignored. There has been encroachment (including by illegal imigants
 from Bangladesh) on tribal land in almost all the states of eastern [ndia, and busi-
 nessmen, flouting Innerline Regulations, have taken out forest and mineral re-
 serves. Spaces in National Education Institutions reserved for tribals and backward
 classes are often taken by more influential people from other backgrunds.
 These violations have given rise to numerous tribal movements demanding protec-
 tion of land and property rights. The Jharkhand movement in Bihar and Orissa, the
 Gorkhaland movement in Darjeeling, and the Bodo movement in Assam all reflect
 deep economic and social grievances among indigenus peoples. In the .Jharkhand
 area, tribal people complain that they have en relegated to unskilled mining jobs,
 have lost forests to industrial construction, and have been physically displaced by
 development projects. The Government responded to these complaints by floating
 the idea of an independent Jharkhand state, but this proposal faced strong resist-
 ance from the state governments that would be affected. Encroachments by
 nontribal traders and shopkeepers sparked serious ethnic violence in Meghalaya in
 which at least 20 people were killed in October.
 Scheduled tribes benefit from targeted development funds, government hiring
 quotas, and special training programs. A national commission on scheduled castes
 and scheduled tribes reports annually on the status of tribal peoples and inves-
 tigates specific complaints about deprivation of rights of scheduled castes and tribes.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution guarantees the right of association.
 Workers are guaranteed the right to form and join unions of their own choosing
 without prior authorization, including in export processing zones (EPZ's;), and sev-
 eral trade union centrals exist. Most trade unions have some tie to a political party,
 national or local. However, trade unions make a point of stressing their formal indc-
 
 
 1146
 pendence from political parties and, on occasion, differ from their respective political
 allies on labor-related issues.
 Trade unions have the legally protected right to strike, but public sector unions
 have to give at least 14 days' notice prior to striking. Some states have laws reqlir-
 ing workers in certain nonpublic sector industries to give prior strike notice. The
 Essential Services Maintenance Act allows central government authorities to ban
 strikes and requires conciliation or arbitration in specified essential industries.
 Legal mechanisms exist for challenging the assertion that a given dispute falls with-
 in the scope of this Act. At least two of the EPZ's limit the right to strike. In 1991
 (the last year for which data are available) there were 963 strikes in India.
 By and large, human rights abuses against nationally organized unions or union-
 ized workers have not been a problem in India. However, as with other peripheral
 groups in Indian society, unafl iated unions of low caste or tribal workers cannot
 always avail themselves of protections and rights guaranteed by law. Shankar Guha
 Nyogi, the leader of an unaffiiated tribal workers union in the Madhya Pradesh
 steel town of Bhilai, was killed by unidentified assailants in September 1991. The
 Indian Central Bureau of Investigation concluded that his death had been planned
 by local industrialists. Arrests were made, but charges were not filed, and a prime
 suspect escaped from custody. On July 1, 1992, with little evident progress toward
 reslvingthe disputes that led to his death, Nyogi's followers organized a sitdwn
 prtest that blocked Bhilai's rail tracks. State police fired on the protesters, killing
 18 or more persons and injuring and arresting scores of others. Hospitalized victims
 displayed numerous upper torso bullet wounds, apparent corroboration of the union
 charge that police had fired to kill.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade union organizations. For ex-
 ample, the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) is afliated with the
 International Confederation of Free   e Unions (ICFTU), and the all India Trade
 Union Conras (AITUC) is affliated with the Communist-dominated World Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions (WFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize (includ-
 ing protection against antiunion discrimination) and to bargain collectively has ex-
 istd i Inianlawfor decades. Trade unions carry out these activities independ-
 ently and without government or, in general, employer attempts to interfere. A sys-
 tem of specialized labor courts exists to hear and adjudicate labor-related com-
 plaints.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of setting wages and settling disputes,
 and trade unions are usually vigorous in defending worker interests in this process.
 When collective bargaining fails to establish locally equitable wage levels, the Gov-
 ernment may set up tripartite boards, including trade union representation, to de-
 tesrmine them. The Trade Union Act prohibits discrimination against union mem-
 bers and organizers and employers may be penalized if they discriminate.
 There are seven sP s in India. Physical access to the EPZ's ordinarily is limited
 to those who work in them, and union organizers are not exempt from these limita-
 tions. While workers in EPts have the legal right to organize and bargain collec-
 tively, trade union activity is rare. Women workers constitute the bulk of the work
 force in the EPss.
 t. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, and legislation passed in 1976 specifically bans the practice of "bonded labor."
 A Supreme Cour decision definsd "forced labor" as work at less than the minimum
 wage (minimum wages are usually set by the states, not the central Government).
 Under this definition, "forced labor" is widespread throughout India, particularly in
 rural areas. "Bonded labor," the result of a private contractual relationship whereby
 a worker incurs or inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt
 (plus extensive interest), is illegal but prevalent. While violations are punishable by
 imprisonment for up to 3 years, individual state labor departments are responsible
 for law enforcement, and prosecutions arc rare.
 Based on reports from the states, the Government estimates that there are ap-
 proximately a quarter of a million bonded workers in India, of whom 223,108 had
 been "rehabilitated" by March 31, 1992. Other sources, including the Bandhua
 Mukti Morcha and the Gandhi Peace Foundation, however, estimate the number at
 10 times the government figure. Private and autonomous social organizations, such
 as trade unions, the Council for Advancement of Peoples' Action and Rural Tech-
 nology, and Action for Welfare and Awakening Rural Environments, attempt to
 identify c ases of bondage and pursue them with the appropriate oicials. However,
 even with better coordination and increased resources to overcome the complicated
 urisdictional division between central and state governments, the eradication of
 Uonded abor is proceeding slowly.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Article 24 of the Indian Constitu-
 tion prohibits employment of children under 14 years of age in factories, rins, or&
 in other hazardous employment; Article 45 encourages states to provide fre6 and
 compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14. However, these const~u-
 tional provisions have had little impact. As in the case of bonded labor, the central
 Government often blames divided jurisdiction with state governments for its inabil-
 ity to curb the practice. Poverty, social acceptance, and the failure of state govern-
 ments to make primary school education compulsory make child labor an especially
 serious problem. According to a Labor Ministry survey, one out of four Indian chil-
 dren between the ages of 5 and 15 is working. Government statistics put the total
 at 17.5 million in 1985. Other figures, including those cited by the ILO, put it as
 high as 44 million.
 Both houses of Parliament passed legislation in 1986 to ban the employment of
 children under 14 in hazardous occupations (such as glass making, fireworks, match
 factories, and carpet weaving) and regulate their employment in others. A child
 labor division set up in 1987 in the Labor Ministry is carrying out child welfare
 projects, including health and nutritional programs, designed to rehabilitate child
 workers. Government efforts were augmented in 1992 by two IL projects, funded
 by Germany, that seek to end child labor in the formal sector and reduce it else-
 where through promotion of primary school and vocational training alternatives. De-
 spite these efforts, progress has been slow. Certain industries, especially carpet
 weaving, have expanded their presence in the export market by exploiting the low
 cost of child labor. Together with other groups in the region, Indian activists con-
 cerned about child labor in July formed the South Asian Coalition on Child Ser-
 vitude (SACCS) which threatens to organize foreign boycotts of regionally produced
 carpets made with child labor. SACCS aimed its efforts at the world's two largest
 markets for South Asian carpets, the United States and Germany.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the "unorganized sector," each state sets
 separate minimum wages for agricultural workers, which are not well enforced.
 While the basic minimum wage varies according to the state and sector of industry,
 most "organized" workers receive much more than the minimum wage, especially
 when legislatively mandated bonuses and other benefits are included. The minimum
 wage is considered adequate only for the most minimal standard of living.
 The Factories Act established an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour workweek, and var-
 ious standards for working conditions. These standards are generally enforced and
 accepted in the modern industrial sectors but tend not to be observed in the more
 extensive older, smaller, and less economically robust industries. State governments
 are responsible for enforcement of the Factories Act. However, the large number of
 industries covered by a small cadre of factory inspectors and their limited training
 and susceptibility to bribery make for lax enforcement.
 Although occupational safety and health measures vary widely, in general neither
 state nor centralgovernment resources for inspection and enforcement of standards
 are adequate. Safety conditions tend to be better in the EPZ's. The ILO plans to
 hold its XIII World Congress on occupational safety and health in New Delhi in
 April 1993.
