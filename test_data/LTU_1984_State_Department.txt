 LITHUANIA*
 The largest of the three Baltic states which were independent
 between the two World Wars, Lithuania was annexed by the
 Soviet Union in 1940 and became a constituent republic of the
 Soviet Union. The United States does not recognize the
 forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R.
 Lithuania is subjected to the same centralized rule, the same
 Constitution and judicial system, the same restrictions on
 civil and political liberties, and the same police controls as
 the republics in the Soviet Union.
 Respect for human rights continued to deteriorate as Soviet
 authorities harassed and persecuted human rights activists,
 Roman Catholics, and other nonconformists. The Soviet
 campaign to suppress religious belief and eliminate
 independent political activity in Lithuania appeared to
 intensify in 1984. By letter and petition, Lithuanian
 Catholics displayed a strong sense of unity in protesting the
 imprisonment of Catholic priests.
 As in the other Baltic states, the standard of living in
 Lithuania is somewhat higher than in the Soviet Union.
 Industrial and agricultural production increased in 1983 and
 the first half of 1984, but chronic shortages of foodstuffs
 and consumer goods mar the overall economic situation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Pulitical Killing
 It has been persistently alleged that Soviet security organs
 were involved in the deaths of three Roman Catholic priests in
 1980 and 1981. All three, Father Leonas Sapoka, Father Leonas
 Mazeika, and Father Bronius Laurinavicius, had been criticized
 in the official media and died under suspicious
 circumstances. Father Laurinavicius was a member of the
 Lithuanian Helsinki Monitoring Group which sought to monitor
 the Soviet Union's adherence to the Helsinki Final Act.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Political dissidents are frequently mistreated during
 interrogation or confinement in labor camp, prison, or
 psychiatric hospital. Persons accused of publishing or
 distributing underground publications receive harsh sentences,
 including prison, labor camp, exile, and psychiatric hospital,
 typically on the charge of "anti-Soviet agitation and
 propaganda.* In 1980 Algirdas Statkevicius, a member of the
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Lithuania,
 the human rights abuses described in the report on the
 U.S.S.R. apply also to Lithuania. This report discusses only
 instances of repression specific to Lithuania.

 Helsinki Monitoring Group, who had a valid claim to U.S.
 citizenship, was sentenced and sent to the psychiatric
 hospital in Chernyakhovsk.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The provisions of Soviet law are so broadly worded that they
 have been used to prosecute persons exercising what are in
 fact internationally recognized human rights. In 1983, Jonas
 Sadunas, the brother of Nijole Sadunaite, a human rights
 activist, was sentenced to 18 months' deprivation of freedom
 for slandering a Soviet official. Sadunas was briefly
 incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital before being formally
 charged. Other examples of arbitrary arrest and detention
 include Jadvyga Bieliauskiene, who was sentenced to 4 years'
 deprivation of freedom and 3 years' internal exile for
 conducting religious activities with her children, and Edita
 Abrutiene, who was arrested I month after the release of her
 husband, Vytautus Abrutis, a Lithuanian nationalist, from
 prison. She was subsequently sentenced to 4 years in prison
 and 2 years in internal exile for anti-Soviet agitation and
 propaganda. The wife of Vytautas Skuodis, a member of the
 Helsinki Monitoring Group who has a valid claim to U.S.
 citizenship and was sentenced in 1980, has been frequently
 harassed and threatened by Soviet officials.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, Communist Party control of society is
 exercised in political cases to negate constitutional
 guarantees of the objectivity and independence of the. judicial
 process. No rights of a defendant override the
 self-determined compelling needs of the state.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through devices ranging from a network of informers to
 censorship of mail, electronic monitoring of telephones, and
 jamming of foreign radio broadcasts, government authorities
 have the ability to interfere in every aspect of personal
 life. Constitutional guarantees to the contrary, Soviet
 investigative agencies do not abstain from forced entry and
 illegal searches. Contacts between Lithuanians and foreign
 visitors are strongly discouraged, and those who indulge in
 such contacts are subject to harassment by the authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties provided that their exercise accords with
 the strengthening and security of the socialist system. As is
 shown by the frequent imprisonment of religious leaders, human
 rights activists, and those involved in underground
 publications, Soviet officials show little respect for freedom
 of speech and press. Despite the authorities' complete
 control of the legal media and strict censorship, however,
 underground publications continue to be produced.
 Publications such as the Chronicle of the Catholic Church in
 Lithuania, AUSRA (Dawn), Tautos Kelias (The Path of the
 Nation), Lietuvos Ateitis (Lithuania's Future), and
 Perspektyvos (Perspectives) appear regularly.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to associate is provided for in the Constitution,
 but the authorities strictly control all associations and
 organizations. The Helsinki Monitoring Group is not
 sanctioned by the authorities, and hence its members have been
 subject to harassment, arrest, and conviction for 'anti-state
 activity.,
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Lithuania.
 Although the Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right independently of state-sponsored and controlled
 unions have been brutally repressed. Given Soviet concern
 that the ideas of the Polish Solidarity movement might spread,
 this has been especially true in the Baltic states.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional guarantees, religious activity is
 subject to systematic harassment. Soviet authorities have
 apparently mounted a large-scale assault on religion.
 Reportedly, they are taking control of church committees and
 excluding priests from them. Because of governmental control
 over admissions to Lithuania's only theological seminary, the
 shortage of priests is such that 139 parishes are said to have
 no permanent priest. Children are harassed to deter them from
 attending church services. In school, the children of
 believers are sometimes forced to join atheist organizations
 or are punished for not joining them.
 Catholics attending religious festivities have been
 interrogated and physically abused, and historic shrines or
 artifacts have been desecrated. On March 4, 1984, the 500th
 anniversary of Lithuania's patron Saint Casimir, thousands of
 believers attended ceremonies throughout Lithuania despite
 extensive efforts by the Government to curtail the
 commemoration by spreading disinformation, withholding a
 message from Pope John Paul II, disconnecting loudspeakers
 outside crowded churches, and scheduling school activities for
 cnildren during the ceremonies. The Government refused to
 allow either Pope John Paul II or his representative to visit
 Lithuania in honor of St. Casimir, and no Lithuanian religious
 leaders were permitted to attend ceremonies at the Vatican.
 Nevertheless, the Soviet authorities approved the elevation of
 Bishop Liudas Povilonis to the rank of archbishop in the
 Lithuanian Roman Catholic Church, as well as the ordination of
 a new bishop in a public ceremony attended by a large number
 of believers.
 Because of difficult conditions created by government.
 reprisals and threats, a group of the Lithuanian Catholic
 Committee for the Defense of Believers' Rights decided it
 could no longer function publicly and has gone underground.
 Although Soviet authorities have tried to suppress its
 activities, the Catholic Church in Lithuania remains an active
 and vigorous religious denomination.
 In 1983, two Catholic priests were arrested for 'anti-Soviet
 agitation and propaganda." Father Alfonsas Svarinskas, a
 founder of the Committee for the Defense of Believers' Rights,
 a key contributor to Catholic underground publications, and an
 activist in the struggle for religious freedom, was sentenced
 to 7 years' imprisonment and 3 years of internal exile.
 
 
 1035
 LITHUANIA
 Father Sigita Tamkevicius, an associate of Svarinskas, played
 a major role in defending religious beliefs. He was
 apparently arrested during the trial of Father Svarinskas when
 he testified as a friendly witness. Many supporters of
 Tamkevicius were detained, interrogated, and in some cases
 briefly jailed when they in turn sought to attend his trial.
 Tamkevicius was sentenced in December 1983 to 6 years in a
 labor camp and 4 years in internal exile for "anti-Soviet
 agitation and propaganda.* In November 1984, Father
 Maturlonas, one of Father Tamkevicius' supporters, was
 arrested in Kybartai.
 Bishop Steponavicius and 98 priests from the Kaunas
 Archdiocese sent a letter to the Soviet Communist Party
 General Secretary in Father Svarinskas' defense, emphasizing
 the impossibility for Catholic clergy of obeying both canon
 law and Soviet law on religious activities. Later in 1983,
 some 123,000 Lithuanians signed a petition for freedom for the
 two priests despite official efforts to prevent the collection
 of signatures. The January 1984 issue of the Chronicle of the
 Catholic Church contained the text of a petition to the
 Chairman of the Presidium of Lithuania which listed 13
 specific examples of religious persecution. Included in the
 list were lack of religious literature, prohibition of
 religious processions to cemeteries, government seizure of a
 church built by the people, and prohibition of teaching
 religion to children.
 For both religious and political reasons, there has been
 opposition in Lithuania to the drafting of young men into the
 Soviet Army, particularly for service in Afghanistan. Draft
 deferment or alternative service for reasons of conscience or
 religious belief is not permitted by the Soviet regime.
 Draftees who resist service in Afghanistan have been
 maltreated and threatened with court martial for treason.
 Those who enter the military service but continue their
 religious practices are subject to physical maltreatment and
 psychological abuse.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The right to travel has been restricted even further during
 the last 4 years. Many Lithuanians have family and personal
 ties with Poland. In past years, travel back and forth was
 relatively frequent. Since the emergence of the independent
 Solidarity trade union movement in Poland in 1980, the
 Polish-Lithuanian border has been closed for extended
 periods. The importation of printed materials from Poland was
 sharply curtailed during 1981. Soviet propaganda in Lithuania
 against the Solidarity union, designed to suppress the
 formation of a free labor movement in Lithuania, was
 particularly active.
 Emigration from Lithuania virtually stopped in 1984. Although
 many Lithuanians have close relatives abroad, Soviet
 authorities use various vague phrases, such as 'against the
 interests of the state,' in order to refuse to permit the
 reunification of families. The authorities try to deter
 people from emigrating by dismissal from employment,
 psychological harassment, and alteration of the procedures for
 exit visa applications. At least six Lithuanian families have
 been repeatedly refused permission to emigrate to the United
 States. Another five families each contain a member with a
 
 
 1036
 LITHUANIA
 claim to United States citizenship. The list of those refused
 permission to emigrate to Israel includes 46 families.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, through its leaders
 in Moscow, directs and controls all political, economic,
 cultural, and social developments. It is defined in law as
 the *leading and guiding force of Soviet society' and is the
 only political party that is tolerated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Rejecting foreign criticism of its human rights record, the
 Soviet Government argues that it fully protects all
 internationally recognized human rights. It will not permit
 any investigation of the human rights situation in Lithuania.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With a population of 3.4 million, Lithuania is the most rural
 of the Baltic states. Half the labor force remains employed
 in agriculture. Until recently, it enjoyed a relatively high
 standard of living compared to the average level of the Soviet
 Union. Soviet statistics show that industrial production
 increased during the first half of 1984 by 6.6 percent over
 1983, meat production by 14 percent, and housing by 8
 percent. However, production of food and consumer goods for
 Lithuanian consumption does not meet demand, and much is
 exported to Poland and the U.S.S.R. Shortages of these goods
 are expected to continue and may lead to a deterioration of
 the average diet.
 Although the quality of housing is higher than the general
 standard in the Soviet Union, living conditions as a whole are
 not significantly better than in the republics of the U.S.S.R.
 Lithuania is far more ethnically homogeneous than Estonia or
 Latvia. Its relatively high birth rate has helped to
 stabilize the Lithuanian share of the total population at
 about 80 percent. Recent statistics, however, indicate that
 Lithuania's birth rate is declining while the rate of
 migration into Lithuania from other parts of the Soviet Union
 is increasing. These trends suggest that Lithuania may soon
 face the kind of demographic shifts that have already aroused
 the apprehensions of the Estonians and Latvians.
 Thus far, the homogeneity of the population, its strong sense
 of national identity, and the binding force of the Lithuanian
 Catholic Church have helped to preserve many of the country's
 moral and cultural traditions. Nevertheless, the disruptive
 effects of an anti-religious ideology and a policy of forced
 collectivization and industrialization have been severe.
 Rigid controls on cultural and religious expression have
 forced many Lithuanians into underground activity which brings
 them into conflict with the authorities. A reduction in the-
 amount of Lithuanian language instruction at the primary level
 in 1982, combined with a corresponding increase in the
 teaching of the Russian language and Russian history, has
 aroused fear that the groundwork is being laid for the
 cultural and eventual linguistic russification of the country.
