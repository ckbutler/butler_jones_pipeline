 JORDAN
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy with a constitution which
 grants the King broad powers. Although the King forms and
 dissolves governments and is the ultimate arbiter of policy,
 the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers (Cabinet)
 exercise considerable responsibility over many issues. The
 Constitution also provides for a bicameral parliament and an
 independent judiciary. Martial law has been in effect since
 the 1967 war, which ended with Israel's occupation of the West
 Bank.
 Under martial law, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID)
 and the Public Security Department (PSD) have broad powers to
 monitor segments of the population that might pose a threat to
 the security of the regime. Certificates of good conduct from
 the GID are needed for all public sector jobs, and for many
 private sector jobs as well. The GID must also approve any
 public gatherings or activities sponsored by private clubs and
 organizations. Under martial law, some persons detained by
 the security forces have been denied the opportunity to
 communicate with their families or attorneys for varying
 periods, sometimes for several months.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with government participation in
 key sectors--notably communications, transportation, and heavy
 industry--gradually being reduced as part of the concerted
 privatization strategy pursued by Prime Minister Zaid Rifai's
 Government, which was formed in April 1985. Resource-poor
 Jordan, which in the paqt received up to $2.5 billion annually
 in workers' remittances and financial grants from its Gulf
 neighbors, faces severe budgetary constraints as these
 revenues have fallen off sharply along with the price of oil.
 Per capita economic growth has been negative over the last few
 years, and unemployment is on the rise, particularly among
 young people leaving school. Increasing foreign debt and
 trade problems with neighboring Iraq contributed to a crisis
 of confidence in the dinar and panic selling on local
 markets. The government has recently taken steps to cut,
 spending and conserve foreign exchange, while continuing to
 expand its free market policies, but still faces in the short
 term a major shortage of reserves. Mobilizing resources to
 fight the North African locust invasion, now threatening
 adjacent Yemen and Saudi Arabia, has placed an additional
 economic burden on Jordan.
 In July the King dissolved the lower house of Parliament, in
 which half the seats were reserved for West Bank
 representatives. This action, which limited democratic
 participation in the political process at the national level,
 was carried out primarily to sever Jordanian legal and
 administrative ties to the West Bank. The principal human
 rights problems in 1988 were the absence of political parties,
 persistent government intervention in the press, the
 continuance of martial law, and the scope of powers exercised
 by the police. On the positive side were the trend toward
 increased opportunities for women and the continuation of an
 independent judiciary.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not sanction political killing. Although
 there have been political killings by nongovernmental groups
 in the past, there were none in 1988. Summary executions do
 not occur in Jordan.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There is no evidence that the Government condones or practices
 torture, although there have been reports that detainees have
 been ill-treated by the security authorities. Amnesty
 International (AI), in its Report covering 1987, noted that it
 continued to receive reports of torture, especially in the
 Amman headquarters of the GID but also in the Zarqa Military
 Prison. Jordanian law provides for the decent treatment of
 prisoners, and judicial authorities have been known to dismiss
 cases based on apparent mistreatment of prisoners. According
 to AI, a number of political prisoners were reportedly beaten
 in October in Al Swaqa prison, one of whom is said to have
 been flogged. In May 1985, the Director of Public Security
 established a special office to handle any public complaints
 of abuse by security officers and promised to punish
 offenders.' Prisons are inspected by the International
 Committee of the Red Cross.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Jordan has been under martial law since 1967, most
 persons are placed in custody by Jordanian authorities in
 accordance with the criminal code, which requires imposition
 of charges within 48 hours. Persons may then be detained
 pending trial for 15 days, or longer if a court approves the
 prosecution's request for an extension. The criminal code is
 generally applied to persons arrested for designated martial
 law crimes, which include espionage, bribery of public
 officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons, black-
 marketing, and security offenses. In the past, security
 forces have apparently detained incommunicado (or with limited
 outside access) some persons suspected of cross-border
 infiltration and security crimes. The GID can detain a person
 without trial for varying periods, but under martial law
 provisions such arrests should be confirmed within a maximum
 of 15 days by the Prime Minister, or by local administrators
 serving as military governors. Security detainees can be held
 without charge for indeterminate periods or can be charged
 formally and brought before the martial court for trial.
 In 1988 there were reports of numerous arrests of Jordanians
 suspected of organizing rallies in support of Palestinians in
 the West Bank and Gaza. These detainees were generally
 reported to have been held--some of them incommunicado--and
 interrogated at the GID Headquarters in Amman for a few weeks
 to a few months. In its report, AI also reported some
 politically motivated arrests in 1987, mostly by the GID, and
 
 
 1390
 JORDAN
 that although some detainees were held and released after a
 few weeks, others were still held without charge at the end of
 the year.
 Military prosecutors who made improper arrests or detentions
 have been disciplined and transferred to positions of lesser
 responsibility. A petition to review the legality of a
 person's detention may be brought before the High Court of
 Justice, but it is unlikely to be granted in security cases.
 Exile is forbidden by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All criminal cases, except martial law crimes and crimes
 committed by military personnel, are tried in civilian
 courts. The legal code and the independent selection of
 judges help to assure a fair trial. Trials are held in open
 court, except in a few cases such as those involving sexual
 offenses. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty and have the right to be represented by counsel, to
 prepare a defense, to cross-examine witnesses, and to refrain
 from giving self-incriminating testimony. The court appoints
 a lawyer for those who cannot afford one if the potential
 sentence is execution or life imprisonment. An effective
 appeals process may be utilized by either the defendant or the
 prosecution, except in those cases tried before the Martial
 Law Court, which has no provision for appeal.
 Civilian judges must demonstrate legal competence in written
 and oral examinations to be selected by a board composed of
 the Undersecretary of the Justice Ministry, the Chief Attorney
 General, and three judges. A procedure exists for disciplining
 judges accused of serious transgressions of the law, i.e.,
 "bad conduct." Penalties for those found guilty range from
 payment of fines to removal from office.
 Martial law crimes are adjudicated in a military court before
 a panel of three military officers trained in the law. In
 practice, the military court observes the law of criminal
 procedure and defendants are given the same rights as in a-
 civilian court. However, AI has expressed concern that trials
 by the martial law court fall "below international standards
 for fair trial." No right of appeal exists from decisions of
 the military court, but sentences of the court for martial law
 offenses must be ratified by the Prime Minister in his capacity
 as Military Governor. He has the authority to increase,
 reduce, or annul the sentences. The cases are reviewed for
 fairness by a legal advisor or the Justice Minister before the
 Prime Minister makes a decision. The military court also
 adjudicates all crimes committed by military personnel. In
 these cases, the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces must
 ratify the sentences. There have been reports of the detention
 of persons for political reasons under the martial law regime.
 Government sources estimate that there are approximately 20
 such detainees.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over most family matters,
 including marriage, divorce, child custody, and guardianship.
 The Shari'a (Islamic religious law) applies to Muslims in
 these areas, and a Shari'a court system handles disputes.
 Ecclesiastical courts handle similar matters for members of
 the main Christian sects. The civil courts administer the
 
 
 1391
 JORDAN
 cases of other religious groups. Shari'a law, however, must
 be applied to questions of inheritance for all communities.
 Some Palestinian residents of the West Bank have been
 sentenced to death in Jordan based on a Jordanian law
 permitting trials in absentia for selling West Bank land to
 Israelis, but these sentences have never been carried out.
 When eventually arrested, individuals convicted in absentia
 have been given new trials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy. Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Jordanian authorities respect the inviolability of the home.
 Police searches of homes require warrants, except in rare
 cases involving security or the hot pursuit of fleeing
 suspects. It is believed that security personnel sometimes
 monitor telephones and correspondence, but the practice is not
 believed to be widespread.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution safeguards freedom of speech and press, but
 permits limited media constraints under martial law.
 Jordanians freely express wide-ranging opinions, including
 criticism of the Government, in informal settings. Public
 debate is less pronounced in the state-owned radio and
 television networks, as well as in the privately owned (but
 government-influenced) press, where self-censorship persists.
 The Government frequently gives editors guidance on key
 foreign policy and security matters. Government interference
 on other issues is sporadic, and commentary critical of the
 regime, though tolerated, is limited. In 1988 the Government
 used emergency economic powers to reorganize the boards and
 management of Jordan's major privately owned newspapers.
 Although billed as a move to improve financial management of
 the newspapers, the reorganization increased governmental
 control over editorial output.
 Western correspondents and resident Western writers have
 occasionally expressed concern over government interference
 with freedom of the press, and some local editors reportedly
 have complained that they are prevented from covering stories
 considered "sensitive" by the Government. Individual
 reporters who fail to follow guidelines on dealing with
 sensitive issues have had their credentials lifted for several
 months, not been allowed to use a byline, been "blacklisted"
 by editors, and, in at least one case in 1988, not been
 allowed to travel outside Jordan. An American correspondent
 was expelled for a television political feature that the
 Government found objectionable. Currently all journalists
 must register with the Information Ministry and join the
 Journalists Association. Foreign newspapers and magazines are
 widely available, although subject to censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public demonstrations require a permit, rarely granted, from
 the Interior Minister. All organizations require government
 approval and may not have political objectives. Government
 surveillance of public meetings, university activities and
 organization gatherings is routine. Professional associations
 of doctors, engineers, lawyers, pharmacists, and similar groups
 
 
 1392
 JORDAN
 exist. Professionals must join these associations in order to
 practice. The associations maintain influence with the
 Government in their respective fields and defend the interests
 of their members. Officers are elected by the membership.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The state religion, Islam, is practiced by well over 90
 percent of Jordanians. However, the Government adheres to the
 constitutional guarantee of freedom of worship. The Christian
 minority (approximately 10 percent) is indigenous and holds
 senior government positions in numbers far exceeding its
 proportion of the population. There appears to be little
 discrimination against most religious minorities, who are well
 represented at all levels in the Government, military, and
 business community. Laws making harassment of religious
 minorities a crime are enforced. A variety of Christian
 groups--including Catholic, Orthodox, Armenian, and Protestant
 --maintain churches, schools, hospitals and other institutions.
 A small Baha'i community also exists. A few foreign clergymen
 reside in Jordan. Although proselytizing among Muslims is
 forbidden, conversion by Muslims is not a criminal offense.
 The only religious group restricted by the Government is the
 Jehovah's Witnesses. There is no objection to the Witnesses'
 doctrine, but it is illegal for them to organize or assemble
 in Jordan. Their religion prohibits them from taking oaths of
 allegiance, saluting flags or serving in the military, and
 these restrictions are perceived as evidence that Witnesses
 are unreliable and disloyal. Some observers believe that
 government opposition to the Witnesses is motivated by
 political rather than religious considerations. All religious
 groups must register with the authorities to obtain official
 approval. However, a few denominations have failed to
 register but are nonetheless permitted to practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within Jordan is unrestricted, except in certain
 military zones. The Government does not restrict Jordanians'
 emigration or foreign travel, with the exception of some
 military personnel and reservists who need permission for
 foreign travel. A woman must present the written consent of
 her husband, father, or male guardian to obtain a passport,
 and may be required to present the same type of permission
 when she wishes to travel abroad without her husband.
 Children must have their father's consent to leave Jordan.
 Citizens who have left Jordan have the right to return. There
 are no reported cases of revocation of citizenship for
 political reasons. The Parliament recently passed legislation
 allowing Jordanian citizens to have dual nationality. Some
 citizens returning to Jordan, particularly those who have
 traveled to Communist countries, are questioned by the GID.
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem from the influx
 of Palestinians made homeless by the 1948 and 1967 Arab-
 Israeli wars. Palestinian refugees and their descendants
 registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
 (UNRWA) on the East Bank total approximately 850,000,
 including 206,000 living in refugee camps. This figure
 includes refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, but does not
 
 
 1393
 JORDAN
 include a large but undetermined number of other persons from
 the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel who have settled in the East
 Bank since 1948. All Palestinian refugees residing in Jordan
 prior to August 1988 can obtain fully valid Jordanian
 passports, and have the unrestricted right to live, work, and
 own property in Jordan. Palestinians residing on the West
 Bank may obtain passports valid for 2 years. The Government
 also issues temporary Jordanian passports to between 26,000
 and 27,000 Gazans residing on the East Bank who are able to
 prove they were displaced prior to 1971. Jordan is unique
 among Arab states in having granted full citizenship to all
 Palestinians on the East Bank, i.e., to a refugee population
 exceeding its own indigenous population at the time. The
 Interior Minister routinely grants permits for travel between
 the East Bank and Israeli-occupied territories. Jordan has
 granted asylum even in cases which have strained relations
 with neighboring states.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Jordanian citizens, although constitutionally entitled to
 elect members of the lower house of Parliament, are not
 ultimately in a position to change their government.
 Executive and legislative powers are constitutionally vested
 in the King, who rules with the assistance of an appointed
 Council of Ministers.. The Constitution may not be amended
 without the approval of the King. Parliament is composed of
 an appointed Senate and an elected lower house. It is
 overshadowed by the executive branch, but has the right to
 propose laws and approve (or reject) treaties and laws
 proposed by the Coundil of Ministers. King Hussein dissolved
 the lower hopse by Royal Decree on July 31.
 The Constitution also gives the King broad scope to postpone
 the election of a new lower house or to recall the previous
 one. Since the Parliament was dissolved as part of a policy
 to sever Jordan's ties to the West Bank, it is unclear when
 and under what form the lower house of Parliament might be
 reconstituted. Reconvening Parliament or holding elections
 without West Bank representation would require amending the
 existing election law. Although the Ministry of Interior has
 announced that this process is under way, there is little
 public expectation of elections in the near future.
 Most municipal and town councils are elected by popular vote.
 The person receiving the highest number of votes is
 traditionally confirmed as mayor by the Minister for Municipal
 Affairs, and then by the Prime Minister. Women were
 enfranchised in 1973 and may also run for public office. King
 Hussein appointed female cabinet ministers in 1979 and 1984
 and has encouraged the participation of women in the political
 process. At the time the King dissolved Parliament, there
 were no women serving in it or in the Cabinet. Organized
 political parties are not permitted, although several informal
 political groups operate openly. All persons seek elected
 office as independents. The Communist Party is banned.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In its 1988 Report, AI reported bringing its concerns about
 human rights abuses to the Government's attention throughout
 1987, and receiving several official replies in which certain
 
 
 1394
 JORDAN
 allegations were denied. In March 1987, AI delegates visited
 Jordan to investigate alleged abuses. In December AI gave the
 Government a memorandum on torture and ill-treatment of
 detainees.
 The Government is generally responsive to inquiries on
 individual human rights cases. Representatives of foreign
 embassies and organizations such as the International Committee
 of the Red Cross are allowed access to prisoners and detainees,
 and the Government has occasionally responded positively to
 recommendations from such representatives. The Jordanian
 lawyers' professional association has a human rights
 committee, but it is relatively inactive. Other local
 organizations and ad hoc groups also occasionally issue
 statements and petitions on such human rights concerns as
 Palestinian rights and the ban on political parties. Jordan
 has played an active role in the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
 and the Crown Prince is a cofounder of the Independent
 Commission on International Humanitarian Issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The role of women in Jordanian society continued to change in
 1988. Women now account for half the student body at the
 University of Jordan. A vocational training center in Amman
 now teaches women to repair radios, televisions, and office
 machinery. Women today comprise about 20 percent of the labor
 force, compared to 4 percent in 1975. They participate
 generally in subordinate positions and most heavily in
 clerical, teaching, and administrative jobs. However, the
 number of women in such professions as medicine, engineering,
 banking, and architecture has increased significantly. Women
 also now serve as police officers, and two female Jordanian
 pilots fly for Royal Jordanian Airlines, which qualified its
 first woman airline captain before any U.S. airline. More
 women also operate businesses than in the past.
 Although equality between men and women is the legal norm, in
 practice certain traditions constrain women's freedoms. Entry
 of women into professional and academic realms, traditionally
 the preserve of men, can'spark resentment and opposition. In
 matters of inheritance and divorce, women have distinctly
 inferior status. Under Islamic law, sons inherit twice as
 much as daughters. However, while a son is required to use
 his inheritance to support his mother and sisters, a daughter
 retains her inheritance for herself. Likewise, a man may
 obtain a divorce more easily than a woman, but he may be
 required to pay considerable compensation based on the
 marriage contract. A recent divorce reform law increased
 compensation for women who experience arbitrary divorce.
 Women may also gain and retain custody of children until their
 legal majority, but they may lose custody if they remarry or
 choose to live outside the country.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Jordanians are free to join labor unions. About 20 percent of
 the Jordanian work force is unionized. Seventeen unions
 comprise the Jordan Federation of Trade Unions (JFTU), and
 there are several other unions which do not belong to the
 JFTU. Unions have virtually no political role and confine
 themselves to representing their membership in such areas as
 
 
 1395
 JORDAN
 wages and working conditions. Their effectiveness varies
 widely. The JFTU actively participates in meetings of
 organizations such as the International Labor Organization.
 Strikes have occurred in the past, but none took place in
 1988. Strikes are permitted only if the Ministry of Labor
 fails to act to arbitrate a labor dispute within 2 weeks after
 receiving a complaint from a union. Government employees, who
 compose about half of the labor force, may not legally strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The 17 unions which comprise the Jordanian Federation of Trade
 Unions (JFTU) function freely and without government
 interference or antiunion discrimination, in accordance with
 Article 23 of Jordan's Constitution. The JFTU recently
 rejoined the International Association of Arab Trade Unions
 (IAATU). The officers of each union, as well as the JFTU
 executive committee, are elected annually by secret ballot.
 JFTU member unions regularly engage in collective bargaining
 with employers. Negotiations cover a wide range of issues,
 including salaries, safety standards, working conditions, and
 health and life insurance for workers and their families. If
 a union is unable to reach agreement with an employer, the
 issue is referred to the Ministry of Labor for arbitration.
 In fact, union-employer-government relations are generally
 tranquil, so arbitration is rarely required.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is forbidden by the Constitution and is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under age 16 are not permitted to work except in the
 case of professional apprenticez, who are allowed to leave the
 standard educational track and begin part-time (6 hours a day,
 no night shifts) training at age 13.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Jordan's workers are protected by a comprehensive labor code,
 enforced by 30 full-time Ministry of Labor inspectors, with
 other Ministry employees augmenting the staff on a part-time
 basis. Duty-free trade zones are in operation at Zarqa and
 Aqaba, governed by the same labor provisions that apply
 country-wide. Jordan has no minimum wage at present. Maximum
 working hours are 48 hours per week, except for hotel, bar,
 restaurant, and movie theater employees, who can work up to 54
 hours. Workers are entitled to a weekly day of rest, rest
 breaks during the workday, 2 weeks' annual paid leave, 2
 weeks' annual sick leave and? severance pay. The law specifies
 health and safety requirements, including bathrooms, drinking
 water, and safety equipment for workers. The Government
 appears to administer and enforce its labor laws fairly. It
 has created an occupational and public safety committee, which
 studies international safety practices, recommends standards
 and conducts public awareness campaigns. Jordan also has a
 workers' compensation law, and social security covers all
 companies with more than five employees.
