 CAMEROON
 Political power in Cameroon is heavily concentrated in the
 presidency. President Biya ran unopposed in 1984 in what is
 essentially a one-party system. The President appoints all
 important government and party officials and makes all major
 decisions, although key parliamentarians in the National
 Assembly have some behind-the-scenes influence. Cameroon had
 an active multiparty system at the time of its independence.
 Under former President Ahidjo, all parties were gradually
 consolidated into the Cameroon National Union, renamed in 1985
 under President Paul Biya, the Cameroon People's Democratic
 Movement. Although Cameroon's 1972 Constitution provides for a
 democratic, multiparty system, in actuality the sole political
 party selects candidates for public office, who run unopposed.
 During the 22 years of President Ahidjo's rule, Cameroon's
 diversity and the armed violence in some parts of the country
 were used to justify authoritarian control and harsh
 restrictions on civil liberties. The Ahidjo legacy still
 shapes President Biya's policies, despite the steps he has
 taken to liberalize the political system. Internal security
 responsibilities are shared by the National Police (Surete
 National), the National Intelligence service (Centre de
 Documentation Nationale-CND), the Ministry of Territorial
 Administration, Military Intelligence, and, to a lesser extent,
 the Presidential Security Service. The Ministry of Territorial
 Administration is in charge of prisons, and during the past
 year the National Police have assumed the dominant role in
 enforcing internal security laws. The CND and the military are
 still involved in both of those functions but to a lessening
 degree.
 Cameroon's economy continues to thrive, and its per capita
 income ranks Cameroon among the middle income developing
 countries, though it remains plagued by many problems of
 underdevelopment. Growth, propelled by oil revenues, continues
 at a steady pace.
 During 1985, the human rights environment in Cameroon reflected
 mixed trends. There is some increase in freedom of expression,
 a major change from the previous regime. At the same time
 there is also continued, though diminished, harassment of some
 groups, including the press, and in some cases imprisonment of
 political dissidents and student activists. A leader of the
 outlawed Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) and a radical
 anglophone dissident were detained for extended periods without
 trial. By most estimates, there are some 10 to 20 political
 prisoners in custody, not counting roughly 200 people who
 received prison terms because of participation in the 1984 coup
 attempt.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Political Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of political killing during
 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of the disappearance during 1985.
 
 
 CAMEROON
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is proscribed in the criminal code, which renders
 evidence obtained by torture inadmissible. In addition, the
 penal code prohibits public servants from using force against
 any person. However, there were credible reports during 1985
 of ill treatment, such as beatings, during police interrogation
 and during imprisonment. Very poor prison conditions,
 including overcrowding, inadequate food and sanitation, and
 medical attention are major problems, and Amnesty
 International's 1985 Annual Report said that some Cameroonian
 prisoners had died of malnutrition during 1984. Because
 government-provided food is very inadequate, prisoners have
 reportedly suffered from severe malnutrition unless provided
 food by friends or families. The Government recognizes these
 problems and has launched a major prison construction and
 renovation program, including some $2 million in additional
 funding for prison meals. Persons under "administrative
 detention" (i.e., political prisoners) are kept in special
 camps or prisons. Access to the administrative detention
 centers by families and friends is reported to be severely
 restricted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Cameroonian law, a person arrested on suspicion of
 committing an offense may not be held for more than 48 hours
 without a court order. This provision is generally observed in
 nonpolitical cases. However, after an investigating magistrate
 has determined that the case should be brought to trial and has
 issued a warrant to that effect, there is no limitation on how
 long the detainee may be held in "preventive detention" pending
 trial. Accused persons awaiting trial constitute the great
 majority of persons in the prisons at Yaounde and Douala.
 Release on bail is infrequent.
 Citizens continue to be stopped by local police who sometimes
 harass or threaten to detain them unless a bribe is paid, but
 for the most part those detained are released within 24 hours.
 These actions are not initiated or condoned by high government
 officials and have been sharply criticized by the President.
 Persons may be held in administrative detention under
 legislation pertaining to subversion. Such detention by
 regional authorities is initially for 1 month, renewable twice,
 and may be extended up to an additional 6 months by the
 Minister of Territorial Administration. Generally, those
 arrested and placed in administrative detention do not
 disappear--their families are told where they are and they are
 eventually released, although the detention may be lengthy.
 Political prisoners, some 10-20 of whom are currently estimated
 to be in custody, are usually held under this type of
 detention. Under the state of emergency, which exists in
 portions of three provinces, authorities may also order
 detention for up to 1 week for persons judged "dangerous to
 public security." The Minister of Territorial Administration
 may also order detention of such persons for up to 2 months;
 the order is renewable without limitation. The state of
 emergency provisions were used rarely, if at all, during 1985.
 The Government announced during the Pope's August visit to
 Cameroon that an amnesty would be forthcoming for "certain
 prisoners." Although officials indicated that political
 
 
 CAMEROON
 prisoners would be among them, a late September announcement of
 the release of 20 prisoners and the commutation of the death
 sentences of 13 others included no political prisoners.
 Two well-known political figures were detained during 1985.
 The first, Fon Gorji Dinka, a radical anglophone spokesman, was
 imprisoned after calling upon the armed forces in an open
 letter to depose President Biya. Dinka was arrested on June 1
 and was still in custody at the end of the year. He has
 apparently not been mistreated while in prison, although
 anglophones have complained that he received inadequate medical
 attention both before and after the deterioration of his health
 in late September. The second well-known detainee was
 Dr. Joseph Sende, self-proclaimed leader of the outlawed UPC
 faction in Cameroon. Sende was held without trial from
 February 7 through May 22, after he had tried unsuccessfully to
 gain legal recognition of the UPC and then issued a UPC
 "position statement" denouncing the single-party system in
 Cameroon as being antidemocratic. Sende was kept in a cell by
 himself but was apparently not tortured and was allowed visits
 by family members.
 The Government keeps a close watch on student activism. On
 October I security forces briefly detained some 100 high school
 students, who had participated in a protest in Bamenda, and
 reportedly held some of their leaders for several weeks.
 There is also an unknown number of current and former UPC
 members in self-imposed exile. Some of those individuals have
 accepted the Government's offer to return to Cameroon "as
 individual citizens, not as political figures." Another
 outlawed dissident party, the Cameroon Democratic Party (CDP),
 has members in self-imposed exile since the party lost its bid
 to be legalized in early 1984.
 There are no reports of forced labor being practiced in
 Cameroon.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trial by a presiding magistrate is guaranteed by law, and this
 practice is followed with the exception of persons held under
 administrative detention. Public trials are also guaranteed by
 law, although exceptions for the public good or national
 security reasons are allowed. Trials which involve prominent
 persons or which are controversial are sometimes held in
 private. Magistrates in Cameroon are drawn from a corps of
 career civil servants and are required to have law degrees.
 Their decisions are generally not subject to government
 interference, and they are generally considered to conduct fair
 trials. Defendants in felony cases are provided attorneys if
 they cannot afford to engage their own.
 Crimes involving subversion or illegal use of weapons, as well
 as crimes involving the military, are tried by military
 tribunal. Each tribunal has three members, and its presiding
 officer must be a magistrate. In some cases, the magistrate is
 a civilian, but often it is a military officer. As in civil
 cases, defendants are entitled to either public or private
 counsel.
 
 
 CAMEROON
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both invasion of the home and tampering with correspondence are
 violations of Cameroonian law. There are reports that police
 do enter homes without warrants during periodic searches for
 criminals in lower income neighborhoods. Surveillance of
 suspected political dissidents, including monitoring of mail
 and of telephone conversations, is also common, such as the
 recent surveillance of some militant anglophones. Although
 membership in the country's sole political party, the Cameroon
 People's Democratic Movement, is not mandatory, there have been
 credible reports that zealous local party officials have denied
 routine services, such as issuance of a driver's license, to
 persons who are not party members. The Government does not
 condone such actions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution of 1972 guarantees the freedom of expression
 and press, but under Cameroonian law and practice these
 freedoms are restricted. During 1985, those restrictions were
 loosened slightly, but they remain extensive and are subject to
 Government interpretation. Informal political discussions in
 1985 are much more open than they had been under former
 President Ahidjo, and there is no evidence anyone is punished
 for privately criticizing the Government. Independent
 newspapers continued to be available in wide variety, including
 20 to 25 registered as "general information" papers during the
 course of the year. These newspapers have slowly increased
 their criticism of Cameroonian government programs, such as
 education, development, or censorship, and also offer limited
 criticism of the single party. There are still many proscribed
 subjects: University Professor Maurice Kamto was detained
 briefly for writing a critical review of a book entitled "The
 Social Ideas of Paul Biya". The newspaper issue which printed
 that article was seized by Government authorities, as were
 issues of other papers too sharply critical of major government
 or party figures. Long-standing problems with the local censor
 are also a major reason why one English-language newspaper, the
 Cameroon Times, was unable to publish for most of the year.
 There has also been a slight increase in the amount of comment
 on internal politics in the government-controlled press and
 radio, although the Government affords official journalists
 much less latitude than it does their private counterparts.
 Most official journalists are civil servants, and if they are
 not sufficiently careful in their self-censorship, they can be
 transferred to less desirable jobs. Occasionally, issues of
 international publications are seized because they contain
 articles about Cameroon which the Government considers
 inflammatory. One example was an article during the Pope's
 visit which strongly criticized Cameroon's Catholic hierarchy.
 Government restrictions on university lecture content and
 publications continue to decrease, but the Government reacts
 firmly to any signs of student protest as in the Bamenda
 incident in October.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedoms of assembly and association, while guaranteed in
 the Constitution, are restricted in practice and in law. The
 
 
 48
 CAMEROON
 Cameroonian penal code prohibits public meetings,
 demonstrations, or processions without prior government
 approval, and organizations must register with the Government.
 The demonstration by anglophone high school students in Bamenda
 on October 1 was unauthorized. Anglophones suspected of
 planning or encouraging an anglophone student demonstration at
 the University of Yaounde have also been questioned by police,
 and authorities have searched the offices of some anglophone
 professors.
 The sole labor union, the Cameroon Trades Union Congress,
 operates within the framework of the official party, the
 Cameroon People's Democratic Movement, and top union leadership
 is chosen by the Government. The union does not play a major
 role in Cameroonian politics, although it has a.membership of
 approximately 450,000 workers in a working population of more
 than 3 million. It pursues individual worker grievances and
 seeks improvements in government programs for worker safety and
 training.
 The union participates in government-regulated negotiations
 with employers, but strikes are illegal. Political activity by
 the trade union, excepting action designed to protect economic
 and other interests, is prohibited. The union cannot have
 contact with foreign trade union organizations without
 government authorization. Cameroon is a member of the
 International Labor Organization, and rank and file workers
 comprise part of the Cameroonian delegation to its meetings.
 The union is also a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and is
 generally respected. Cameroon is comprised of 20 percent
 Muslims, 30 percent Christians, and the rest animists.
 Officials of the Government and party are drawn from members of
 all denominations. Missionaries played a major role in the
 development of Cameroon and continue to be active. However,
 the Jehovah's Witnesses, who do not acknowledge the supremacy
 of the state, were banned in 1970 and have periodically been
 targets of harassment since then. In December 1984, 89
 Jehovah's Witnesses were arrested at their annual conference
 and held without trial until May 5, 1985. Observance of
 traditional religions is not discouraged by the Government,
 although acts of witchcraft, magic, or divination "liable to
 disrupt public order or tranquility or to harm person or
 property" are outlawed with penalties of up to 10 years
 imprisonment.
 Independent Muslim and Christian publications exist in
 Cameroon, and there is no evidence that they are censored more
 heavily than the secular press. The exception, again, is the
 Jehovah's Witnesses, who are not allowed to publish or
 distribute their religious materials.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by
 law. In practice, however, police frequently stop travelers
 for a check of identification, tax receipts, or voting cards.
 Exit visas are required to leave the country and sometimes are
 obtainable only after long bureaucratic delays. In some cases,
 
 
 49
 CAMEROON
 these delays may represent attempts by the Government to
 discourage or even prevent departure. The Government has also
 been known to refuse issuance of a passport, or to confiscate
 an already issued passport, in order to prevent someone from
 traveling abroad. Cameroonians who leave the country must
 deposit sums sufficient to buy a return air ticket for
 repatriation should they become stranded abroad. There are no
 restrictions on the right of voluntary repatriation. Women
 must obtain the permission of their husbands or fathers to
 leave the country.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safehaven for
 thousands of displaced persons. The Government currently
 acknowledges the presence of some 45,000 Chadian refugees in
 Cameroon, 6,000 of whom are either at the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) refugee camp in Poli or are
 in the process of relocating there. The rest of the Chadians
 have integrated into the Cameroonian economy and do not receive
 government assistance. Cameroon is also host to displaced
 persons from South Africa, Zaire, Angola, and other African
 nations, and there are roughly 100 Namibians who are in
 Cameroon as students.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cameroon continues to be a one-party state with political power
 and administrative responsibility concentrated in the
 presidency. Following the resignation of former President
 Ahidjo on November 4, 1982, his constitutional successor, Prime
 Minister Paul Biya, took office as President. In September
 1983, Biya was elected President of the Party, following
 Ahidjo's resignation. President Biya subsequently withstood a
 coup attempt from forces allegedly close to Ahidjo. While the
 Constitution implies the legality of other political parties,
 in fact, only one party is permitted--the Cameroon People's
 Democratic Movement (CPDM). Although the election law
 theoretically permits multiple candidates for the presidency,
 President Biya ran unopposed in the January 1984 elections and
 teceived 99.98 percent of the votes. The President appoints
 governors, prefects, and cabinet ministers.
 Cameroon's political system is a product of the country's
 ethnic and linguistic diversity, which includes some 230
 languages and 3 separate European heritages (French, British,
 and German). A careful balancing act, within the one party,
 takes place to maintain political cohesion. Membership in the
 CPDM is thus open to all religious and ethnic groups, but the
 party remains a centrally controlled organization. The party
 elite chooses the candidates for local offices as well as for
 the National Assembly. One candidate is chosen for each
 position by the party and is submitted to the electorate. The
 electorate has never rejected a candidate chosen by the party
 since the Cameroon National Union was constituted the sole
 legal party in 1966. The CPDM Congress in March 1985 formally
 adopted a program of democratization within the party and
 encouraged some dissidents who had formerly been excluded from
 the party to become members. The CPDM is also working on
 reforms whereby the leadership of each level of the party
 organization will be chosen by the members at that level,
 rather than selected by the hierarchy.
 Externally based dissident groups including the Union des
 Populations du Cameroun (francophone) and the Cameroon
 
 
 50
 CAMEROON
 Democratic Party (anglophone) periodically send letters or
 pamphlets into the country. The Government attempts to seize
 these documents when they arrive.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Cameroon Constitution affirms support for the freedoms
 guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
 United Nations Charter. Under President Biya, the Government
 has increased the attention it pays to human rights issues,
 both internally as a part of President Biya's program of
 "democratization" and in public statements at forums such as
 the United Nations.
 In its 1985 Report (covering 1984), Amnesty International
 expressed concern over prison conditions in Cameroon, citing
 reports of torture and malnutrition. The organization also
 called for the trial or release of several prisoners of
 conscience, as well as information on those still detained as a
 result of the 1984 coup attempt. The Government has not
 responded to those requests. Freedom House rated Cameroon "not
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Cameroon's population is approximately 9.7 million, and is
 growing at a rate of 2.6 percent per year. Over 60 percent of
 the population still lives in rural areas, but the urban
 population is expanding by 10-12 percent per year. The per
 capita gross national product ($820 in 1983) is poorly
 distributed among the population.
 Cameroon has one of the strongest economies among African
 developing countries, with a gross domestic product of $7.3
 billion (1983-84), and a 6.5 percent growth rate, due primarily
 to oil revenues, strong and diversified agriculture, a
 relatively well-balanced, market-oriented economy and prudent
 economic policy management. The rate of inflation is
 officially estimated at 14 percent, but it is probably somewhat
 higher. The rapid growth in urban population has produced an
 increased need for basic urban infrastructure, and also means
 that continuing productivity increases in food crop agriculture
 are necessary if Cameroon is to continue to produce the major
 part of its food requirements in rural areas. Many of those
 living below the poverty level (40 percent in 1978) are
 subsistence farmers.
 The average Cameroonian has a life expectancy of 54.6 years.
 Nationally, the infant mortality rate is officially 113 per
 1,000 live births but is probably closer to 127. Chronic
 undernutrition affects 21 percent of the children under age 5.
 Despite this figure, the ratio of caloric supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements was 102
 percent in 1981. Such practices as early weaning, as well as
 intestinal parasites and diarrhea, have contributed to infant
 and child malnutrition, despite the surplus of calories
 available. Malnutrition is more prevalent in rural areas.
 Based on a 1976 estimate, some 26 percent of the population is
 estimated to have access to safe drinking water; the figure for
 urban dwellers is 35 percent and for rural inhabitants 22
 percent.
 
 
 51
 CAMEROON
 The national adult literacy rate is 41.5 percent; 54.6 percent
 for men and 24.5 percent for women (1976). The school
 enrollment rate for children between the ages of 6 and 14
 averages 88 percent in urban areas and 46 percent in rural
 areas, with female students noticeably underrepresented in
 rural secondary schools.  School attendance rates are one-third
 the national average in the Muslim north, where only 22 percent
 of the children attend school. Girls are underprivileged, both
 in access to higher education and in terms of professional
 opportunities. Girls from the southern part of the country,
 although disadvantaged at the level of secondary entrance when
 compared with boys from the same areas, have a considerable
 educational lead over both girls and boys from the eastern and
 northern provinces.
 The Cameroonian national labor code sets the minimum working
 age at 14, the minimum annual paid vacation at 18 days, and the
 legal work week at 40 hours for nonagricultural employees and
 up to 48 hours per week for agricultural workers. Minimum
 monthly wages are set by the Government for all types of jobs
 in both the public and private sectors. Wage rates are based
 on geographic zones, types of industry, and workers'
 qualifications and length of service. The lowest pay levels
 are not sufficient to support a family but, in most cases, such
 wages are supplemented by a second job or another family
 member's earnings.   Workers with middle-range wages are also
 likely to need second incomes to support a family, especially
 in the high cost living areas of Yaounde and Douala. Because
 of Cameroon's healthy economy, opportunities do exist for
 workers to supplement their wage levels with second jobs.
 Occupational health and safety is mandated by law, based on the
 International Labor Organization standards. In theory, these
 standards are enforced by Ministry of Labor inspectors, but
 they lack the means for effective enforcement.
 Women enjoy equal rights under the Constitution and are
 politically active in the party and labor union. The women's
 wing of the party has developed programs aimed at encouraging
 the economic and social productivity of Cameroonian women.
 Women are represented in the modern sector, although not
 proportionately in the upper levels of administration and in
 the professions. There are currently five women in President
 Biya's cabinet, but no women governors or prefects. Women also
 hold positions in the National Assembly and, as a result of the
 1983 legislative elections, the percentage of women in the
 National Assembly increased from 10 to 14 percent.
