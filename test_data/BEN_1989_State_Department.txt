 BENIN
 The People's Republic of Benin is a single-party state headed
 by President Mathieu Kerekou, who came to power in a military
 coup in 1972. In 1974 President Kerekou declared Benin to be
 a Marxist-Leninist state under the direction of a single
 political party, the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin.
 However, on December 7, 1989, the party's Central Committee,
 the standing committee of the National Revolutionary Assembly,
 and the National Executive Council (cabinet ministers plus the
 six provincial governors), under the chairmanship of the
 President, announced that Marxism-Leninism was no longer the
 State's official ideology.
 Benin's Armed Forces number approximately 4,000 personnel. In
 addition to the regular army, there are small navy, air force,
 and militia contingents. The army is the main internal
 security force, backed by the paramilitary gendarmerie,
 regular police units, the presidential guard, and the
 Documentation and Informatioi Service, the Government's
 intelligence agency.
 Benin's underdeveloped economy is largely based on subsistence
 agriculture, cotton production, regional trade, and a low
 level of offshore oil production. In June the Government
 signed agreements with the World Bank and the International
 Monetary Fund which included austerity reforms, e.g., reducing
 the number of state enterprises, cutting wasteful fiscal
 expenditures, deregulating trade, and encouraging private-
 sector activity. Benin's small modern economy, however,
 remained depressed in 1989 due to falling world prices for
 local exports, relatively high debt service charges, and
 widespread unemployment.
 Human rights continued to be circumscribed in 1989. In the
 face of social unrest and strikes by students, teachers, civil
 servants, and even some military personnel over the
 deteriorating economic situation and alleged corruption, the
 Government cracked down hard on demonstrators in January,
 February, and December 1989, killing one worker and two
 youths, including a 12-year-old, and detaining a number of
 persons. On August 29, 1989, the President granted a general
 amnesty and clemency to 133 political detainees, to another 30
 persons accused of coup-plotting, and to 29 persons in exile.
 He also stressed the importance of human rights by: approving
 a visit from an Amnesty International (AI) mission in April;
 authorizing the establishment of a nongovernmental National
 Commission on Human Rights; and personally visiting the
 military Camp Guezo Detention Center in June to discuss with
 security officials the problem of arbitrary detention. Major
 human rights concerns included mistreatment of prisoners and
 detainees, arbitrary detentions, restrictions on freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly, and the right of citizens to change
 their government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings in Benin in 1989, but the Government's use of lethal
 force in countering public disturbances and strikes in 1989
 
 
 BEIN
 led to the deaths by gunfire of at least one striking factory
 worker at Save in January and two young demonstrators in
 Cotonou in Decermber.
 b. Disappearaj1ce
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Beninese penal code requires that prisoners be treated
 consistent With-"prison d isgipline and security."
 Mistreatment of-prisoners and detainees occurs. Cases of
 prison'death frgm torture (primarily beatings)' disease, or
 poor prison conditions. were reported by private sources and by
 AI in its 1989 Repoyt.
 There were credibie reports that two prisoners died after
 having been tortured in 1989. Serge Gnimadi, a 21-year-old
 member of the National Union of High School Teachers, was
 arrested on January 23 for allegedly engaging in vandalism and
 other activities- threatening public order during strikes in
 Porto Novo.' He died in prison at the end of February; the
 Government stgted tetanus was the cause of death. Luc    .
 Togbadja, a student arrested for transporting antigovernment
 tracts on March 3, was detained at Cotonou's Camp Guezo until
 May 6. He was then moved to the Petit Palais, a security
 forces installation, and reportedly beaten to death there.
 President 1erekou visited Camp Guezo shortly thereafter to
 investigate allegations of human rights abuses, but at the end
 of 1989 there had been no report or formal investigation, and
 no disciplinary action had been taken against responsible
 persons.
 Prison conditions in Benin are very poor. Sanitation and
 medical facilities are deficient, and the prison diet is
 inadequate unless supplemented by food from friends or
 relatives. Much public attention has centered on conditions
 at two remote detention centers: the civil prison in Segbana,
 where there had been protests in 1988, and Sero Kpera military
 camp in Parakou. The amnesty in August reportedly eased
 significantly the overcrowding in several prisons, including
 Segbana, where members of the Dahomey Communist Party had been
 detained.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 While Benin's legal system requires judicial review of
 detention, this is not always observed in political cases.
 The Constitution states that no citizen may be arrested
 without an arrest order authorized by an established judicial
 body. However, there is no time limit with respect to
 charging a defendant or bringing the accused to trial. In
 practice, persons have been detained incommunicado, some for
 extended periods, without charge and-without recourse to legal
 assistance or judicial hearing. Outside the judicial system,
 the Government has used an administrative body, the Permanent
 National Commission of Inquiry, to question political
 detainees about their activities and to decide whether they
 should remain in custody.
 The President publicly addressed the question of arbitrary
 arrest and detention in 1989. On June 20, he visited Camp
 Guezo (Benin's military and security headquarters) to discuss
 
 
 BEN8IN
 military personnel involvement in arbitrary arrests.
 President Kerekou asked security officials for a complete
 accounting of all prisoners being held at the camp and warned
 against arbitrary detention. Kerekou then organized a June 22
 working session with a number of security and judiciary
 personnel and ordered them to settle quickly all proven cases
 of arbitrary arrest. By year's end, this was accomplished.
 There was no evidence of further investigation of, or actions
 taken against, security officials.
 At the beginning of 1989, over 200 Beninese were believed
 detained in various prisons for political reasons. During the
 January-February 1989 strikes, 68 persons were arrested for
 vandalism or otherwise disturbing public order. On April 1,
 40 detainees were released from Camp Sero Kpera in Parakou.
 Among these was Dr. Afolabi Biaou, who had been arrested in
 1985 and detained since then without charge. Both AI and the
 American Association for the Advancement of Science had made
 appeals in his case. An unknown number of persons were also
 arrested during antigovernment demonstrations in early
 December. Most are believed to have been released.
 The August amnesty freed 133 political detainees, including
 several whose cases had been noted by AI, the International
 Human Rights Law Group, and the American Association for the
 Advancement of Science. They included: Anselme Agbanoundo, a
 geological engineer arrested in October 1985; Thomas Houedete,
 an economist and professor at the University of Benin,
 arrested in October 1985; Didier D'Almeida, arrested in
 November 1984; Yako Toko Chabi, in detention since 1985; and
 Jonas Gnimagnon, Chairman of the Committee of Wives and
 Relatives of Prisoners of Conscience, arrested in May 1989.
 The Government had reportedly suspected these persons of ties
 to the banned Dahomey Communist Party.
 The August amnesty also freed 30 persons suspected of coup
 plotting in 1975 and 1977. At the end of 1989, as many as 20
 others remained imprisoned for alleged involvement in more
 recent conspiracies to overthrow the Government. One group,
 allegedly involved in a March 1988 plot, is still awaiting
 trial. A second group, implicated in a Libyan-backed plan to
 overthrow President Kerekou, was tried and sentenced in
 February 1989.
 There was no use of forced exile in Benin as a means of
 political control in 1989. The August amnesty also included
 an invitation for 29 voluntary exilees to return to Benin,
 although it is not confirmed that any had accepted the amnesty
 by the end of the year.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Benin's legal system is based on French civil and customary
 law. In recent years, a civilian court system organized on
 provincial and national levels has operated, with the People's
 Central Court as the highest regular court of appeal. In
 September 1988, the Government held elections for civilians to
 sit on local tribunals for the first time. Defendants have
 both the right to be present at their trial and the right to
 an attorney (at public expense, if needed).
 In the past, the Government rarely brought security cases to
 the trial stage. However, in 1988 a new law established the
 
 
 17
 BENIN
 State Security Court, and in 1989, as noted above, a number of
 political opponents charged with involvement in a
 Libyan-backed plot were tried before this Court in an open
 trial and sentenced in February. *Their testimony, including
 segments critical of government policy, was broadcast on
 public television.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Benin's Constitution provides for the inviolability of the
 home and requires a warrant from a judge before the police can
 enter a residence. In practice, authorities enter homes
 without a warrant in suspected security cases. Reports
 indicated that the security police also monitor telephones and
 the mail of persons suspected of antigovernment activities.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-
 Public expresgioi of political opinion is'controlled, and open
 criticism of the Government, as occurred during the 1989
 strikes aid disturbances, is not permitted. However, some
 negative coverage of the Government and its policies appeared
 in the independent press during 1989. Most Beninese appear
 willing to discuss politics freely in private or in small
 groups, even in the presende of foreigners.
 The Government owns and operates the local radio and
 television stations and one daily newspaper. The Beninese
 media also includes three independent private newspapers (La
 Gazette du Golfe, Tam-Tam Express, and La Recade), as well as
 La Croix, a weekly paper published by the Catholic Church, and
 Echo, a monthly journal of opinion circulated throughout West
 Africa. The official media generally carry those stories that
 are approved by,,or serve the interests of, the-State.
 Private newspapers treat controversial political issues with
 circumspection, but many.articles appeared in the private
 press in 1989 mildly criticizing President Kerekou and the
 party on various domestic political and economic issues.
 There are limits to such criticism, however, as in March the
 Government arrested and briefly held Parfait Agbele, a
 journalist with the Gazette du Golfe, reportedly after he had
 begun research for a story on Luc Togbadja's death. In
 September the Government confiscated a number of copies of the
 Gazette after it had published a controversial opinion poll on
 the Government, and in October it suspended the paper "until
 further notice." The suspension was canceled on December 8
 but with the caveat that future editions be submitted to the
 Government for prior censorship.
 There is normally no censorship of foreign books or artistic
 works. Foreign periodicals are widely displayed on
 newsstands; and foreign radio broadcasts are readily available
 to much of the population through shortwave radio. No attempt
 is made to interfere with foreign radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In recent years, the Government has permitted the formation of
 a number of nonpolitical, private, social, service, and
 professional organizations. All meetings of a political
 nature, however, must be approved by the State. The
 
 
 18
 Government used gunfire against alleged stone-throwers
 participating in antigovernment demonstrations in 1989
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions all coexist in
 Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer any
 special status or benefit. There are no restrictions on
 religious ceremonies, teachings, or foreign clergy, and
 religious conversion is freely permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is not restricted. Passport and exit
 permits are necessary for travel outside West African
 countries but are usually not difficult to obtain. Emigration
 is common; many Beninese move to neighboring countries to earn
 a living and do so without jeopardizing their citizenship.
 The Government encourages the repatriation of its citizens
 living abroad but with only limited success to date.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees, there were 869 identified refugees in Benin as of
 August 1989, 808 of whom were Chadians who had fled the
 fighting in their country. Although some settled in Benin,
 many now were in the process of returning to Chad. The
 Government imposes no restriction on the return of refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government
 through democratic means. Political leadership is exercised
 by President Kerekou and a small group of senior officials,
 many of whom are military officers. The Cabinet and Political
 Bureau are made up of persons from a variety of ethnic groups
 and geographic areas. The People's Revolutionary Party, the
 sole recognized political party, controls the selection of
 candidates for the National Revolutionary Assembly and local
 government bodies. While party membership is not a requisite
 for holding office or for civil service employment, it can be
 helpful for political and career advancement. The National
 Revolutionary Assembly itself rarely takes issue with policies
 formulated by the President. In the June elections for the
 National Revolutionary Assembly Beninese citizens voted *yes"
 or "no" for a single slate of candidates, chosen in advance.
 There were reports of soldiers intimidating voters, and at a
 number of polling stations the principle of the secret ballot
 was not honored. The Assembly, which has little influence on
 policymaking, reelected Kerekou without opposition to the
 Presidency 2 months later.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Government considered any attempt to
 investigate human rights practices to be interference in its
 internal affairs. However, 1988-1989 saw a change in that
 policy. In 1988 the International Committee of the Red Cross
 
 
 -was permitted to visit Benin and investigate prison
 conditions. In April 1989, Al representatives visited Benin
 to di*'ii  the organization's c6ncerns on a number of human
 rights  s'sues.
 In April the National Revolutionary Assembly passed a law
 creating the Beninese.Commission on Human.Rights. The
 Commission, Which at the end of 1989 was still in the process
 of beingIdX�njzed, is a nongovernmental entity designed to
 promote human rights and review complaints forwarded by
 privat 'sdtlzqns. Jt will be comprised of 45jaembers,
 including lawyers, ripiesentatives of nongovernmental
 organizations, and government officials.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or S6cial Status
 There is no evidence that discrimination based on race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status exists in Benin.
 The Constitution states that women are by law the equals of
 men fii the 'political, economic, cultural, and social spheres,
 and the Government officially encourages opportunities for
 women. The Constitution also notes that the State "protects
 the family, in particular, the mother and child" and calls for
 the development of matdrnity hospitals and childcare
 facilities. Female employees have the right to paid maternity
 leave, although the actual enjoyment of this benefit is
 limited mostly to civil servants, teachers, and other
 profestionars. Beninese women play a major role in the
 commercial sector as well as in small-scale family farming,
 but they have not traditionally had the same educational
 opportunities as men.
 Violence against women, such as wife beating, has been given
 little attention by the Government. Civil penalties may be
 applied in cases of domestic violence, but the police and
 courts are often reluctant to intervene, considering such  -
 affairs to be "family matters." The Organization of
 Revolutionary Women of Benin serves Eo transmit government and
 party policy on such issues and make known women's views to
 the leadership.
 According to several local medical practitioners, the practice
 of female circumcision is not widespread in Benin. However,
 published reports in the United States suggest about 20
 percent of the female population is subject to this practice,
 mostly in the northern part of the country. The Government is
 making efforts to eradicate this practice through an education
 campaign conducted by government-employed health workers, and
 there are'signs that the practice is diminishing, especially
 in urban areas.
 Section 6 Workers Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Benin's Constitution states that "union activities are
 guaranteed to workers," and workers are free to'join the union
 of theii choosing. However, the National Workers' Union of
 Benin (UNSTB), which is closely linked to the Government and
 party (the President of the National Assembly acts as head of
 the UNSTB), is the only legally recognized trade union
 federation in the country. Approximately 75 percent of wage
 earners belong to organized labor unions. Civil servants are
 
 
 20
 obligated to join the UNSTB as a condition of their
 employment. In August Benin's National Union of High School
 Teachers declared its independence from the UNSTB and 2 weeks
 later held a widely publicized and cordial meeting with
 President Kerekou.
 While the right to strike is not explicitly denied or
 protected in the Beninese labor code, the last labor strike
 prior to 1989 occurred in 1975 and was forcibly suppressed by
 the Government after 3 days. However, at various times during
 1989 civil service employees at all 15 government ministries,
 teachers, and professors went on strike for nonpayment of
 salary arrears. Given such broad opposition, the Government
 did not interfere with the strikes, but it arrested several
 persons who allegedly engaged in vandalism or other activities
 causing public disturbances during the strikes. Also, during
 a strike by workers at the sugar cane factory at Save in
 January 1989, soldiers reportedly opened fire into the crowd
 in an attempt to restore order, killing at least one worker.
 The UNSTB is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is provided for under the Beninese labor
 code. Individual labor unions negotiate with employers on
 labor matters and represent workers' grievances to employers
 and to the Government. The Government often acts as arbiter.
 Until the National Union of High School Teachers became
 independent in August, all labor organizing and collective
 bargaining took place under the umbrella of the
 government-controlled UNSTB. The Beninese labor code
 prohibits employers from taking union membership or activity
 into account when making decisions on hiring, work
 distribution, professional or vocational training, or
 dismissals. Benin's labor laws apply throughout the country,
 including in the export processing zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited under Article 3 of
 the Beninese labor code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age For Employment of Children
 The Beninese labor code prohibits the employment or
 apprenticeship of children under the age of 18 in any
 enterprise. However, enforcement is erratic at best, and
 child labor does occur, especially in the subsistence economy,
 where children below the age of 14 often work on family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Benin's labor force of 1.9 million (out of a population of 4.5
 million) is primarily employed in agriculture (80 percent),
 with less than 2 percent of the population involved in the
 industrial (wage) sector. For the wage sector, the Beninese
 labor code establishes a 40-hour workweek and sets a minimum
 wage of approximately $40 per month. In many instances,
 however, the Government's ability to enforce labor laws and
 regulations in the wage sector is limited by a shortage of
 administrative and financial resources and a difficult
 
 
 21
 BI
 economic environment in which unemployment is high. The
 minimum wage level normally provides for a degree of food and
 housing for a f mily,'but in order to provide a decent living
 it usually has to be supplemented-by other means, such as
 subsistence farming.
 The Government 'has given vigorous support to policies designed
 to improve the conditions of workers in both the agricultural
 and industrial sectors. It has, for example, committed itself
 to the provision of free or low-coSt medical care and social
 services and set occupational safety standards. The labor
 code sets stringent health and safety standards, but again the
 resources needed to enforce these regulations are limited.
