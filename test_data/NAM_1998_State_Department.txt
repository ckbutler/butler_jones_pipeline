 NAMIBIA
 Namibia is a multiparty, multiracial democracy. President Sam Nujoma, leader
 of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), won the country's first
 free elections in November 1989. President Nujoma and the SWAPO party received
 just over 70 percent of the vote in the December 1994 presidential and National As-
 sembly elections, which, despite some irregularities, generally were regarded as free
 and fair. While November 30-December I regional elections were fairly administered
 and free of violence, voter turn out was only a little over 30 percent compared to
 80 percent in the 1992 regional elections. Although the Constitution limits the presi-
 dent to two terms in office, on November 4, the National Assembly passed a bill to
 amend the Constitution to permit President Nujoma to run for a third term in 1999
 and the President signed the amendment on December 7. The judiciary is independ-
 ent.
 Thepolice, supervised by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Namibian De-
 fense Force (NDF), supervised by the Ministry of Defense, share responsibility for
 internal security. Approximately 2,000 NDF soldiers were sent to the Democratic
 Republic of the Congo (DROC). The civilian authorities maintain effective control
 over the security forces, although members of the police force committed some
 human rights abuses. In late October, the Government sent NDF troops and police
 into the Caprivi region to counter a purported secession plot. There were reports
 that Government forces, particularly the paramilitary police Special Field Force
 (SFF) troops, beat civilians, and looted property, and shot and wounded civilians
 fleeing arrest. Over 2,000 Caprivians sought refuge in Botswana by year's end.
 These refugees claimed    that Government security    forces  also  committed
 extrajudicial killings and rapes. Independent observers did not corroborate these
 claims.
 Namibia's modern market sector produces most of its wealth, while a traditional
 subsistence agricultural sector (mainly in the north) supports most of its labor force.
 The principal exports are diamonds and other minerals, cattle, and fish. Mining,
 ranching, and fishing-the mainstays of the market sctor--still are controlled
 largely by white Namibians and foreign interests. However, government policy has
 been to "Namibianize" the fishing sector, so that an increasing number of indige-
 nous entrepreneurs are able to participate, and to provide opportunities for black
 Namibians in the potentially lucrative and labor-intensive tourism industry. Per
 capita annual gross domestic product is $1,860. However, there remains a wide dis-
 parity between income levels of blacks and whites. Whites have an average per cap-
 ita income of $14,000 a year and many of the poorest blacks earn just $65 a year.
 Unemployment is nearly 40 percent and affected primarily the black majority.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, although
 there were serious problems in several areas. In 1997 the Government admitted
 that since 1994 security forces had committed seven extrajudicial killings along the
 northern border with Angola. However, during the year, there were no credible re-
 ports of extrajudicial killings or disappearances. Nevertheless, the Government still
 refuses to provide a full accounting of missing detainees who were in SWAPO camps
 before independence. In 1997 the Government rejected a request by the South Afri-
 can Truth and Reconciliation Commission to hold hearings in Namibia. Except for
 the Caprivi region, there were fewer reports of police beatings or other abuse of sus-
 pects in detention. In the wake of an armed secession attempt in the Caprivi region,
 there were reports that security forces shot, beat and detained civilians. By year's
 end, over 2,000 refugees fled to Botswana. Prison conditions remain harsh, but the
 Government took some steps to improve conditions. Lengthy pretrial detention is a
 problem. A large court backlog continues to lead to lengthy delays of trials. There
 was an increased number of verbal attacks by government and ruling party officials
 against foreign and domestic nongovernment organizations critical of government
 policies and against Namibians of European descent. There was also evidence of
 growing official intolerance of criticism of ruling party policies. In addition, the
 President and other high government and ruling party officials made repeated, well-
 publicized verbal attacks on the independent press. There was also increasing pres-
 sure on journalists who worked for government-owned media outlets not to report
 critically on the Government. The Government issued new restrictions on foreign
 journalists and two journalists who entered the country to cover the secession story
 without a proper work permit were arrested and held overnight. In May the Govern-
 
 
 299
 
 ment forcibly deported a recognized refugee, Dr. Manuel Neto, back to Angola. The
 deportation was carried out in violation of a court order that expressly prohibited
 Dr. Neto's removal from the country. The Government was criticized strongly by
 international human rights organizations. Late in the year, Namibian authorities
 deported military-age Angolan illegal immigrates without judicial review, as re-
 quired by Namibian law. This led the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR)
 to charge that the Namibian Police with assisting Angolan Government in its con-
 scription efforts.
 Although violence against women and children, including rape and child abuse,
 continued to be serious problems, the President, members of his Cabinet, and parlia-
 mentarians have spoken out forcefully on these problems, which received significant
 attention at all levels of government. Courts are handing down much more severe
 sentences to convicted rapists and child abusers. However, problems remain with
 court testimony by vulnerable witnesses. Women married under customary law con-
 tinued to experience serious legal and cultural discrimination. In a June speech to
 traditional chiefs, President Nujoma called on the leaders to protect the rights of
 women in rural areas. Relatively little has been done to elevate women to high-level
 positions in government and the ruling party, despite promises by the President to
 nominate more women. Racial and ethnic discrimination and glaring disparities in
 education, health, employment, and working conditions continued, despite sustained
 efforts by the Government to reduce them. Amendments to the Racial Discrimina-
 tion Prohibition Act, passed in July, increasing penalties for racial discrimination
 while protecting free speech. Discrimination against indigenous people persists, es-
 pecially in remote rural areas where people often are unaware of their rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-While there were no substantiated
 reports of political or other extrajudicial killings by government security forces, refu-
 gees from the Caprivi region claimed that security forces killed persons while sup-
 pressing a secessionist plot.
 After repeated prodding by a local NGO, in 1997 the Government admitted that
 since 1994 security forces along the northern border had killed seven civilians with
 Angola. The admission came after the Namibian Defense Force and the Ministry of
 Defense conducted an investigation into charges that over a thousand civilians had
 disappeared along the Angolan border (see Section .b.). One NDF officer was
 charged with murder and another was found guilty of culpable homicide. Investiga-
 tions into the other killings were ongoing at year's end. In October two persons tried
 to leave the armed secessionist movement led by Mishake Muyongo in the Caprivi
 region. One was shot and killed by Muyongo's forces.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of poitically motivated disappearances
 during the year. However, a local NGO charged in 1997 that more than a thousand
 persons had disappeared along the northern border with Angola after being de-
 ported by security forces. This charge has not been substantiated; however, a 1997
 investigation by the Ministry of Defense found that Namibian security forces had
 killed seven civilians (see Section l.a.). The Ministry of Defense invited representa-
 tives of the NGO that make the claims about disappearances to participate in a field
 investigation of the charges. The NGO declined to participate. In December the
 NSHR charged that NAMPOL forces in northern border towns were assisting Ango-
 lan authorities to round up military age Angolans fleeing military conscription.
 While denying this allegation, NAMPOL did admit that border security forces do de-
 port illegal Angolan immigrates, apparently without legally required judicial re-
 views. In the wake of the Caprivi crisis, there were also reports that Zambians in
 that region also were being deported without judicial review.
 Human rights organizations, political parties, and the public continued to call for
 a full accounting of unexplained disappearances of persons detained by SWAPO
 prior to independence. In 1996 President Nujoma released the long-promised, official
 SWAPO memorial book, known as the Heroes Book, which lists the names of nearly
 8,000 persons who died during the liberation struggle. Local human rights organiza-
 tions harshly criticized the book, characterizing it as an unconvincing cover-up and
 declaring that the listing is fraught with inaccuracies and omissions regarding those
 who died or disappeared in SWAPO detention camps.
 In 1997 the Government formally rejected a request by the South African Truth
 and Reconciliation Commission to hold hearings in Namibia. Such a hearing might
 have shed light on disappearances that occurred on both sides during the liberation
 struggle. While some of the Government's critics would be satisfied with an official
 
 
 300
 apology for SWAPO abuses against these detainees, others are pressing for full ac-
 countability through a truth commission, prosecutions, and convictions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides that "no persons shall be subject to torture or to cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment;" although police continued to beat
 or otherwise abuse suspects, there were fewer reports of such incidents outside of
 the Caprivi region. A local human rights NGO confirmed that the number of abuse
 cases declined, although it noted that abuse still may occur in remote rural areas
 where citizens are less aware of their rights. While there were 25 official complaints
 reported in 1997 that members of the police beat or otherwise abused civilians, ei-
 ther during arrest or in police station houses in the north, there were no press re-
 ports of brutality during the year. Human rights advocates have noted that the in-
 crease in reported cases of brutality in 1997 may have been due in part to growing
 public awareness of citizens' rights and a willingness to report such cases. The At-
 torney General has ordered full investigations of complaints of brutality and an
 NGO official noted that at least one police officer has been prosecuted and convicted
 of abusing prisoners.
 In October security forces moved into the-Caprivi region to break up an armed
 secessionist movement. There were reports that the paramilitary police Special
 Field Force (SFF) beat and detained civilians, and looted property, and that the reg-
 ular police shot and wounded civilians fleeing arrest. Caprivian refugees in Bot-
 swana claimed that security forces engaged in extrajudicial killings and rape. Inde-
 pendent observers did not corroborate these claims.
 The Government failed to protect the leader'of an NGO critical of government pol-
 icy on the former detainee issue who had received numerous death threats, and the
 individual departed the country.
 Prison conditions are harsh, although the Government focused greater attention
 on rehabilitation programs and vocational training for inmates. Human rights orga-
 nizations continued to complain about prison overcrowding. In 1995 the Government
 created a Ministry of Prisons and Correctional Services, charged with administering
 the country's prisons and jails. The Government also is making efforts to separate
 youthful offenders from adult criminals, although in many rural areas juveniles con-
 tinue to be held with adults. There are several pilot programs that provide alter-
 natives to incarceration for juvenile offenders.
 The Government continued to grant NGO's and diplomatic officials regular access
 to prisons and prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest
 or detention, and the Government generally respected these provisions 'in practice.
 According to the Constitution, persons who are arrested must be informed of.the
 reason for their arrest and must be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours
 of their detention. Those accused are entitled to defense by legal counsel of their
 choice, and those who cannot afford a lawyer are entitled to state-provided counsel.
 However, in practice many accused persons in remote and rural areas are not rep-
 resented counsel primarily due to resource constraints. A trial must take place with-
 in "a reasonable time," or the accused must be released. Human rights organizations
 criticized the length of time that pretrial detainees were held, which stretched up
 to one year in some cases, but stated that the situation improved during the year.
 An unknown number of citizens from the Caprivi region were detained in the
 wake of a secessionist movement. Most were questioned for a short time and re-
 leased.
 The NSHR charged that NAMPOL was assisting Angolan authorities in rounding
 up military age Angolans in northern border towns. There were also reports that
 Zambians in the Caprivi region were suffering extrajudicial deportation (see Section
 1.b.).
 Authorities arrested and detained two journalists in November (see Section 2.a.).
 Some traditional leaders reportedly continued to detain and imprison persons ac-
 cused of minor offenses without recourse to police or judicial review. In response the
 Government instructed training traditional leaders on the legal limits of their au-
 thority.
 The Government generally does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The formal court system has three levels: 30 magistrates' courts, the High Court,
 and the Supreme Court. The latter also serves as the court of appeals and as a con-
 stitutional review court.
 Most rural citizens first encounter the legal system through the traditional courts,
 which deal with minor criminal offenses, such as petty theft and infractions of local
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 customs, among members of the same ethnic group. The Traditional Authorities Act
 delineates which offenses may be dealt with under the traditional system.
 The constitutional right to a fair trial with a presumption of innocence until prov-
 en guilty generally is afforded by the judiciary. However, this right is somewhat lim-
 ited in practice by long delays in hearing cases in the regular courts and uneven
 application of constitutional protections in the traditional system.
 The lack of qualified magistrates, other court officials, and private attorneys has
 resulted in a serious backlog of criminal cases, which often translated into delays
 of up to a year or more between arrest and trial, contravening constitutional provi-
 sions for the right to a speedy trial. Many of those awaiting trial are treated as con-
 victed criminals.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides all citizens with the right to privacy and requires arresting
 officers to secure a judicial warrant before conducting a search. Government au-
 thorities respected these rights in practice, and violations were subject to legal ac-
 tion.
 Under the Namibian Central Intelligence Service (NCIS) bill passed by the Na-
 tional Assembly in 1997, the NCIS is authorized to conduct wiretaps, intercept mail,
 afid engage in other covert activities, both inside and outside the country, to protect
 national security. However, wiretaps and covert surveillance require the consent of
 a judge. There were reports that the NCIS requested footage from the Namibian
 Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) of a demonstration in the northern town of Katima
 Mulilo. It was reported that the intelligence service was seeking to identify dem-
 onstrators from the tapes. NBC denied that the government-run station provided
 videotapes to the intelligence service.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respected these rights; however,
 there were growing signs of intolerance by the nation's political leaders of editorial
 criticism and increased reports of government pressure on reporters who worked for
 the government-owned media.
 Reporters for independent newspapers continue to criticize the Government open-
 ly and do not engage in self-censorship. During the year, the President, the Prime
 Minister, and other members of the Government attacked the independent press
 with greater frequency. These attacks included charges that the independent press
 was "foreign owned" and "an enemy press." While such charges may have been cal7
 culated to quiet criticism, they do not appear to have had any major impact on the
 aggressive style of the independent media. However, NGQ's involved in media issues
 maintained that reporters working for the government-owned media outlets were
 subjected to indirect and direct pressure not to report on certain controversial top-
 ics. In February the government-run radio cancelled a popular morning press review
 that publicized articles featured in the independent newspapers. After protests were
 lodged, the press review was reinstated in June before being cancelled permanently.
 In June a reporter for the government-run Namibia Press Agency (NAMPA) was
 called in to the office of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting and told that
 since NAMPA was funded by the Government, the reporter had to be more sensitive
 in reporting on the Government. The government-run newspaper the New Era gave
 frequent coverage to opposition parties and views critical of the Government.
 Human rights NGO's noted significant improvements in balanced reporting by the
 New Era, but a libel suit brought by a senior government official against the New
 Era in September was being watched closely by human rights groups. In December
 Defense Minister Erkki Nghimitima ordered Ministry officials not to discuss the
 military's involvement in DROC fighting with the press. This gag order was lifted
 after several days.
 The government-owned NBC operates most radio and television services. NBC
 provided coverage to opposition points of view. Media observers believe that NBC
 reporters exercise considerable self-censorship on certain controversial issues, such
 as the question of missing detainees, allegations of corruption, and the issue of a
 third term for President Nujoma. Despite these complaints, NBC gave coverage to
 viewpoints critical of government policies.
 There are five private radio stations, one private television station in the town
 of Rehoboth, and a private cable and satellite television service that broadcasts
 Cable News Network, British Broadcasting Corporation, and a range of South Afri-
 can and international news and entertainment programs. The ruling SWAPO party
 owns 51 percent of this cable service. There are no restrictions on the private owner-
 ship of satellite dishes and the use of satellite dishes and cable television is growing.
 
 
 There are no restrictions on Internet access or use. There are growing numbers of
 Namibian web pages and one of the independent newspapers has a popular web
 site.
 In October 1997, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MOIB) issued
 new regulations that require foreign journalists who seek to visit Namibia to pro-
 vide 1 month's advance notice to the MOIB, stating the purpose of their proposed
 visit. Journalists are required to schedule appointments with government officials
 through the MOIB and request permission to visit areas under the control of the
 Ministry of Environment and Tourism. Additionally, journalists must obtain a tem-
 porary work permit from the Ministry of Home Affairs. The MOIB reaffirmed the
 regulations in May, but there have been no reports of complaints from journalists.
 Several major conferences in the country attracted large numbers of international
 journalists. In November two foreign journalists were arrested and held overnight
 for entering the country to cover the secession story without a work permit. The
 Ministry of Home Affairs also seized temporarily their videotapes.
 The Government respects academic freedom. During the year, there were numer-
 ous seminars held at universities and other venues in Windhoek on controversial
 issues. There were no reports of interference with, or harassment of, these activities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; while in the past the Government generally has respected this
 right in practice, in 1997 the President announced a ban on all public demonstra-
 tions that did not have prior police approval. This ban was based on an apartheid-
 era law. The ban was enforced selectively in late July 1997 when police in the
 northern town of Okanguati broke up private meetings between a public interest
 law firm and its clients, Himba tribesmen, who were opposed to the construction
 of the Epupa Dam, which the Government supports (see Section 5). In August 1997
 the High Court struck down the 1989 law used by the President to justify the ban.
 In November paramilitary police broke up a meeting in Caprivi between a local en-
 vironmental NGO and representatives of the San community. However, various or-
 ganizations, including political parties, civic and religious groups, women's organiza-
 tions, students, the unemployed, and former combatants held large meetings and
 public gatherings without Government interference.
 In February Emma Kambangula, the leader of a small NGO representing the in-
 terests of former detainees (the Namibia Foundation for Torture and Trauma Sur-
 vivors) was forced to leave the country after receiving anonymous death threats. She
 had just returned from an Amnesty International conference where she had criti-
 cized the Government for failing to deal forthrightly with the former detainee issue.
 Her attorneys wrote to the Ministry of Home Affairs requesting police protection
 and provided copies of the death threats, but the Ministry never replied and protec-
 tion was not provided.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and in the past the Govern-
 ment has respected them in practice. However, the forced return in May of a recog-
 nized refugee and human rights activist, Dr. Manuel Neto, to Angola, seriously dam-
 aged the Government's record on refugee issues. According to local human rights
 groups, the Ministry of Home Affairs violated a court decision that barred Neto's
 deportation. The refoulement resulted in strong criticism of the Government by
 international human rights groups. The Namibian Society for Human Rights
 charged the police with assisting Angolan authorities in rounding up illegal immi-
 grates who had come to Namibia to avoid being conscripted into the Angolan army
 (see Section 1.b.). Another NGO charged that the Government deported several Ni-
 gerian asylum seekers, although it is not clear whether these persons had made for-
 mal requests for asylum. There were also reports of extrajudicial deportations from
 the Caprivi region of illegal Zambian immigrates following the secessionist crisis in
 that region.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commission for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) on the granting of refugee status to asylum seekers. A bill containing
 provisions for dealing with refugees in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention
 Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol was passed in 1998 but
 as of year's end, it had not been signed into law. The Government's eligibility com-
 mittee continued to meet on a regular basis to consider asylum requests. The Gov-
 ernment also assisted in the voluntary return of Angolan asylum seekers in late
 1997. Illegal immigrants continued to be detained. There was a report in June that
 children were imprisoned temporarily during a raid on homes of illegal immigrants.
 
 
 Namibia is a first asylum country and continues to permit asylum seekers to
 enter the country. There are more than 2,000 refugees and asylum seekers at Osire
 camp, 90 percent of whom are from Angola. The rest are from the Democratic Re-
 public of the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and other African countries. Gov-
 ernment officials interview asylum seekers, and those granted refugee status are
 permitted to work and attend schools, including the University of Namibia. Schools
 have been established at the Osire refugee camp. Residents of the camp are free
 to leave the unfenced facility, and many travel to Windhoek and other towns on per-
 sonal business and to sell handicrafts. In late 1997, 129 Angolan refugees were re-
 patriated voluntarily to Angola.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right and exercised it for the second time in December 1994
 in what observers generally agreed, despite some irregularities, was a free and fair
 for presidential and parliamentary elections. Elections for regional councilors held
 November 30-December 1 were judged to be fairly administered. However, voter
 turnout fell to slightly over 30 percent from 80 percent in the 1992 regional council
 elections. SWAPO candidates ran unopposed in 28 of 102 constituencies and now
 controls ten of the country's 13 regional councils. Regional councilors select the
 members of the National Council, the upper legislative body. Some observers blame
 the low voter turnout on voter disillusionment and the lack of competitive opposition
 parties.
 The Directorate of Elections makes special efforts to keep voters informed by
 printing posters and distributing useful and informative voter guides with lists of
 government and opposition candidates. Opposition parties were afforded television
 time during the year on the government-run national television network to promote
 their platforms for the February local elections. In the 1994 national elections, there
 were televised debates. Opposition parties are able to campaign freely and many
 new local parties, also known as "ratepayer associations," were formed in 1998 to
 contest local council seats.
 The Government took further steps in July to ensure free and fair elections by
 creating an independent electoral commission and naming a broad-based group of
 respected individuals to the commission. The Government also named a well-re-
 spected former journalist as the new Director of Elections.
 The Constitution establishes a bicameral Parliament and provides for general
 elections every 5 years and regional elections every 6 years. Incumbent President
 Sam Nujoma was reelected to a second 5-year term of office during the country's
 first post independence elections for the National Assembly and presidency in De-
 cember 1994. Although the Constitution limits the president to two terms, in 1997
 the ruling SWAPO's National Congress recommended that the Constitution be
 amended to permit President Nujoma to run for a third term. In November the Na-
 tional Assembly passed and the National Council approved a bill to amend the Con-
 stitution. The President signed the amendment in December.
 Leaders of the opposition have criticized the ruling party for its decision to amend
 the Constitution to permit the President to seek a third term. Ambassador Ben
 Ulenga, Namibia's High Commissioner to Great Britain and also a high-level ruling
 party official, resigned from his diplomatic post after he was unsuccessful in getting
 the ruling party to debate the third term issue. With his resignation, he lost his
 pension and other work-related benefits.
 During most of the year, the ruling SWAPO party held 53 of the 72 elected Na-
 tional Assembly seats, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, the major opposi-
 tion party) had 15 seats, ana three smaller parties occupied a total of 4 seats. How-
 ever, because of his involvement in the Caprivi secessionist attempt, DTA leader
 Mishake Muyongo forfeited his seat, which will be filled in a by-election. At year's
 end, other DTA National Assembly members from Caprivi continued to hold their
 seats.
 Members of the National Assembly are elected on a party list system on a propor-
 tional basis.
 In 1997 the ruling SWAFO party voted to change the voting procedure under the
 Local Authorities Act to require that local elections be held on a party list instead.
 of a ward system. While it was believed that this change would favor the ruling
 SWAPO party, opposition parties competed fully in local elections held in February,
 capturing 19 of 45 municipalities. There were also major gains for women, as they
 won 131 seats, roughly 40 percent of all local council elected positions. In February
 a national conference in Windhoek brought together locally elected female officials
 from all over the country.
 
 
 304
 Women increasingly are involved in the political process. However, at the national
 level, women remain seriously underrepresented despite promises by SWAPO to in-
 crease the number of women on the party's appointed central committee. There are
 2 female ministers and 3 female deputy ministers out of a total of 42 ministerial
 and deputy ministerial positions. In addition, two women hold cabinet-level posi-
 tions, as Director of the Department of Women Affairs in the Office of the President
 and Director of the National Planning Commission. Another woman serves as
 Ombudswoman. Women hold 15 of 98 parliamentary seats in the National Assem-
 bly. In 1996 female legislators formed a Women's Caucus in Parliament to review
 legislation for gender sensitivity.
 Historic economic and educational disadvantages have served to limit the partici-
 pation of the indigenous San ethnic group in politics, although virtually all of the
 country's other ethnic minorities are represented in Parliament and in senior posi-
 tions in the Cabinet. Members of smaller ethnic groups hold the offices of Prime
 Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Speaker of the
 National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 During the year, there was a growing intolerance on the part of the nation's politi-
 cal leaders of criticism by nongovernmental organizations. In June the President
 threatened to "deport" or "get rid of' foreign nationals who "disturb the peace in Na-
 mibia." The President specifically criticized the Legal Assistance Centre (LAC), a
 well-respected indigenous NGO with a long record of opposing apartheid and fight-
 ing for the rights of the most underprivileged elements in society. The LAC has pro-
 vided counsel to the Himba people, a traditional semi-nomadic group that opposes
 construction of the Epupa Dam. While no actions were taken against the NGO, the
 President's remarks had a chilling effect on those working with indigenous groups.
 The deportation of Angolan human rights activist Dr. Manuel Neto also came
 shortly after the Angolan refugee had announced the formation of the Angolan
 League for Human Rights (LADH), an NGO closely aligned with the National Soci-
 ety for Human Rights (NSHR). The NSHR is a frequent critic of the Government,
 and in 1997 the Government briefly opposed the granting of consultative status at
 the United Nations Economic and Social Council to the NSHR. The NGO subse-
 quently was granted consultative status.
 Despite the verbal attacks on the LAC, local NGO's such as the LAC, the NSHR,
 the Breaking the Walls of Silence Movement, and those working with indigenous
 groups, continue to criticize government policies freely. In addition, human rights
 organizations such as the Media Institute for Southern Africa, the Center for Ap-
 plied Social Sciences, and the Human Rights Documentation Center worked openly
 on a variety of human rights issues affecting the press, women, ethnic minorities,
 and other groups. In June the Namibian Nongovernmental Organization Forum
 (NANGOF) publicly criticized "growing sentiments and practices of political intoler-
 ance" by the nation's political leadership
 Representatives of international human rights organizations traveled to Namibia
 and discussed human rights issues with governmental and nongovernmental rep-
 resentatives on several occasions; however, President Nujoma accused "foreigners"
 of interfering in Namibia's affairs on several occasions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, gender, or religion,
 and specifically prohibits "the practice' and ideology of apartheid.' During the year,
 there was a significant improvement in the attention paid to women's issues and
 the rights of the disabled.
 Women.-Violence against women, including beating and rape, is widespread. Tra-
 ditional attitudes regarding the subordination of women exacerbate problems of sex-
 ual and domestic violence. However, there continued to be an improvement in the
 attention paid to the problems of rape and domestic violence. Government ministers
 joined in public protests against violence. The President, members of his Cabinet,
 and parliamentarians continued to speak out against violence. Longer prison sen-
 tences have been handed down to convicted rapists and abusers, although a problem
 remained with respect to vulnerable witnesses in rape and abuse cases. Police stat-
 ed that more women came forward to report cases of rape and domestic violence.
 A Ministry of Justice official announced in June that a special course in gender sen-
 sitivity would be introduced at the newly inaugurated police training center. Cen-
 ters for abused women and children in Oshakati, Windhoek, Keetmanshoop, Walvis
 Bay, and Rehoboth are staffed with specially trained female police officers to assist
 
 
 305
 
 victims of sexual assaults. Safe houses are opening in Mariental, Swakopmund, and
 Tsumeb.
 In 1996 the President elevated the head of the Department of Women Affairs to
 cabinet rank. The passage in that year of the Married Persons Equality Act also
 prohibited discriminatory practices against women married under civil law. Women
 married in customary (traditional) marriages continue to face legal and cultural dis-
 crimination. During the year, Oshiwambo chiefs denounced traditional practices
 that permit family members to confiscate the property of deceased men from their
 widows and children. Efforts are underway to address this problem and it has been
 reduced considerably.
 In June President Nujoma addressed traditional leaders and made a forceful case
 for better treatment of women in traditional communities.
 Children.-The Constitution enumerates children's rights, including those in the
 area of education and health. The Government devotes 31 percent of the national
 budget to education and an additional 15 to 20 percent towards health. In practice,
 however, outmoded policies and laws and an untrained work force lead to inad-
 equate attention to child welfare. Many San children do not attend school, and it
 is difficult for the Government to afford basic protections to children living on re-
 mote commercial farms.
 Child abuse is a serious and increasingly acknowledged problem. The authorities
 vigorously prosecuted cases involving crimes against children, particularly rape and
 incest. Courts handed down stiffer sentences against child rapists and the Govern-
 ment provided training for police officials to improve the handling of child sex abuse
 cases. Centers for abused women and children are working actively to reduce the
 trauma suffered by abused children. The LAC has launched a national campaign to
 revise legislation on child maintenance.
 The Government expanded programs to separate juvenile offenders from adults in
 the criminal justice system. Separate facilities for child offenders have been estab-
 lished in Windhoek and Mariental.
 People With Disabilities.-While discrimination on the basis of disability is not ad-
 dressed in the Constitution, the Labor Act of 1992 prohibits discrimination against
 disabled persons in employment. However, enforcement in this area is weak.
 The Government does not require legally special access to public buildings for the
 disabled, and many ministries remain inaccessible to the disabled. However, some
 municipal governments have installed ramps and special curbing for the disabled
 at street crossings. Disability issues received greater attention during the year, with
 wider press coverage of the human rights problems that confront persons with dis-
 abilities. In December the Government launched a campaign to expand economic op-
 portunities for and change attitudes about persons with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.-The Bushmen, also known as the San people, the country's
 earliest known inhabitants, historically have been exploited by other ethnic groups.
 The Government has taken a number of measures to end societal discrimination
 against the San, including seeking their advice about proposed legislation on
 communally held lands andincreasing their access to primary education. However,
 little has been done to bring San representatives into the Government, and many
 San children do not attend school. Reports from the NSHR and in the press claim
 that civilians from the Mafwe and Khoe San ethnic groups were targeted for harass-
 ment during the police campaign against Caprivi separatists.
 By law all indigenous groups participate equally in decisions affecting their lands,
 cultures, traditions, and allocations of natural resources. However, Bushmen and
 other indigenous citizens have been unable to exercise fully these rights as a result
 of minimal access to education and economic opportunities under colonial rule, and
 their relative isolation.
 In 1997 authorities arrested 73 members of the Hai/oin Bushmen community for
 blocking the gates to a national game park. The Bushmen were protesting in sup-
 port of the return of their ancestral lands, which had been seized in order to create
 the park. The Hal/om maintained that their previous requests to discuss the case
 with government officials had been ignored. The protesters were released on bail,
 and later in the year the case was dropped.
 In 1997 the Government unilaterally announced plans to expand a prison in the
 West Caprivi Game Park on land claimed by the Kxoe ethnic group. The expansion
 would deny access by members of the Kxoe ethnic group to revenues from commu-
 nity-based tourism projects on their lands. The projects are an important mecha-
 nism for empowering the Kxoe to benefit from tourism activities in their community.
 However, there is some question regarding the Kxoe's right to occupy that land, As
 of year's end, no final decision on the prison expansion had been announced.
 The Government plans to build a hydroelectric dam on the Kunene River that
 would flood ancestral graves and grazing areas of the semi-nomadic Himba people.
 
 
 The project is highly controversial. The Government has made repeated efforts to
 consult with Himba leaders regarding the project, but many of the Himba chiefs re-
 main adamantly opposed to the project. Government leaders have criticized harshly
 those opposed to the project, terming them "enemies of development." In 1997 police
 in Okanguati broke up a private meeting between Himba chiefs and their lawyers
 (see Section 2.b.).
 The Traditional Authorities Act, which came into effect in 1995, defined the role,
 duties, and powers of traditional leaders. The act provided that customary law that
 is inconsistent with provisions of the Constitution is invalid. It enumerated the
 types of crimes that may be dealt with in traditional courts. The act assigned to
 traditional leaders the role of guardians of culture and tradition, and also mandated
 that traditional leaders elected to Parliament choose between their traditional and
 elected offices before the end of 1996. This provision has not been enforced, and sev-
 eral traditional leaders remain in Parliament.
 The Government's power to confer recognition or withhold it from traditional lead-
 ers, even in opposition to local preference, is especially controversial because of the
 leaders influence on local events including local police powers. In some cases, the
 Government has withheld recognition from genuine traditional leaders who have
 sympathy for the political opposition. This has been especially true in the Khoe San
 and Mafwe communities in the Caprivi and in the Herero community. In June a
 number of traditional leaders boycotted the inauguration of the Traditional Leaders'
 Council, claiming that the installation was illegal, as some of the leaders chosen by
 the Government did not represent their communities.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination
 based on race and other factors and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology
 of apartheid." In July Parliament passed amendments to the 1991 Racial Discrimi-
 nation Prohibition Act that strengthened the act and the penalties for discrimina-
 tory practices. The act codified certain protections for those who cite racial discrimi-
 nation in the course of research or in trying to reduce racial disharmony. Neverthe-
 less, as a result of more than 70 years of South African administration, societal, ra-
 cial, and ethnic discrimination persists. There were several reported cases of black
 farm workers suffering'discrimination in remote areas at the hands of white farm
 owners. Increasing references in 1998 to white Namibians as "foreigners" by senior
 government officials were contrary to professed government efforts to promote na-
 tional reconciliation. Many non-whites continued to complain that the Government
 was not moving quickly enough in education, health, housing, employment, and ac-
 cess to land.
 Some opposition parties, including members of the Herero and Nama ethnic
 groups, also complained that the SWAPO-led government provided more develop-
 ment assistance to the numerically dominant Ovambo ethnic group of far northern
 Namibia than to other groups or regions of the country. In 1997 leaders of the
 "Baster" community in Rehoboth reached an understanding with the Government
 and dropped their demand that the Government return the community's "traditional
 lands" that had reverted to the central Government upon independence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association,
 including freedom to form and join trade unions. The 1992 Labor Act extended that
 right to public servants, farm workers, and domestic employees. However, farm
 workers and domestic servants working on rural and remote farms often are igno-
 rant of their rights and as a result, suffer abuse. Trade unions have no difficulty
 registering, and there are no government restrictions on who may serve as a union
 official. No union has been dissolved by government action. In 1997 members of the
 Namibian public service held vigorously contested union elections.
 Unions are independent of the Government and may form federations. The two
 principal -trade union organizations are the National Union of Namibian Workers
 (NUNW) and the Namibia Federation of Trade Unions (NFTU). The NUNW for-
 merly was affiliated with the ruling SWAPO party but became nominally independ-
 ent. The NFTU, launched in October and made up of several large public service,
 teachers, mining, and maritime unions, is more critical of the Government. Less
 than 20 percent of full-time wage earners are organized.
 Except for workers providing essential services such as, jobs related to public
 health and safety, and workers in the export processing zones (EPZ's), workers enjoy
 the right to strike once conciliation procedures have been exhausted. There are
 EPZ's at the Walvis Bay and Oshikango industrial parks and a number of single-
 factory EPZ's outside of these parks. Under the Labor Act, strike action can be used
 only in disputes involving specific worker interests, such as pay raises. Disputes
 over worker rights, including dismissals, must be referred to a labor court for arbi-
 
 
 tration. The Labor Act protects workers engaged in legal strikes from unfair dismis-
 sal.
 Unemployment, which is nearly 40 percent, remained a significant problem and
 affected primarily the black majority. Apartheid-era attitudes among some employ-
 ers contributed to a divisive, 10-week strike at a major mining firm in 1997. The
 atmosphere at the three-mine sites was tense and occasionally violent. Although the
 confrontation was defused temporarily by high-level government intervention, the
 mine filed for bankruptcy.
 Trade unions are free to exchange visits with foreign trade unions and to affiliate
 with international trade union organizations. Unions have exercised this right with-
 out interference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Act provides
 employees with the right to bargi   individually or collectively. Collective bargain-
 ing is not practiced widely outside the mining and construction industries. However,
 as unions become more active, informal collective bargaining is becoming more com-
 mon.
 The Labor Act provides a process for employer recognition of trade unions and
 protection for members and organizers. The law also empowers the Labor Court to
 remedy unfair labor practices and explicitly forbids unfair dismissals, which may be
 appealed to the Labor Court.
 The Labor Act applies to the EPZ in Walvis Bay with certain exceptions. Some
 trade unionists continued to challenge the constitutionality of the agreement
 reached by government and NUNW representatives in because it precludes strikes
 and lockouts. Under the agreement, labor-related issues in the EPZ are referred to
 a special EPZ dispute settlement panel composed of employers and workers for ex-
 peditious resolution. With only a few businesses operating in the Walvis Bay EPZ,
 the effectiveness of this agreement in securing the rights of workers in the EPZ
 could not yet be determined.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced and bond-
 ed labor by adults and children. However, during the year, there were ongoing re-
 ports in the media that farm workers (including some children on commercial farms)
 and domestic workers often receive inadequate compensation for their labor and are
 subject to strict control by employers. Ministry of Labor inspectors sometimes en-
 countered problems in gaining access to the country's large, privately-owned com-
 mercial farms in order to investigate possible labor code violations.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Under the
 1992 Labor Act, the minimum age for employment is 14 years, with higher age re-
 quirements for certain sectors such as mining, construction, and for night work.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors generally enforce minimum age regulations, but chil-
 dren below the age of 14 often work on family and commercial farms, and in the
 informal sector. The 1991 census, which reported on the status of children, esti-
 mates that 13,800 children under 15 years of age were in the labor force. Of this
 total, 41 percent were working as unpaid laborers on family and commercial farms.
 Boys in rural areas traditionally start herding livestock at the age of 7. According
 to 1991 figures, approximately 2 percent of farm workers were children (mainly
 from the San ethnic group). There were also reports that Angolan and Zambian chil-
 dren, who are not protected by the Labor Act, worked on communal and cattle farms
 in border areas. The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but
 some children worked without compensation on commercial farms (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage law. In
 Windhoek's non-white urban area townships, many workers and their families have
 difficulty maintaining a minimal standard of living. White citizens earn significantly
 more on average than do black citizens, in large part because whites own most of
 the country's productive resources and have had access to education that enables
 them to take advantage of the skilled labor shortage.
 After independence, the standard legal workweek was reduced from 46 to 45
 hours, and requires at least one 24-hour rest period per week. An employer may re-
 quire no more than 10 hours per week of overtime. The law mandates 24 consecu-
 tive days of annual leave, at least 30 workdays of sick leave per year, and 3 months
 of unpaid maternity leave. However, in practice these provisions are not yet ob-
 served or enforced rigorously by the Ministry of Labor. In 1996 two important NGO
 studies-one of farm workers and the other of domestic employees-highlighted the
 extremely poor conditions that some employees encounter while working in these oc-
 cupations.
 The Government mandates occupational health and safety standards. The Labor
 Act empowers the President to enforce these standards through inspections and
 criminal penalties. The law requires employers to ensure the health, safety, and
 
 
 308
 
 welfare of their employees. It provides employees with the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations.
