 COMOROS
 Feudal rule and the dominance of Islam have long been
 the main characteristics of society in the Comoro Islands.
 This tradition survived the French colonial period, but
 was interrupted shortly after independence by the estab-
 lishment in August 1975 of a regime headed by Ali Soilih.
 His regime gave a great deal of authority to youth,
 strove to modernize society, collectivize the economy,
 and reduce the role of Islam, often by brutal means. Ali
 Soilih was overthrown and killed in May 1978 in a coup
 effected by French mercenaries acting on behalf of former
 Chief of State Ahmed Abdallah, a wealthy merchant and the
 dominant figure in the Comorian Island of Anjouan. The
 new government headed by Abdallah denies any intention of
 returning to the past, but is conservative economically,
 politically, and socially.
 Ali Soilih's overthrow was greeted with relief by most
 Comorians, as his government had become increasingly
 repressive. Ahmed Abdallah and his mercenary supporters,
 a number of whom remain in the islands, have ruled with a
 far lighter hand but have occasionally resorted to
 censorship and repressive action to discourage criticism
 and stop some manifestations of political opposi-
 tion. Ahmed Abdallah ran unopposed in the presidential
 campaign of 1978 and was elected by a 99 percent vote.
 Elections for various subordinate government positions
 and bodies were contested, but the officially backed
 candidates usually were elected. All political parties
 have been banned for a period of 12 years.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Two individual cases of torture by the present government
 have been reported which ended in the death of the
 victims, but there is no information to corroborate this
 report. The new federal constitution, adopted on October
 1, 1978, guarantees certain rights on the basis of the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and specifies that
 penal law and procedures are to be governed by federal
 law, but does not mention torture specifically.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Five persons were killed during the May 1978 coup, and
 Chief of State Ali Soilih was killed in the coup's
 aftermath under circumstances that are not clear.
 Conditions of detention have always been poor in the
 Comoros and prisoners have to depend on food provided by
 their relatives. Common law prisoners, however, have
 traditionally been allowed out during the day to work on
 their fields.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no instances of disappearance in 1980.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A number of persons, most of them former government offi-
 cials, were arrested immediately following the Hay 1978
 coup and are to be tried for crimes committed under the
 old regime. At an extraordinary session starting August
 29, 1979, the national assembly began consideration of
 the establishment of a special court to try these indi-
 viduals. According to a critical press article in a
 nearby country, a number of other individuals have been
 arrested since the coup on suspicion of plotting against
 the state. The government admits to holding about twenty
 persons from the old regime, but other estimates of
 individuals held for political reasons have been as high
 as fifty. Amnesty International Report 1980 estimates
 about 43 individuals have been held without trial since
 the present government took power in 1978. Some of these
 persons were brought to trial in 1980 (see below).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The new penal laws and procedures called for by the
 constitution are yet to be established, and presumably
 French law still applies with all its guarantees. The
 constitution specifies the right of all citizens to
 trial, and to legal defense. The long-planned trials of
 imprisoned military officers, accused of having partici-
 pated in a 1978 "massacre" of 12 persons under the Ali
 Soilih regime, took place in December 1980. Fourteen
 officers received sentences ranging from life imprison-
 ment, to 20 years, to six months incarceration. The
 trials were conducted by a specialy created 15-member
 court and, according to the press, were public and
 broadcast on the radio. It is not known whether any
 other prisoners await judgment by the special court. Two
 prisoners, according to the press, were released in May
 1980 as a clemency measure. The constitution guarantees
 the independence of judges and calls for public trials,
 "except in certain specified cases". The latter are not
 identified.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution provides qualified protection for the
 idviolability of the home "on the conditions prescribed
 by the laws of the republic".
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The economy of the Comoros was affected severely when
 the French ended their subsidies in 1975 following the
 island's unilateral declaration of independence. In
 1978 relations with France were restored, and France is
 providing military, technical, and financial assist-
 ance. International donor institutions, some Arab
 countries and western European countries have also
 provided assistance to both the Ali Soilih regime and the
 present government. Ahmed Abdallah believes strongly in
 free enterprise and the principal government intervention
 in the economy at this time is price control at the
 retail level. Economic development plans have only
 begun to be formulated, primarily by newly arrived
 
 
 61
 French counselors, upon whom the Comorian authorities are
 heavily dependent. Most of the islanders are illiterate
 and poor, living on subsistence agriculture, fishing, or
 working in the vanilla and essential oil plantations
 which provide the principal Comorian exports. There are
 serious deficiencies in food, clothing, shelter, and
 health care.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 There is only one information medium, the national radio
 which has always been government-owned and operated.
 There have been two reported cases of outside publica-
 tions being banned from the country and one case of a
 foreign reporter being evicted arbitrarily. There have
 been a few instances of security forces breaking up
 gatherings of students demonstrating against the govern-
 ment. One such gathering occurred at the grave of
 Ali Soilih. Islam is the state religion of the Comoros.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no obstacles to internal and external travel
 or emigration.
 a. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The new constitution guarantees everyone the right to
 vote. The government is reported to have used subtle
 intimidation measures to influence the various elec-
 tions held in late 1978 and the continued presence of a
 small number of mercenaries is a deterrent to the full
 exercise of political rights by the opposition. While
 opposition candidates did get votes, most government-
 backed candidates won. Considerable liberty of expres-
 sion was noted in the process of establishing the new
 government's institutions. The right of labor to strike
 is guaranteed by the constitution but is not known to
 have been exercised. While the rights of women are
 guaranteed, their exercise is discouraged by tradition.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In reply to Amnesty International's queries about the
 fate of Ali Soilih and the imprisoned members of his
 government, the Ahmed Abdallah government has stated
 that Soilih was killed trying to escape and affirmed
 that the detainees would receive fair trials in open
 courts which international observers would be allowed
 to attend.
 Amnesty International has also protested reported death
 sentences pronounced against four Comorian prisoners
 for acts which they had performed while officials of
 the Ali Soilih government. The four men are Salim
 Hamidi, a former Minister of Interior, Ali Toihir Kefe,
 formerly responsible for national defense, Amahada
 Mohamed, and Aboul Wahamed. The latter two men are
 
 
 62
 identified simply as former members of the Ali Soilin
 government. The death sentence was reportedly pronounced
 by a special tribunal headed by President Ahmed Abdallah
 and composed of government ministers which had been set up
 to try such cases. In a subsequent broadcast, the
 Comorian government denied Amnesty International's
 statement end said no death sentences had been pronounced.
 The International Federation of the Rights of Man issued
 a critical report on the Comoros' treatment of political
 prisoners in mid 1980. An opposition movement, critical
 of the human rights situation but also apparently moti-
 vated by disagreement with President Abdallah's redistri-
 bution of cabinet posts in July, was formed by exiles in
 Paris late in the year.
