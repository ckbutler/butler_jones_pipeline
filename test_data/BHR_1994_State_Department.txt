 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain is a monarchy that has been ruled since the late 18th century by the Al-
 Khalifa family, which dominates its society and government. It has no political par-
 ties or elected representative institutions. The Constitution confirms the Amir as he-
 reditary ruler. The current Amir, Sheikh Isa Bin Sulman AI-Khalifa, governs with
 the assistance of his younger brother, the Prime Minister, his son, the Crown
 Prince; and an appointed Cabinet of Ministers. In 1975 the Government suspended
 some provisions ofthe 1973 Constitution, including those articles relating to the Na-
 tional Assembly, which the Government disbanded in the same year. The Govern-
 ment faces few judicial checks on its actions. Bahrainis belong to the Shi'a and
 Sunni sects of Islam, with the Shi'a comprising over two-thirds of the indigenous
 population. Sectarian and ethnic divisions exist among the Shi'a. Despite their mi-
 nority status, the Sunnis predominate because the ruling family is Sunni and is
 supported by the armed forces, the security service, and powerful Sunni and Shi'a
 merchant families.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security. Under its auspices, the
 Public Security Force (police) and the extensive Security Service are responsible for
 maintaining internal order. The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) defends against ex-
 ternal military threats. It does not play any role in internal security.
 Bahrain has a mixed economy, with government domination of many basic indus-
 tries, including the important oil and aluminum industries. The Government has
 used its modest oil revenues to build an advanced infrastructure in transportation
 and telecommunications. Bahrain is a regional financial and business center. Tour-
 ism is also a sig." cant source of income.
 There was little change in the human rights situation: civil liberties remained
 broadly circumscribed. The main abuses included arbitrary and incommunicado de-
 tention; involuntary exile; the absence of impartial inspection of detention and pris-
 on facilities; some instances of abuse of detainees; restrictions on the right to a fair
 public trial, especially in the Security Court; and restrictions on freedom of speech
 and press, freedom of assembly and association, women's rights, and worker rights.
 As a practical matter, the people do not have the right to change their government.
 In early December, a Shi'a imam and approximately 12 of his followers were ar-
 rested for inciting violence against the Government and foreign residents. Protesters
 staged large and sometimes violent demonstrations in Manama and in several Shi'a
 villages to demand his release. Three protesters and 1 policeman were killed in the
 unrest, and the police detained about 500 to 600 persons. Nearly all the detainees
 were arrested for committing illegal acts such as skirmishing with police or vandal-
 ism. Demonstrations continued into January 1995. The police arrested several hun-
 dred more demonstrators.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KIdling.-There were no reports of political or
 extraudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture. Little is known about the treatment of detainees and
 prisoners because the authorities restrict prison visits. During interrogations the
 police reportedly have beaten detainees on the soles of their feet. Credible evidence
 exists that the authorities at Al-Jaw Security Prison used excessive force to restrain
 or punish a small number of prisoners who staged a 10-day hunger strike in April.
 Convicted prisoners, including those sentenced for security offenses, have regular
 access to medical care and may receive visits from family members, usually once
 a month. On at least one occasion, a prisoner serving a life sentence for a security
 offense was given a 1-day furlough to visit his family following the death of his fa-
 ther.
 The Government denies that torture takes place. However, it has not imple-
 mented minimal procedural safeguards nor allowed inspection of detention facilities
 by impartial international organizations. The Government has difficulty in rebutting
 allegations of torture because it permits incommunicado detention and detention
 without trial. The Government is not known to have punished any official in 1994
 for human rights abuses committed either in 1994 or in previous years.
 Prison conditions do not appear to pose any threat to the life or health of those
 detained.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-n addition to overseeing the Security
 Service and police, the Ministry of Interior also controls the office of the Public Pros-
 
 
 1056
 ecutor, whose officers initially determine whether sufficient evidence exists to con-
 tinue to hold a prisoner in "investigatory detention." The Ministry is responsible for
 all aspects of prison administration. In the early stages of detention, prisoners and
 their attorneys have no recourse to any authority outside the Ministry of Interior.
 Under normal criminal proceedings, police may detain a suspect for up to 7 days
 of questioning before filing charges.
 However, under the State Security Act of 1974, persons accused of subversive or
 antiregime acts may be detained without trial for a period not to exceed 3 years.
 Detainees have the right to appeal such detentions after a period of 3 months and,
 if the appeal is denied, every 6 months thereafter from the date of the original de-
 tention. Under the Act, persons may be detained for attempting to exercise the
 rights of free speech, association, or other rights in opposition to the AI-Khalifa re-
 gime. Activities that could lead to detention include: membership in illegal organiza-
 tions or those deemed subversive; painting antiregime slogans on walls; Joining
 antigovernment demonstrations; possessing or circulating antiregime writings;
 preaching sermons with a distinct antiregime political tone; and harboring or associ-
 ating with persons committing such acts.
 In April security forces detained 14 Shi'a students following a sectarian school-
 yard brawl and held them for 2 months without charge. In early December, a Shi'a
 1m     and approximately 12 of his followers were arrested for inciting violence
 against the Government and foreign residents. Following their arrest, protesters de-
 manding their release staged a series of large, sometimes violent, demonstrations
 in Manama and several Shi'a villages. Throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, the
 protesters attacked two police stations, public security vehicles, and two branches
 of the National Bank of Bahrain. At least three demonstrators and one policeman
 were killed in the clashes. The police detained approximately 500 to 600 persons,
 nearly all of whom were arrested for committing illegal acts, such as skirmishing
 with police or vandalism. Demonstrations continued in mid-January and the police
 detained several hundred more demonstrators.
 The authorities continue to use the revocation of citizenship and exile to punish
 individuals suspected or convicted of antiregime activity. During the 1980's, in the
 aftermath of the Iranian Revolution and an aborted coup attempt by pro-Iranian
 elements, the Government deported without trial a significant number of citizens.
 In 1994 the Amir granted amnesty to 21 of these exiles and their families, allowing
 them to return to Bahrain.
 Throughout 1994 the authorities detained individuals at the airport who sought
 to return without the benefit of amnesty, and returned them to their point of origin.
 The authorities also revoked the citizenship of two citizens of Iranian descent who
 were convicted in 1988 of security offenses, and deported them to Iran after they
 completed serving their prison terms.
 The authorities maintain that they present prospective returnees with the evi-
 dence against them and give them the choice of standing trial or continuing to re-
 side abroad for a specified period of time. In some cases, the Government maintains
 that individuals have legally forfeited their citizenship by their acceptance of foreign
 citizenship or participation in antiregime activities.
 However, emigre rups and their local contacts challenge both assertions. They
 argue that most exiles would prefer to stand trial than continue to live abroad, and
 that the revocation of citizenship without due process violates the Constitution. Ac-
 cording to emigre groups, approximately 100 to 150 Bahrainis live in exile. This fig-
 ure includes those who are prohibited from returning and their family members who
 voluntarily live abroad with them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tral.-An arrested person may be tried in an ordinary
 criminal court or, if required by the prosecution, in the Security Court. Ordinary
 civil or criminal trials provide procedural guarantees for an open trial, the right to
 counsel (with legal aid available when necessary), and the right to appeal. However,
 some attorneys and family members involved in politically sensitive criminal cases
 complained that the Government interfered with normal court proceedings to influ-
 ence the outcome or to prevent court judgments from being carried out. Allegations
 of corruption in the judicial system have also been made from time to time, although
 corruption does not appear to be a pervasive problem. There are precedents in which
 the Amir, Prime Minister, and other senior government officials have lost cases
 brought by private citizens. The judgments in such cases were carried out.
 , Security cases are tried directly by the Supreme Court of Appeal, which sits as
 the Security Court. Procedures in the Security Court do not provide appropriate
 safeguards. The Security Court is exempted from adhering to the procedural guar-
 antees of the Penal Code, trials are held in secret, and defendants do not have the
 right to ask for a review of the legality of their arrests. There were no reports of
 security court trials in 1994. Sentences imposed by the Security Court may, at the
 
 
 1057
 discretion of the Court or the request of the defendant's family, be referred to the
 Amir for clemency.
 The total number of prisoners of all kinds, excluding those arrested in the Decem-
 ber riots, is believed to be between 270 and 300 persons, of whom a small number
 may be political prisoners. The number of political prisoners is difficult to determine
 because the Government does not release information on security cases and restricts
 visits to prisoners convicted of security offenses. The Government denies that there
 are any political prisoners. It claims that all individuals detained for security of-
 fenses, including those arrested in the December riots, the attempted coup in 1981
 and a 1987 attempt to destroy Bahrain's single oil refinery, were properly convicted
 of criminal acts such as espionage, espousing or committing violence, or belonging
 to terrorist organizations.
 In accordance with tradition, the Government continued to release and grant am-
 nesty to a small number of prisoners, including self-declared political prisoners, on
 major holidays. The Government released 44 prisoners in March, including 10 con-
 victed of security offenses in the 1980's; in June it released and deported to Iran
 on the completion of their sentences, 2 individuals convicted of security offenses in
 1988; and in December the Amir pardoned and released another 6 to 8 convicted
 criminals. Government sources have indicated that nearly all of the prisoners con-
 victed for nonviolent antiregime activity in the 1980's have been released by am-
 nesty or upon completion of their sentences.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 empowers the Ministry of Interior to authorize entry into private premises without
 specific judicial authorization. The authorities monitor some domestic and inter-
 national telephone calls and correspondence. Police informer networks are extensive
 and sophisticated.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for the right
 "to express and propagate opinions," citizens are not generally free to express public
 opposition to the AI-Khalifa regime in speech or writing. The Government does not
 permit political meetings and monitors gatherings that might take on a political
 tone. The security forces sometimes disperse such meetings. The Government pro-
 hibits press criticism of personalities in the ruling family and on certain sensitive
 subjects, such as the Hawar Islands dispute with Qatar.
 The local press is free to report and comment on international issues. Discussion
 of local economic and commercial issues is also relatively unrestricted. In practice
 there are few restrictions on the discussion of political and economic issues in pri-
 vate settings, provided such discussions do not become public.
 The Information Ministry exercises sweeping control over all local media. Bah-
 rain's privately owned newspapers routinely exercise self-censorship of stories on
 sensitive topics. In 1994 the Government prohibited a local editorial columnist from
 publishing for 1 month following his criticism of government policy during the Yem-
 eni civil war.
 The Government does not condone unfavorable coverage of its domestic policies
 by the international media and has occasionally revoked the press credentials off-
 fending foreign journalists. Since the Ministry also sponsors foreign journalists' resi-
 dence permits, this action can lead to deportation. The Government deported a cor-
 respondent of the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) in December for covering
 the civil disturbances in a manner unfavorable to the Government. In addition, Reu-
 ter withdrew its correspondent in April and did not replace him after the Ministry
 of Information indicated that his residence permit would not be renewed. Other
 international news services have frequently complained of government restrictions.
 Several news services have departed Bahrain and established offices elsewhere in
 the region.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television stations. The Government
 does not interfere with radio and television broadcasts from neighboring countries
 and from Egypt, nor does it interfere with the English-language news from the Brit-
 ish Broadcasting Company and Cable News Network. Many senior government offi-
 cials, ruling family members, and well-to-do citizens receive international television
 broadcasts via satellite reeiving dishes. The Ministry of Information closely controls
 access these and the importation or installation of them without   vernment ap-
 proval is illegal. In October the Ministry established a 13-channel subcription cable
 network and  announced plans to add an additional 7 channels by the end of the
 year.
 Although there are no formal regulations limiting academic freedom, as a prac-
 tical matter academics try to avoid contentious political issues. In general there is
 greater latitude to discuss politics in an academic setting. Nevertheless, strict limits
 
 
 1058
 are observed, and research, publications, and public discussions critical of the Gov-
 ernment are highly infrequent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Despite the Constitution's af-
 firmation of the right of free assembly, the Government prohibits public political
 demonstrations and meetings. Religious gatherings that may take on political over-
 tones are strictly controlled. In January and March security forces dispersed Shi'a
 Muslim gatherings commemorating the death of Iranian Grand Ayatollah
 GoIpayegani at the A1-Mu'min mosque in Manama and closed the mosque tempo-
 raily, ostensibly on the grounds that the gatherings had become political and
 confrontational.
 In July and September, security forces used tear gas to break up large, Shi'a-led
 demonstrations at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. After each of these inci-
 dents, suspected leaders and active participants were briefly detained for question-
 ing, usualy on grounds of participating in or inciting violence. All were later re-
 leased without charge.
 The Government prohibits political organizations. Some professional societies and
 social and sports clubs have traditionally served as fora for discreet political discus-
 sion, but these are restricted by law from engaging in political activity. Only the
 Bar Association has been granted an exemption to the regulation requiring all asso-
 ciations to state in their constitutions that they will refrain from political activity.
 The Bar Association successfully arged that a lawyer's professional duties may re-
 quire certain "political" actions, such as interpreting legislation or participating in
 a politically sensitive trial. Since the Gulf War the Government has been more toler-
 ant of informal discussion of some political issues, but organized discussions and
 meetings are still actively discouraged. The Government requires permits for most
 public gatherings, and does not routinely grant permission.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The population is overwhelmingly Muslim, and Islam is
 the state religion. However, Christians and other non-Muslims, including Jews, Hin-
 dus, and Baha'is, are free to practice their religion and maintain their own places
 of worship. Bibles and other Christian publications are displayed and sold openly
 in local bookshops, which also sell Islamic and other religious literature. Religious
 tracts of all Islamic sects, cassettes of sermons delivered by Muslim preachers from
 other countries, and publications of other religions are readily available. The Gov-
 ernment discourages proselytizing by non-Muslims and prohibits anti-Islamic
 writings. However, it does not interfere with conversions from Islam to other reli-
 gions.
 Both Sunni and Shi'a sects are subject to governmental control and monitoring,
 but the Government does not interfere with routine religious activities. Public reli-
 gious events, most notably annual commemorative marches by the Shi'a, are per-
 mitted but are closely watched by the police. There are no restrictions on the num-
 ber of citizens permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a shrines and holy sites in Iran
 and Iraq. However, in the past, the Government strongly discouraged religious
 study in and pilgrimages to Iran. Although the Government continues to monitor
 travel to Iran and scrutinizes carefully those who choose to pursue religious study
 there, Bahraini travel to Iran for pilgrimages, business trips, tourism, and family
 visits is increasingly common.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to move within the country and change their place of
 residence or work. However, the Government may deny issuance of passports on po-
 litical grounds. Under the 1963 Citizenship Law, the Government may reject appli-
 cations to obtain or renew passports for "reasonable cause," but the applicant has
 the right to appeal such decisions before the High Civil Court. The Government has
 also issued 'temporary passports" to individuals whose travel it wishes to control
 or whose claim to citizenshi  is questionable. At least 3 to 5 percent of the indige-
 nous population, mostly Shi a Muslims of Iranian origin, do not have passports and
 cannot readily obtain them, although they may be issued travel documents as resi-
 dents (see Section 5). Noncitizen residents may also obtain "laissez-passers" or tem-
 porary passports. These documents are valid for 2 years and may be reissued at
 Bahraini embassies overseas. "Laissez passer" holders are required to obtain visas
 to reenter Bahrain.
 In 1994 the Government continued to allow the repatriation of certain persons
 who have lived in exile (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government does not usually accept refugees. However, it does not repatriate
 those refugees who arrive in Bahrain. The Government has granted some Iranian
 emigres permission to remain in Bahrain, but has not granted them citizenship.
 During the Yemeni civil war in 1994, the Government accepted approximately 10
 Yemeni casualties for medical treatment.
 
 
 1059
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change their government
 or their political system, and the Government strictly controls all political activity.
 Since the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1975, there have been no formal
 democratic political institutions, political parties, or opposition organizations. The
 Prime Minister appoints all members of the Cabinet. About one-third of the Cabinet
 ministers are Shifa, although they do not hold security-related offices. All other gov-
 ernment positions are appointed by the relevant ministries. The ordinary citizen
 may attempt to influence government decisions through submission of written peti-
 tions and informal contact with senior officials.
 The Government established a 30-member Consultative Council, or Majlis Al-
 Shura, in 1992. The Majlis held its second session from October 1993 to May 1994,
 and began its third session in October. The members of the Mals are evenly di-
 vided between Sunni and Shfa and were appointed by the     n to represent the
 major constituent groups, including business, labor, the professions, and the reli-
 gious communities. There are no members of the ruling Al-Khalifa family in the
 Majlis. The Chairman is a Shi'a who formerly was Minister of Transport and Com-
 munications.
 Although the MJlVis has no formal legislative power, it may draft legislation for
 the Cabinet and Prime Minister to approve and is empowered to summon and ques-
 tion Cabinet ministers. According to the Speaker, the Government responded poai-
 tively to about 85 percent of the Majliss recommendations by incorporating them
 into legislation or by taking other appropriate actions. However, since all Majlis
 meetings are closed, little information is available to verify this claim.
 In the autumn and winter, 14 prominent religious and secular figures circulated
 a petition calling for the return of the National Assembly or elections for a new as-
 sembly. The petition reportedly has 20,000 signatures but at year's end had not
 been formally presented to the Government. The Government is aware of the peti-
 tion but has not responded to the petition's demands or taken any legal action
 against the drafters. However, the authorities dismissed a senior employee of the
 Ministry of Public Works, Power and Water from his job after he disobeyed instruc-
 tions not to circulate the petition on ministry grounds during workhours.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights organizations. Because of the restrictions on free-
 dom of association and expression, any independent, domestically based investiga-
 tion or public criticism of the Government's human rights policies would face manor
 obstacles. A number of groups based abroad claim to report on human rights viola-
 tions, including the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Bahrain in Da-
 mascus, the Bahrain Freedom Movement in London, and the Bahrain Human
 Rights Organization (formerly the Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners
 inBarain) in Copenhagen. These groups are composed of small numbers of emigres
 and often receive funding from governments hostile to the Al-Khalifa regime.
 The Government has consistently characterized as baseless charges of torture and
 denial of access to detainees, but it has not taken practical steps to refute such
 charges. The Government maintains that it is "not opposed" to visits in good faith
 by 'bona fide human rights organizations," and it has engaged in dialog with the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Amnesty International (AI).
 However, by the end of 1994, there were no substantive visits by ICRC or Al rep-
 resentatives, despite tentative "invitations" extended by the Government. In prac-
 tice, international human rights organizations have found that operating in Bahrain
 is difficult.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women encounter various forms of discrimination. Islamic law, or
 Shari'a, governs some of the social and legal rights of men and women. Specific
 rights vary according to the Shi'a or Sunni interpretation of Islamic law.
 While both Shi'a and Sunni women have the right to initiate a divorce, religious
 courts may refuse the request. Occasionally Shi'a women seeking divorce must trav-
 el outside of Bahrain, as the Ja'afari sect courts in Bahrain are said to lack a reli-
 gious scholar of sufficient rank to issue rulings in controversial cases. Women of ei-
 ther sect may own and inherit property and may represent themselves in all public
 and legal matters. In the absence of a direct male heir, Shi'a women may inherit
 all property, by contrast, Sunni women-in the absence of a direct male heir-in-
 herit only a portion, with the balance divided among male relatives of the deceased.
 
 
 1060
 In the event of divorce, the courts routinely grant Shi'a and Sunni women custody
 of daughters under the age of 9 and sons un er age 7, although custody usually is
 awarded to the father once the children reach those ages. In all circumstances ex-
 cept mental incapacitation, the father, regardless of custody, retains the right to
 make certain legal decisions for his children, such as guardianship of any property
 belonging to the child until the child reaches legal age. A non-Bahraini woman auto-
 matically loses custody of her children if she divorces their Bahraini father.
 Women may obtain passports and travel abroad without the permission of a male
 head of the household. Women are free to work outside the home, drive cars without
 escorts, and wear the clothing of their choice. Many women wear Western dress out-
 side the home.
 Women constitute over 20 percent of the work force. The Government has encour-
 aged the hiring of women, enacted special laws to promote female entry into the
 work force, and is a leading employer of women. The Labor Law does not discrimi-
 nate against women; however, some women's groups complain about informal dis-
 crinnation m the workplace, including inequality of wages and denial of oppor-
 tunity for advancement. Except for a few exempted professions, such as nursing,
 women are prohibited from working at night. Generally, women work outside the
 home during the years between secondary school or university and marriage.
 Women make up the majority of students at universities. There are women's organi-
 zations which seek to improve the status of women under both civil and Islamic law.
 Increasingly, women have expressed the view that, despite growing female partici-
 pation in the work force, women are not significantly advancing their rights and
 that much of their lack of progress is due to the influence of Islamic religious tradi-
 tionalists, especially in the government-run school system and in the Shari'a courts.
 Other women, however, desire a return to more traditional religious values and sup-
 port calls for a return to Islamic patterns of social behavior.
 Violence against women is known to occur, but knowledge of incidents is usually
 kept within the family. There is virtually no public discussion of the issue. No gov-
 ernment policies explicitly address violence against women. Women's groups and
 health care professionals state that spouse abuse is relatively common. There are
 very few known instances of Bahraini women seeking legal redress for violence, and
 anecdotal evidence suggests that the courts are not receptive to such cases.
 Foreign women working as domestic servants sometimes report assault and sex-
 ual abuse to local embassies and the police, but most victims are too intimidated
 to sue their employers. Those who do sue appear to be received sympathetically in
 the courts.
 Children.-The Government has often stated its commitment to the protection of
 children's human rights and welfare within the country's social and religious frame-
 work. The Government honors this commitment through enforcement of its civil and
 criminal laws and an extensive social welfare network.
 The status of children is shaped by tradition and religion to a greater extent than
 by civil law. Public discussion of child abuse is rare, and the preference of the au-
 thorities has always been to leave such matters within the purview of the family
 or religious groups. The authorities actively enforce the laws against prostitution,
 including chid prostitution and procuring. They deal harshly with violators. In
 some cases, the authorities reportedly return children arrested for prostitution and
 other crimes to their families rather than prosecute them, especially for first of-
 fenses. The regular courts hear juvenile cases. Some legal experts have called on
 the Government to establish a juvenile court, but other citizens insist that the pro-
 tection of children is a religious, not a secular, function and oppose greater govern-
 ment involvement. Independent and quasi-governmental organizations play an ac-
 tive part in protecting children by providing counseling, legal assistance and advice,
 and in some cases, shelter and financial support to distressed children and families.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorit ie.-A group of 3,000 to 5,000 mostly Iranian-ori-
 gin Shm'a, commonly known as "bidon" (those without), enjoy less than full citizen-
 ship. Many are second- or third-generation residents whose ancestors emigrated
 from Iran. Although they no longer claim Iranian citizenship, the law does not grant
 them Bahraii citizenship. Without citizenship, they are officially unable to buy
 land, start businesses, or obtain government loans, although in practice many d.
 The Government maintains that many of those who claim to be "bidon" are actu-
 ally citizens of Iran or other Gulf states who have voluntarily chosen not to renew
 their foreign passports.
 Those bidon and Bahrainis who speak Farsi, rather than Arabic, as their first
 language, also face significant socia and economic obstacles, including difficulty
 finding employment.
 Reigious Minoritie.--Although there are notable exceptions, the Sunni Muslim
 minority enjoys a favored status in Bahrain in comparison with the Shi'a Muslim
 
 
 1061
 majority. Sunnis generally receive preference for employment in sensitive govern-
 ment positions and in the managerial ranks of the civil service.
 Shi'as are not allowed to hold significant posts in the defense and internal secu-
 rity forces. However, they occupy most of the senior positions in the major govern-
 ment-owned industries and are disproportionately represented in the educational
 sphere as secondary school teachers, professors, and university administrators. In
 general, lower padworker in the private sector tend to be Shi'a because of the
 arger proportion in that group-and the much larger absolute number-who are
 poorly educated. Social and municipal services in moat Shi'a neighborhoods, particu-
 larly in rural villages, are inferior to those in Sunni urban communities. In an effort
 to remedy social discrimination, improve living conditions for the Shi'a, and encour-
 age integration, the Government has built numerous subsidized housing complexes
 open to all citizens on the basis of financial need.
 People With Disabilities.-The law protects the rights of people with disabilities,
 and a variety of governmental, quasi-governmental, and religious institutions are
 mandated to support and protect disabled person. The Regional (Arabian Gulf)
 Center for the Treatment of the Blind is headquartered in Bahrain, and a similar
 center for the education of deaf children was established in 1994.
 Society tends to view people with disabilities as special cases in need of protection
 rather than as fully functioning members of society. Nonetheless, the law requires
 the Government to provide vocational training for disabled persons wishing to work.
 The Labor Law of 1976 also requires that any employer employing over 100 employ-
 ees engage at least 2 percent of its employees from the Govements list of disabled
 workers. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs works actively to place people
 with disabilities in public sector jobs, such as in the public telephone exc angs.  e
 Government's housing regulations require that access be provided to disabled per-
 sona. Met large public buildings (including the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and
 Defense, the University, and schools) are equipped with ramps and other aids which
 make them accessible to disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution recognizes the right of workers to
 organize, but trade unions do not exist, and the Government does not enourage
 their establishment. However, labor regulations allow the formation of elected work-
 era' committees in the larger Bahrainy companies. Worker representation is based
 on a system of Joint Labor-Management Consultative Councils (JCC's) established
 by ministerial decree. In 1994 four new JCC's were established in the private sector,
 including one in a major hotel Twelve preexisting JCC's cover the major state-
 owned industries. The JCC's are composed of equal numbers of apointed manage-
 ment representatives and worker representatives elected from andby company em-
 ployees.
 The elected labor representatives of the JCC's select the 11 members of the Gen-
 eral Committee of Baaini Workers (GCBW), established in 1983 by law, which
 oversees and coordinates the work of the JCC's. The Committee also hears com-
 plaints from Baraini and foreign workers and assists them in bringing their com-
 plaints to the attention of the Ministry of Labor or the courts. The JCC-GCBW sys-
 tem represents close to 70 percent of the island's indigenous industrial workers, al-
 though both government and labor representatives readily admit that nonindustrial
 workers and expatriates are underrepresented by the system. Expatriate workers,
 who comprise 67 percent of the work force, may participate in JCC elections. No
 expatriate worker, however, currently sits on the board of the GCBW.
 The Labor Law neither prohibits nor guarantees the right to strike. The 1974 Se-
 curt La    obids strikes that are perceived to be detrimental to the "existing rela-
 tionship" between employers and employees or to the economic health of the state.
 No major strikes took place in 1994, eut sm  ale walkouts and other job actions
 have occurred, often with favorable results for the workers.
 The  -CBW represents workers at the International Labor Organization and in
 the Arab Labor Orga    nation, but does not belon e to any international trade union
 organizations. A Bahraini Ministry of Labor officil currently chairs the governing
 body of the Arab Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organire and Bargain Collectively.-As in the case of strikes, the
 Labor Law neither prohibits nor guarantees the rig t to organize and bargain collec-
 tively. The GCBW represents workers' interests in tripartite negotiations with man-
 agement and government representatives. While the JCC's are empowered to dis-
 cuss labor disputes, organize workers' services, and discuss wages, working condi-
 tions, and productivity, the workers have no independent, recognized vehicle to rep-
 resent their i      n these or other labor issues. JCC's make suggestions to man-
 
 
 1062
 agement on some working conditions and limited aspects of wage issues, but man-
 agement must agree before a proposal can be put in force.
 Mdinimum wage rates are established by Council of Ministers' decree. Increases in
 wages above the minimum, which are subject to discussion in the JCC's, are set by
 management, with government salaries for comparable work often serving as an in-
 formal guide. Private businesses generally follow the Government-JCC lead in es-
 tablishing their wage rates.
 There are two export processing zones, but labor law and practice are the same
 in these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is le-
 gally prohibited, and the Labor Ministry is charged with enforcing the law. The
 Ministry enforces the labor laws with periodic inspections and routinely fines viola-
 tors. New prvisions to the Labor Law passed in November 1993 stiffened the maxi-
 mum fines and mandated imprisonment for certain violations. The press often per-
 forms an ombudsman function on labor problems, reporting instances in which pri-
 vate sector employers compelled foreign workers from developing nations to perform
 work not specified in their ontracts and other abuses, as well as Ministry of Labor
 responses. The press regularly reports the results of labor cases brought bfore the
 courts. In September B  aini courts awarded three Filipino domestic workers back
 pa and damages in cases against their employers.
 Once a complaint has been lodged by a worker, the Labor Ministry opens an in-
 vestigation and often takes remedial action. Although the Ministry takes such cases
 seriously, abuses undoubtedly go unreported, particularly those involving domestic
 workers and others working illegally in Bahrain. The Labor Law stipulates that any
 Bahraini found guilty of illegally sponsoring foreign workers may be sentenced to
 6 months in prison for each worker. However, the Government's efforts to deport
 aegally sponsored workers make these domestic workers reluctant to bring cases
 of abuse to the courts. The intense fear of deportation almost certainly allows some
 sponsoring employers to impose abusive conditions, which approach coerced or bond-
 ed labor, on their employees.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment is 14. Juveniles between the age of 14 and 16 may not be employed in
 hazardous conditions or at night and may not work over 6 hours per day or on a
 piecework basis. Ministry of Labor inspectors effectively enforce child labor laws in
 the industrial sector, child labor outside that sector is less well monitored but is not
 believed to be significant outside family-operated businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wage scales, set by government de-
 cree, exist for public sector employees and generally afford a decent standard of liv-
 ing for workers and their families. The current minimum wage for the public sector
 is $237 (91 dinars) a month. Wages in the private sector are determined on a con-
 tract basis. For foreign workers, employers consider benefits such as paid annual
 trips home and housing and education bonuses part of the salary.
 The Labor Law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, mandates
 acceptable conditions of work for all adult workers, including adequate standards
 regarding hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week) and occupational safety and
 health. Complaints brought before the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs that can-
 not be settled through arbitration must, by law, be referred to the labor court within
 15 days. In practice, most employers prefer to settle such disputes through arbitra-
 tion, particularly since the court and Labor Law are generly considered to favor
 the employee, and the rulings in such cases are often published in the local press.
 Under the Labor Law, workers hav   e right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations without jeopardy to their employment.
 The Labor Law stipulates significant fines and jail sentences for private sector
 employers who fail to pay legal wages. This law app lies equally to employers of Bai-
 rainis and expatriates and is intended to reduce abuses against foreign workers who
 in the past have sometimes been denied legal salaries. The law provides equal pro-
 tection to Bahraini and foreign workers, but all foreign workers still require spn-
 by Bahraiis or Bahrain-based institutions and companies. Subject to sanc-
 tor wrongful dismissal, sponsors are able to cancel the residence permit of any
 person under their sponsorship and thereby block them from obtaining entry or resi-
 dence visas from another sponsor.
 The local press has reported instances of foreign workers denied full wages, days
 off vacations, or other guaranteed conditions of employment, as well as the court
 ruings or Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs actions taken in response. Nonethe-
 less, government attempts to address individual abuses in these and other cases are
 often hampered by the workers' unwillingness to make formal complaints.
 The Labor Law favors Barainis and Arab expatriates over other foreign workers
 in hiring and fhirng. Because employers include housing and other allowances in
 
 
 1063
 their salary scales, expatriate workers legally may be paid lower wages than their
 Bahraini counterparts, although they sometimes receive the same or greater total
 compensation because of home leave and holiday pay allowances. Women are enti-
 tled to 60 days of paid maternity leave, nursing periods during the day, and up to
 1 year of unpaid maternity leave. However women are generally paid less than men.
