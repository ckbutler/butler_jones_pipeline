 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 emirates established in 1971. Each emirate retains extensive
 control over such important matters as mineral wealth
 including oil), internal security, and some aspects of
 defense. There are no popular elections, ,either local or
 federal. Emirate rulers govern by virtue of.longstanding
 tribal tradition. In accordance with the 1971 Constitution,
 the seven emirate rulers comprise a Federal Supreme Council,
 the UAE's highest legislative and executive body, but it meets
 only occasionally. In practice, the legislative and executive
 work is delegated to the various -emirates and the more active
 federal ministr3es. The Supreme Council selects a President-
 and Vice President from its membership; each serves a 5-year
 term. The President in turn appoints a Prime -Minister and a
 Cabinet.
 Only the.Federal Government and the Emirate of Dubai maintain
 independent internal security organizations. The other
 emirates-have- their own police forces, which are active in
 antinarcotics and antiterrorist activity. All these
 organizations-ar-e under either federal or local government
 control.
 The economy is based on oil and gas production, which has made
 the UAE's per capita income one of the world's highest. It is
 a largely free market-economy, but the Government owns the
 majority share-of the oil enterprise in Abu Dhabi. A small
 UAEcitizen population controls the country's economic life
 but  depends heavily on a -much larger contingent of foreigners
 to provide manual labor and technical skills. The UAE's four
 emirates with small or nonexistent-petroleum resources -are
 dependent on federal government subsidies for such essential
 services as health, electricity, water, and education.
 There was no important change in the UAE human rights
 situation in 1990. Principal human rights concerns continued
 to be abuse of prisoners and restrictions on freedom of speech
 and press, assembly and association, the right of citizens to
 change their government, and women's and worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No political disappearances were reported.         -
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture or degrading treatment of
 any person, and the physical or moral abuse of an accused
 person. No instances of torture were reported in 1990.
 However, there have beeen several credible reports (including
 Amnesty International's (AI) 1990 report, covering 1989) of
 torture and other ill-treatment of prisoners in previous
 years, particularly at Al-Wathba Central Prison. UAE
 
 
 1671
 UNITED ARAB EIRATES
 officials generally do not comment on such reports and there
 have been no known instances in which authorities were tried
 and punished for such abuses.
 In 1990 there were several instances of amputation of a hand
 as punishment for theft in conformance with Shari'a law, which
 is still an integral part of the judicial system. There were
 also several criminal cases in which flogging or caning was
 the prescribed punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arrest, search, detention, or
 imprisonment except in accordance with the law, and the laws
 of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable
 cause. By law, the polibe must report any arrest to a judge
 within 48 hours for his determination whether to charge,
 release, or, with sufficient police justification, ballow
 limited further detention pending an investigation. Prolonged
 detention without charge is rare. However, in its 1990
 report, AI noted continued detention since 1987 of a
 15-year-old Somali national, Mahmud Sulaiman Abdi, thought to
 have-been arrested because of his father's political activity
 in exile; AI said there was no information on. the fate o.r
 whereabouts of Iraqi national Ismail al-Nouri, detained in
 1988, but a UAE law enforcement official subsequently said
 that both the Somali and Iraqi prisoner had been released.
 Once charged, suspects come to trial reasonably quickly,
 although the reabsorption of the Ministry of Justice by the
 Ministry of Islamic Affairs in March 1989 reportedly has
 slowed the judicial system. While there is no formal system
 of bail, there are instances of people being released after
 depositing money or important documents such as a passport.
 In 1%90 there were no- reported instances of preventive
 detention. Consular access to imprisoned foreign nationals is
 permitted, although it is sometimes delayed. There were no
 known instances of incommunicado detention.
 The Constitutioa prohibits- the exile of citizens. Noncitizens-
 convicted of crimes are subject to deportation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a and civil courts, each of
 which deals with-both criminal and civil cases. The Shari'a
 courts are administered by each emirate, but the civil courts
 are usually part of the federal system and are answerable to
 the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi. However, the Dubai,
 Ras a-l-Khaimah, and Umm al-Qawain Livil court systems are
 independent of the federal system. Each court system has a-
 multilevel appeals process. Either the plaintiff or the
 nature of the case determines which court system hears a
 particular case. Due process rights are uniform under both
 Shari'a and civil court procedure. There is a presumption of
 innocence until guilt is proven.
 Legal counsel is readily available and permitted to represent
 a defendant in both court systems. The court may appoint
 legal counsel if counsel agrees to provide services free; no
 system of state payment of public, defenders exists. However,
 the losing party may be required to pay the winner's legal
 fees. The judge is responsible for looking after the
 interests of a person not represented by counsel.

 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 There-are no jury trials. All cases, except national security
 cases and those deemed by the judge likely to upset public
 morality, are open to the public. Most judges are foreign
 nationals, primarily from other'Arab countries. There has
 been little evidencein recent years of rulers interfering in
 the judicial process. Commercial.law is still in a
 rudimentary-stage of development in the UAE, causing some
 confusion. Foreign businessmen also widely believe the UAE
 judicial system is biased in favor of UAE nationals. The
 criminal court system, on the other hand, is generally
 regarded as fair and its judgments well considered. There is
 no separate national security court system. The military has
 its own court system based on Western military judicial
 practice. Military tribunals try only military personnel.
 There are no known political prisoners in the UAE.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the
 owner's permission, except in accordance with the law.
 Although the police can enter homes without a warrant and
 without demonstrating probable cause, an officer is answerable
 if he abuses his authority in doing so. Anyone other than a
 police officer must have a court order to enter a private
 home. Local custom and practice place a high value on
 privacy, and violations are rare. There is no surveillance of
 private correspondence. Except for rare instances involving
 national security, no cases of arbitrary interference-with
 privacy have been reported in recent years.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 UAE citizens-are constitutionally assured freedom of speech.
 In practice, however, most inhabitants, especially foreign
 nationals, are circumspect in public discussions of sensitive
 political topics or in criticizing the Government. All
 television and radio stations are government owned and conform
 to government reporting-guidelines. Although many of the
 local English- and Arabic-language newspapers are privately
 owned, all but one receive government subsidies. -The press
 operates under the same self-censorship arrangement as
 broadcast media.
 Self-censorship by journalists makes formal official
 censorship rare. Local newspapers normally are-cautious in
 reporting on government policy, the ruling families, national
 security, religious matters, and relations with neighboring
 states. In 1989 two local English-language newspapers, the
 Gulf News and the Khaleej Times were closed for 1 day for
 running an advertisement with a reference to an alcoholic
 beverage. Journalists resident in the UAE must also conform
 to the code of-self-censorship in articles concerning the UAE
 which are destined for foreign publication.
 The Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information and
 Culture reviews all imported newspapers, periodicals, books,
 films, and videos, and bans items considered pornographic,
 violent, derogatory to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly
 critical of friendly countries, or critical of the Government
 or the ruling families. Authorities confiscate material
 written in the Hebrew language and prohibit the sale of
 Iranian newspapers and magazines. The small publishing
 
 
 1673
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 industry is subject to government censorship in accordance
 with the above criteria. The unwritten but widely accepted
 ban on criticism of the Government also restricts academic
 freedom. However, there is a growing trend toward more overt
 criticism of the Government by academics in both word and
 print.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Organized public gatherings require a government permit. In
 practice, public gatherings are rare. There were, however,
 two public demonstrations in support of Kuwait in August.
 Political organizations are prohibited. Citizens normally
 confine their political discussion and debate to the numerous
 "assemblies" (majlises), held in private homes, which are a
 local tradition. There are no restrictions on the formation
 of private associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion. Non-Muslims are free to
 practice their religion, but may not publicly proselytize or
 distribute religious literature. By tradition and social
 custom, non-Muslims may worship in their own way, and several
 churches exist in major cities. Several Christian churches in
 the capital, Abu Dhabi, were built on land which was a gift
 from President Zayed. Foreign clergymen are allowed to   ,
 minister to expatriate congregations. No religion other than
 Islam may conduct religious training. Religious groups are
 allowed to engage in private charitable activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation
 within the country except in security areas such as defense
 and oil installations. Unrestricted foreign travel and
 emigration are permitted to citizens, except those involved in
 financial disputes under adjudication. Exit visas are not
 required. All citizens have the right of return. In- 1990
 there was one reported instance of revocation of citizenship
 for political reasons related to criticism of the leadership.
 The UAE as a whole and the member emirates individually have
 - long accepted groups of displaced persons such as Palestinians
 and Lebanese and, in 1990, over 40,000 Kuwaitis. Even so, the
 UAE lacks a formalized procedure for accepting refugees, and
 noncitizens are expected to leave the UAE at retirement age.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The UAE has no formal democratic institutions, and citizens do
 not have the right to change their government. The bulk of
 executive and legislative power is in the hands of the seven
 emirate rulers, their families, and those persons and families
 to whom they are allied by historical ties, marriage, or
 common interest. These emirate political leaders constitute
 the dominant political force at the national level, especially
 through their use of power in the Federal Supreme Council.
 Political parties are prohibited.
 Although the rulers land ruling families by tradition are
 presumed to have the right to rule, their incumbency
 ultimately depends on the quality of their leadership and
 
 
 1674
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 responsiveness to their subjects' needs. Emirate rulers are
 accessible, in varying degree, to citizens who have a problem
 or request. The choice of a new emirate ruler falls to the
 ruling family in consultation with other prominent tribal
 leaders.
 The political dominance of the ruling families is intertwined
 with their substantial involvement and influence in economic
 life. The ruling families and their close allies control and
 profit from petroleum production and, with important merchant
 families, have a major stake in the UAE's commercial life. A
 complex system of distribution of wealth, including through
 the Federal and Emirate Governments, ensures generous
 subsidies and a high standard of living for UAE citizens.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The UAE has been responsive in some cases to intenational
 criticism of its human rights situation. For example, it
 improved its labor laws following criticism that foreign
 workers were being mistreated. However, in its 1996 report,
 AI noted that it had expressed concern to the UAE authorities
 about reports of detention without trial and possible torture
 or ill-treatment of detainees, but that no response was
 received from the Governient.
 The UAE does not permit any internal groups that would monitor
 human rights, and nooutside human rights group visited the UAE
 in 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most.UAE Women-still have a traditional family-centered role
 in UAE society. Traditional attitudes about women's roles and
 the frequency of early marriage still limit women's *
 educational and employment opportunities. However, women's
 education is advancing rapidly, and females outnumber males at
 the UAE national university. The medical school has more
 women than-men. Opportunities for women are growing in
 government service and the media, in addition to the more
 traditional fields of education and health. The UAE military
 began accepting women volunteers for the first time in 1990.
 There are no restrictions on the right of UAE women to own
 property or to engage in marriage contracts as equal
 partners. A woman's property is not commingled with that of
 her husband. In cases of divorce, Islamic law is observed.
 The woman-gets custody of male children until 7 years of age.
 Between age 7 and 9, at the judge's discretion, a male child
 can choose to go live with his father. Female children should
 remain with the mother until marriage. A woman who remarries
 forfeits her right to custody of children from a previous
 marriage. Polygamy is also legal, with the stipulation that
 all wivesbe-treated equally. In practice, it is rare to find
 a UAE man married to more than one wife.
 Although violence against women, such as wife beating and the
 abuse of domestic servants, is known to occur in the UAE,
 little is known about its extent. One Asian state banned its
 female citizens from accepting employment as domestics in the
 UAE because of poor working conditions, including violence
 against them. This ban was lifted after 2 years. The Koran
 
 
 1675
 
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 is considered to allow a husband to discipline his wife, a
 principle that some might interpret to permit force. Abuse
 occurring within the family is seldom mentioned because of the
 value attached to personal privacy in this traditional
 society, and the Government does not acknowledge the existence
 of a problem. Excessive violence against women would be
 grounds for divorce and criminal charges, but suits brought on
 these charges in the UAE are believed to be rare.
 Legislation that would limit the' marriage of UAE citizens to
 foreigners is under consideration. At present, only a UAE
 male confers citizenship on the spouse by marriage.
 There is no noticeable discrimination because of race or
 language. UAE citizens are almost all Arabs and speakers of
 Arabic. Although the UAE's Shi'a minority has had commercial
 success, few of them manage to reach top positions in the
 UAE's governing hierarchy. Their religious affiliation may be
 an inhibiting factor, but their largely Iranian origin also
 leads the majority of UAE citizens to view them as outsiders.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of workers to organize unions and to strike is
 neither explicitly legal nor illegal under UAE law. In
 practice, there are no unions and no strikes, and it is a
 criminal offense for UAE public sector workers to strike.
 Foreign workers who might attempt to organize a union risk
 deportation. The UAE has been a member of the International
 Labor Organization since 1972, but it has ratified neither
 Convention 87 regarding Freedom of Association nor Convention
 98 on the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legal provision for the right of workere to engage
 in collective-bargaining. For the resolution of work-related
 disputes, workers must rely on conciliation committees,
 organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and on
 special labor courts.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor regulations prohibit employment of youths under age 18
 and have special provisions for employing persons aged 15 to
 18. Since the children of UAE iationals have little incentive
 to work and only adult foreign workers are allowed in the
 country, there is virtually no child labor. There is
 compulsory education of children to age 12.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated minimum wage in the UAE. Supply and
 demand determine salaries. Work hours are restricted to 8
 hours per day, 6 days per week, but this is not strictly
 enfbrced. The UAE sets health and safety standards, which are
 enforced by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, municipalities, and Civil Defense. The
 
 
 1676
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which oversees such
 matters as worker compensation, is chronically understaffed
 and underbudgeted. The Ministry of Health, on the other hand,
 has developed a good health card system.
 Foreign nationals from Pakistan, India, the Philippines,
 Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka continue to seek work in the UAE in
 large numbers. Most foreign workers receive some form of
 housing from their employer. Employers are required to pay a
 small sum (less than $100) for national health service cards
 for foreign workers. The latter then have access to free
 medical care. The Government has made gifts of numerous
 social centers and schools to various foreign national
 groups, Foreign workers earning more than $1,000 per month
 may bring their families, but the vast majority do not
 qualify. The pool of foreign workers, most of them actively
 recruited from abroad, meets the demand for domestic and
 service workers and manual laborers.
 There are many complaints that recruiters in the country of
 origin use unscrupulous tactics and entice foreign manual
 laborers and domestics to the UAE on the basis of false salary
 and benefits promises. Such cases can be appealed to the
 Labor Ministry and, if this does not resolve the issue, to the
 courts. However, many laborers are reluctant to protest or to
 engage in such a lengthy process because of fear of reprisals
 by their employers. Also, domestics and agricultural laborers
 are not covered by-the UAE's labor code, which makes
 enforcement of their complaints more difficult. A foreign
 worker must get permission from the previous employer to move
 to a new job with a different employer.
 UAE law provides for a minimum of 24 days per year of annual
 leave plus 10 national and religious holidays. Though it is
 not a legal requirement, many employers provide as a fringe
 benefit an annual round-trip airplane ticket for the employee
 to return home. Employers are required to pay airfare both to .
 the UAE when the employee arrives and to the country of origin
 when he returns.
