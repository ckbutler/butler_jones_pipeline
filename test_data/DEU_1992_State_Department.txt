 GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in a constitutional federal republic and
 a parliamentary democracy. The head of the Federal Government, the Chancellor,
 is elected by the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament. The powers of the Chan-
 cellor and of the Parliament are set down in the Basic Law, Germany's Constitution.
 Governmental authority is also divided between national and state governments.
 The states enjoy significant autonomy, especially in matters relating to law enforce-
 ment and the courts, culture and education, social welfare assistance, and the envi-
 ronment.
 As a result of German unification on October 3 1990 the laws and Constitution
 of the Federal Republic were extended to the dermas of the five new eastern
 states, who now enjoy the full rights and privileges of FRG citizenship.
 The police system is organized essentially at the state (Land) level and operates
 under the direction of state governments. The western police forces, in the vast ma-
 jority of cases, are well-trained, disciplined, and careful in respecting citizens' rights.
 Their actions, however, in controlling demonstrators during an economic summit in
 Munich in July came under criticism. Demonstrators protesting the Economic Sum-
 mit said local police prevented them from approaching the summit site and used ex-
 cessive force. The eastern  states' Police Forces, in contrast, are generally
 understaffed, underequipped, and undertrained. They were sharply criticized for
 failing to act in defense of foreigners attacked by rightwing extremists. Subse-
 quently, western police units were deployed in the eastern states to help control
 antiforeigner violence.
 The industrialized market economy provided one of the highest standards of living
 in the world to those living in the western parts of Germany. In the eastern states,
 however, the transition to a market economy produced high rates of unemployment.
 As of November, nearly 1.1 million people, representing 13.4 percent of the work
 force, were officially registered as unemployed in the eastern states. In all, the ap-
 proximate equivalent of one-third of the eastern German work force was either un-
 employed, underemployed, or engaged in a retraining or job-creation program.
 Transfer payments to the eastern states significantly increased disposable income
 there.
 The Basic Law, adopted in 1949, rests firmly on the principles of liberty, equality,
 and the free exercise of individual rights. In practice, these human rights are pro-
 tected in almost all cases. German law provides protection against racial and ethnic
 intolerance. However, incidents of violence and harassment directed at foreigners,
 and particularly at non-European foreigners, occurred throughout the year in both
 eastern and western Germany. Over 2,000 instances of rightwing extremist violence
 occurred, most of them against foreigners. The violence claimed the lives of 17 peo-
 ple (8 of them foreigners). Arson attacks accounted for almost one-third of the
 crimes. Individual foreigners, including students and diplomats, were also harassed
 and suffered verbal and physical abuse. Jewish cemeteries and memorials also were
 increasingly targets of vandalism. All the major parties and all of the leading rep-
 resentatives of the Federal Republic denounced the violence. During the last 4
 months of the year, well over 2 million people took to the streets in various dem-
 onstrations to protest against extremism, with crowds of over 300,000 in Berlin, Mu-
 nich, and Hamburg.
 Organized rightwing attacks on an asylum seekers' shelter in Rostock in late Au-
 gust led to several days of rioting and sparked a wave of similar attacks against
 asylum shelters throughout much of eastern Germany and in a few western German
 cities. To a large degree, these attacks were perpetrated by rightwing extremists,
 alienated youths (many of them "skinheads"), and a small core of neo-Nazis. In
 many cases, the rightists and others who assaulted the shelters were applauded by
 bystanders; often the police manifested an inability, and at times a hesitancy, to
 stop the violence. Many German politicians and outside observers, including human
 rights groups, criticized the 'eastern olice for their slow and inadequate response
 to some of the violence, especially in Rostock. Some critics charged that the security
 forces were unwilling to act and that the rightists were tried on minor charges and
 received light sentences. Discussion of manifestations of antiforeigner sentiment
 often centered on a review of the asylum law rather than focusing on the human
 rights abuses suffered by foreigners and the need to quell lawbreaking by rightists.
 Some German officials linked their condemnation of the antiforeigner violence with
 calls for restricting the influx of asylum seekers, leading to accusations from a major
 international human rights organization of "subtly shifting the focus and the blame
 to the foreigners themselves." On December 10, Chancellor Kohl specifically rejected
 such linkage in a statement before the Bundestag.

 On November 23, skinheads firebombed two houses in Moelln inhabited by long-
 time Turkish residents. One woman and two girls died; several others were injured.
 The murders prompted the Federal Government, which has only limited law en-
 forcement jurisdiction, to step up its response to the violence. The Federal prosecu-
 tor took over the Moelln investigation; two perpetrators were arrested, and they con-
 fessed to the crime.
 In December the Chancellor created an interagency task force to coordinate a
 range of measures to combat the violence. Using existing previsions of the German
 Constitution, the Federal Ministry of Interior banned four small neo-Nazi groups.
 In December the Federal and state Ministers of Interior placed the rightwing
 Republikaner Party under nationwide police observation to determine whether they
 were antidemocratic.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 . a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Politically motivated killing by the
 Government or by mainstream political organizations is unknown. For the first time
 in years, the leftwing Red Army Faction (RAF) did not engage in any terrorist acts
 in 1992. It remained to be seen, however, whether this represented a long-term pol-
 icy change or a short-term tactical move.
 b. Disappearance.--Governmental or police authorities do not abduct, secretly ar-
 rest, or otherwise illegally detain persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There is no indication that police authorities engage in these practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-No person may be arrested lawfully ex-
 cept on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial authority. Any
 person detained by the police must be brought before a judge and charged no later
 than the day following the day of apprehension. The court must then either issue
 an arrest warrant with stated reasons for detention or order the person's release.
 There is no preventive detention. A suspect may be held in custody for up to 24
 hours while awaiting a formal charge if there is evidence that he might seek to flee
 the country to avoid prosecution. The right of free access to legal counsel has been
 restricted only in the cases of some terrorists who were suspected of having used
 contacts with lawyers to promote and continue terrorist activity, even while in pris-
 on. Only judges may decide on the validity of any deprivation of liberty. Bail bond
 exists but is seldom employed. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Trials are public. The court system, largely spe-
 cialized, has five components: "ordinary", (criminal and civil cases); labor (disputes
 between employers and unions); administrative (administrative law); social* (social
 security); and fiscal (taxation). The Federal Constitutional Court is the supreme
 court. In the new states, there has been substantial progress in reforming the courts
 to meet western German standards. One remaining area of weakness concerns per-
 sonnel. Many experienced judges from the former German Democratic Republic
 (GDR) had to be disqualified for political and judicial reasons, and many judges had
 to be brought in from the west, who then faced unfamiliar circumstances. The Basic
 Law assures due process and prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both
 government interference and intimidation by terrorists. There are no political pris-
 oners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The in-
 violability of the home is ensured by the Basic Law and respected in practice. Prior
 to forcible entry by police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance or monitoring of mail
 may be undertaken only after authorization by a court order.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The provisions of the Basic Law, an independ-
 ent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system com-
 bine to ensure freedom of speech and press. Criticism of the Government is unre-
 stricted. The media and artistic works are not censored. On October 21, unknown
 person(s) attacked the memorial at the site of the Ravensbrueck former concentra-
 tion camp, and two Molotov cocktails were thrown, causing slight damage; state au-
 thorities withheld information about the incident for 2 days. The State Minister-
 President (Governor) said that the decision to withhold the information had been
 made on a state, not federal, level, in order not to hinder the ongoing police inves-
 tigation. Local Jewish leaders, the press, and other critics charged that the motive
 had been to avoid publicity duringthe visit of Queen Elizabeth 11 of Great Britain.
 After the criticism, state justice officials promised to take steps to ensure that simi-
 
 
 785
 lar delays would not occur again. Anecdotal information from various parts of the
 country suggested that press reporting of some other incidents was delayed or given
 low-key treatment.
 There is academic freedom. There is no censorship of foreign or domestic books,
 although Nazi propaganda is illegal. Newspapers and magazines are privately
 owned. Radio and television stations and networks function, for the most part, as
 corporations under special public laws. They are governed by independent boards
 made up of representatives of churches, political parties, and other organizations.
 In accordance with the terms of the 1990 second unification treaty, the former East
 German public broadcasting outlets were integrated into an all-German system.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assocation.-The rights of assembly and as-
 sociation are fly respected, as is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain plice permits beforehand and may be asked
 to pay a deposit to cover the repair of any damage to public facilities. Such police
 permits are routinely granted. When demonstrators have not obtained the required
 permits, plice have exercised restraint, showing concern ultimately only for the
 continued functioning of public facilities and for the safety of the general public.
 There are no supplementary restrictions on freedom of assembly and association in
 the eastern states.
 Membership in nongovernmental organizations of all types, including political
 parties, is entirely open. Parties found to be "fundamentally antidemocratic" may,
 however, be outlawed. Under this constitutionally based provision, the Federal Con-
 stitutional Court in the 1950's declared both a neo-Nazi party and a Communist
 party to be illegal, a ban still in effect. Several extremist parties are under observa-
 tion by the "0fic for the Protection of the Constitution" (BFV, the internal security
 service), but they nonetheless enjoy all the freedoms of a political party. In 1992
 two of these parties, the Deutsche Volksunion (German People's Union) and the
 Republikaner, gained state representation in Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-
 Wuerttemberg, respectively. The BFV registered approximately 41,000 people as
 members of rightwing extremist groups. Mme 6,400 are considered violence prone.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The full practice of religion is allowed. Almost 50 dif-
 ferent churches and religious denominations exist, but most of the population be-
 longs to the Catholic or Protestant churches. Together with the small Jewish com-
 munity, these churches hold a special legal status as corporate bodies under public
 law, giving them, for instance the right to participate in a state-administered
 churh tax system. The rest of the population either practices no religion or belongs
 to small independent Christian churches or other faiths, such as Islam. The Govern-
 ment subsidizes church-affiliated schools and provides religious instruction in
 schools and universities for those belonging to the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish
 faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country and to
 leave and return at any time. The Basic Law guarantees automatic German citizen-
 ship and the right to legal residence without restrictions to ethnic Germans. The
 number of such ethnic Germans coming from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
 to settle in Germany in 1992 continued to be large, although less than the all-time
 high of 2 years ago. In 1992, 231,000 ethnic Germans had registered to resettle in
 Germany including 196 000 from states of the former Soviet Union, 18,000 from Po-
 land, and 16,000 from komania. Immigrants who are not ethnic Germans can ac-
 quire citizenship if they meet certain requirements: legal residence in Germany for
 at least 10 years (5 years for those married to Germans); renunciation of all other
 citizenships; and a basic knowledge of German (along with some other minor re-
 quirements). German citizenship is not granted automatically (unlike the case with
 ethnic Germans); application is necessary. Legal long-term residents often opt not
 to apply. They receive the same social benefits as do German citizens and, afMer 10
 years of legal residency, are automatically entitled to permanent residency.
 The right of asylum for foreigners who are politically persecuted is rovided under
 Article 16 of the Basic Law' and respected in practice. Shelter, clothing, and food
 are provided to asylum seekers by the Government. They are not allowed to work
 while their cases are being processed; this processing can take over a year. Con-
 sequently, the financial maintenance of the asylum seekers and their families is an
 added burden on an economy already severely strained by the financial costs of both
 reunification and the integration of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the
 states of the former Soviet Union. The number of those seeking asylum continued
 to increase dramatically, the Government registered 438,000 asylum seekers in
 1992-a 70-percent increase from the 1991 figure of 256,000. Some of the increase
 can be attributed to the 123,000 requests for asylum filed by refugees from the re-
 publics of the former Yugoslavia. The next largest group of asylum seekers were Ro-
 
 
 786
 manians (104,000), followed by Bulgarians (31,000) and Turks (28,000). The visi.
 bility of asyloes, who are distributed throughout Germany on a proportional basis
 according to each state's population, became an easy focus for German frustration
 and discontent. Consequently tremendous domestic political pressures built up to
 restrict the constitutional ight of asylum. In December the major parties reached
 a compromise to amend the constitutional right to apply for aslum and thereby to
 restrict the flow of asylum seekers. Implementing legislation is to follow in 1993.
 Once formally granted asylum status, and to a lesser extent while being proc-
 essed, these persons have essentially the same access to social welfare benefits as
 German citizens. Short of the right to vote, they also enjoy complete civil rights.
 While less than 5 percent of the asylum seekers succeed in their requests for politi-
 cal asylum, denial of political asylum does not automatically result in deportation.
 The majority of applicants who are rejected (especially those from the former Yugo-
 slavia) typically are allowed to remain in the country for other humanitarian rea-
 sons. Deportations thus have been extremely rare and are often complicated by the
 absence of documents proving country of origin. Under new procedures that went
 into effect on July 1, 1992, the processing of aylum applications was centralized
 and accelerated using independent adjudicator. The stated goal is completion of the
 entire processing within 6 weeks a standard that so far has rarely been met. Re-
 sponding to the increasing visibility of and focus on asylum seekers, the Govern-
 ment in September signed an agreement with Romania whch provided for expedi-
 tious deportation of Romanian asylum seekers, mostly Gypsies, who did not qualify
 for asylum. Some human rights groups, journalists, and others argued that the
 agreement singled out a particular ethnic group for mass deportation. In fact the
 Government negotiated similar agreements with Poland and Bulgaria. Gypsies, who
 make up 60 percent of the Romanian applicants, cannot generally demonstrate the
 likelihood of 'political persecution" (the German constitutional grounds for granting
 asylum).
 Section 3. Respect for Political Right&- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Under the Basic Law, Germany's Government is chosen by the people through or-
 derly elections based on universal suffrage. The Bundestag, which chooses the
 Chancellor, is elected through a mixture of direct constituency candidates and party
 lists. The upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, is composed of delegations
 from state governments. New political  rties are free to form and to enter the polit-
 ical process, but the Basic Law and the state constitutions stipulate that parties
 must receive at least 5 percent of the vote in order to be represented in the federal
 and state parliaments. Although party discipline plays an important role, voting on
 issues in the Bundestag is ultimately a matter of individual decision. The first all-
 German Bundestag elections took place on December 2, 1990.
 Women are entitled by law to full participation in political life, and all parties
 have expressed the commitment to encourage their greater participation. The
 Greens require that women comprise half of the party's elected officials. Social
 Democrats have a 40-percent quota for women on all party committees and govern-
 ing bodies, with an eventual goal of 50-percent female representation in several
 yeai's time. The Cabinet Minister for Women and Youth is responsible for further-
 ing women's interests in both the public and private spheres. Women comprise 21
 percent of the current Bundestag membership. The President of the Bundstag is
 a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Private nongovernmental human rights organizations operated freely and without
 harassment in all of Germany, as did international organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Denr.g access to shelter, health care, and education on the basis of race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or citizenship is illegal.
 Incidents reflecting intolerance of foreign, religious, and ethnic minorities oc-
 curred in both western and eastern Germany. Foreigners, particularly Romanians,
 Poles, Gypsies, and non-Europeans, increasingly became the targets of violence in
 1992. Rostock was the scene of extended violence against foreigners from August 22
 through Augst 27. Repeated attacks against an asylum compound there culminated
 on the third night in the firebombingof an asylum home and the evacuation of sev-
 eral hundred asylum seekers. There were credible reports that the police were slow
 to respond, coupled with allegations that they did not even try to prevent the arson
 attacks; in fact the fire brigae had to withdraw under a barrage of stones because
 of lack of police protection. On October 17, 13 German youths attacked and forced
 
 
 787
 entry into a housing facility for foreigners in Thale. Armed with clubs, pistols firing
 blanks, and flare guns, they threatened and beat 50 Vietnamese living in the facility
 and sexually attacked several women. They also demolished furniture and tried to
 set the building on fire. There were also attacks against refugee facilities through-
 out Germany, in places such as Cottbus, Eisenhuettenstadt, Quedlinburg, Hesse,
 and Wismar.
 Asylum seekers were not the only victims, however. Resident Turks and North
 Africans were also targets. A number of African and Asian diplomats in Berlin told
 journalists that they felt anxious about the increase of antiforeigner sentiment or
 had been victims of antiforeigner threats or violence. On October 21, a large street
 brawl occurred between 60 German youths and 60 foreign university students in
 Greifswald. Many on both sides were masked and armed with baseball bats, clubs,
 and swords. Police required reinforcements to separate the groups. The rioting con-
 tinued over the weekend, with foreign student dormitories and a foreign club the
 main targets. On October 19, 46 French Jews were arrested in Rostock during a pro-
 test against the German-Romanian repatriation agreement. In a confrontation with
 the German police, 8 police were "  red by tear gas used by 3 protestors resisting
 arrest. Rostock police, while not able to protect asylum seekers and their homes in
 August, intervened immediately in this instance. The French Jews were held for 4
 days, in contrast to the treatment of many rightwing extremists who were detained
 during this period for firebombino asylee apartments, and who were released after
 only a few hours. A number of critics drew the conclusion from these circumstances
 that local police and law enforcement authorities were less vigorous in pursuing
 rightwing extremists than in pursuing those who demonstrated or used violence to
 oppose such extremism. Federal and state officials have responded to this criticism
 inpublic statements and also with measures to counter rightwing violence.
 Federal officials, including the Chancellor, condemned the attacks from the far
 right element and, in the wake of the Rostock riots, moved to reinforce the eastern
 German police forces. Furthermore, the Federal and state Interior Ministers, who
 handle internal security affairs, strengthened their cooperation in combating far
 right violence. On November 8, the Government participated in a Berlin rally in
 which 350,000 demonstrated aginst antiforeigner violence. Although leftist disturb-
 ances disrupted the speech of the German President the crowds marched peacefully
 for several hours, and foreign groups (principally Turks and Asians) walked with
 the Germans.
 Vandals increasingly targeted Jewish monuments. The concentration camp memo-
 rial at Ravensbrueck was vandalized and desecrated. An arson attack on the former
 concentration camp at Sachsenhausen destroyed a new exhibit on Nazi oppression
 of Jews. Although the Government condemned such anti-Semitic attacks, Jewish
 leaders and others felt that the response was inadequate and condemned what they
 perceived to be a greater leniency in the judicial system for rightwing criminals.
 Discrimination against the Gypsy population continued. One of the main targets
 in the Rostock riots was the Gypsies housed there by the Government while their
 asylum requests were being processed. In addition to the asylees, there are 60,000
 Gypsies resident in Germany.
 Some laws discriminate against members of the Muslim faith and others by pro-
 viding subsidies to Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish places of worship and schools
 not provided to members of other faiths (see Section 2..).
 women generally enjoy full and equal protection under the law, including prop-
 erty and inheritance rights. However, some regulations and social programs are ap-
 plied divergently in the two parts of the country. Young women experience difficul-
 ties in gaining access to training in some traditionally male fields, but recent court
 rulings and government pilot programs have helped break down some of these atti-
 tudinal and institutional barriers.
 Salaries for women in the private sector tend to be lower than salaries for men
 in similar jobs. The Government, through its Labor Ministry, has acknowledged the
 existence of unequal, sex-diIffrentiated pay scales in the private sector as a violation
 of the constitutional prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex, religious
 affiliation, or race. Several decisions by the National Labor Court in recent years
 ruled in favor of women who initiated htigation to redress pay inequities. The issue
 of equal pay for equal work is subject to negotiation in private sector collective bar-
 gaining between unions and firms.
 The involuntary unemployment rate for women in the eastern states continued to
 be high relative to the rate for men, with women comprising over 64 percent of all
 unemployed workers in eastern Germany. In the former GDR, 95 percent of the
 women worked. As of November 1992, official figures indicated that approximately
 18.5 percent of them were out of work, compared to 9.4 percent of the men.
 
 
 788
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is not condoned either in law or
 in practice. The women's movementhas urged public discussion of the problem and
 tougher penalties for crimes against women. Interim statistics for rape (through the
 first 6 months of 1992) show 2,406 reported cases in the entire country, about the
 same level compared to that of the first half of 1991.
 While there is no persistent abuse of human rights of children in Germany, the
 Government does recognize that violence against children is a problem. Approxi-
 mately 75 percent of sexual abuse against children is committed by family members;
 one-third by the child's biological father. The Government has sought to curb the
 violence through a public awareness initiative launched on June 30 1992 by the
 Minister for Women and Youth. The initiative seeks to sensitize people to te prob-
 lem, above all by making them more familiar with its dimensions and symptoms,
 and by teaching them to recognize appeals for help. According to the Ministry for
 Women and Youth, counseling and assistance in the area of cild abuse have been
 expanded in recent years, in part reflecting the emphasis (as set forth in the new
 Child and Youth Protection Law) placed on prevention.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to associate, choose representatives, deter-
 mine programs and policies to represent members' interests, andfpublicize views is
 recognized and freely exercised in Germany. About 35 percent o the total eligible
 work force belongs to the highly organized labor movement. The German Tade
 Union Federation (DGB) represents approximately 82 percent of organized workers
 in both eastern and western Germany and actively participates in various inter-
 national and European trade union organizations. The trade unions are independent
 of both the Government and the political parties. The two largest groupings, the So-
 cial Democratic Party (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) aong with
 the Christian Social Union (CSU), have separate organizations for trade
 unionists-- respectively, the Working Group oar Worker Questions (AFA), the
 Christian Democratic Workers' Group (CDA), and the Christian Social Workers'
 Group (CSA). These groups wield considerable influence both within the parties and
 the DGB.
 The right to strike is guaranteed by law, except for civil servants (including teach-
 ers) and personnel in sensitive positions (such as members of the armed forces) and
 was extensively exercised in 1992. International Labor Organization (ILO) bodies in
 1992 were critical of the Government's broad definition of essential services" which
 prevents teachers from striking legally. Sanctions imposed on teachers who struck
 n Hesse in 1989 and the replacement of striking postal workers by civil servants
 in an earlier incident were the specific cases that provoked a complaint to the ILO.
 In May and June, public service workers (who hold less sensitive jobs than civil
 servants do, and who do not enjoy the same benefits) staged an 11-day national
 walkout affecting many services, including rail, airport, postal, garbage disposal,
 and police. At its height, some 400,000 workers participated in the walkout.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Co/lectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is guaranteed by the Basic Law and is widely practiced No gov-
 ernment mechanism to promote voluntary worker-employer negotiations is required
 because of a well-developed system of autonomous contract negotiations, now ex-
 tended to the eastern states. There is a two-tiered bargaining system whereby basic
 wages and working conditions are established at the industry level and then adapt-
 ed to the circumstances prevailing in particular enterprises through local negotia-
 tions. So far in 1992, an increasing number of frms in eastern Germany refused
 to join, or withdrew from, employers associations and bargained independently with
 workers. This development does not appear to impair the right of German workers
 to bargain collectively, although it radically alters the fashion in which this right
 is exercised. A characteristic of German industrial relations is the legally mandated
 system of works councils that provides a permanent forum for continuing selective
 worker participation in the management of enterprises. Workers are fully protected
 against antiunion discrimination.
 Germany has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is
 barred by the Basic Law and is nonexistent in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Federal law generally prohibits
 the employment of children under age 15, with a few exceptions: children aged 13
 and 14 may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day or may deliver newspapers for
 up to 2 hours per day;, children aged 3 through 14 may take part in cultural per-
 formances under stringent conditions with regard to number of hours, time of day,
 and form of activity. The Federal Labor Ministry effectively enforces the law
 through its Factory Inspection Bureau.
 
 
 789
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-There is no legislative or administratively de-
 termined minimum wage rate. Wages and salaries are set either by collective bar-
 gaining agreements between industrial unions and employer federations or by indi-
 vidual contract. These agreements, which cover about 90 percent of all wage and
 salary earners, set minimum pay rates and are legally enforceable. These minimum
 wage levels provide an adequate standard of living for workers and their families.
 The number of hours of work per week is regulated by contracts that directly or
 indirectly affect 80 percent of the working population. The average workweek in the
 western part of Germany is 37.6 hours, and in the eastern states, about 40 hours.
 Germany has an extensive system of laws and regulations on occupational safety
 and healt and incorporates a growing body of European Community-wide stand-
 ards into its own legislation. This system includes the right to refuse to perform
 dangerous or unhealthy work without jeopardizing employment. Worker insurance
 carriers have established-and they enforce-a comprehensive system of safety re-
 quirements in the work place .for each occupation. This system has recently been
 extended into the eastern states, where lax occupational  th and safety stand-
 ards and conditions under the Communist regime created serious long-term prob-
 lems. The Federal Labor Ministry effectively enforces occupational safety and health
 standards through a comprehensive network of government structures, including
 the Federal Institute for Work Safety. At the local level, professional and trade asso-
 ciations oversee the prevention of workplace accidents as well as worker safety.
