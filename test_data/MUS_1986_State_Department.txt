 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a small, densely populated island country with a
 functioning parliamentary democracy modeled after that of
 Great Britain. It is governed by a Prime Minister, Council of
 Ministers, and Legislative Assembly. The Governor General,
 with largely ceremonial powers, represents Queen Elizabeth II,
 the titular Head of State. Elections at national and local
 levels take place at regular intervals. There are five major
 political parties, which reflect a wide range of ideological
 views, and several smaller parties. Executive power has
 changed hands twice in the last 5 years through fair and
 orderly elections supervised by an independent commission.
 Municipal elections in 1985 returned the main opposition party
 to power in Mauritius' five largest cities.
 Mauritius has no military forces and depends on the
 paramilitary 700-man Special Mobile Force and the 200-man
 Police Riot Unit for internal security. These forces, under
 the command of the Commissioner of Police, are apolitical,
 well-trained, and backed by a general duty police force of
 approximately 4,000 men.
 Mauritius has a mixed economy, based on sugar production,
 tourism, and textiles, with a strong private sector. In 1986
 the economy continued its recovery, registering a 5.5 percent
 growth rate and creation of some 20,000 jobs. Mauritius
 maintained readjustment policies in line with assistance from
 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 Political and civil rights, including the freedoms of speech
 and press, are protected under the Mauritian Constitution and
 exercised in practice. There are 290 labor unions which enjoy
 considerable freedom in contract negotiations and within the
 political arena, although their right to strike is limited by
 law. Religious freedom is respected in this society which has
 large Hindu, Christian, and Muslim populations. An
 independent judiciary administers a legal system patterned on
 the British model. Since independence in 1968, there have
 been no reports of political killings, disappearance, torture,
 or degrading treatment of prisoners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance of persons for
 political causes.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law, and
 there were no reports of degrading treatment or punishment.
 Prisons, however, are badly overcrowded. The situation was
 exacerbated in 1986 by Government efforts to cope with
 increased narcotics trafficking. According to local press
 accounts, over 1,000 people were arrested during the period
 
 
 204
 MAURITIUS
 of January-September 1986 for possessing narcotic substances.
 Figures are not available for the number of those arrested who
 were subsequently imprisoned. The Government is sensitive to
 prison conditions and is publicly committed to their
 improvement. A British prisons expert arrived in September to
 conduct a study of prison conditions and make recommendations
 to the Government for the alleviation of current problems.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or detentions
 since the early 1970's. Detained persons have the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of their detention. In
 practice, this determination is usually made within 24 hours.
 Bail is commonly granted. The Supreme Court recently ruled
 invalid a section of the "Dangerous Drugs Act" of 1986 which
 had provided that any person arrested under the provisions of
 Clause 46 of the Act could be detained in prison until the
 conclusion of the judicial process. According to the press,
 the practice of incarcerating those found in possession of
 narcotic substances was established in September 1986. The
 Supreme Court has been petitioned to rule on the
 constitutionality of Clause 46.
 Exile is legally prohibited. The Constitution prohibits any
 form of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers, and
 a series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the
 Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom and is routinely
 made in the case of death sentences. There are no political
 or military courts. The legal system has consistently
 provided fair, public trials to those charged with crimes.
 Defendants have the right to private or court-appointed
 counsel. The judiciary is also charged under the Constitution
 with ensuring that new laws are consistent with democratic
 practice. Commissions of Inquiry are frequently established
 to examine various issues of social or political concern. The
 commissions, routinely chaired by distinguished jurists,
 conduct hearings, subpoena witnesses, and present their
 findings to the Government for corrective action when
 wrongdoing has been discovered. Commission proceedings are
 conducted in public and reported fully by the press. The
 findings, however, are conveyed to the Government in
 classified reports that are not routinely made public unless
 or until the Government decides to take action against an
 accused party. During 1986, one Commission of Inquiry
 examined in detail the operation of the Public Service
 Commission for local governments, a body charged with ensuring
 that appointments to local government positions are made on
 the basis of merit rather than as a result of political
 influence. A second Commission focused on drug trafficking
 and consumption. It is unclear whether judicial action will
 result from evidence gleaned during the inquiry on drugs, some
 of which concerns parliamentarians suspected of involvement in
 drug trafficking.
 'f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and generally
 respected in practice. The search of personal property or
 
 
 205
 MAURITIUS
 premises is allowed only under clearly specified conditions by
 court order or by police decision if an illegal act has been
 committed. There have been reports from reliable sources that
 the Government's intelligence apparatus occasionally opens
 mail and carries out surveillance of local opposition leaders
 and other major figures.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected by the Constitution
 and by local tradition. Sixteen privately owned daily,
 weekly, and monthly newspapers present varying political
 viewpoints and freely express partisan views. Newspapers are
 subject only to the legal constraints of libel laws. There is
 one television station and two radio channels (one strictly
 educational) broadcasting in five languages. The television
 and radio are reasonably objective in news and entertainment
 presentation, although opposition politicians occasionally
 accuse the broadcasting corporation of political bias in its
 news coverage. Television and radio broadcasts are also
 easily received from the nearby island of Reunion (a French
 Department) and are subject to no interference by the
 Government. However, any foreign satellite broadcasts, or
 programs from foreign sources, which are considered
 "controversial" are subject to approval by the Cabinet of
 Ministers before transmission on local television or radio.
 In March 1985, the Legislative Assembly passed an act which
 made it a felony to charge without proof in speech or print
 that a government minister was corrupt in exercising official
 functions. The first offense brings a $600 fine; the second,
 3 years in prison. Although the act remains in force, it has
 yet to be used to prosecute anyone.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Mauritians enjoy the right to form associations, including
 political parties, trade unions, and religious organizations.
 Mauritius has a multitude of such private organizations.
 Political, cultural,and religious assemblies are
 commonplace. Although police permission is required for
 holding demonstrations and mass meetings, such permission is
 rarely refused. May Day rallies held in 1986 by all major
 political parties attracted a total of 30,000 supporters.
 Mauritius has an active trade union movement. Almost 300
 unions represent 90,000 workers, more than one-fourth of the
 work force. Unions are free to organize workers in all
 sectors, including the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) which
 employs about 66,000 workers. Unions can press wage demands,
 establish ties to domestic political parties and international
 organizations, and address political issues. One leading
 federation actively supports the opposition party. The
 largest confederation, the Mauritian Labor Congress, is a
 member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. In theory, unions have the right to strike. However,
 in labor disputes, the Industrial Relations Act requires a
 prestrike, 21-day cooling-off period followed by binding
 arbitration, which has the effect of making most strikes
 illegal.

 MAURITIUS
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius. Hindus,
 Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and others openly practice,
 teach, and proselytize their religions without prejudice. All
 religious institutions receive state subsidies in proportion
 to their memberships. There is no state-sanctioned
 discrimination against any ethnic or religious community.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on full freedom of movement within
 the country. Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are
 also unrestricted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Mauritius is governed by a freely elected, unicameral
 Legislative Assembly, with executive direction coming from a
 Council of Ministers, currently headed by Prime Minister
 Anerood Jugnauth. The Governor General has the right to
 designate the person charged with forming a new government
 following parliamentary elections or a parliamentary crisis.
 Parliamentary, municipal, and village council elections are
 held at regular intervals. Voting and running for office are
 rights of all citizens 18 years of age and over. In the
 Legislative Assembly, 8 of the 70 members are appointed
 through a complex "best loser" system designed in part to
 ensure that all ethnic groups are adequately represented. The
 governing coalition consists of 5 parties and officially
 controls a majority of the 70 seats. Political parties often
 match the ethnicity or religion of their candidates to the
 composition of particular electoral constituences. There have
 been allegations that certain groups, including Muslims, are
 underrepresentated in the civil service. The December 1985
 elections were supervised by an independent commission and
 were preceded by intense campaigning, including regular public
 rallies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no known requests by international
 organizations to investigate human rights violations in
 Mauritius. Amnesty International maintains two branches in
 Mauritius. There are several local human rights groups which
 address the internal situation in Mauritius without government
 intrusion.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women in Mauritius participate in all types of political,
 business, and social activities, and a few hold important
 positions. Nonetheless, traditional ethnic and religious
 attitudes prevent women from achieving true parity: For
 example, only 4 of 70 parliament members and 1 of 19 ministers
 are women. The Mauritian Government seeks to improve the
 status of women, and recent amendments to laws ranging from
 emigration to inheritance have removed sex discriminatory
 sections. An interministerial committee headed by the
 
 
 207
 MAURITIUS
 Minister of Women's Rights and Family Welfare (a woman) was
 formed in April 1985 to address remaining discriminatory
 elements in local laws and practices. Discriminatory laws and
 regulations remain include a prohibition against women serving
 on juries and in the national pension scheme.
 Although the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family Welfare was
 made into a combined portfolio with labor and industrial
 relations in 1986, the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family
 Welfare still receives one of the smallest ministerial
 allocations--only $380,000 in the 1986-87 budget. The
 illiteracy rate for women (20 percent in 1983) is about twice
 that of men. While women are highly sought for employment in
 manufacturing plants, they tend to occupy the less skilled and
 lower paid positions and are particularly susceptible to
 layoffs during economic downturns. The average industrial
 salary for women is about/50 percent that of men. The
 Minister for Labor and Industrial Relations, Women's Rights
 and Family Welfare has indicated, however, that middle
 management training for women is one of her ministry's
 priorities.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Conditions of employment in Mauritius, including wage and
 leave conditions, are generally sufficient to afford an
 acceptable standard of living for workers in the agricultural,
 service, and manufacturing sectors.  Government, private
 welfare groups, and labor unions serve as watchdogs on
 potential employer abuses. A maximum workweek of 45 hours is
 allowed, and children below the age of 14 cannot be legally
 employed, although scattered cases of child labor have been
 reported. The Government mandates minimum wage increases each
 year based on inflation. It also operates an unemployment
 insurance program and a social security fund, although an
 effective social safety net does not yet exist. The rapid
 transfer of workers out of traditional sectors into the
 industrial work force has caused some social displacement, and
 occasional disputes have arisen between workers and
 employers--especially foreign managers--in the EPZ and other
 industrial sectors. These growing pains seem to be declining
 as foreign employers adjust to their Mauritian workforce and
 new workers learn industrial discipline.
