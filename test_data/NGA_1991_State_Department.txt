 NIGERIA
 Nigeria is ruled by a military regime, the Federal Military
 Government (FMG), headed by President Ibrahim Babangida, who
 came to power following a 1985 coup. A 19-member Armed Forces
 Ruling Council (AFRC) is the country's main decisionmaking
 organ, and its decisions, promulgated by decree, are the
 supreme law of the land. A 25-member, mixed military-civilian
 cabinet presides over executive functions. President Babangida
 controls both the AFRC and the Cabinet. Civilian chief
 executives elected in December and inaugurated in January 1992
 replaced military governors as head of each of the 30 states.
 A presidentially appointed administrator heads the Federal
 Capital Territory, Abuja.
 During 1991 the FMG continued its measured steps toward
 returning Nigeria along its own, firmly directed path toward
 democratic, civilian rule by 1992 (see Section 3). Nationwide
 voter registration exercises and party congresses at the ward,
 local government, and state levels were conducted. Party
 primaries, marred by widespread allegations of fraud, were held
 to select gubernatorial and state legislative candidates.
 State general elections by open ballot voting (see Section 3)
 were held on December 14. A national census that will be the
 basis for apportionment in the future civilian government was
 conducted in November. In his year-end speech, President
 Babangida announced that the controversial open ballot system
 of voting, used in December, would be used again for the 1992
 national elections, with certain unspecified modifications.
 Responding to pressure from various ethnic and regional groups,
 the FMG made radical changes in the Nigerian political map with
 the creation of 9 states (now 30) and 136 new local government
 areas (now 589).
 The FMG enforces its authority through the federal security
 system--the military, the State Security Service, and national
 police--and through the courts. As in the past, police and
 security service officials committed numerous human rights
 violations, including arbitrary arrests, detention without
 trial, and excessive use of force.
 Most of Nigeria's population of over 10 million is rural,
 engaging in small-scale agriculture. The country depends on
 oil revenues for over g0 percent of export earnings and to pay
 for 80 percent of its budgetary expenses. In 1986 the FMG
 initiated the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to address
 economic problems exacerbated by the fall in oil revenues which
 began in 1981. The SAP has had mixed results. In 1990, for
 the third consecutive year, Nigeria's real gross domestic
 product (GDP) increased by more than the population growth
 rate. However, the SAP has led to growing public opposition.
 Unemployment is widespread, and underemployment is high in
 urban areas. Inflation rose sharply in 1991 due to excessive
 government spending. Extreme disparities of income exist, and
 the majority of Nigerians continue to live in poverty.
 Human rights in Nigeria continued to be circumscribed in 1991.
 The sections of the 1989 Constitution providing for individual
 liberties can be superseded by AFRC decrees; Decree Two in
 particular abridges due process with its broad detention
 powers. Major problem areas in 1991 included: extrajudicial
 killings, often involving the use of excessive force by
 security forces; police brutality; poor prison conditions;
 official mistreatment; arbitrary detentions; the lack of fair
 trials; and press closures. Law enforcement personnel are
 seldom, if ever, tried and punished for killings, torture, and

 other abuses. Ethnoreligious tensions between Muslims and
 Christians erupted again in communal rioting, resulting in
 hundreds of deaths in two major disturbances. There continue
 to be only two government-mandated political parties. The use
 of open ballot voting was heavily debated during the year, with
 many Nigerians asserting that it disenfranchised significant
 numbers of voters.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Continuing a trend from previous years, use of excessive force
 by police officers was common: in May, a Rivers state
 government commission of inquiry, investigating the deaths of
 over 20 persons in a disturbance in late 1990, recommended that
 120 policemen be prosecuted for acts of brutality during the
 disturbance. To date, however, no criminal charges have been
 filed.
 In March, seven unarmed persons were fatally shot by Lagos
 police, who alleged, contrary to witness accounts, that the
 seven were armed robbers. The Federal Ministry of Justice in
 December demanded prosecution of the policemen involved in the
 slaying of the seven; the decision results from findings of an
 investigatory panel headed by a Deputy Inspector General of
 Police.
 In another highly publicized case, a Lagos businessman was
 killed by police on May 15. Eyewitness accounts indicated
 brutality and contradicted the police claim that he was
 accidentally killed by a stray bullet. Policemen are to be
 tried for the murder. In several other cases, police
 reportedly killed persons while attempting to extort money from
 them, then claimed the victims were armed robbers shot in
 self-defense. There are also reports of criminal suspects
 being killed in jail or after being brought under police
 custody. One credible human rights group estimated at least
 three extrajudicial killings per month by police or security
 agents. In November, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police
 announced that a Police Inspector would be tried for the murder
 of an unarmed motorist at a police checkpoint.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported politically motivated disappearances.
 However, FMG detention practices have the effect of causing
 many detainees to be "missing" for extended periods (see
 Section I.d.).
 c. Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The 1989 Constitution prohibits torture and mistreatment of
 prisoners, and Nigerian law provides criminal sanctions for
 such excesses. However, there were numerous credible reports
 that police regularly beat suspects to extract criminal
 confessions. In December the national daily Punch publicized
 the death of an 18-year-old trader while in police custody in
 the town of Kano, and the Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights (CDHR) protested the deaths of two Lagos men, .apparently
 beaten to death while in police custody in November.
 
 
 288
 NIGERIA
 Mistreatment of both male and female prisoners by guards and
 security officials were regular occurrences. Inmates often
 beat others at the behest of or with the consent of prison
 guards. Motorists at police checkpoints and pedestrians were
 often harassed and sometimes beaten by police officers trying
 to extort money. A leading member of a human rights
 organization was beaten at a police checkpoint, and several
 U.S. citizen summer interns working with the organization were
 harassed. There have been no known government investigations
 or disciplinary proceedings to punish those responsible for
 alleged abuses within prisons; investigations of abuses at
 police checkpoints are uncommon, though not unprecedented.
 Several student union leaders, detained in the aftermath of the
 threatened nationwide student strike in late- May, complained of
 mistreatment by prison officials. Some of the students alleged
 that, under the threat of torture and after having been beaten,
 they were intimidated into signing false statements naming
 several human rights activists as the instigators of the
 student strike and ensuing campus disturbances. At least two
 student leaders went on a temporary hunger strike to protest
 their treatment.
 Conditions in Nigerian prisons continue to be life threatening
 due to disease and malnutrition. The Civil Liberties
 Organization (CLO), one of Nigeria's leading human rights
 groups, reported that lack of food and potable water was
 universal (approximately 50 cents per day is spent on each
 prisoner for food). Many prisoners do not have adequate
 clothing and, according to credible sources, some go virtually
 naked. Severe overcrowding forced some prisoners to sleep in
 rows or in shifts. Inmates are sometimes manacled in their
 cells or placed in solitary confinement for long periods
 without justification, according to human rights groups. Time
 outside the celI for exercise is minimal. Most cells are
 poorly ventilated and filthy. Vermin are rampant, and most
 long-term prisoners suffer respiratory ailments or various skin
 diseases. Although most institutions have clinics, medical
 care is inadequate. One credible source indicates that female
 prisoners may give birth in prison with little medical
 assistance or postnatal care. Prison-born children can remain
 there for some time, without adequate nutrition or schooling.
 The CLO estimates that over 2,000 inmates die yearly as a
 result of the poor prison conditions. In 1991 the CLO also
 instituted lawsuits to force the FMG to improve conditions or
 close some of the worst prisons. The suits are pending. The
 FMG, acknowledging shortcomings in the prison system,
 established the National Committee on Prison Reform in 1990.
 The Committee was charged with reporting on prison conditions
 and recommending improvements to the Attorney General in 1991.
 It had not reported its findings by the end of the year.
 During the year, however, the FMG released over 2,600
 prisoners--some elderly and terminally ill--for humanitarian
 purposes and initiated construction plans for new prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The 1989 Constitution provides for trial within 3 months for
 the criminally accused in most cases. However, inefficient
 administrative procedures, petty extortion, and bureaucratic
 inertia resulted in many detainees and prisoners being held for
 protracted periods, sometimes years, without charge or trial.
 
 
 289
 NIGERIA
 Over 40 percent of Nigeria's 60,000 prisoners are awaiting -
 trial or have not been charged, according to credible estimates.
 Police officers are empowered to make warrantless arrests if
 there is reasonable suspicion of an offense, or if they witness
 commission of an offense. These provisions give police
 officers wide discretion, which is frequently abused. 'Under
 the law, the arresting officer must inform the accused of the
 charges at the time of arrest and take the person to the
 station for processing within a reasonable time. The suspect
 must be given the opportunity to engage counsel and obtain
 bail. Credible reports indicate that the police did not
 generally adhere to these procedural safeguards and often held
 suspects incommunicado, under harsh prison conditions, for
 extended periods without informing them of their rights or the
 charges against them.
 Arbitrary detentions of ordinary citizens occurred throughout
 1991. Motorists and pedestrians detained by police were
 sometimes jailed for purposes of extortion. There were
 instances in which police, after unsuccessful searches for
 criminal suspects, detained the suspect's relatives.
 Decree Two of 1984, the State Security (detention of persons),
 Decree, provides that the FMG may detain without charge persons
 suspected of acts prejudicial to state security or harmful to
 the economic well-being of the country. When invoked, Decree
 Two suspends the detainee's'civil liberties. 'Decree Two also
 contains a judicial ouster clause intended to prohibit judicial
 scrutiny of acts under its purview. In 1990 the'FMG amended
 Decree Two, shortening the time a person may be detained
 without charge from 6 months to 6 weeks, naming the Vice
 President as the only authorized signatory of detention orders,
 and creating a review panel to make recommendations for the
 release or continued holding of detainees.
 Nonetheless, many Nigerians still consider Decree Two the main
 threat to their basic freedoms because the judicial ouster
 clause encourages arbitrary detention with impunity for the
 arresting officers. Human rights groups charged that the
 review panel rarely met and detention orders were generally
 renewed without review. Additionally; there are credible
 reports that the provisions for effecting a detention under the
 Decree were not always followed. Sources reported that many
 persons were detained without a prior order signed by the Vice
 President and that police and security officials subsequently
 forged detention orders.
 Decree Two was used in 1991 to detain and silence persons for
 antigoverment actions or statements. In the aftermath of a
 May and June national student strike-and campus disturbances,
 the FMG said it-had detained approximately 200 student leaders
 across the country, including the national executive officers
 of the banned National Association of Nigerian students!(NANS),
 which had called the strike. Many of the students were
 detained under Decree Two; others were simply detained without
 charge. Many'of the student leaders were detained over 2
 months before, being released in August and September. The FMG
 has not announced whether all detained students have been
 released, and human rights groups have been unable to determine
 if all have been released because the FMG never disclosed the
 identities of the detainees.
 Four journalists were detained for an article implicating
 police in the shooting deaths of two students during a campus
 
 
 290
 NIGERIA
 disturbance in Lagos, and two human rights activists were
 briefly detained in connection with student disturbances.
 Among the most publicized Decree Two detentions in 1991 were
 those of Gloria Mowarin and Dorah Mukoro, girlfriend and wife,
 respectively, of two fugitive officers implicated in the April
 1990 coup attempt. Both women were detained shortly after the
 unsuccessful coup. Mukoro was held with her children, one of
 whom was born in detention. These detentions appear illegal
 even under Decree Two, since the Government was holding the
 women for acts they did not commit. In August Mrs. Mukoro and
 her children escaped from detention. The FMG is still holding
 Ms. Mowarin despite a February court decision quashing her
 detention on technical grounds. A number of relatives of other
 suspected coup plotters are also under detention, but the exact
 number is unknown.
 Many criminal suspects were held under Decree Two, although the
 measure ;as not intended to apply to common crimes. As a
 result, these suspects can also be held indefinitely after
 charges are filed, and detention orders renewed, sometimes for
 periods exceeding the maximum penalty for their alleged
 offenses. This practice has not been discouraged by the
 Government.
 The FMG continued a process, begun in 1986, of reviewing the
 cases of persons detained, convicted or charged under various
 decrees during the previous military administration
 (1984-1985). The exact number of such cases reviewed was
 unknown but believed to be few.
 There were no instances of forced exile as a means of political
 control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Decree One of 1984, the Basic Constitution (modification and
 suspension) Decree, left the institutional framework of the
 judiciary relatively intact, but set up a parallel system by
 transferring jurisdiction over certain major criminal offenses
 from the courts to special tribunals, weakening the regular
 court system in the process. The independence of the judiciary
 has also been challenged seriously by the APRC's assumption of
 the role as the final arbiter and by promulgation of decrees
 that prohibit judicial intervention.
 Under these decrees, the AFRC has transferred jurisdiction over
 cases involving corruption, currency violations, armed robbery,
 and a variety of miscellaneous offenses, such as drug
 trafficking and illegal oil sales, from the civilian judicial
 system to special tribunals. In these cases, those charged
 have access to legal assistance, bail (except in the case of
 armed robbery), and the right to appeal (except in the case of
 armed robbery and conviction under the civil disturbances
 decree). Prior to a decree passed in July 1991, military and
 police officers sat on these tribunals as coequals with a
 civilian judge. Pursuant to the new decree, only sitting or
 retired civilian judges can be on the tribunals. Nevertheless,
 these tribunals still do not provide full procedural safeguards
 normally granted the criminally accused. A leading human
 rights group, the Constitutional Rights Project (CRP), reported
 that the Recovery of Public Property Decree and Tribunal
 substitute a presumption of guilt for the presumption of
 innocence which customarily attaches in criminal proceedings.
 Sentences by these special tribunals are generally severe.
 
 
 291
 NIGERIA
 Convictions for armed robbery by the Special Robbery and
 Firearms Tribunals carry the death sentence with no right of
 appeal, although the sentence must be confirmed by the state's
 governor before it is carried out.. Conviction under the
 Treason and Other Offenses Tribunal (established in 1986) also
 carries the death sentence and provides for appeal only to the
 joint chiefs of staff. Its recommendations cannot be appealed
 but are subject to AFRC confirmation. Legal observers remain
 particularly critical of the mandatory death penalty without
 right of appeal, especially for cases involving armed robbers
 who have been sentenced to death for thefts of small amounts of
 money. Moreover, the CRP reported that rates of conviction in
 these tribunals over several years were 93 percent, and in one
 particular tribunal 100 percent.
 The regular court system is composed of both federal and state
 trial courts, state appeal courts, the federal Court of Appeal,
 and the federal Supreme Court. Courts of first instance under
 the 1989 Constitution include magistrate or district courts,
 customary or area courts, religious or Shari'a (Islamic)
 courts, and, for some specified cases, the state high courts.
 The nature of the case usually determines which court has
 jurisdiction. In principle, customary and Shari'a courts have
 jurisdiction only if both plaintiff, and defendant agree to it,
 though in practice fear of legal costs, delay, and distance to
 alternative courts encourage many litigants to choose these
 courts. Under the'1989 draft constitution (scheduled to come
 into full effect in 1992) Shari'a courts are limited to
 followers of Islam'and to only those states that establish them.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and generally
 respect constitutionally guaranteed individual rights. These
 include a presumption of innocence, the right to be present at
 a public trial, to confront witnesses and present evidence, and
 to be represented by legal counsel. There is legal provision
 for bail, but the Nigerian Bar Association and human rights
 groups charge that bail is underutilized. As a result, many
 accused persons remain in jail while'awaiting trial for petty
 offenses. Bail is denied to those charged with murder, armed
 robbery, and drug offenses.
 Public complaints about judicial corruption were frequent in
 1991. There are credible claims that some judges sought
 government advice before deciding cases where the Government
 was a litigant; long adjournments are frequently granted in
 wrongful imprisonment cases filed against the Government.
 There were also credible. reports that judges and security
 agents pressured individuals to drop suits against the FMG or
 state governments. Few released-detainees or closed newspapers
 filed or pursued suits against the FMG.
 Nevertheless, within a complex legal system,. in which the AFRC
 has encroached on the traditional role of the judiciary,
 Nigeria's courts have an established legal tradition, and a
 number of judges seek to uphold it. For example, in a lawsuit
 filed by several human rights groups against the temporary
 closure of the Guardian family of publications in May, the
 * presiding Lagos State High Court judge issued a temporary
 injunction barring the Lagos state government from any further
 press closures during the pendency of the suit.
 Some observers allege that there are political prisoners in
 Nigerian jails, but they cannot provide specific information
 and often do not distinguish between detainees held without
 
 
 292
 NIGERIA
 charge and those convicted of political offenses. The number
 of politically motivated detentions at any one time varied
 widely during the year, from a handful to over 200 after the
 May-June student disturbances.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference by
 the State in the private lives of its citizens. Provisions of
 the 1989 Constitution guarantee the rights of privacy in the
 home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications.
 While there have been isolated instances of unauthorized forced
 entry by security forces, the State does not carry out general
 surveillance of the population.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of speech and press
 The 1989 Constitution provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, but it also reserves for the federal and state
 Governments the exclusive right to own and operate radio and
 television stations, the most important media for reaching the
 public. There are no restrictions on ownership of print media,
 and, despite considerable government intimidation, there is a
 lively press. Among the many Nigerian daily newspapers are
 seven privately owned national dailies with large circulations,
 one daily owned by the federal Government, and another in which
 the federal Government owns a majority share. Many states
 operate their own daily or weekly newspapers. In some states,
 privately owned dailies compete with state papers. Several
 weekly newsmagazines vie for national readership.
 Criticism of the Government is tolerated to a substantial
 degree, and there is open discussion of political, social, and
 economic issues. However, officials frequently caution
 journalists, both publicly and privately, on their
 responsibilities and the limits of acceptable press activity.
 Although there are no published guidelines or decrees directly
 limiting freedom of speech and the press, Decree Two
 prohibitions against acts prejudicial to state security or
 economic stability cast an expansive shadow, and most
 journalists make a well-considered decision before publishing
 sensitive news articles. The issues considered most sensitive
 by the Government continue to be identifying top government
 officials with corruption, publication of subjects the
 Government believes are incitements to riot or which undermine
 state security, and subjects which fall under "disrupting the
 transition to civilian rule program." As a result of these
 sensitivities, as well as the FMG's proven disposition to take
 action against offending publications, self-censorship is
 common.
 Journalists who did not exercise self-censorship were targeted
 during the year. The Guardian news publishing group (three
 newspapers and three magazines) was closed by the Lagos state
 government after the Guardian Express published an article
 implicating the police in the deaths of two students during a
 campus disturbance in late May. The editor and three
 journalists from the paper were detained for several days.
 From March 8 to March 21, John West.publications (three
 separate publications) was closed by security agents after one
 
 
 293
 NIGERIA
 of its papers, the Lagos News, carried an article linking first
 lady Maryam-Babangida to a Lagos socialite who is the key
 figure in a sensational corruption scandal; editors of the
 paper were detained for 2 days. Without being charged for any
 criminal offense or being granted a hearing, foreign journalist
 William Keeling of the London-based Financial Times was
 deported after writing an investigative report on government
 expenditure of windfall oil revenues accrued through the
 temporary oil price increase during the Gulf crisis.  In
 September the editor of a state-owned newspaper was demoted by
 the newspaper's board of directors for placing an unflattering
 picture of the President's wife on the newspaper's front page.
 The Government and journalists continue to disagree on the
 Media Council Decree of 1988, which still has not been
 implemented because private journalists refuse to participate
 in the council as contemplated under the Decree. The Decree
 establishes licensing and educational requirements for
 journalists.. It also empowers the Media'Council, to be
 composed of government officials and journalists from
 government and private media, to subpoena journalists and
 require them to divulge sources of news articles.
 Academic freedom, although generally respected, came under some
 restrictions in 1991. There were no reports of censorship of
 books or other academic publications or of the intimidation of
 faculty. However, some campus groups allege that the state
 security service maintains an active undercover presence on
 campuses and reports directly to the Government and sometimes
 university authorities on acts or attitudes considered
 threatening to national security.'
 The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) remained
 officially banned for alleged radical activities. A NANS
 national executive-meeting was disrupted by Lagos antiriot
 police in early April.  In late April, NANS called for a
 nationwide student strike to pressure the Government into
 meeting demands ranging from ending the Structural Adjustment
 Program to providing guaranteed-minimum stipend to all
 university students. There were protests and disturbances on
 several campuses, resulting in three confirmed student deaths.
 Some students and human rights group claim, although without
 strong corroborating evidence, that many of the disturbances
 were instigated by students employed or encouraged by the
 Government to disrupt peaceful NANS demonstrations. In the
 aftermath of the disturbances, the NANS national executive
 officers were.detained, and overall approximately 200 students
 were detained. Several schools were closed and student union
 activities were banned or severely restricted by campus
 authorities. Many of the NANS leaders have also been expelled
 or suspended from their schools.
 Violent gang-like student groups popularly known as "secret
 cults" disrupted order on several campuses during the year, and
 the Government took measures to curtail their activities.
 Several hufdred students were interrogated by security agents
 and scores were arrested. Campus authorities formed anticult
 boards of inquiry which have suspended or expelled scores of
 suspected cult members across the country. Human rights
 observers and some student leaders assert that the boards did
 not provide fair hearings and that these proceedings were
 sometimes used to remove dissidents and student union leaders
 from campus.
 
 
 294
 NIGERIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Nigeria's 1989 Constitution assures all citizens the right to
 assemble freely and to associate with other persons in
 political parties, trade unions, or other special interest
 associations. Permits are not normally required for public
 meetings indoors, unless administrative approval is needed to
 use a government facility. Permits are required in many areas
 for outdoor gatherings, but the requirement is routinely
 overlooked by both the authorities and the organizations
 holding the meeting or rally. In most states, open air
 religious services away from a church or mosque continue to be
 prohibited.
 Nigerians form and participate in a wide variety of special
 interest organizations, including religious groups, trade
 groups, women's organizations, and professional associations.
 Organizations are not required to register with the Government
 and are generally permitted free association with other
 national and international bodies. Following violent religious
 disturbances in March 1987, however, the Government required
 that religious groups be sanctioned by either the Christian
 Association of Nigeria or the Supreme Council for Islamic
 Affairs. Only two political parties, both organized by the
 FMG, are permitted.
 On December 18-, the FMG rescinded the 1987 and 1989 decrees
 that prohibited hundreds of present and former officials and
 politicians from engaging in political activity or running for
 elective office during the transition to civilian rule. Within
 days of the FMG decision, 13 prominent politicians who had been
 arrested on December 2 for violating the decrees were released
 from custody, and charges against them were dropped. Although
 official language rescinding the decrees had not been
 promulgated at year's end, it is understood that all Nigerians
 excpet those convicted of offenses committed while in public
 office are now permitted to participate in politics, including
 running for election to the National Assembly and the
 Presidency in 1992.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The 1989 Constitution prohibits the federal and state
 governments from adopting any state religion. This is adhered
 to in practice, though some Christians maintain that Islam
 provides a political advantage and called on the FMG to
 publicly state that Nigeria is not a member of the Organization
 of the Islamic Conference. Constitutional provisions
 guaranteeing freedom of religious belief, religious practice,
 and religious education are generally respected. Nonetheless,
 it is commonly reported that members of one ethnic group may
 discriminate against those of another, and this discrimination
 may take the form of bureaucratic obstacles and delays in the
 construction of churches or mosques.
 Religious publications and travel are unrestricted.
 Missionaries and foreign clergy, though limited by quotas, are
 permitted to work in Nigeria and have not encountered official
 harassment or mistreatment.
 Tensions between the Muslim and Christian communities remain
 high in some parts of the country, particularly the north. In
 Bauchi state, ethnoreligious fighting erupted in April,
 resulting in hundreds of deaths and substantial destruction of
 property in the state capital. Both Christian and Muslim
 
 
 295
 NIGERIA
 populations blame government for failing to act promptly to
 quell the violence and both cite instances of police and army
 personnel taking sides in the disturbances. Katsina state was
 also the site of violent religious-disturbances in April when
 fundamentalist Muslims, disturbed over what they perceived as
 articles derogatory toward Islam appearing in the state
 newspaper, attacked government buildings and clashed with
 police. Many persons were arrested, and approximately 70 were
 convicted and jailed for various offenses by a tribunal
 established especially to investigate these disturbances.
 In October there was a major outbreak of violence with
 religious overtones in Kano; Gangs of Muslim and Christian
 youths fought running street battles, killing an est~mated 200
 personsand wounding many others. There was extensive damage
 to homes and shops. The immediate cause of the violence was
 reportedly a Christian effort (a revival meeting) to win
 converts in this strongly Muslim city. In contrast to the
 fighting in Bauchi, the military intervened quickly, imposing a
 dusk-to-dawn curfew and ordering security forces to shoot
 rioters on sight. A Muslim congregation had been denied
 permission to celebrate an Islamic holiday at the same venue, a
 local stadium, only weeks before. While a Board of Inquiry has
 been convoked, figures on arrests have varied widely, and there
 were no convictions by year's end.
 In the wake of violent disturbances in the'northern state of
 Kaduna in 1987, the Government instituted a ban, still in
 effect, on all religious organizations on postprimary campuses,
 .while reaffirming the right of individual students to practice
 their religion in recognized places of worship.
 Publication of advertisements paid for by religious
 organizations remain banned, although the ban is not strictly
 enforced, and. advertisements occasionally appear in the press.
 Religious programming on radio and television, both government
 controlled, remains limited in some areas. The 1982 ban on the
 Maitatsine Muslim sect, the source of bloody disturbances in
 1982, remains in effect. The group still exists but is closely
 monitored by the police.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nigeria's Constitution entitles its citizens to move freely
 throughout the country and reside where they wish. The
 Constitution also prohibits expulsion from Nigeria or the
 denial of exit or entry to any Nigerian citizen. Nigerians
 travel abroad in large numbers, and many thousands study
 overseas. Exit visas are not required. However, the .
 Government occasionally prevents travel for political reasons.
 A leading human rights activist has not been able to travel
 abroad since August 1990 when his passport was seized by
 security agents, and security agents in October seized the
 passport of a lawyer active in the human rights community. In
 the latter instance, a December court ruling enabled the
 attorney to retrieve his passport on an interim basis for
 medical travel. Further hearings are to be held on the case.
 Under Nigerian law, wives--including expatriates--must have the
 permission of their husbands to take their children out of
 Nigeria. Security officials in the past have prevented wives
 from leaving with children, but there were no known instances
 of such interference in 1991. Citizens leaving Nigeria have
 the right to reenter. Citizenship cannot be revoked for any
 
 
 296
 NIGERIA
 reason. No known penalties have been levied against the
 thousands of Nigerians who have emigrated, settled abroad, or
 acquired another nationality. However, Nigeria does not
 recognize dual nationality, and naturalization in another
 country does not exempt a person from Nigerian laws.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum in
 Nigeria for political refugees from other countries. Nigeria
 supports and fully cooperates with the Lagos office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The
 country presently hosts an estimated 1,500 refugees each from
 Liberia and Chad. Treatment and repatriation of refugees is
 normally conducted in accordance with UNHCR standards. In 1991
 several hundred Chadian refugees were voluntarily repatriated,
 continuing a practice from previous years. No refugees were
 reported expelled in 1991.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The 19-member AFRC headed by President Babangida is the highest
 political authority in the land. There is no nationally
 elected legislative body, and citizens do not have the right to
 change their national government through the electoral
 process. However, during the year, the FMG continued its
 closely controlled program of political transition to civilian
 government. The FMG has dictated the creation of only two
 political parties, complete with political manifestos,
 constitutions, and financing, with the exclusive right to
 compete for public office. One is the National Republic
 Convention (NRC), the party "slightly to the right," and the
 other is the Social Democratic Party (SPD), "the party slightly
 to the left." Nationwide voter registration programs were held
 in early August.
 The political parties held ward, local government, and state
 congresses to verify party membership lists and help select
 party candidates for state elections. After postponements
 caused by the creation of new states, both the NRC and the SDP
 conducted gubernatorial primaries where nominees were chosen by
 direct vote using an open ballot voting system. Under this
 system, party members cast votes by standing in line behind
 photos of their preferred candidates (the December state
 general elections were also by open ballot.) The FMG announced
 that the open ballot system, after certain modifications, would
 also be employed for the 1992 national elections. Many critics
 claim that the open ballot system subjected voters to coercion
 and social pressure, particularly in rural areas, and, in urban
 areas, discouraged civil servants and business people from
 voting out of fear of losing their jobs or government
 contracts, respectively.
 The two parties engaged in political campaigning and activity
 throughout the year. Generally, their activities were
 peaceful. There were, however, instances of both interparty
 and intraparty violence. While most of the violence was
 limited to minor altercations, there were some fatalities and
 destruction of property. In most cases, the perpetrators were
 never apprehended, but the Government regularly issued strong
 warnings against political violence.
 The October gubernatorial primaries were marred by widespread
 fraud on the part of candidates, party officials, and some
 electoral officials. After weeks of legal and bureaucratic
 tugs of war between candidates over bontested results, the FMG
 
 
 NIGERIA
 annulled results in 9 states and disqualified 11 candidates.
 In those cases, fresh primaries were held on December 5, with
 fewer reports of irregularities. The gubernatorial and state
 house of assembly elections on December 14 passed with little
 turmoil. There were only isolated reports of violence and
 electoral manipulation. The NRC won 16 of the 30 gubernatorial
 contests, while the SDP gained control in more of the
 unicameral state legislatures. Some of those results may be
 subject to challenge. --=.  -
 Traditionally, Nigerian politics have been male dominated,
 though women do not face legal impediments to political
 participation or voting, and the FMG has actively promoted
 their involvement. During the 1990 party elections, women in
 various-parts of Nigeria, including the traditionally
 conservative north, won positions in the NRC and SDP., In 1991
 there were several wofmen who campaigned vigorously for state �
 and national offices.
 Hundreds of former Nigerian government officials, both civilian
 and military, were prohibited from participating fully in the
 transition process until the decree instituting such a ban was
 rescinded on December 18 (see Section 2.b.). Though their
 right to vote had never been denied, they are now eligible to
 campaign and run for office. Many prominent Nigerians from
 across the political spectrum called for the lifting of the
 prohibition.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human"Rights
 The human rights committee of the Nigerian Bar Associatipn
 monitors the domestic human rights situation and occasionally
 speaks out against human rights abuses. At.least six major
 local groups are active exclusively in human rights matters:
 the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, led by a
 prominent Lagos physician; the Nigerian Council for Human
 Rights, chaired by a leading Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN);
 Human Rights Africa, led by a prominent Lagos lawyer; the Civil
 Liberties Organization (CLO), led by several Lagos attorneys
 and journalists;. the National, Association of Democratic
 Lawyers; and the Constitutional Rights Project, headed by the
 former national secretary of the CLO. Nobel laureate Wole
 Soyinka frequently spoke out on human rights issues as did
 various respected political figures and academicians.
 The human rights groups, Soyinka, and, to a lesser extent, the
 Nigerian Bar Association made strong public statements against
 the open ballot voting system, substandard prison conditions,
 police brutality, erosion of the jurisdiction of the courts,
 and, most importantly, the continued use of Decree Two and
 other forms of detention without charge. Some of these groups
 also publicly opposed the FMG's endorsement of former head of
 state Olusegun Obasanjo for United Nations Secretary General.
 A former president of the Nigerian Bar Association, Bola
 Ajibola, who also served as chairman of its Human Rights
 Committee, continued to hold the post of Attorney General and
 Minister of Justice. He has been severely criticized by human
 rights activists for his defense of Decree Two. He was
 nominated by the FMG and elected in December to the
 International Court of Justice despite public opposition from
 many in the human rights community. While most human rights
 monitors were relatively free from government interference in
 1991, attorneys Femi Falana and Alao Aka-Bashorun were detained
 
 
 298
 NIGERIA
 and questioned in connection with the threatened national
 student strike in late May.
 The Nigerian Vice President in October threatened two local
 human rights groups after they publicly opposed the Obasanjo
 and Ajibola nominations. Questioning the patriotism of the
 groups, the Vice President said the FMG would act against any
 group receiving foreign funding and whose activities could
 destabilize the Government. To date, no action has been taken
 against either group.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no official policy of discrimination against any of
 Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups, and laws do not favor one group
 over another. The 1989 Constitution requires that governmental
 employment and the provision of government services reflect
 "federal character," i.e., proportioning of public employment
 and government services to reflect the ethnic and regional
 distribution of the country's population. The FMG generally
 makes a conscious effort to strike a balance among different
 groups in its decisionmaking and in appointments to key
 government positions. Ethnic and regional hiring quotas are
 observed in most public sector employment. However, Nigeria
 has a long history of tension among its diverse ethnic groups,
 and tradition continues to impose considerable pressure on
 individual government officials to favor their own ethnic or
 religious group. Religious and ethnic favoritism or harassment
 persist. Persons not indigenous to their state of residence
 frequently experience difficulty, e.g., in finding employment
 and enrolling their children in the schools of their choice.
 Women have always had some economic power and have exerted
 influence in Nigerian society through women's councils, family
 connections, and to a much lesser extent, mainstream social,
 economic or political organizations. As primary school
 enrollment increases, girls and young women are gaining greater
 access to education. However, according to U.N. data, females
 get only 27 percent of the schooling of males. There has been
 a dramatic increase in the number of women obtaining university
 degrees and becoming professionals, including teachers,
 lawyers, doctors, judges, senior government officials, media
 figures, and business executives. However, despite some
 economic independence, women suffer discrimination in
 employment and experience social prejudice.
 The pattern of discrimination against women varies according to
 the ethnic and religious diversity of Nigeria's vast
 population. In some states, husbands can prevent their wives
 from obtaining employment or passports. In many states, a
 woman cannot own property in her own right and as a widow
 cannot inherit her husband's property, which in the absence of
 children usually reverts to the husband's family. Women do not
 receive equal pay for equal work, and male professionals
 receive fringe benefits not extended to their female
 counterparts. Women find it extremely difficult to acquire
 commercial credit or obtain tax deductions or rebates as the
 heads of households. Single mothers face added
 discrimination. Credible sources report that a highly
 qualified candidate was denied appointment as a trial court
 judge solely because she was a single mother. The Ministry of
 Justice has pledged to investigate this charge.

 NIGERIA
 While violence against women exists, there are no statistical
 data to help determine the extent of the problem. Police do
 not normally intervene in domestic disputes. Reports of wife
 beating are common, especially from rural areas, where women
 are generally uneducated and unlikely to use the legal system
 due to traditional pressures and ignorance of the law.
 Moreover, in very traditional areas it is questionable whether
 the courts would actively intervene to protect a woman who has
 formally accused her husband, if the level of alleged abuse
 does not exceed customary norms.
 The Government publicly opposes female circumcision, which
 reportedly affects close to 50 percent of the female
 population. The most dangerous form, infibulation, is still
 practiced in some areas. However, because of the deep cultural
 roots of this practice, the Government has relied primarily on
 education through women's and public health organizations to
 help induce change in attitudes rather than trying to
 criminalize the practice. Public education has had some
 effect, but change has been slow. The Government also opposes
 the selling of young girls for marriage by poor rural families,
 again primarily through educational means. There are no
 estimates of the extent to which this practice is carried out.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.
 Nigerian workers, except members of the armed forces and
 employees of government services designated essential by the
 FMG, may join trade unions.. In February 1990, the FMG
 dissolved the Customs, Excise and Immigration Staff Union and
 added its members to the list of essential occupations. The
 Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has called on the FMG to
 reinstate the Union.
 Employers are obliged by law to recognize tradd unions and must
 pay or deduct a dues checkoff for employees whoare members of
 a registered trade union. In 1981.organized labor claimed 3
 million members out of a total work force of 30 million. Since
 then, the available work force has increased as the population
 has grown, while trade union membership has probably declined
 due to low economic growth.
 While the trade union movement has had, within limits,
 considerable latitude for action, it has been subject to
 government oversight, particularly during the past 3 years.
 Despite provisions in the 1989 Constitution and Nigeria's
 ratification of 29 International Labor Organization (ILO)
 conventions, government decrees, and policy continue to
 restrict labor freedoms. A 1978 decree established a single
 central labor body, the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), created
 42 (now 41) industrial unions through forced mergers, and
 deregistered all other unions.
 In recent kears the Government has publicly announced its
 intention to merge the present 42 unions into 19. During 1991
 the Government said little on the subject, while the NLC has
 its own possible merger plan (which would reportedly result in
 21 unions), aimed, in its view, at strengthening the labor
 movement. The Nigerian Union of Journalists has filed suit
 against the NLC to stop its NLC-proposed merger with the Radio
 and Television Workers Union. The suit has not been decided,
 and some legal experts question whether the NLC, in the absence
 of a government decree, can force the merger of unions.

 NIGERIA
 The 1991 Report of the ILO Committee of Experts (COE)
 reiterated its criticisms of the Nigerian Labor Code, including
 the single trade union system, the ban on organizing for
 certain categories of workers, the broad powers of the
 Government to supervise union accounts at any time, and
 restriction of the right to strike through compulsory
 arbitration in other than essential services.
 The right to strike is recognized by law, except in the case of
 essential services as defined by the Government. During 1991
 strikes were relatively few and of short duration and focused
 primarily on pay and benefits.
 NLC president Paschal Bafyau has publicly endorsed the Social
 Democratic Party (SDP). Government officials have warned that
 under the transition to civil rule program it is illegal for an
 organized body such as the NLC to engage in partisan politics.
 Thus far, neither Bafyau nor the NLC have been sanctioned for
 backing the SDP.
 In August the FMG amended a policy held since 1975 which
 permitted international labor affiliation only with the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and affiliated
 pan-African labor federations. The old policy provided for
 criminal fine and imprisonment of individuals and proscription
 of unions for violating the ban. Decree 35 of 1991 partially
 repealed the ban by allowing affiliation with other,
 non-African international labor organizations but only for
 training and educational assistance.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor laws of Nigeria permit both the right to organize and
 the right to bargain collectively between management and trade
 unions. Collective bargaining is, in fact, common in many
 sectors of the economy. Nigerian law further protects workers
 against retaliation by employers for labor activity through an
 independent arm of the judiciary, the Nigerian Industrial
 Court, which handles complaints of antiunion discrimination.
 The FMG, however, retains broad authority over labor matters.
 In many areas of contention, the unions often take their
 demands directly to FMG authorities rather than to the
 employers. At the same time, the FMG can intervene forcefully
 to end debate on issues which its feels contravene the
 government's essential political or economic programs. In
 January the FMG abolished the uniform wage structure for all
 government entities. Now each tier of government--federal,
 state, local, and state-owned firms--must negotiate its own
 level of wages, benefits, and conditions of employment.
 Organized labor will now have to bargain with each governmental
 employer, and there is apprehension that this may weaken
 labor's bargaining position. President Babangida laid the
 cornerstone for an Export Processing Zone on November 8, but
 the Zone is not expected to be operational before 1993.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Nigeria's 1989 Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor, and this prohibition is generally observed.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children
 Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree prohibits employment of children
 under 15 years of age in commerce and industry and restricts
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 301
 NIG9RIA-
 other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic work.
 The Labor Decree does allow the apprenticeship of youths aged
 13 to 15, but only under specific conditions. Apprenticeship
 exists in a wide range of crafts,-trades, and state
 enterprises. With respect to apprentices over the age of 15,
 their activity is not specifically regulated by the
 Government. These laws are enforced by the Ministry of
 Employment, Labour, and Productivity only sporadically,
 particularly in the rural areas where most Nigerians live.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree also established a 40-hour
 workweek, prescribed 2 to 4 weeks of annual leave, and set a
 minimum wage for commerce and industry.. In January 1991, the
 Government announced a 50-percent increase in the minimum wage,
 but labor leaders were not satisfied with the new figure,
 believing that it did not represent much of an increase since
 it also included many allowances previously given or permitted
 a reduction in the benefits-of some workers. Labor also -
 complaihed that government and private employers were slow to
 implement the new wage scale, and there were numerous local
 strikes and work stoppages in protest. During one wage-related
 demonstration in Kwara state, three people were killed when
 workers clashed with antiriot police.
 The 1974 Decree contains general health and safety provisions,
 some aimed specifically at youth and female workers,
 enforceable by the Ministry of Employment, Labour, and
 Productivity. Employers must compensate injured workers and
 dependent survivors of those killed in industrial accidents.
 The ineffectiveness of the Ministry in enforcing these laws in
 the workplace is regularly criticized by labor unions.
