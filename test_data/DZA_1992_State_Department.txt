 ALGERIA
 Under a Constitution adopted in 1989 Algeria was converted from a one-party So-
 cialist state, in which the National Liberation Front (FIN) held power, to a
 multiparty parliamentary system. However, political power continued to be held by
 a government composed overwhelmingly of present and former FIN members with
 the President wielding executive power. On December 26, 1991, the Islamic Salva-
 tion Front (FIS) won the first round of elections for the National Assembly. How-
 ever, on January 11, 1992, President Chadli Bendjedid was forced to resign by the
 army and elements within the Government. The next day the regime cancelled the
 second round of National Assembly elections. A five-me r Hig State Committee
 was created on January 14 to serve as the country's collective presidency. Mohamed
 Boudiaf, the President of the High State Committee, was assassinated on June 29;
 he was replaced by Ali Kafi, who remains in office.
 The National Police, the Gendarmerie, and the army maintain internal security.
 Security forces resorted on occasion to excessively harsh treatment of prisoners and
 detainees. This has included mental and physical harassment and, in isolated cases,
 torture. According to the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total mili-
 tary expenditures for 1989 were $2,313 million. There is no indication that efforts
 will be made to reduce current expenditures in the near future.
 Algeria's industrialized economy (agriculture accounts for less than 10 percent of
 the gross domestic product) remains largely under government control, with the
 State operating almost all major industries, much of the distribution and retail sys-
 tems, and the entire banking and credit system. Under Prime Minister Ghozali (who
 resigned in July) the Government pursued a reform program emphasizing the d-
 centralization of economic decisionmaking. The economic program enunciated by
 current Prime Minister Belaid Abdesselam, however, calls for an increased state
 role in managing some sectors of the economy. High population growth, an acute
 housing shortage, a scarcity of foreign exchange, an the egacy of years of economic
 inefficiency and corruption continue to hamper the Government's efforts to meet so-
 cial needs.
 The human rights situation deteriorated severely in the wake of the cancellation
 of parliamentary elections in January and the declaration of a state of emergency
 in February. Provisions under the state of emergency allowed the regime to detain
 administratively thousands (the Government cites 9,000; the FIS claims 30,000) of
 people in detention camps in southern Algeria without benefit of legal representa-
 tion or due process. In August, however, the regime pledged to close all the camps
 and release or transfer to the judicial system all the detainees. As of late December,
 four camps remained open, with around 1,000 people still in detention, according
 to the Government. A rash of assassinations and terrorist bombings followed the
 cancellation of elections. Citing a need to protect security and public order, the Gov-
 ernment suspended 9 publications (one of them twice) by administrative action and
 on at least seven occasions seized single-day editions of publications.
 Apart from these actions, which have frustrated an electoral process that for the
 rst time could have resulted in a democratic change of government and severely
 restricted the freedom of the press, other human rights problems included arbitrary
 interference with privacy, excessively harsh treatment of detainees, and restrictions
 on freedoms of assembly, religion, and women's rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-There were no known instances of
 politically motivated extrajudicial killing by the Government in 1992. Nevertheless,
 two detainees died from dehydration in May after escaping into the desert from a
 (977)
 
 
 978
 southern detention camp. Government forces were subject to frequent armed attacks
 after the cancellation of elections in January, resulting in the deaths of over 200
 security force members. The Government charged that most of these killings were
 acts of politically motivated terrorism rather than criminally motivated murder and
 reacted by issuing, by administrative decree, increasingly strict laws. Although
 armed attacks were aimed predominantly against security force members and gov-
 ernment representatives, private citizens were also targets. A bomb explosion at Al-
 giers airport on August 26 killed 9 and wounded 124. Bombs also exploded at a
 modern shopping center and at an Air France office in Algiers, causing damage but
 no deaths. Among other incidents, an anti-Islamist university professor was assas-
 sinated, and an unsuccessful assassination attempt was made against the leader of
 Algeria's largest trade union.
 e Section 1.g. for a discussion of killings resulting from the security forces' use
 of excessive force in dispersing crowds of demonstrators following the cancellation
 of elections.
 b. Disappearance.-A number of people seized by security forces in January and
 February were not heard from for several months (as many as 3,000 according to
 local human rights observers), but almost all were eventually located in detention
 camps. The Government acknowledged that it maintained poor detainee identifica-
 tion records.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continued to be reports of torture and brutal treatment of prisoners by the
 security forces, although there were fewer such reports than in past years. The inde-
 pendent Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH) asserted pub-
 licly that it had evidence of numerous cases of trtur by the security services, but
 declined to provide evidence of these allegations when requested to do so by the
 Governments National Observatory of Human Rights. A medical team under the
 auspices of the Algerian League for Human Rights (a diferent organization than
 the LADDH) found no evidence of torture in detention camps but did report in-
 stances of the security forces mistreating the detainees before the latter were sent
 to the camps. Government officials acknowledged that individual cases of improper
 behavior by the security forces occurred, but stressed that the Government did not
 sanction torture and would investigate any allegations of torture for which evidence
 was presented. Arresting officers subjected some detainees to mental and physical
 abuse including kicks, punches, and gratsitous insults, according to a number of
 sources. Detainees in the camps faced hardships on a daly basis; according to press
 accounts, detainees faced temperatures reaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit, poor food,
 inadequate bedding, and overcrowding.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention and stipulates that detention for questioning in criminal inves-
 tigation cases may not exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be charged
 or released. This period may be extended to 4 days by written request of the govern-
 ment prosecutor. Provisional liberty may be authorized if the detainee shows that
 he can guarantee to be present at all necessary stages of the inquiry. Detainees
 must be informed im'mediately of charges against them. Once charged, however, a
 person may be held under pretrial detention indefinitely while the case is being in-
 vestigted. For security-related crimes, under prvisions established in Article 5 of
 the state of emergency declared in February, the Ministry of Interior is empowered
 to "order that anyone of full legal age, whose activity is clearly found to constitute
 a danger to public order and security or to the proper functioning of public services,
 be placed in a security center." Under this provision, government security forces ar-
 rested and detained thousands (the Government cited 9,000 while the Islamic Salva-
 tion Front claimed 30,000).
 Although a few of the detainees were reportedly involved in criminal activity
 when seized, the maority were arrested exclusively for participating in demonstra-
 tions or expressing their views. According to the Government, aft arrrest and roc-
 essinan estimated 9,000 detainees were sent to detention camps in southern ige-
 ria (tere were eight camps operating iu March), without being formally charged
 and often without camp authorities notifying next-of-kin about their detention. The
 Government released a small number of sick and elderly detainees in May and,
 under increasing pressure from Algerian and international human rights groups,
 announced on August 8 that all detention centers would be closed. The Government
 indicated that all detainees would be released except the few charged with criminal
 acts.
 The release proecedures were reportedly disorganized, with authorities frequently
 failing to noti y the families of detainees about those being released and releasing
 detainees near the camps without transportation home. The majority of detainees
 
 
 979
 were released, but as of the end of the year, around 1,000 people continued to be
 held in four remaining camps.
 An antiterrorist law issued in October increased the permissible length of
 prearraignment detention from 2 days to 12 days. The new law defined terrorism
 broay as "any act committed against individuas     or sybols of the republic
 with the aim of jeopardizing life, security, or lroperty, or the obstruction of the work
 of public authorities or institutions * *  or the encouragement of such acts, includ-
 ing through the reprinting or redistribution of documents or recordings."
 There is no bair system. Lawyers are normally permitted access to their clients
 although this right is sometimes disregarded. Lawyers for seven FIS leaders tried
 in July were prevented from meeting with their clients on several occasions. Law-
 yer-client meetings are supervised visually by a guard.
 Exile is not a legal form of punishment in Algeria and is not known to be prac-
 ticed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The 'udicial system consists of civil and military
 courts and, since December, special an iterroit courts made up of civilian judges.
 There are no Islamic courts, although Shari'a law forms much of the basis for civil
 court rulings on social matters. The Constitution provides for the independence of
 the judiciary, and it is generally independent of the executive branch in cases not
 involving security or public order. In such cases, and particularly in military courts
 the Government is able to influence court decisions. Civilian judges are appointed
 and promoted by the Ministry of Justice through an independent bard created in
 1991.
 The antiterrorist law issued in October provided for three special courts with civil-
 ian judges to try crimes specifically relating to terrorism. As indicated above, these
 courts were formally established in December. It was widely believed that these
 courts were established to allow the Government more influence over the outcome
 and sentencing in security-related criminal cases.
 In civilian courts, defendants are usually permitted unrestricted access to counsel,
 who operate without government interference. The Algerian Bar Association is le-
 ally euired toprovde free legal servies to defendants unable to afford counsel.
 eendants are a       of the chares against them at the time they are bound over
 for trial. Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and present evidence.
 Trials are public, although generally not publicized, and defendants have the right
 of appeal.
 Article 10 of the declaration of the state of emergency gives military courts broad
 jurisdiction over crimes (including felonies and major offenses) related to security
 and public order. The vast majority of criminal cases in 1992 remained in the civil-
 ian court system.L Criminal cases heard by military courts included the trials of the
 men accused of attacking a border police installation in Guemar in November 1991
 and the trials of seven FIS leaders, including Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, who
 were found guilty of threatening the security of the State. Although prosecutors re-
 quested life sentences, Madani and Belhadj were sentenced to 12 years each. A
 number of observers said that the regime assigned the FIS leaders' trial to the mili-
 tartribunal to afford itself more influence over the trial's outcome.
 me of the rights normally protected and observed in civil court proceedings
 were ignored or circumscribed by the military courts. Defendants were denied the
 unrestricted right to call witnesses and the right to be represented by counsel of
 choice. The Government denied that there were any political prisoners in Algeria
 in 1992. Some human rights observers, including the Algerian League for the De-
 fense of Human Rights (LADDH), considered the Algerians held in detention camps
 in the South to have been political prisoners. Of the people held in the camps earlier
 this year, an estimated 1,000 remain in detention.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, Article 6 of the
 declaration of the state of emergency authorizes the Ministry of Interior and the
 governors of provinces to designate specific areas where visitors and nonresidents
 of particular areas must sty, refuse residence to anyone whose activitX is perceived
 as threatening to public order, and issue "exceptional search warrants at any time
 of day or night. Security forces have used these special provisions to enter resi-
 dences and question suspected FIS members. The police and security services are
 also believed to use telephone-monitoring systems, reportedly without the prior
 court authorization that is required by law.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violation of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Following the resignation of President Bendjedid and the cancellation of par-
 liamentary elections, mass demonstrations occurred in January and February. In
 dispersing crowds, security forces reportedly used excessive force. Security forces
 ined live ammunition over the heads of, and occasionally at, demonstrators, and
 
 
 980
 fired tear gas over, and occasionally into, crowds, causing a number of deaths. The
 Algerian media reported between 30 and 35 civilian deaths and at least 9 security
 personnel deaths, while local and international human rights groups placed the
 death toll for civilians and security force members at between 60 and 70.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms were substantially impaired in
 1992 both by the climate of fear created by the arrest and detention of thousands
 of Algerians in January and February and by the Government's action in suspend-
 ing a number of publications and seizing several other single-day editions of publica-
 tions containing articles the Government deemed harmful to public order.
 The broad authority the regime gave itself in February to reestablish public order,
 bolstered by new antiterrorist legislation, resulted in self-censorship and discour-
 aged public expression of views supportive of the now banned Islamic Salvation
 Front. While the Government said it did not object to criticism as long as such criti-
 cism did not weaken the institutions of the State or threaten security or public
 order, the Government determined what criteria to apply. In January the Govern-
 ment suppressed two FIS journals. Under authority granted to it by Article 5 of the
 February emergency declaration (and Presidential Decree No. 92-320 of August),
 the Government suspended nine additional publitioions. On October 7, the Govern-
 ment authorized the four suspended dailies to resume publication, although on De-
 cember 19 the Government again ordered the suspension of one of these dailies.
 Five weekfy newspapers remain suspended. The Government on a number of occa-
 sions also seized editions of dailies, weeklies, and FIB journals that contained arti-
 cles the Government said were false, unconfirmed, misleading, and damaging to
 public order. These closures were accompanied by government warnings that jour-
 nalistic irresponsibility would no oner be tolerated, causing the press to become
 much more cautious in its reporting. The Government also detained at least 15 jour-
 nalists in February and March for criticizing the state of emergency and in May ex-
 pelled aFrench journalist who wrote articles unfavorable to the regime. The press
 did carry expressions of opinion contrary to those of the Government, including criti-
 cism of government economic and social policies, but criticism of the state of emer-
 gency was avoided.
 Independent newspapers currently go through state-owned companies to get their
 publications printed. They do so for financial reasons and not as a result of a legal
 requirement.
 There were two terrorist attacks on the press: one bomb was exploded at a
 compound housing several newspaper headquarters in Algiers in March and another
 was set off at the headquarters of the state-owned television station in Algiers in
 June.
 Radio and television remained under government control, with coverage biased in
 favor of the Government's policies. Because of the widespread accessibility of sat-
 ellite dish antennas among the Algerian middle class, however, many have access
 to European television news, which is watched reglarly.
 There continuedtbe some restrictions on academic freedom. There is social p rc-
 sure from some students and Islamist student groups on campuses urging conform-
 ity to Islamist norms of dress and behavior. In this atmosphere, some female teach-
 ers have complained that they found it difficult to continue teaching. Algerian pro-
 fessors attendinternational conferences regularly, and many Algrian professors are
 active in human rights circles without apparent prejudice to their professional ca-
 reers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaion.-Although the Constitution and
 legislation adop ted in 1989 provide for the rights of assembey and association, free-
 dom of peaceful assembly was sharpl curtailed under the state of emergency. Arti-
 cle seven of the state of emergency ceclaration allows the Government to close all
 places of entertainment, halls, and assembly places, as well as ban all demonstra-
 tions likely to disturb peace and threaten public order." The authorities refused
 afer February to issue permits for marches or demonstrations in public squares or
 streets. Permits were generally granted, however, to the Front for Socialist Forces
 (FFS) and the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD), and other legal parties, for
 public gatherings held indoors.
 According to the July 1989 Political Associations Law, membership in political or-
 ganizations is permitted for all Algerians except judges, army and security service
 personnel, and members of the Constitutional Council All nongovernmental associa-
 tions must be approved by the Interior Ministry. On March 4, the Interior Ministry
 obtained judicial aoprvalt rescind the FIB's authorization to act as a legal politi-
 cal party. Most political groups operate openly. These range from political parties-
 
 
 there were over 60 parties, including Islamic parties such as.Hamas, active in
 1992--to specialized groups such as human rights organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-While the Constitution declares Islam to be the state reli-
 gion (almost all Algerians consider themselves Muslim), it prohibits discrimination
 based on belief or any other personal or social circumstance or condition. The Gov-
 ernment protects the rights of the very small Christian and Jewish populations and
 includes leaders of these communities at ceremonial state functions. The Jewish
 community numbers fewer than 300, and it maintains a synagogue in central Al-
 giers. Algerian Christians reportedly number fewer than 600. Conversion from
 Islam to Christianity is extremely rare and is severely sanctioned by family mem-
 bers and the community. Algerians who convert from Islam do so clandestinely.
 The Islamic clergy is government trained, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs
 appoints imams to both state and privately funded mosques. Beginning in February,
 the Ministry of Religious Affairs removed a number of imams for preaching
 antigovernment views, replacing them with progovernment imams. In January ang
 February, a number of mosques known for the antigovernment sentiment of their
 leaders and followers were surrounded following prayer by security forces; this often
 led to clashes.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom to travel within Algenia and abroad and to emigrate is pro-
 vided for by law and is generally respected in practice, although minor children are
 not allowed to travel abroad without their father's permission. A curfew announced
 in early December, however, prohibited people from traveling within Algiers and
 surrounding provinces between 10:30 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. Gendarmerie checkpoints
 in the cities and countryside routinely stop vehicles to inspect vehicle registrations
 and occasionally search for signs of terrorist activity or evidence of black-marketing.
 There are some administrative restrictions on foreign travel related to mandatory
 military service and the obligation to repay state education scholarships.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum. Based on data provided
 by the Government, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 estimates that approximately 165,000 Sahrawi refugees live in camps in southwest-
 ern Algeria. Of these, some 80,000 are considered by UNHCR to be in vulnerable
 groups, and thus in need of aid. Sahrawi refugees in southwestern Algeria are sup-
 ported by both the Government and the UNHCR. Another estimated 50,000 dis-
 placed Tuaregs from Mali and Niger live in settlements in southern Algeria.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The cancellation of National Assembly elections and assumption of power by the
 High State Committee in January effectively denied citizens the right to change
 their government. Constitutional provisions approved by the National Assembly in
 1989 which convert Algeria from a one-party Socialist state to a multiparty system
 have been effectively suspended.
 Although multiparty elections for local and municipal councils took place in 1990,
 implementation on a national level was delayed until the National Assembly elec-
 tion in December 1991. The election resulted in a major victory for the FIS (188 of
 the 430 assembly seats went to the FIS; 15 went to the governing FLN) and evi-
 denced strong popular condemnation of the Government. In January President
 Bendjedid resigned under pressure from the army, election results were cancelled,
 and a five-member executive body, the High State Committee (HSC), was named to
 replace Bendedid and to serve as a collective presidency until December 1993 (when
 Ben~jedd's term of office was to end). In Aprilthe HSC appointed a 60-member Na-
 tional Consultative Council (CCN) to advise the executive. Although approximately
 60 political parties remain legal and operative, the Government postponed indefi-
 nitely a resumption of the electoral process.
 Two levels of local government exist: 1,541 local districts elect municipal councils
 to 4-year terms, and 48 provinces elect provincial councils to 5-year terms to work
 in consultation with prvmnial governors appointed by the Interior Ministry. Follow-
 ing local and regional elections in June 1990, the FIS controlled 853 municipal and
 32 provincial councils. During 1992 under Article 8 of the state of emergency, the
 Government replaced about 800 of tihe 885 FIS-controlled councils with government-
 appointed executive committees; about 85 FIS-controlled councils thus remain in op-
 eration.
 Very few women are active in government. Less than 1 percent of the candidates
 for Assembly seats in the last election were women, a result of strong social pres-
 sures against women's participation in politics and government.
 The Berbers, an important indigenous minority group, participate freely and ac-
 tively in the political process. Two important KaXyie-based (see Section 5) political
 
 
 982
 parties exist, inclus  the Front for Socialist Forces (FFS), which came in second
 to the FIS in terms of seats won in the first round of parliamentary elections in
 December 1991, and the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD). Furthermore, Ber-
 bers hold a number of influential positions within the Government. Tuaregs (a peo-
 ple of Berber origin) do not play as important a role in the political process, due
 in large part to their small numbers (estimated at 10,000) and their nomadic na-
 ture. Systemic or government-sanctioned barriers to political participation, however,
 do not exist against any Berber groups, including the Tuaregs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights organizations are active in Algeria, including the Na-
 tional Observatory of Human Rights (a government-created organization charged
 with monitoring and reporting developments to the HSC), the Committee Against
 Torture the Algerian league of Human Rights (which is affidiated with the
 Maghreb Human Rights Association), and the Algerian League for the Defense of
 Human Rights. Algerian human rights monitors receive wide publicity in the inde-
 pendent press and regularly hold press conferences to publicize their initiatives.
 me say, however, that they are ignored by the government-controlled press.
 The Government permitted visits by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC), Amnesty International, and Middle East Watch in 1992. In some in-
 stances, their access was restricted. Several Middle East Watch requests to visit de-
 tention camps were denied. The ICRC suspended its visits because the Government
 refused to meet the ICRC's conditions for conducting the visits. Local security au-
 thorities in the eastern city of Constantine detained the Middle East Watch rep-
 resentative during his visit. The Minister of the Interior subsequently apologized to
 the representative for his detention.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The 1989 Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based on birth, race,
 sex, belief, or any other personal or social conditions or circumstance. The declara-
 tion of the state of emergency did not affect these prohibitions. The 1989 Constitu-
 tion omits, however, the specific guarantees for women's political, economic, social,
 and cultural rights which had been included in the 1976 constitution.
 Minority groups and women do not appear to be treated unfairly in their access
 to housing, education, and health care. Algeria's population is ethnically mixed, and
 ethnic minorities, except blacks, seem to fare no better and no worse than the Arab
 majority. Black Algerians (who make up a very small percentage of the population)
 face continued social discrimination at all levels of society and traditionally perform
 the most menial and lowest paying jobs.
 The Berbers, who were the original inhabitants of the region prior to its settling
 by Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, and later by Europeans, can be divided into four
 subgroups: 1) Kabylie Berbers, who live in the Kabylie mountains east of Algiers,
 2) Chaoui Berbers, who live in the Aures Mountains south of Constantine; 3) Tua-
 regs largely nomadic tribes living in southern Algeria; and 4) the Mozabites of the
 northern part of the Sahara region.
 Berber ethnic consciousness remains strong and is fueled by the Berbers' desire
 to preserve their distinctive cultural identity and lanuage in the face of the Gov-
 ernment's emphasis on the development of an Arab identity. Many Algerians are
 both Arab and Berber, and many Berbers, including Prime Minister Belaid
 Abdesselam, achieve positions of influence in government. Nevertheless, some Ber-
 ber spokesmen assert that the Government implicitly seeks to repress the Berber
 culture, including the teaching and propagation of Amazight, the language of the
 Kabylie Berbers. Amazight is not taught in primary and secondary schools but is
 taught at Tizi Ouzou University.
 The situation of the nomadic Tuaregs of Algeria's southern desert continues to be
 of domestic and international concern. The drought in the central Sahara continues
 to disrupt traditional Tuareg patterns of life. Notwithstanding agreements nego-
 tiated between the governments of Algeria, Mali, Niger, and Libya and Tuareg rep-
 resentatives, Tuareg-related grievances and conflicts outside Algeria remain unre-
 solved. As a consequence, large numbers of Tuareg refugees (from Niger and Mali)
 remain in Algeria. Algerian Tuaregs are encouraged to settle and are generally
 treated fairly by government authorities.
 Women's rights are restricted by Islamic law and custom. Women's rights to work
 live independently, and generally function outside the traditional Muslim social
 norm have come under heated attack from Islamist leaders and conservative ele-
 ments of society. Revisions to Algeria's Family Code in 1984 effectively curtailed
 some women's rights. Under the Code, much of which is based on Shari'a law,
 
 
 983
 women, regardless of their age, employment, or civil status, remain like minors
 under the legal guardianship of a husband or father. Although the Family Code al-
 lows husbands to have four wives (a rsre ocurrence), it requires the husband to
 disclose his marital status and intent to both his present andi future spouses. If he
 fails to tell the truth, any of his wives ma file a suit in court against him for fraud
 or divorce. The Code awards only 4 months of alimony to the woman regardless of
 the husband's means and the circumstances of the divorce, although under the Code
 thewifemayreceiveasignificantsettlementincashorpropertyafter divorce if so
 stipulated by a prenuptial agreement. Because Islamic law and the Family Code for-
 bid Algerian Muslim women from marrying non-Muslims, women engaged to non-
 Muslim men are sometimes subjected to harassment, including confiscation of their
 passports by authorities.
 With the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, secularist women regard themselves as
 increasingly under attack from proponents of the implementation of Islamic law.
 Conservative societal and family pressures, as well as support or fear of the FIS,
 resulted in an increasing number of Algerian women weanng Islamic dress, includ-
 ing the hijab headcovering with ankle-length overdress.
 An estimated 14 percent of the Algerian work force are women, most of whom
 work in urban areas. Many of these women are trained and employed in the fields
 of medicine and teaching, and some women serve in the armed forces. Some radical
 Islamists blame male unemployment on female participation in the workplace and
 argue that women should not be allowed to work outside the home. At the same
 time, some moderate Islamist leaders have publicly defended the right of women to
 work. Girls represent just under 50 percent of all children enrolled in primary and
 secondary schools and 35 percent of all students enrolled in universities.
 The extent of violence against women is unclear. Formal studies on this problem
 do not exist, but knowledgeable sources have suggested that wife and sister beating
 are not rare occurrences, particularly in more traditional, male-dominated families.
 Roth types of abuse, however, are increasingly unacceptable among middle-class Al-
 gerians and seem to be declining in society at large. Ause within the family is sel-
 dom mentioned publicly. Wives who are beaten by their husbands may file criminal
 charges or sue for divorce, but such legal actions are rare. Cases of rape are
 underreported to police, due to the social stigma attached in Algeria to victims of
 such crimes.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Algerian workers have the right to form and be rep-
 resented by trade unions of their choice. Government approval for the creation of
 a labor union is not necessary, although considerable limits are imposed on union
 activities. Unions are not legally allowed to be associated with political parties, al-
 though in practice some, including the National Patriotic Rally-backed General
 Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), still are. Unions are forbidden to receive funds
 from abroad, and the Government may suspend a union's operations if it violates
 the law. Unions are also subject to dissolution by judicial means if a court finds the
 union has engaged in illegal activities.
 Article Six of the state of emergency declaration authorized the Government to
 require workers to do their usual jobs in both public and private enterprises in the
 event of an unauthorized or illegal strike. The 1990 law on industrial relations per-
 mits strikes only after 14 days of mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitration
 efforts. This law states that arbitration decisions in worker-management disputes
 are binding on both parties. If no agreement is reached, and provided a majority
 of the workers vote by secret ballot to strike, the workers may legally strike. A mini-
 mum level of public services must be maintained during public service sector
 strikes.
 Numerous (at least 20) strikes in all sectors occurred in 1992. Although many of
 these strikes did not satisfy terms set by the 1990 law (in many cases there were
 no attempts at arbitration or mediation before striking), the Government did not
 prosecute the workers involved. Strikes included those by dockworkers, taxi-drivers,
 and customs officials. Many strikes were averted due to successful mediation or ar-
 bitration. Most of the strikes were resolved by wage or other concessions from man-
 agement. The Government did not rely upon the state of emergency provisions to
 force striking workers back to work.
 Unions may form and join federations or confederations and affiliate with inter-
 national bodies. Several Algerian unions including the UGTA, have sought inter-
 national contacts beyond the quasi-officia Arab and African Trade Union Organiza-
 tions in which they participate.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1990 law permits collec-
 tive bargaining for all unions, and this right has been freely practiced. The law also
 
 
 prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers and provides mechanisms for resolving trade union members complaints of
 antiunion practices by employers. It further permits all unions, whether longstand-
 ing or newly created, to recruit members at the workplace.
 There are no special economic zones in Algeria.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is in-
 compatible with the Constitutions provisions on individual rights, and the Penal
 Code was amended in 1990 to ban compulsory labor explicitly. This ban is effec-
 tively enforced by labor inspections and penal sanctions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age is
 16 years. Work inspectors, who report to the Ministry of Labor, are responsible for
 enforcing the minimum employment age by periodic or unannounced inspection vis-
 its to the workplace. The minimum age is enforced in the state sector, the country's
 largest employment sector. It is not effectively enforced in the agricultural or small
 private sectors, but violations are not widespread. However, there was an increase
 in the number of children occupied in informal employment, such as street vending,
 due to the poor state of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1990 Law on Work Relations defines the
 overall framework for acceptable conditions of work, but leaves specific policies with
 regard to hours, salaries, and other work conditions to the discretion of employers
 in consultation with employees. Minimum wages are fixed by government decree
 after negotiations between the Government and the UGTA. Although Ministry of
 Labor work inspectors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the minimum
 wage regulations, enforcement has been inconsistent. The minimum wage is not
 adequate to provide a worker with a family a decent standard of living.
 Algeria has a 44-hour workweek and well-developed occupation andhealth regula-
 tions, but enforcement by government work inspectors is generally lax.
