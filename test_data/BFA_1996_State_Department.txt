 BURKINA FASO
 President Blaise Compaore continued to dominate the Government of the Fourth
 Republic, assisted by members of his party, the Congress for Democracy and
 Progress (CDP). In spite of the existence of dozens of political parties, there is little
 viable opposition to the President and his Government, which includes one rep-
 resentative from a small self-described opposition party. The CDP controls the Na-
 tional Assembly with 86 of the 107 seats. Several opposition parties have token rep-
 resentation. In December 1995, the constitutionally mandated (though purely con-
 sultative) second chamber of the National Assembly was installed, completing the
 government structure envisaged in the 1991 Constitution. The Constitution provides
 or an independent judiciary; however, it is subject to executive influence.
 The security apparatus consists of the armed forces, the paramilitary gendar-
 merie, controlled by the Ministry of Defense, and the police, controlled by the Min-
 istry of Territorial Administration.
 Over 80 percent of the population of 10 million engages in subsistence agriculture,
 which is highly vulnerable to rainfall variation. Frequent drought, limited commu-
 nication and transportation infrastructure, in addition to a low literacy rate, are
 longstanding problems. The 50 percent devaluation of the cfa franc in 1994 added
 to the existing economic hardship of a structural adjustment program under way
 since 1991. That program seeks to limit government spending, especially on salaries
 and transfers, and open the economy to market forces, including privatization and
 reduction in the size of many inefficient state companies. Per capita income is about
 $150 per year, in postdevaluation terms.
 There was continuing pogress in the move towards greater democratization. De-
 spite a functioning parliament structure and elected local governments, citizens are
 unable to exercise fully the right to change their government, and serious human
 rights abuses persisted. The extrajudicial killing of a villager by the local police and
 a general climate of impunity fostered by failure to prosecute previous abusers tar-
 nished the Governments record. Prison officials continued to torture and mistreat
 detainees, and prison conditions remained harsh. A libel suit brought by the Presi-
 dent against a political foe for particularly harsh public criticism left some members
 of the press apprehensive about a resurgence of self-censorship. The most egregious
 instances of violence against women remain those involving female genital mutila-
 tion, although women continue to campaig against this practice as well as against
 other forms of discrimination. Killings of crimninal suspects by vigilante mobs re-
 mained a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-In May members of the police sta-
 tioned in the town of Reo shot and killed an unarmed villager during an operation
 to fine owners of unregistered vehicles. This incident, which still has not resulted
 in any punitive action by the Government against those responsible, marred an oth-
 erwise improving record regarding the security forces. The major problem with law
 enforcement is a general climate of impunity for human rights abusers fostered by
 the habitual failure of the Government's investigations to result in guilty findings
 
 
 or appropriate sanctions. Inquiries tend to drag until they are overshadowed by sub-
 sequent incidents, and then they are quietly shelved. Appeals by human rights orga-
 nizations generally go unanswered. This failure to prosecute previous abuses re-
 mains a major hindrance to further human rights progress.
 An official investigation into the May 1995 shooting to death of two unarmed high
 school demonstrators in Garango has yielded no results. The investigation into the
 July 1994 savage beating of two prisoners, who later died at the Maco prison in
 Ouagadougou, ended without calling for the punishment of those responsible. Nor
 were there any further developments regarding the July 1994 corruption scandal
 that led to the death in custody of two suspects under suspicious circumstances.
 To date, the authorities have provided no explanation of the death of Doin Redan,
 who was found dead in 1994 a day after being detained by police. The Government
 continued to make no real effort to investigate the fate of a Ghanaian detainee, re-
 portedly killed in 1993 while in police custody. Although international and local
 human rights groups ressured the official commission investigating the 1991 assas-
 sination of Clement Suedraogo, a prominent opposition leader, to submit a report
 of preliminary findings to the Prime Minister, the report has not been made public.
 The case remains open, as do the cases of the 1989 "disappearance" of professor
 Guillaume Sessouma, detained for allegedy participating in a coup plot, and medi-
 cal student Dabo Boukary in 1990, detainedfollowing student demonstrations. Cred-
 ible reports indicated that security forces tortured and killed both.
 Another disturbing trend was the persistence of vigilante killings by the public.
 There were numerous documented incidents of summary mob justice meted out to
 thieves caught by the citizenry, mostly in urban centers.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While legally prohibited, torture and mistreatment of detainees, often to extract con-
 fessions, have been documented for a number of years. There are credible reports
 that officials at Maco prison continue to employ torture and degrading treatment,
 including beatings, cold showers, exposure to hot sun, and forcing persons to eat
 their own feces. The Government is not known to have taken any disciplinary action
 against those responsible, and the climate of impunity created by the Government's
 failure to prosecute abusers remains the largest obstacle to ending torture and other
 abuses.
 Prison conditions are harsh, overcrowded, and can be life threatening. The federal
 prison in Bobo-Dioulasso, built in 1947, housed about 1,000 prisoners, although de-
 signed to hold less than half that number. The prison diet is poor, and inmates must
 often rely on supplemental food from relatives.
 According to human rights monitors, prison visits are granted at the discretion
 of prison authorities. Permission is routinely granted, and advance permission is not
 require d.
 d.Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for the right
 to expeditious arraignment and access to legal counsel, and the law limits detention
 for investigative purposes without charge to a maximum of 72 hours, renewable for
 a single 48-hour period. In practice, however, police rarely observe these provisions.
 The average time of detention without charge is 1 week.
 A few intellectuals, military officers, and former Government officials remain in
 self-imposed exile abroad following the October 1987 coup that brought Compaore
 topower, but most desiring to do so have repatriated themselves.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, in practice it is subject to executive influence. The Constitution stip-
 ulates that the Head of State is also the President of the Superior Council of the
 Magistrature which nominates and removes some high-ranked magistrates and can
 examine the performance of individual magistrates.
 The Constitution provides for the right to public trial, access to counsel, and has
 provisions for bail and appeal. While these rights are generally respected, the ability
 of citizens to obtain a fair trial remains circumscribed by ignorance of the law (80
 percent of the population is illiterate) and by a continuing shortage of magistrates.
 A new penal code more relevant to modern requirements was adopted by Parliament
 and was expected to take effect in early 1997.
 The Constitution provides that the Supreme Court is the highest court in the
 countr. Beneath it are 2 courts of appeal and 10 provincial courts ("de grande in-
 stance'). There is also a High Court of Justice, with jurisdiction to try the President
 and senior government officials for treason and other serious crimes. The President
 has extensive appointment and other judicial powers. In 1995 the National Assem-
 bly passed legislation reforming the military court system, which had been suscep-
 
 
 tible to considerable executive manipulation, but there have been no further devel-
 opments.
 In 1995 the Government announced the creation of the Office of Ombudsman,
 called "Mediateur du Faso." Retired General Marc Garango was appointed to the po-
 sition, which is responsible for mediating disputes between the State and its citi-
 zens. In addition to the formal judiciary, customary or traditional courts, presided
 over by village chiefs, handle many neighborhood- and village-level problems, such
 as divorce and inheritance disputes. These decisions are generally respected by the
 population, but citizens may also take a case to a formal court.
 At year's end, there were no political prisoners in Burkina, according to local
 human rights organizations.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for these rights, and, in practice, the authorities generally do
 not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens. In national security cases, how-
 ever, a special law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and
 private correspondence without a warrant. By law and under normal circumstances,
 homes may be searched only with the authority of a warrant issued by the Minister
 of Justice. Except in certain cases, such as houses of prostitution and gambling
 dens, such warrants must be executed during "legal hours," defined as between 6
 a.m. and 9 p.m.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1990 Information Code provides for free-
 dom of speech and the press. In practice, these freedoms still remain circumscribed
 by a certain degree of self-censorship. The President and his Government remain
 sensitive to criticism. Provisions in the Code granting the Government strong legal
 powers to intimidate the press through a broad interpretation of defamation were
 removed in December 1993. As a result, journalists now charged with libel may de-
 fend themselves in court by presenting evidence in support of their allegations. Per-
 haps as a consequence, the independent press continued to exercise greater freedom
 of expression.
 In February Bloc Socialiste Burkinabe (BSB) leader Nongma Ernest Ouedraogo
 was released after serving 5 months of a 6 month sentence for libel. In an August
 1995 statement carried by a Ouagadougou daily, Ouedraogo alleged, among other
 things, that the President was corrupt and suggested that he fed human flesh to
 lions on his property. Ouedraogo was expeditiously tried under the law in a civil
 suit brought by President Compaore, at which he provided no evidence of his allega-
 tions. His appeal was turned down and he was med a symbolic 1 franc and sen-
 tenced to 6 months in jail. The President's lawyer told the court that his client was
 not suing the paper over publication of the statement because he believes in freedom
 of the press. But the case reinforced a tendency toward self-censorship.
 The independent press now includes four dailies, a dozen weekly newspapers, and
 a monthly news magazine. Although the official media, including the daily news-
 paper Sidwaya and the national radio, display progeverament bias, the presence of
 independent competition led government media to give more coverage to the politi-
 cal opposition. Therere e a half dozen thriving radio stations, one with eight
 branches, and one private television station.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Permits must, however, be obtained from mu-
 nicipal authorities for political marches. Applicants must indicate date, time, dura-
 tion, and itinerary of the march or rally, and authorities may alter or deny requests
 on grounds of public safety. Denials or modifications may be appealed before the
 courts. Since early 1990, political parties and labor unions have usually been per-
 mitted to organize and hold meetings and rallies without seeking government per-
 mission. However, in March police broke up a student demonstration at Burkinabe
 University with tear gas, and in May security forces intimidated participants in a
 march by a labor union and forced them to chane their route. The union had never
 received a response to its application for permission to march.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Burkina Faso is a secular state. Islam,
 Christianity, and traditional religions operate freely without government inter-
 ference. Neither social mobility nor access to modern sector jobs are linked to, or
 restricted by, repigious affiliation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement and authorities re-
 spect this right in practice. Gendarmes routinely stopped travelers within the coun-
 
 
 try for identity and customs checks and the levying of road taxes at police and mili-
 tary checkpoints. There is no restriction on foreign travel for business or tourism.
 Refugees are accepted freely in Burkina Faso. Due to civil unrest in neighboring
 countries, there are nearly 30,000 refugees and displaced persons, mostly Tuareg
 from Mali and Niger. The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The Government provides first asylum and provided it
 to over 20,000 refugees in 1996. The vast majority of those refugees were Tuaregs
 from Mali. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid
 claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government through
 multiparty elections. In practice, however, they have been unable to exercise that
 right fully. Power remained in the hands of President Compaore and the CDP, most
 of whose members also played prominent roles in previous ruling parties. The Gov-
 ernment includes a strong Presidency, a Prime Minister, a Council of Ministers pre-
 sided over by the President, a two-chamber National Assembly, and the judiciary.
 The legislature is independent, but it remains susceptible to external influence from
 the executive branch.
 The first municipal elections took place in 1995. The President's party secured
 over 1,100 of some 1,700 councillor seats being contested. On the whole, the ballot-
 ing, which was monitored by representatives of several local human rights groups,
 proceeded freely and fairly. The Compaore Government faces legislative elections in
 1997 and presidential elections in 1998.
 In 1994 the Supreme Court ruled that an elected deputy in the National Assembly
 is not bound to the political party under which that person was elected and may
 change party affiliations as a representative in the legislature. This practice has
 been labeled "political nomadism and is responsible for much of the factionalism
 in opposition parties.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women or mi-
 nority group members in politics. However, there are few women in positions of re-
 sponsibility; 3 of the 23 ministers and 6 of the 107 National Assembly deputies are
 women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government's attitude toward local human rights groups has been mixed. It
 continued to tolerate the activities of the Burkinabe Movement for Human Rights
 (MBDHP), an independent group with representation in all 30 provinces. The Gov-
 ernment is responsive to investigations by international nongovernmental organiza-
 tions. However, the report of the special investigative committee into the 1995
 killings in Garango has not been released, and the Government has not provided
 any information on the results of the inquiry.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic
 origin. Minority ethnic groups are, like the majority Mossi, represented in the inner
 circles of the Government, and government decisions do not favor one group over
 another.
 Women.-Violence against women, especially wife beating, occurs occasionally.
 Cases of wife beating are usually handled through customary law and practice. The
 Government is attempting, using education through the media, to change attitudes
 toward women. The new penal code explicitly prohibits sexual harassment and fe-
 male genital mutilation.
 The Constitution provides for respect of human rights including those of women,
 but there is no specific constitutional protection for women, who face extensive dis-
 crimination. In general women continue to occupy a subordinate position and experi-
 ence discrimination in such areas as education, jobs, property, and family rights.
 Overall, women represent 45 percent of the work force. In the modern sector, how-
 ever, women make up one-fourth of the government work force, although usually in
 lower paying positions. Women still do much of the subsistence farming work.
 Children.-The Constitution nominally protects children's rights. The Government
 has demonstrated its commitment to improving the condition of children by adopt-
 ing a national policy to revitalize primary health care through the privatization of
 hospitals, which provided greater autonomy in hospital management. The Govern-
 
 
 23
 ment has stated its commitment to improve access to primary education and has
 raised the literacy rate from 16 percent to 23 percent in recent years.
 Females constitute approximately one-third of the total student population in the
 primary school system and are represented in the secondary and higher educational
 systems--although the percentage decreases dramatically beyond the primary level.
 Schools in rural areas have disproportionately fewer female students than schools
 in urban areas.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is still widely
 practiced, especially in many rural areas, and is usually performed at an early age.
 The percentage of females who have undergone this procedure may be as high as
 70 percent. The Government has made a strong commitment to eradicate FGM
 through educational efforts, and a national committee campaigns against the prac-
 tice. The projected new Penal Code makes FGM a crime whose perpetrators are sub-
 ject to 6 months' to 3 years' imprisonment and a significant fine. Nevertheless, FGM
 is still widely practiced. The Government has launched a sensitization campaign re-
 garding the deleterious effects of this practice. Another form of mutilation, scarifica-
 tion of the faces of both boys and girls of certain thnic groups, is gradually dis-
 appeang
 people With Disabilities.-While there is a modest program of government sub-
 sidies for workshops for the disabled, there is no Government mandate or legislation
 concerning accessibility for the disabled. There is no legislation to protect people
 with disabilities from discrimination. Programs to aid the disabled are limited, but
 human rights groups are not aware of any discrimination against the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Drafted in 1995, a new labor code remains before
 the National Assembly for review. Notwithstanding this pending legislation, work-
 ers, including civil servants, traditionally have enjoyed a legal right of association,
 which is recognized under the Constitution. There are 4 major labor confederations
 and 12 autonomous trade unions linked together by a National Confederal Commit-
 tee. They represent a wide ideological spectrum, of which the largest and most vocal
 member espouses Socialist doctrine. Essential workers-police and fire workers-
 may not join unions.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and workers use strike actions
 to achieve labor goals. Employees of the largest commercial bank in the country
 went on strike for 2 days in September. In November health workers staged a 72-
 hour strike to demand better pay and working conditions.
 Labor unions may affiliate freely with international trade unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain for wages and other benefits, both directly with employers and with industry
 associations. These negotiations are governed by minimums on wages and other
 benefits contained in the Interprofessional Collective Convention and the Commer-
 cial Sector Collective Convention, which are established with government participa-
 tion. If no agreement is reached, employees may exercise their right to strike. Either
 labor or management also may refer an impasse in negotiations to labor tribunals.
 Appeals may be pursued through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, whose
 decision is binding on both parties. Collective bargaining is extensive in the modern
 wage sector but encompasses only a small percentage of workers.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination. The Labor Ministry handles
 complaints about such discrimination, which the plaintiff may appeal to a Labor Tri-
 bunal. If the Tribunal sustains the appeal, the employer must reinstate the worker.
 Union officials believe that this system functions adequately.
 There are no expert processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code now in effect sets
 the minimum age for employment at 14 years, the average age for completion of
 basic primary school. However, the Ministry of Employment, Labor, and Social Se-
 curity, which oversees labor standards, lacks the means to enforce this provision
 adejuately, even in the small wage sector. Most children actually begin work at an
 eariier age on small, family subsistence farms, in the traditional apprenticeship sys-
 tem, and in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code mandates a minimum monthly
 wage, a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one 24-hour rest period, and
 establishes safety and health provisions. The current minimum monthly wage in the
 formal sector, about $48 (cfa 24,000), does not apply to subsistence agriculture,
 which employs about 85 percent of the population. The Government last set the
 
 
 minimum wage in 1995. It is not adequate for an urban worker to support a family.
 Wage earners usually supplement their income through reliance on the extended
 family and subsistence agriculture.
 A system of government inspections under the Ministry of Labor and the Labor
 Tribunals is responsible for overseeing health and safety standards in the small in-
 dustrial and commercial sectors, but these standards do not apply in the subsistence
 agricultural sector. Every company is required to have a work safety committee. If
 a workplace has been declared unsafe by the government labor inspection office for
 any reason, workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 without jeopardy to continued employment. In practice there are indications that
 this right is respected, but such declarations are relatively rare.
