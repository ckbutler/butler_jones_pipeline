 ALBANIA*
 Albania, which proclaims itself a People's Socialist Republic,
 is a one-party state ruled by a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship.
 Ramiz Alia, who came to power in 1985, exercises personal
 leadership through the Communist party known as the Albanian
 Party of Labor (APL). Internationally, he has pursued a
 policy of cautiously expanding diplomatic, cultural, and
 commercial links abroad, especially with Balkan and Western
 European states.
 A large, effective security .service, the Sigurimi, assists the
 APL in maintaining repressive controls over the Albanian
 people, who are permitted only very limited civil and
 political rights.
 Albania has a centrally controlled economy under which the
 State owns the means of production, and the GoveXnment directs
 all significant economic activity. Within a strategy of
 economic self-reliance, the Government emphasizes a policy of
 rapid industrialization and development. In recent years,
 however, the rate of economic growth has declined. Refugees
 have reported increased shortages of basic foodstuffs.
 Information on internal conditions within-Albania is limited.
 Although the Albanian population continues to be shielded from
 foreign influences, the Government now tacitly allows citizens
 to receive foreign broadcasts from Italy, Greece, and
 Ytdgoslavia. The Government has liberalized visa issuance for
 tourists from most Western countries and allowed a limited
 number of its own citizens to visit neighboring countries in
 tour groups. In other areas, significant human rights
 violati1s, corroborated by private international
 o6anizaions and refugees, continue to occur. The Government
 has repe.atedly refused to cooperate with any international
 organizhtion which investigates human rights complaints. In
 1989 the United Nations Human Rights Commission publicly
 censured Albania for its human rights record and for its
 failure to cooperate&with the. Commission.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedbm from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No evidence came to light of political killings by the
 authorities during 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no recent information available on whether
 disappearances occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The criminal code prohibits and provides punishment for the
 use of physical or psychological force during investigations.
 *Because the United States has not had diplomatic relations
 with Albania since 1939, it is difficult to comment
 authoritatively on conditions in Albania.

 ALBANIA
 Nevertheless, former political prisoners have often
 reportedthat they were beaten or otherwise ill-treated during
 investigative proceedings to force them to make confessions.
 Although some of the worst abuses of the past may have ended,
 there continue to be allegations that Albanian investigators
 resort to threats and beatings to obtain confessions or
 collaboration. In the absence of independent means of
 investigation, it is difficult to corroborate such reports.
 In the past, private international humanitarian organizations
 have reported harsh prison conditions in Albania, including a
 severe hard-labor regime with inadequate food and clothing,
 long-term solitary confinement, cramped cells without room to
 lie down, and unheated, unfurnished cells lacking any sanitary
 facilities. The Burrel prison and Spac, Ballsh, and Qafe e
 Barit labor camps, in particular, have been noted for their
 harsh conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no one may be arrested without
 court or prosecutorial approval or be sentenced to jail
 without a court verdict or for an act which is not a crime.
 The criminal code, however, is explicitly ideological and
 officially characterized as a "weapon in the class struggle."
 Its provisions defining political offenses are loosely
 formulated, allowing the courts to interpret them broadly to
 punish whomever the regime desires.
 The criminal code lists 34 crimes, 12 of which are political
 offenses, for which the death sentence may be imposed. Among
 these capital offenses are such nonviolent political offenses
 as: unauthorized departure or "flight" from the State,
 agitation and propaganda against the State, creation of a
 counterrevolutionary organization or participation therein,
 concealment of a person who commits a crime against the State,
 activity against the revolutionary movement of the working
 class, and refusal to carry out a duty or coercing others to
 refuse to do so.
 The criminal code also provides that banishment (generally to
 a state farm or enterprise) or internment may be imposed
 administratively, without trial, for up to 5 years on persons
 whom the authorities consider a threat to the Communist system
 and on the families of fugitives. In 1988 a new decree (No.
 7071) was officially reported concerning "internment and exile
 as administrative measures." However, the text of the decree
 was not published, and it is not known how this decree differs
 from Decree No. 5912 of 1979.
 There are numerous reports that families of escapees from
 Albania have been imprisoned or interned as a deterrent to
 other potential illegal emigrants. Amnesty International (AI)
 has reported a number of such cases in recent years, but
 another source claimed that close relatives of recent escapees
 are no longer interned.
 Al reports that political detainees lack adequate legal
 safeguards during pretrial investigations. It also notes that
 political prisoners awaiting trial are not guaranteed visits
 from relatives during the investigation or access to a legal
 advisor unless the court "deemed it necessary." By law,
 investigations into crimes against the State must be completed
 within 3 months, but extensions are easily obtained, and no
 effective maximum period of investigation is enforced. Most
 
 
 1027
 ALBANIIA
 investigations into p6litical offenses are completed within 4
 months, but AI has charged that some investigations have
 dragged on for more than a year.
 Political detainees have been held in solitary confinement for
 up to 6 months during pretrial investigations without access
 to lawyers or relatives. The criminal code provides that
 accused persons must be informed when investigation of their
 cases is concluded and allowed to examine all the evidence to
 *be brought against them. Usually, however, they are not
 allowed to examine all the materials and are shown only a copy
 of the indictment. While investigators are theoretically
 bound by rules of procedure, and the accused may appeal to
 higher-authority against investigators who violate proper
 procedures, these controls do not appear to be effective.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e, Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system includes the Supreme Court and regional
 and district courts. Like all organs of the Government, the
 judicial system is under the total control of the APL. Courts
 may not render an. independent verdict in conflict with the
 wishes or policies of the regime.
 AI reports that persons accused of political crimes lack
 adequate legal safeguards during their trials. Defendants at
 political trials have usually been denied defense counsel and
 have had to conduct their own defense. Major important trials
 of state officials are closed when it suits the purposes of
 the regime, but most political trials of ordinary citizens are
 held in open court. Most such trials last no more than 1 day,
 and there have.been no known Acquittals.
 The number of-persons. izk prison is unknown; they include 300
 -members of the pre-World War II elite, as well as pro-Soviet,
 pro-Chinese, and other political prisoners. Many persons are
 serving sentences for expressing dissatisfaction with
 conditions in Albania or for trying to flee the country.
 Former political prisoners report about 1,200 political
 prisoners each were being held in the Ballsh and Spac labor
 camps during the early 19801s. Some 300 more were imprisoned
 at Burrel, and others were held in Tarovic, Kosove, and Tirana
 prisons.
 f., Arbij<ary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Corespondence-.
 .The Constitution proclaims the inviolability of the home and
 the privacy of correspondence, but at the same time it
 provides that these and other civil rights are subordinate to
 the g eneral interest and may not be exercised in opposition to
 the Social.ist order. Observers generally believe that the
 authorities can, and do, violate the privacy of the home when
 and As :Aecessary to achieve their ends. The Government uses
 its pervasive informer,.network to report on, among other
 things, the private lives of its citizens.
 Contact with the outside world is carefully monitored.
 Albanian citizens are required to report to the police any
 contact with foreigners, but many welcome casual contact with
 foreign tourists. Refugees have reported difficulties they
 had while in Albania in receiving telephone calls from
 relatives living in the United States. Sometimes packages of
 
 
 1028
 ALBANiIA
 food, medicine, and clothing sent to them were returned by the
 Albanian authorities. After 1986 it became significantly
 easier to receive letters and packages from relatives abroad.
 Though it is technically illegal to receive television or
 radio broadcasts from neighboring Italy, Yugoslavia, and
 Greece, the Government tacitly allows its citizens to do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that citizens enjoy these freedoms but
 may not exercise them in opposition to the Socialist order.
 Any citizen who publicly criticizes the Government is subject
 to swift and severe reprisals under an article of the
 Constitution which forbids anti-State agitation and
 propaganda. AI states in its 1989 report that the majority of
 political prisoners were imprisoned for attempting to exercise
 their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of movement.
 All news media are government controlled and never criticize
 the state and party leadership or their policies. However,
 there are indications that media criticism of some aspects of
 Albanian society, such as the pervasive problem of corruption,
 has increased. As weapons of revolutionary change, art and
 literature are subject to rigid state control and censorship.
 The authorities also manipulate scholarly inquiry and
 publications for political purposes, particularly in such
 fields as linguistics, literature, economics, history,
 geography, folklore, and ethnology.
 Although there are restrictions on contacts with foreigners,
 such restrictions have been relaxed lately. Western visitors
 report that Albanian citizens are increasingly bold in talking
 to Western visitors and tourists. Tirana's participation in
 Balkan cooperation should increase Albania's exposure to
 external influences.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The security police deal severely with group activities that
 do not have government sanction or that appear to be in
 opposition to the leadership. There are no independent
 associations or organizations.
 Western news services reported demonstrations took place in
 the northern Albanian city of Shkoder and in some other
 locations at the end of December. Some reports say that the
 demonstrations were violently repressed by the Government.
 Other reports indicate that four young ethnic Greek men,
 identified as Costas, George, Takis, and Odysseas Prassos,
 were brutally punished by the Albanian authorities. Two
 allegedly died after being dragged by tractors through several
 villages. Some accounts indicate they were punished to
 forestall demonstrations in the area; others say they were
 caught attempting to leave the country. The Government has
 denied both the reports of demonstrations and of the deaths.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious activity in Albania is. expressly prohibited by the
 Constitution and by government policy. Historically, about 70
 
 
 1029
 ALBANIA
 percent of all Albanians were Muslim, nearly 20 percent were
 Orthodox, and a little more than 10 percent were Roman
 Catholic. Estimates of the number of Jews in Albania range
 ftrom-500 to2,500.
 In 1967-the Government proclaimed Albania the first atheist
 State in the world- abrogatedall laws-dealing-with church-
 state relations, and began actively to eradicate all vestiges
 of-religion. More than 2,100 mosques, churches, monasteries,
 and other institutions were closed, their fixed assets were
 seized by the authorities without compensation, and many
 religious leaders were persecuted, imprisoned, or even
 executed for continuing their religious functions. All
 -religious literature was banned, as were any personal
 manifestations of religious-belief or practice. In 1975 a
 Legislative Decree stipulated that names for newborns were to
 be chosen from a list of "appropriate" names (that is, names
 without'reli-gious overtones). At the same time, a number of
 geographical-names with-religious significance were changed.
 ,While a few outstanding historic churches and their religous
 art are being restored -s,museums, most churches and mosques
 have been converted to other uses.
 -The regime continues to suppress religious activity by
 threatening harsh penalties for believers who practice their
 faith and by obliging citizens to inform on believers.
 Refugees have said that people who were known to practice
 religion in their homes were publicly ridiculed, summoned by
 the authorities for interrogation, and threatened. Despite
 years of antireligious pressure, it is clear that some
 Albanians-have continued to practide their faith in their own
 homes, particularly in villagds and in more remote mountainous
 areas.' Tourists have reported seeing Muslims praying along
 roadsides with apparent impunity. There have been some signs
 that the regime, eager to improve its relations with Western
 European countries as well as with its Balkan neighbors, is
 quietly toning down its antireligious campaign and even
 permitting some private expressions of religion. In March the
 .United Nations Human Rights Commission voted to censure
 Albania for its failure to comply with the U.N. Charter's
 provisions protecting human rights. The Government responded
 that there was genuine freedom of conscience in Albania. It
 said that no one can force people to believe in God or to
 perform religious rites and that, ultimately, religious belief
 was a personal and family matter.
 -This-ig: the first public statement by the Government which
 seems to concede, at least in principle, the right of its
 citizens to religious belief. Another positive development
 -was the official decision in 1988 to permit the visit of an
 Orthodox priest and an Islamic imam of Albanian descent to
 visit Albania. A Jesuit priest who left Albania in 1940 was
 al6 permitted to visit his family. In 1989 Mother Theresa,
 who is of Al1anian descent, was permitted to visit Albania.
 A-thbugh'her'visit was given prominent coverage in the local
 press, "she was not identified as a Roman Catholic nun but only
 as a "well-known Albanian charity worker."
 In 1989 several Roman Catholic prielsts were reportedly
 released from prison. The single surviving Roman Catholic
 prelate, Bishop Nikoll Mehill Troshani, who had been
 imprisoned cduring-the 1940's and 1950's and again arrested in
 1974 after holding rbligious services, was reportedly released
 frbuf a forced labor camp in 1988. It'was confirmed that
 Father Pjeter Mashkalla died in the Ballsh labor camp on
 
 
 1030
 ALAIA
 July 28, 1988. He had been imprisoned from 1946 to 1971 and
 from 1973 to 1983, and was again arrested in 1985 after
 celebrating Christmas eve Mass.  No new information is
 available about the fate of another imprisoned Roman Catholic
 priest, Ndoc Luli.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution does not guarantee freedom of movement.
 Movement within the country and travel abroad are controlled
 very strictly, and transgressors against the laws have been
 severely punished in the past. The criminal code states that
 flight from the State or refusal to return to the fatherland
 by a person sent abroad on service or allowed to leave the
 State is considered treason and punishable by imprisonment for
 not less than 10 years or by death. AI stated in its 1989
 report that many prisoners apparently had been imprisoned for
 trying to leave Albania illegally. Until recently, Albanians
 were allowed to leave the country legally only on official
 business or, very rarely, for family reasons. In 1988
 organized groups of Albanian tourists visited Yugoslavia and
 Western European countries. Albania has publicly stated that
 it wishes to increase the number of its university students on
 exchange programs in Western countries. Neither Albanian law
 nor practice allows the right to emigrate.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No such right exists in theory or in practice. The system of
 government is a Communist dictatorship, headed by Ramiz Alia
 in his capacity as First Secretary of the APL and Chairman of
 the Presidium of the People's Assembly. The Constitution
 establishes the APL as the sole political entity and Marxism-
 Leninism as the only political ideology. The APL is governed
 internally by the principle of "democratic centralism," under
 which decisionmaking power is concentrated in the hands of a
 small elite.
 The Constitution provides that the People's Assembly (a
 unicameral parliament) is the supreme organ of national
 government in Albania; similar bodies, called people's
 councils, exist at the local level. Candidates for these
 assemblies are first designated by a mass organization known
 as the Democratic Front, which is controlled by the APL. They
 are then "elected" without opposition by universal suffrage.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government denies violating human rights and refuses to
 cooperate with any investigation of allegations to the
 contrary, including confidential investigations by the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Greeks are the largest ethnic minority, but smaller numbers of
 Serbs, Macedonians, Vlachs, Gypsies, and Jews also live in
 Albania.. Estimates of the size of the Greek population vary
 from 40,000 (from an official Albanian census) to as high as
 400,000 (from groups promoting the interests of ethnic Greeks
 
 
 1031
 ALBANiIA
 in Albania). Neutral organizations have estimated that the
 ethnic Greek population is 50,000.
 The Constitution grants nationa- minorities "guaranteed
 protection and development of their culture and popular
 traditions, the use of their mother tongue, and its teaching
 in the schools, and equal development in all fields of social
 life." While there are differences of opinion over the extent
 to which minorities may exercise their cultural, educational,
 and linguistic rights, they are clearly restricted. While
 Greeks and Macedonians may be educated in their mother tongues
 through the primary level, there are no radio or television
 programs in these languages. A Greek-language newspaper,
 Laiko Vima, is published in the southern town of
 Argyrokastro. Cross-border.ties between Albania and Greece
 increased significantly after the November 1987 visit to
 Albania of the Greek Foreign Minister, and relatives and
 friends of the Greek minority in Albania are being permitted
 to send remittances to Albania.
 Several reports indicate persecution, harassment, and
 discrimination against minorities solely because of their
 ethnic status. There have even been reports of mass removals
 of segments of the Greek population out of traditionally Greek
 lands in the soueh to areas more distant from the
 Albanian-Greek border. Furthermore, insofar as the ban on
 religious practice has removed the Greek Orthodox church from
 Greek communities in Albania, an important part of that ethnic
 group's community life and links to Greece has been
 eliminated. The leadership of both the APL and the Government
 are overwhelmingly ethnic Albanians of Muslim background. The
 Chairman of the People's Assembly, a Greek woman, is one
 notable exception, however.
 Scholars of the Albanian language have noted that northern
 Albanians, who historically spoke the Gheg dialect of their
 language, have been educationally disadvantaged by the
 adoption of "unified literary Albanian," basically a version
 of the Tosk dialect, spoken in southern Albania. Most members
 of the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor are Tosk
 speakers.
 The Constitution states that women shall enjoy "equal rights
 with men in work, pay, holidays, social security, education,
 in all social-political activity, as well as in the family."
 Information on the extent to which these rights are exercised
 is not available, but the regime appears to have advanced the
 status of women. Women are said to participate equally in
 obligatory labor and military service programs. No
 information is available on the extent to which violence
 against women is practiced or what, if anything, the regime
 has done on the issue.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a.* The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to associate freely and to
 strike. Nearly all Albanians belong to trade unions that are
 part of the United Trade Unions of Albania (UTUA), an arm of
 the APL. These unions have no significant independent voice
 in the field of labor relations, but they play a key role in
 indoctrinating and propagandizing the workers, in maintaining
 labor discipline, and in organizing the periods of so-called
 voluntary manual labor in which all Albanians are expected to
 
 
 1032
 ALBANIA
 take part. There is a seat reserved for the UTUA as an
 affiliate of the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions, but the Albanians have not participated in this
 Soviet labor front organization since the mid-1960's. Albania
 withdrew from the International Labor Organization in 1967.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to organize freely and to
 bargain collectively. There are no special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Little information on forced labor is available. It is
 believed that one form of punishment is internal banishment to
 a labor camp. The prisoners do not have a choice of work but
 are paid for their labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to the Labor Code of 1980, amended in 1981, the
 minimum age for employment of children is 15. Those under 16
 years of age may not work more than 6 hours per day.
 Information on enforcement of this law is unavailable.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 -According to the Labor Code, the workweek is 48 hours.
 Pregnant women, children under 16 years of age, and persons
 with a doctor's certificate may not work between 10 p.m. and 6
 a.m. Women, young persons under 18 years of age, and those
 with a doctor's certificate are prohibited from working
 underground. Workers in arduous and dangerous jobs are
 provided appropriate protective clothing and special food
 rations. The Labor Code contains regulations pertaining to
 occupational health and safety, but there is no available
 information on the effectiveness of enforcement. Minimum wage
 information is not available.
