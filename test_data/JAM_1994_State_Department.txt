 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. An appointed Governor General represents the Queen as
 Head of State. The elected Prime Minister is the Head of Government. An elected
 lower house and an appointed upper house comprise Parliament. Two political par-
 ties have alternated in power since the first elections under universal adult suffrage
 in 1944. The last general election, held in March 1993, was marred by political vio-
 lence and fraud.
 The security forces consist of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF-police), the
 Island Special Constabulary Force (ISCF-auxiliary police), and the Jamaica
 Defence Force (JDF-army, air wing, and coast guard). The JCF continued to be re-
 sponsible for serious human rights abuses and political partisanship. The JDF has
 been responsible for some abuses, albeit fewer than the JCF.
 The economy is based on primary products (bauxite and alumina, sugar, bananas),
 services (tourism, finance), and light manufacturing (garment assembly). The Gov-
 ernment has promoted private investment to stiulate economic growth and mod-
 ernization, pursuing in the process a sometimes painful program of structural ad-
 justment. As a result of concentrating economic policy on maintaining a stable rate
 of exchange with the USq. dollar, interest rates were high and economic growth suf-
 fered.
 Among Jamaica's principal human rights abuses, there are allegations that police
 and prisonguard commit summary executions and other extrajudicial killings and
 beatings, often with impunity. Other abuses included violence against women, in-
 cluding attacks by police; warrantless searches; indefinite detention; brutality
 against detainees; and vigilantism. Conditions in Jamaican jails and prisons remain
 poor, with serious overcrowding, awful sanitary conditions, and inadequate diet the

 norm. An inefficient and overburdened judiciary was responsible for lengthy delays
 in trials, sentencing, and appeals.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There continued to be credible re-
 ports that the JCF engaged in the summary execution of suspects under the guise
 of 'shootouts." Local media accounts disputing JCF claims of shootouts continued
 to appear in 1994, albeit with less frequency than in previous years. JCF statistics
 have shown a continuous pattern in recent years wherein persons shot and killed
 by the JCF outnumbered those shot but only wounded.
 The authorities charged a JCF officer with capital murder in the July 1993
 killings of Alfredo Bell and Leroy Chin at Nuttal private hospital, but he has yet
 to be tried. Authorities also brought charges against a JDF lieutenant and a cor-
 poral for killing a policeman guarding a candidate for Parliament in 1993. The lieu-
 tenant has since died of natural causes. The trial of the corporal was postponed
 until 1995. The JCF Office of Internal Affairs continues to take disciplinary action
 against other abusive officers.
 Te Jamaica Council for Human Rights (JCHR) received fewer complaints about
 police abuses in 1994 than in 1993. However, police officers continued to enjoy ap-
 parent impunity for extrajudicial killings. For example, the courts freed in 1994 five
 police officers charged with the October 1992 deaths of three men in Constant
 Spring jail when the judge found them not guilty of manslaughter. (The deaths were
 the result of confining 19 men--arrested in a police sweep but never charged-in
 a nearly airless cell for 2 days.) The Supreme Court subsequently awarded damages
 to 1 of the 16 survivors in a lawsuit which the Attorney General did not contest.
 The other 15 also have lawsuits pending.
 Vigilantism, involving spontaneous mob executions, occurred with some frequency
 in 1994. In rural areas, the response to crimes such as animal theft was often the
 rapid formation of a local mob which beat, stoned, or "chopped" to death (with ma-
 chetes) the alleged criminals. Police rarely brought charges against vigilantes, and
 acquittals have been common in the few cases that do go to court.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically related abduction or dis-
 appearances pe   trated by the security forces or others.
 c. Torture an2 Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees. Nonetheless,
 detainees and prisoners made numerous credible complaints that guards and secu-
 rity personnel beat them in local jails and prisons to obtain confessions. The JCHR
 continued to document cases where prison personnel beat inmates in order to obtain
 confessions.
 The Police Public Complaints Authority (PPCA), a nonpartisan civilian body
 which began operation in 1993, received hundreds of complaints in its first year of
 operation. Most complaints charged excessive use of force or abuse of authority by
 police. At year's end, however, the authorities had not brought any charges against
 JCF personnel for matters arising from complaints to the PPCA.
 In the case of a police instructor who allegedly raped a young female recruit in
 1993, the woman subsequently refused to testify against him. The judge directed a
 verdict of not guilty but recommended that the instructor resign from the JCF.
 Conditions in maximum security prisons and police jails remained abysmal. Sani-
 tary conditions were dangerously inadequate, food insufficient, and overcrowding
 the rule. Prisoners often have to resort to buying their own food or medicine, or hav-
 ing relatives bring it to them. At the general penitentiary in Kingston, authorities
 imprison up to six men in the 7- by 10-foot cells in the remand section, in near-
 total darkness, for 16 to 20 hours a day. The Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights found that while some of Jamaica's prisons appear to meet international
 standards, others do not. A Human Rights Wateb/Americas report was highly criti-
 cal of the treatment of children in the prison system.
 At his discretion, a judge may impose both whipping (with a tamarind switch) and
 flogging (with a cat o'nine tails) as punishment in criminal cases. A judge sentenced
 a Kingston man who paralyzedawoman with an ie pick tobe whipped and jailed.
 This aroused considerable public debate on corporal punishment. Following the first
 flogging sentence, other judges sentenced several more criminals to be flogged.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exiie.-Parliament repealed the Suppression of
 Crimes Act (SOCA) of 1974, which permitted warrantless searches and the arrest
 of persons "reasonably suspected" of having committed a crime. The Jamaica Con-
 stabulary Force Act, howev~r, now contains several of these provisions.
 
 
 The authorities regularly detained suspects without a warrant, particularly in
 poor neighborhoods. The law requires a court appearance within 48 hours of deten-
 tion, but the authorities often held detainees for several weeks without bringing
 them before a judge or magistrate. However, the JCHR tallied fewer complaints of
 illegal detention in 1994 than in previous years. There is a functioning bail system
 for Jamaicans; foreign detainees, however, are regularly denied bail.
 The Constitution provides immunity from expulsion from the country, or exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is a well-established right to counsel for
 persons charged with criminal offenses; indigents, however, must have been accused
 of a "serious offense" (e.g., murder, rpe, robbery, gun offenses) to qualify for court-
 appointed counsel. However, the law does not consider many offenses, including
 wounding with intent to cause great bodily harm, as "serious," and courts thus con-
 vict many defendants without benefit of counsel.
 The judicial system, although independent, is overburdened and operates with in-
 adequate resources. Budgetary shortfalls have resulted in a steady attrition of
 trained personnel, causing further delays. Many cases take years to come to trial,
 and others were dismissed because case files could not be located.
 The court of appeal and the Parliament may refer cases to the fudicial committee
 of the Privy Council in the Unj~ed Kingdom. In September Prime Minister Patterson
 called for abolition of appeals to the Privy Council and creation of a Caribbean
 Court of Appeals. Opposition leader Seaga and some human rights organizations im-
 mediately opposed this proposal.
 There were no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private life of the
 individual. The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force Act, however, continues to give
 security personnel the sort of broad powers of search and seizure which were con-
 sistently abused under the Suppression of Crimes Act. Although the use of tele-
 phone taps without a court order is officially limited to cases involving the drug
 trade, terrorism, and subversion of the Government, politicians, trade union off-
 cials, and local journalists have charged that the authorities were tapping their tele-
 phones in recent years. The accused authorities did not respond to these charges.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and the Government respects these rights in practice, within the broad
 limits of libel laws and the Official Secrets Act.
 The Jamaica Broadcasting Company, largely deregulated in 1988, operates two
 radio stations and one of the island's two television stations. The Government's
 broadcasting commission has the right to regulate programming during emer-
 g ncies. Foreign television transmissions are unregulated and available to tens of
 t ousand of Jamaicans through satellite antennas.-The four largest newspapers, all
 privately owned, regularly report on human rights abuses, particularly those involv-
 ing the JCF. Foreign publications are widely available.
 There were no reports of censorship or interference in academic institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. The police routinely grant without favoritism
 the permits required for political parties to stage public rallies. Large numbers and
 varieties of professional, business, service, social, and cultural associations function
 freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is well estabished in law and prac-
 tice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides Jamaican citizens freedom of movement and
 the authorities respect these provisions.
 The authorities adjudicate applications for refugee status on a case-by-case basis.
 In coordination with the local office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), the Government has processed more than 80 Haitian boat people. The
 Government was considering applications from approximately 60 Cuban asylum
 seekers, also in coordination with the UNHCR. The Government had not made a
 decision on the refugee status of either the Haitians or the Cubans at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Jamaicans have, and freely exercise, the right to change their government. All
 citizens aged 18 and over have the right to vote by secret ballot. Two political par-
 ties have alternated in power since the first elections under universal adult suffrage
 in 1944. The People's National Party (PNP) holds 52 of the 60 seats in the House
 
 
 442
 of Representatives. The opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP), last in power from
 1980 to 1989, holds the remaining 8 seats. The JLP boycotted both by-elections in
 1994, charging that needed electoral reform was not in place. Two small-party can-
 didates contested the April election which the PNP candidate won overwhelmingly.
 One small-party candidate contested the August election, which was marked by very
 low voter turnout, and the PNP candidate again won. The newly appointed head of
 the electoral office dismissed allegations of fraud in the August election as un-
 founded.
 There are no legal limits on the participation of women in politics; in practice,
 women constitute a small minority of national parliamentarians and an onjy slightly
 higher proportion of local representatives. In May Senator Maxine Henry-Wilson be-
 came the first woman in either party to hold the post of general secretary when she
 was elected to the post by the leadership of the ruling PNP. The Minister of Labor
 and Welfare is a woman, as is the mayor of Kingston.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations. The JCHR, the country's
 only formal human rights organization, has vigorously protested abuses by the po-
 lice. Its work has been hampered, however, by a lack of adequate resources. There
 was no official followup on the August 1992 break-in and fire at the JCHR head-
 quarters, which left the organization in a perilous financial position.
 The Government of Jamaica has not attempted to hinder investigations by foreign
 and international human rights groups into alleged violations of human rights. The
 Human Rights Watch Childiren's Rights Project noted in a report on children in po-
 lice lockups that the Commissioner of Correctional Services and the Commissioner
 of Police were "especially cooperative" during the investigation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, polit-
 ical opinion, color, or creed.
 Women.-The Constitution and the 1975 Employment Act theoretically accord
 women full equality. In practice, however, they suffer from economic discrimination,
 sexual harassment in the workplace, and cultural and social traditions that promote
 violence against women. According to statistics from the police sexual offenses unit,
 there has been an increase in reported cases of rape and other sexual assaults from
 1,308 in 1992 to 1,520 in 1993, and reported rapes for the first 3 months of 1994
 were 19 percent above the figures for the same period in 1993. Women remain reluc-
 tant to press charges against their partners in cases of domestic violence when jail
 sentences are mandatory. The Government, which promised legislation to introduce
 noncustodial sentencing, had not done so by the end of 1994.
 Children.--The Juvenile Act of 1951 covers a number of aspects related to the
 protection of children, including prevention of cruelty, prohibition on causing or al-
 lowing juvenile begging, the power to bring juveniles in need of care or protection
 before a juvenile court, the treatment of juvenile offenders, the regulation and su-
 pervision of children's homes, and restrictions on employment of juveniles. However
 the Human Rights Watch report contends that the Government has not committed
 an adequate level of resources to enforce the Act.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws mandating accessibility for people
 with disabilities. Several government agencies and nongovernmental organizations
 provide services and employment to various groups of disabled Jamaicans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right to form or join a trade
 union, and unions function freely and independently of the Government. The Labor
 Relations and Industrial Disputes Act (LRIDA) defines worker rights. There is a
 spectrum of national unions, some of which are affiliated with political parties. Ap-
 proximately 15 percent of the work force is organized.
 The LRIDA neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to strike, but strikes do
 occur. Striking workers can interrupt work without criminal liability but cannot be
 assured of keeping their jobs. Workers in 10 broad categories of "essential services"
 are prohibited from striking, a provision the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 has repeatedly condemned as overly inclusive. No strikes were declared illegal in
 1994.
 Jamaican unions maintain a wide variety of regional and international affili-
 ations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government rarely inter-
 feres with union organizing efforts. Judicial and police authorities effectively enforce
 
 
 443
 the IRMA and other labor regulations. All parties in Jamaica are firmly committed
 to ollective bargaining in contract negotiations, even in some nonunion settings. An
 independent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT) hears cases where management and
 labor fail to reach agreement. Any cases not resolved by the IDT pass to the civil
 courts. In 1994, however the IDT was not able to resolve the large number of dis-
 putes before it. The LRIA prohibits antiunion discrimination: for example, employ-
 ees may not be fired solely for union membership. The authorities enforced this law
 effectively.
 Domestic labor laws apply equally to the "free zones" (export processing zones).
 However, there are no unionized companies in any of the three zones, established
 in 1972, 1985, and 1988, which employ approximately 18,000 workers. Organizers
 attribute this to resistance by foreign owners in the zones to organizing efforts. At-
 tempts to organize plants within the zones continue. Company-controlled "workers'
 councils" handle grievance resolution at most free zone companies, but do not nego-
 tiate wages and conditions with management. Management determines wages and
 benefits within the free zones; they are generally as good as or better than those
 in similar industries outside the zones. The Ministry of Labor has not performed
 factory inspections in the free zones since 1992.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not specifi-
 cally address the matter of forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party
 to both ILO conventions that prohibit compulsory labor, and there were no reports
 that this practice exists.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Juvenile Act provides that
 children under the age of 12 shall not be employed except by parents or guardians
 and that such employment may only be in domestic, agricultural, or horticultural
 work. However, enforcement is erratic. Children under 12 can be seen peddling
 goods or services on city streets, but there is no evidence of widespread illegal em-
 ployment of children in other sectors of the economy. The Educational Act stipulates
 that all children aged 6 to 11 must attend elementary school. Industrial safety, po-
 lice, and truant officers are charged with enforcement. Under current economic cir-
 cumstances, however, thousands of children are kept home to help with housework
 and avoid school fees.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage, raised from $9.00 (J$ 300)
 to $15.00 (J$ 500) per week in 1994, is widely considered inadequate. Most salaried
 workers are paid more than the legal minimum. Work over 40 hours per week or
 8 hours per day must be compensated at overtime rates, a provision that is widely
 observed:
 The Labor Ministry's Industrial Safety Division is charged with setting and en-
 forcing industrial health and safely standards, which are considered adequate. In-
 dustrial accident rates, particularly in the bauxite/alumina industry, were once
 again low in 1994. Public service staff reductions in the Ministries of Labor, Fi-
 nance, National Security, and the Public Service have contributed to the difficulties
 in enforcing work place regulations. The law provides workers the right to remove
 themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued em-
 ployment if they are trade union members or covered by the Factories Act. The law
 does not specifically protect other categories of workers in those circumstances.
