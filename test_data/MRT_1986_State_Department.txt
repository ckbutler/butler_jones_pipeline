 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania is governed by the Military Committee for National
 Salvation (MCNS), established after a bloodless 1978 coup which
 removed the civilian president and abolished the parliamentary
 system in effect since independence in 1960. Colonel Maaouya
 Ould Sid' Ahmed Taya, President of the Committee, is Chief of
 State. He assumed power after the ouster of the former
 President, Lt. Colonel Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla, on
 December 12, 1984. All 23 members of the Military Committee
 retain ministerial portfolios or occupy other key military or
 government positions. In effect, the President functions as a
 "first among equals," since decisionmaking is by consensus.
 All political parties and opposition groups are banned.
 Prospects for an early return to civilian rule on the national
 level appear remote. In the absence of any institutionalized
 consultative process between the Government and the people, the
 Structure for the Education of the Masses (SEM) was created on
 a nationwide basis in 1982. organized down to the village and
 neighborhood level, it is used to explain government policy,
 mobilize manpower for self-help projects, and air grievances.
 In 1986 the regime took the first tentative steps towards
 democratization on the local level. Communal elections were
 held in Nouakchott and regional capitals in December. The
 authority of the newly elected councils, which will choose
 mayors and deputy mayors from among their membership, is
 limited to local affairs. While political parties were not
 permitted, campaigning in the municipal elections was lively
 and took on some of the tone and color of political debate.
 Despite this first step and the personal popularity of
 President Taya, the governmental institutions remain without a
 broad basis of support and provide no outlet for discontent,
 dissent, or even meaningful debate of national policies.
 The country continues to face daunting economic and social
 problems: desertification and other aftereffects of prolonged
 drought; increasing racial tensions; massive unemployment; the
 highest per capita debt in Africa; poor infrastructure;
 inadequate health and education systems; and a mass exodus from
 the rural areas. Although adequate rains fell in 1985 and
 1986, the 1971-1984 drought caused a massive migration of
 nomads into towns, thereby forcing them into urban refugee
 camps and severely weakening the Maur nomadic culture.
 The advent of the Taya regime brought some human rights
 improvements. In late 1984, the new regime released and
 pardoned all political prisoners and detainees from the
 Haidalla regime. President Taya also publicly espouses a
 harmonious, multiethnic society. However, the arrest, trial,
 and sentencing in 1986 of 21 blacks from the Toucouleur ethnic
 group, including prominent figures in politics, media, and
 education, on charges of sedition and threatening national
 unity raised serious questions concerning the Government's
 attitude towards the political aspirations of black
 Mauritanians. Many see these arrests as evidence of the
 Government's intention to maintain the domination of the Maurs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 
 
 195
 MAURITANIA
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of politically inspired disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture, and there is no
 evidence that it was practiced in 1986. However, extended
 confinement is sometimes used to encourage self-incrimination.
 Some political prisoners released in late 1984 charged that
 they had been tortured under the previous Haidalla regime. At
 the beginning of 1987, there were reports that the Toucouleur
 prisoners had been denied visits by family members. The
 Ministry of the Interior is actively cooperating with the newly
 founded Mauritanian Human Rights League to ensure the proper
 treatment of detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mauritanian law guarantees expeditious arraignment and trial,
 access to legal counsel, and the right of appeal. However, an
 inadequate and underfinanced judicial system results in
 suspects being held regularly for long periods before trial.
 Moreover, under legislation enacted before the 1978 coup, the
 authorities have the prerogative to detain, without trial or
 appeal, anyone judged to be a threat to national security.
 Such detainees are usually confined to their residences but can
 also be detained in prisons, which exist in both Nouakchott and
 Jereida for more serious cases.
 As many as eight government officials and businessmen closely
 associated with former President Haidalla were detained along
 with him at the time of the coup in 1984. Four of these men,
 as well as Haidalla, are still under house arrest or in prison,
 with no formal charges having been brought against them.
 Internal exile, loosely supervised, is the normal method for
 removing opposition from the political arena.
 Although the Government remains opposed to slavery and has
 established a commission to implement abolition measures,
 notably the 1980 Declaration, vestiges of the practice still
 remain. In the spring of 1985, the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission released a report on slavery in Mauritania, based on
 a 1984 visit by a commission representative. The report
 criticized the continued existence of slavery, especially in
 rural areas, but acknowledged the Government's intent to
 eradicate it, e.g., through government-sponsored resettlement
 programs. It is impossible to verify an estimate of the number
 of persons remaining in servitude. The institution still
 persists largely in southern Mauritania, where it originated in
 historic conflicts between nomads and sedentary groups. Under
 the form of slavery in Mauritania, slaves are legally free to
 leave but most do not either because their ancestors have
 worked for the same families for generations without pay or
 because of economic hardship outside the system. Freed slaves
 may choose to remain in servitude in exchange for bread and
 board. Slavery and the acceptance of such attitudes are deeply
 ingrained by historical circumstances, but new economic
 conditions and opportunities can engender change. The drought
 has had a tremendous impact on slavery, causing many Maurs to
 release their slaves because of the deteriorating economic
 situation. There is no commercial market for slaves.

 MAURITANIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In September the regime arrested 21 prominent Toucouleur blacks
 for protesting Maur domination of the political and economic
 system. They had circulated a political manifesto, entitled
 "Manifesto of the Oppressed Negro-Mauritanian", embodying their
 grievances against Arabization, their concerns about the
 adverse effects on blacks of the land tenure law, and their
 complaints about the unrepresentative and undemocratic nature
 of the Mauritanian Government. This document was circulated
 outside Mauritania. The detainees were charged with spreading
 falsehoods and hatred and calling for disorder. They committed
 no known acts of violence. All 21 were tried and given
 sentences ranging from 6 months to 5 years, to be followed by
 10 years of internal exile--unusually harsh penalties in a
 country where internal exile alone is the preferred method of
 treating political prisoners and detainees. Although they were
 assigned defense attorneys and were tried in accordance with
 Mauritanian law, they were apparently guilty only of nonviolent
 political acts and thus must be regarded as political
 prisoners. Each of the 21 sentences was confirmed on October
 13 by the appeals court. Eighteen other persons arrested in
 the course of the public disturbances associated with the trial
 of the Toucouleurs are currently under detention awaiting
 trial. A large number of Toucouleurs, mostly intellectuals and
 professionals, were taken into custody, questioned, and
 released during September, October, and November.
 Additionally, in the wake of the trials some ranking Toucouleur
 officials, including the Secretary General of the Ministry of
 Defense (since reinstated), were dismissed from their jobs.
 Former President Haidalla released a number of political
 prisoners shortly before his ouster. President Taya, in late
 1984, released and pardoned all remaining political prisoners
 from the Haidalla regime. Those whose goods were confiscated
 at the time of their detention had their belongings restored by
 the Government. Although President Taya also invited all
 exiles to return home to Mauritania, only a limited number have
 done so. The current estimate of 26 political prisoners
 includes former President Haidalla and 4 of his supporters and
 the 21 Toucouleurs sentenced in September 1986.
 The Shari'a Islamic Code, as instituted in Mauritania in 1980,
 covers adultery, theft of personal property, and murder. A
 Muslim judge presides over a jury chosen by the governor of the
 region. The defendant has a right-to counsel and can appeal a
 guilty verdict to the Supreme Islamic Court within 15 days.
 Circumstantial evidence cannot be admitted as proof of guilt.
 Admission of guilt is sometimes obtained in the context of a
 promised reduction in punishment. Inability to convince the
 sitting magistrate that the Government's charges are in error
 is in itself considered by the courts as a legal admission of
 guilt, as is the convincing testimony of a firsthand witness or
 codefendant. All sentences must be approved by the President.
 Opposition to the Shari'a has been expressed most often by
 blacks and women, who believe that the Shari'a code favors the
 Maur way of life. Although a strict interpretation of the
 Shari'a in earlier years produced communal tension, the issue
 has largely passed from public debate due to moderate
 implementation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in private affairs, save in instances
 where treason is suspected, is limited. Reflecting the nomadic
 
 
 197
 MAURITANIA
 penchant for privacy and the sanctity of confidences, the lack
 of sophisticated equipment to undertake surveillance, and the
 isolation of many parts of the country, the Government normally
 limits its surveillance to patrols on major highways,
 occasional nighttime inspections of vehicular traffic, and
 inspections of mail suspected of containing currency or
 prohibited items.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedom of speech and press is restricted. Political
 expression is tightly controlled. Most Mauritanians are
 careful not to propagate antigovernment opinions. Private
 discussion is lively in family and clan networks, which act as
 vehicles for communicating complaints and airing dissent, as do
 the Structure for the Education of the Masses. The nomadic
 tradition also provides for candid expressions of concern to
 the leadership. In fact, both Presidents Taya and Haidalla
 invited discussion of governmental policies from local leaders
 during visits to rural areas. In practice, the Government is
 particularly reactive to expressions of ethnic or racial
 discontent and criticism of the regime's basic policies or
 legitimacy, as evidenced by the recent convictions of the black
 dissidents.
 Mauritania's only newspaper, news agency, and radio/television
 station are government operated. The Government does not
 permit criticism of its policies or authority, and editorial
 content of the media is controlled. International news
 magazines and newspapers generally circulate freely in
 Mauritania. Shortwave broadcasts and Senegalese television are
 followed openly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly has been suspended since 1978 when civilian
 rule was ended by a military coup. The Government strictly
 enforces its prohibition of public meetings addressing
 political themes. In September minor civic disturbances,
 kindled by the arrests of black leaders, were suppressed
 swiftly by armed police and the use of tear gas. In addition,
 as part of the large scale crackdown on the Toucouleur
 community carried out in the second half of 1986, authorities
 banned meetings of black self-help groups and cultural
 associations, and even checked on large black family gatherings
 such as weddings. Later in the year, however, large
 demonstrations were permitted in the campaigns for communal
 councils.
 Labor unions were the only nationwide organizations with any
 political impact that were not dissolved following the 1978
 coup. Labor unions are grouped in a national organization, the
 Mauritanian Workers Union (UTM), which is allowed a large
 measure of freedom in its organizational efforts. The UTM is
 associated with a number of regional and international labor
 organizations, and its officials are permitted to travel to
 attend international labor meetings. Union leaders are free to
 take positions on international labor matters within the
 confines of Mauritania's basic foreign policies.
 Individual labor unions have the right to organize but are
 recognized only when they register with the UTM and accept an
 
 
 198
 MAURITANIA
 appointed director general. Wages are set through an informal
 bargaining arrangement involving individual unions, the UTM,
 employers, and the Government. Union officials claim that
 total union membership has reached 30,000 members. Union
 membership is not universal; workers must pay an annual
 membership fee of $4, but the Government indirectly finances
 most union activities. The right to strike exists in theory,
 but is greatly restricted in practice, and an extended strike
 would probably be strongly opposed by the Government. There
 have been two brief strikes in recent years.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania, and the country's
 official name is the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. Virtually
 all citizens are Muslim. Proselytizing and the construction of
 churches and other non-Islamic houses of worship are prohibited
 without government permission. Mauritania's small Roman
 Catholic community has been granted permission in several
 instances to build churches. A number of Catholic churches
 operate freely. Mauritanian Muslims are prohibited from
 entering non-Islamic houses of worship and from converting to
 another faith.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 although travelers are frequently subjected to routine police
 checks. Temporary curfews have been imposed several times
 during emergency situations, most recently following'the 1984
 "restructuring" of the Military Committee for National
 Salvation. As a result of the endemic drought, large numbers
 of former nomads and oasis dwellers have migrated to urban
 areas, swelling the population of the towns and surrounding
 shanty villages.
 In 1985 the Government ended the requirement that Mauritanians
 must have an exit visa before traveling abroad. A few
 Mauritanian officials have fled the country because of
 political opposition to the Government. Conflict in the
 Western Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front has led
 to a small immigration of refugees into Nouadhibou and other
 northern towns, but there are no acknowledged political
 refugees in Mauritania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political power rests in the hands of a military junta. Ethnic
 diversity is marked, and the sense of national identity weak.
 In the official view, underdevelopment and potential ethnic
 conflicts require limits on political rights. Ethnically based
 political movements are particularly feared, as shown by the
 strong reaction to Toucouleur dissidents in 1986. Black
 opponents of the regime accuse it of forcibly perpetuating Maur
 dominance of the political system. Many observers are
 convinced that the Government intends to ensure Maur dominance
 by quickly breaking the back of any black dissident movement.
 The Military Committee for National Salvation remains the
 "custodian of the nation's sovereignty." All executive and
 legislative functions reside with this Committee. Membership
 is limited to military officers and is automatically conferred
 
 
 199
 MAURITANIA
 on incumbents of ministerial positions and important military
 and security posts. In ethnic terms, the MCNS is predominantly
 Maur, although several blacks are members as well. The most
 prominent black on the MCNS lost his position in the wake of
 the 1986 Toucouleur arrests. The right of citizens to change
 their Government has not existed since 1978, when Mauritania's
 military ended all democratic procedures and abolished the
 country's sole political party.
 As promised by President Taya, municipal elections were held in
 December 1986. Slates of candidates for communal councils were
 organized in Nouakchott and in all 12 regional capitals. While
 in a few cases only one slate came forward, the elections were
 generally contested by several slates in each city. The
 process was tightly controlled--political debate on national
 issues was forbidden, and the makeup of the slates was required
 to reflect ethnic and tribal balances. The balloting itself
 was orderly and free of interference, although administrative
 problems prevented some persons from voting. Results were
 announced promptly. The communal councils elected in December
 will choose mayors and deputy mayors from their ranks. The
 councils are new institutions, and their authorities and
 relationship to the central administration are as yet unclear.
 December 1986 marked the first time contested elections have
 ever been held in Mauritania. That the municipal elections
 evinced such evident enthusiasm and was carried out in an
 orderly, successful manner may auger well for the regime's
 stated policy of a gradual return to civilian, representative
 government and should be regarded as an advance in human rights
 terms.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is-sensitive to criticism on human rights and
 has been cooperative with the U.N. Human Rights Commission's
 working group on slavery, inviting the Comission to send a
 representative to Mauritania in 1984. An official response to
 the Commission's 1985 report is scheduled for release in 1987.
 The Government is also aware of continuing Amnesty
 International concerns over a number of human rights issues.
 The Taya regime gave permission in 1986 for the founding of
 Mauritania's first organization dedicated to the protection of
 human rights, the Mauritanian Human Rights League. The
 League's primary concern is to address the means by which the
 Government can eliminate the last vestiges of slavery and
 provide an economic basis for the advancement of former
 slaves. Other stated concerns include the status of women's
 rights, the uniform application of the Shari'a law, and the
 prevention of abuses similar to those which occurred under the
 Haidalla regime.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mauritania is situated geographically and culturally on the
 divide between the nomadic Arabic-speaking Maurs of the north
 and the sedentary blacks of the African south. The interaction
 of these two groups produces the complex cultural diversity
 which fuels ethnic/racial tensions inherent in Mauritanian
 society. Recent movements of the nomads to the south as a
 result of drought have greatly exacerbated tensions,
 
 
 200
 MAURITANIA
 culminating in the 1986 arrests of black leaders.
 Historically, and since independence in 1960, the Maurs have
 dominated the political and economic system. The Maurs claim
 they are still a demographic majority, whose mother tongue is
 Hassaniya Arabic, but blacks believe they now constitute a
 majority and are entitled to more political representation.
 There are no statistics to back up either claim, although most
 foreign observers believe that blacks represent a substantial
 and growing proportion of the population. The black population
 is represented. at all levels of government but is
 underrepresented in terms of its proportion of the population.
 Many blacks also believe that Maur domination in government,
 state enterprises, business, and religious institutions is a
 result of racial discrimination. Their grievances include such
 issues as language (Arabization and the use of French),
 educational opportunities, and land reform. A controversial
 land tenure bill is, for example, viewed by some as a means by
 which wealthy, urban Maurs can appropriate profitable land
 along the Senegal River basin, traditionally the homeland of
 Mauritania's black population.
 Although Mauritanian women are legally free to participate
 fully in governmental affairs and private business, traditional
 values and practices limit the scope of their activities. A
 small number of women have risen to important positions in the
 fields of health and education or hold midlevel government
 positions. Large numbers of women turned out both as
 supporters in political rallies and as voters in the December
 elections. Even though few women were candidates on the
 slates, their active participation in the political process is
 apparently being encouraged.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Mauritania, with a population estimated at 1.8 million and an
 annual growth rate approaching 3 percent, has one of the lowest
 standards of living in the world. Its economy is characterized
 by a sharp contrast between the modern, internationally
 oriented mining and fisheries sector in the north and central
 regions and the very underdeveloped subsistence livestock and
 agricultural sector of the south, in which the majority of the
 population is engaged. Although estimates for unemployment
 vary from 50 to 90 percent, it is impossible to judge the
 situation accurately, given the rural nature of the economy.
 Many Mauritanian workers go abroad for work, but Mauritania
 also receives substantial numbers of workers from neighboring
 countries.
 While education is not compulsory in Mauritania, no child may
 be employed before the age of 14 without the express permission
 of the Minister of Labor and National Labor Council. The
 standard minimum age of employment in nonagricultural
 enterprises is 15 years. The labor code does not address
 conditions of employment for family members in agriculture or
 animal husbandry, which is largely outside the cash economy and
 accounts for 95 percent of non-Government economic activity in
 Mauritania. Although there are no figures available, the use
 of child labor (except in the family-owned agricultural sector)
 is not thought to be widespread due to massive unemployment
 among adult males. There is a guaranteed minimum wage,
 established in 1985 for unskilled workers and for agricultural
 workers and in 1984 for skilled workers. Information on actual
 wage levels is scanty and often unreliable.
 
 
 201
 MAURITANIA
 The standard nonagricultural workweek in Mauritania is not to
 exceed 40 hours, nor 6 days per week. Enforcement of labor
 laws is the responsibility of the labor inspectorate, Ministry
 of Labor. Disputes over labor issues are heard before special
 three-person labor courts which are overseen jointly by the
 Ministries of Justice and Labor. These courts are regarded by
 labor union leadership as unbiased and effective.
