 AUSTRIA
 Austria, a neutral and Western-oriented society, attaches
 vital importance to human rights. It is a parliamentary
 constitutional democracy. The Austrian constitution and
 Austrian State Treaty of 1955 define and guarantee basic
 human rights concerning the integrity of the person and
 civil and political liberties. Austria's record since re-
 gaining sovereignty in 1955 has been exemplary. Austria is
 well known for its assistance to refugees from other countries,
 many of whom have settled there, and for its important role in
 facilitating transit of Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of punish-
 ment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Austria has a highly developed social welfare system, and the
 distribution of wealth is more equitable than in most countries.
 Government, labor and management cooperate well in a so-called
 "social partnership" which has been effective in avoiding
 serious labor-management disputes. Austria's socialist govern-

 ment places heavy emphasis on maintaining and improving
 health, education and social services.
 The Austrian State Treaty (Article 7) states that Slovene
 and Croatian minorities shall enjoy the same rights on
 equal terms as all other Austrian nationals and inter alia
 grants to them the right to educational instructlon-in-
 their own languages at the elementary school level and to
 a proportionate number of secondary schools. Interpretation
 and implementation of these rights has been a subject of
 controversy. The Austrian government has recently enacted
 and started to implement legislation which it hopes will ful-
 fill Austria's obligations under the State Treaty.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are in full effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is complete freedom of movement within and from the
 country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in Political Process.
 This freedom is in effect.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no investigations of Austria's human rights
 record. To our knowledge, there have been no requests for
 them.
