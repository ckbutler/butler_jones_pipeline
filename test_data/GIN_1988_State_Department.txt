 GUINEA
 General Lansana Conte leads a military government which
 assumed power in 1984 after the death of Sekou Toure. He
 inherited a 26-year legacy of mismanagement and leftwing
 authoritarianism. Since the military Government suspended the
 Constitution in 1984, the Military Committee for National
 Recovery (CMRN) and a military and civilian Council of
 Ministers rule through ordinances, decrees, and decisions
 issued by the President and various ministers. The 1965
 Guinean Penal Code regulates treatment of prisoners, delegates
 authority to permit public assemblies, and provides some
 guarantees of personal liberties. Generally disregarded
 during the previous regime, the Code has increasingly been
 enforced by the CMRN.
 Military and paramilitary forces number about 17,000 persons,
 with the army consisting of some 10,000 officers and
 soldiers. The 2,000-man national guard (Gendarmerie
 Nationale), a police force, and a well-armed presidential
 guard share in providing internal security.
 Eighty percent of Guinea's population of 7 million is
 dependent on subsistence agriculture, with per capita annual
 income estimated at barely $300. The country relies largely
 on mineral resources, mainly bauxite, but also diamonds and
 gold, for export income. Under President Conte, Guinea has
 been attempting to create an economic environment conducive to
 private enterprise and free market activity. Its
 comprehensive economic reform program has diversified the
 small salaried work force and made it less dependent on public
 service jobs primarily through the creation of producers'
 associations and cooperatives, and by promoting foreign
 investment. In the wake of reforms, the economy has
 occasionally been subjected to heavy inflationary pressures
 which early in the year led to protest demonstrations by
 university students and unemployed youth.
 Despite the improvements since the fall of the Toure regime,
 human rights continue to be circumscribed in Guinea,
 especially in the political sphere. In particular, the
 secretive handling by the CMRN of those arrested and tried
 following the 1985 coup attempt against the Conte Government
 has left a residue of controversy and questions concerning
 their fate. At the end of 1987, the President moved to
 alleviate this situation by granting amnesty to 67 persons who
 had been imprisoned in 1984 and 1985 for association with this
 coup attempt or with the previous Toure regime; an additional
 39 persons were released on October 2, 1988. Others detained
 after the 1985 coup attempt remain unaccounted for. The
 Government in 1988 publicly stressed its commitment to work
 toward "a government of laws," encouraged the teaching of
 human rights in African schools by hosting an all-African
 seminar on this subject, and promulgated a new work code to
 further worker rights with the help of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 
 
 144
 GUINEA
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, there is still uncertainty about the fate of some
 military officers who disappeared after their arrest following
 the 1985 coup attempt.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The military Government has denounced the human rights
 atrocities of the former Toure dictatorship and seeks to
 enforce provisions of the. 1965 Penal Code which forbid torture
 and abuse of authority. Mistreatment of prisoners continues,,
 largely q result of poor discipline among guards, but is not
 condoned by the Government. In the case of those arrested
 after the 1985 coup attempt, the Amnesty International (AI)
 1988 report indicates that the authorities may have used
 torture and other forms of duress to extract statements which
 were subsequently used against these persons in secret trials.
 Prison conditions remain squalid. The Government is
 attempting to implement judicial and prison reforms to help
 alleviate these conditions. For example, in August it
 announced a project to renovate the Conakry central prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 A suspected criminal can be detained incommunicado until the
 arresting authority has completed a preliminary investigation
 and has the right to counsel only after first appearing before
 a judge. A system of bail for those accused of less serious
 crimes, as defined by the presiding judge, is available at the
 judge's discretion. Despite presidential admonitions and
 campaigns in the government-owned media against corruption and
 harassment of citizens by paramilitary elements, there have
 been isolated incidents of extortion through arbitrary
 detention.
 Political detainees, such as those held after the 1985 coup
 attempt, have been held incommunicado for extended periods of
 time. About 10 university students were held without counsel
 for a few days after disturbances at the University of Conakry
 in January.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Guinean Penal Code contains provisions on the presumption
 of innocence of accused persons, the independence of judges,
 the equality of citizens before the law, the right of accused
 to counsel and to appeal a judicial decision, and amnesty.
 The judiciary has courts of first instance, or justices of the
 peace, at the local level and two courts of appeal (one in
 Kankan, one in Conakry). The Court of Annulment is the
 Guinean court of last appeal. A Special Court of State
 Secrity was created in 1985 to try those allegedly involved in
 the July coup attempt.. There is also.a military court system.
 There is a parallel system of justice at the village or urban
 neighborhood level where litigants present their civil case
 before a village chief, neighborhood chief-, or council of wise
 men for judgment. Justice is not enforced uniformly,
 however. For example, in urban areas, burglars, if caught,
 
 
 145
 GUINEA
 are sometimes beaten to death by victims and their neighbors
 with the tacit approval of police authorities.
 The Government's handling of those arrested for their alleged
 involvement either with the former Toure regime or the July
 1985 coup attempt has been the subject of much criticism by
 human rights organizations. About 70 civilians imprisoned in
 1984 and 1985 were later tried and sentenced in secret
 proceedings before the Special Court of State Security.
 Likewise, about 130 military personnel were tried and
 sentenced in secret before the Military Court for involvement
 in the July 1985 coup attempt. Much of the information
 concerning the arrest, interrogation, detention, trial
 procedures, sentencing,-and release of prisoners under the
 jurisdiction of these Courts has never been made available.
 AI's 1988 report states that none of the defendants were ever
 informed the trials were taking place and that they were
 represented by legal counsel who never consulted them. For
 most of the accused, the Government announced the sentences
 only in May 1987. Presidential amnesties on December 31,
 1987, and on October 2, 1988, released 106 persons (including
 79 military). The fate of the remaining persons was unknown
 at the end of 1988, but it was widely believed that many of
 the announced death sentences had been carried out summarily
 shortly after the suspects were arrested.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government stresses traditional family values and the
 inviolability of the home. In general, the military
 Government is less willing than the previous regime to abuse
 police powers, although some unwarranted interference in
 citizens' lives continues, mainly through individual police
 harassment related to extortion. Though not officially
 sanctioned, some mail and telephone calls are subject to
 monitoring.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press
 The Government has publicly stated that it supports free
 speech and press. President Conte asked the Guinean press in
 April to exercise more independence and especially avoid
 contrived praise of himself or his Government. However, the
 Government owns and operates the news media, and reporters,
 who are government employees, practice self- censorship.
 There was more investigative reporting in 1988, but no
 criticism of the senior levels of government or established
 policies.
 The Guinean Penal Code also contains numerous restrictions on
 speech and press freedoms; for example, the Code requires
 authors to indicate name, profession, and place of residence
 on every article published. This regulation is not fully
 implemented at present; at most only the name of the author is
 given, and some articles are unattributed. Publications which
 incite crime or are contrary to good morals are prohibited, as
 are insult, defamation, and libel. Citizens do not generally
 feel free to express public criticism of the Government, but
 some groups, operating for the most part abroad, have
 expressed criticism in clandestinely published and distributed
 tracts. The Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism
 continues to act both as administrator and censor of media
 
 
 146
 GUINEA
 services. Many foreign publications circulate freely in
 Guinea, including some critical of the Government, and no
 attempt is made to interfere with foreign radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public gatherings can take place only with the approval of the
 Government. The Guinean Penal Code bans any meeting which has
 an ethnic or racial character or any gathering "whose nature
 threatens national unity." The Government encourages the
 formation of nonpolitical professional organizations and their
 numbers continue to increase.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Guineans generally enjoy religious freedom and tolerance for
 the larger religious groups. Missionaries may proselytize in
 Guinea. Although an estimated 85 percent of the population is
 nominally Muslim, there is no official state religion. The
 Government observes both major Christian and Muslim holidays.
 There have been some signs of intolerance of smaller sects,
 however. In July 1988, the Government established an
 interministerial commission charged with drafting "a
 comprehensive report on the measures that should be taken to
 put an end to the proliferation of religious sects." No
 report had been issued at the end of 1988. In 1987 the
 Government denied the Baha'is authorization to procure land
 and build a Baha'i center in Conakry. Several other
 organizations, both religious and secular, have faced similar
 problems in obtaining building permits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Guineans are free to move about the country and to change
 place of residence and work, .although in practice they face
 some harassment by police and military at unauthorized
 roadblocks, particularly at night. It is common for
 individual citizens to pay bribes to avoid police harassment.
 The number of police patrols and checkpoints increased in
 1988, in part to counter drug-related crime and juvenile
 delinquency. Foreign travel for Guinean citizens involves
 considerable delay to obtain a passport and required exit
 visas.
 The Government has restricted the freedom of movement of
 individual citizens for political reasons. For example, the
 67 persons who were granted amnesty at the end of 1987 were
 restricted to their area of origin upon their release from
 prison. That restriction has gradually been relaxed in many
 cases and left to the discretion of local prefects. The
 Government has encouraged Guinean expatriates, including
 former exiles of the Sekou Toure regime, to return home.
 There are still significant numbers of Guineans living in
 neighboring African countries and in France.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guinea has had. no long-term experience with democracy since
 independence, and citizens are unable to change their
 government under democratic procedures. The military
 
 
 147
 GUINEA
 Government suspended the Constitution and banned political
 parties and formal political activity when it took power in
 April 1984. In 1988, hcwever, the Government established a
 constitutional commission whose mandate is to draft a
 constitution by the end of 1989. Decentralization remained a
 major theme in 1988, and the Government continued to
 strengthen local government advisory bodies at the village
 level in rural areas. Nonpartisan elections at the
 subprefecture level have taken place in most parts.of the
 country for selection of officials responsible for local
 development projects and other community services. These
 officials complement the subprefects, prefects, and provincial
 governors appointed by the President.
 While there are no women in the CMRN, women do hold cabinet
 posts, ambassadorships, judicial positions, and other high
 level government positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1987 senior government officials, including the Minister of
 Justice and the President of the State Security Court,
 received AI representatives seeking information about the
 secret trials. It is not known what the Government's response
 was, if any, to AI's memorandum submitted in December 1987
 expressing its concerns about the trials and proposing
 measures to uphold human rights. The Government permits a
 local affiliate of AI to operate.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While racial or ethnic discrimination is prohibited by the
 Penal Code, ethnic identification is still very strong in
 Guinea and mutual suspicion affects relations across ethnic
 lines within and outside the Government. The Soussou ethnic
 group, to which President Conte belongs, tends to predominate
 at the highest, most influential levels. However, there are
 currently no major ethnic disputes, arid government policy is
 to include representatives of all major ethnic groups in the
 Government. The Government repeatedly urges Guineans to think
 of themselves as a nation and not as members of ethnic groups.
 In rural Guinea, opportunities for women are limited by custom
 and the traditional demands of subsistence farming. Even in
 urban areas Guinean women lag behind in school enrollments and
 in employment opportunities. Nevertheless, in addition to
 progress in government service, women are well-represented in
 music, dance, sports, and business throughout the country.
 The Government has affirmed the principle of equal pay for
 equal work, but in practice women receive less pay than men in
 most jobs.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Guinea's new Labor Code, drafted with the assistance of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and promulgated in
 January 1988, states all workers have the right to create and
 participate in organizations that defend and develop their
 individual and collective rights as workers. The Code also
 provides that workers have the right not to be a member of
 
 
 GUINEA
 such organizations. Further, it stipulates that a union must
 be independent of political parties to be recognized as
 representative of workers. The Code requires elected worker
 representatives for any enterprise employing 25 salaried
 workers. The Code also grants salaried workers the right to
 strike 10 days after their representative union makes known
 their intention to strike.
 The ILO Committee of Experts has commended the Government for
 its new labor code; however, it has also noted that
 discrepancies remain between the relevant ILO Convention and
 legislative provisions that permit only workers of Guinean
 nationality to be elected as trade union officers and that
 provide for the establishment of compulsory arbitration.
 In practice, most salaried Guineans--many of whom are civil
 servants--are affiliated with the country's sole trade union
 central, the Guinean National Labor Confederation (CNTG),
 which has close ties to the Government. The CNTG is
 affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 and maintains relations with recognized regional and
 international bodies, including the ILO. Private sector
 workers may strike only with the permission of the CNTG board,
 a requirement which reduces the likelihood of strikes. The
 Government has dealt sternly with wildcat strikers in the
 past, including banning those in the public sector from
 further government employment.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the new Code, representative workers' unions or union
 groups can organize in the workplace and negotiate with
 employers or employers' associations. Union delegates are to
 represent individual and collective claims and grievances
 before the employer. Work rules and work hours established by
 the employer are to be developed in consultation with union
 delegates. Individual workers threatened with dismissal or
 other sanctions have the right to a hearing before the
 employer with a union representative present. Employers must
 give advance notice of any plan to reduce the size of their
 work force for economic reasons.
 In practice, CNTG representatives take the lead in
 labor-management talks. Collective bargaining has taken
 place, most notably in 1986 when the CNTG concluded an
 agreement with the mining companies, and again in 1988 when
 bank employees collectively bargained for substantially higher
 salaries. Labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout
 the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced in Guinea, and
 Article 2 of the Labor Code specifically forbids it. The ILO
 Committee of Experts has noted the Government's stated
 intention to revise or repeal various laws that have become
 obsolete so as to bring them into compliance with ILO
 conventions on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment in practice as well as in the
 new code is 16 years of age. Apprentices, however, may be as
 young as 14 years old. Workers and apprentices below age 18
 are not permitted to work at night or more than 12 consecutive
 
 
 149
 GUINEA
 hours or on Sundays. According to the Labor Code, the
 Minister of Labor must maintain a list of occupations in which
 women and youth under age 18 may-not be employed. Enforcement
 of these provisions outside of the modern sector of the
 economy however tends to be erratic, particularly in rural
 areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government has not yet enacted minimum wage legislation,
 but the Labor Code provides for the eventual establishment by
 decree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage. There are also
 provisions for overtime and night wage rates, which are fixed
 percentages of the regular wage. Wages currently paid the
 average worker in the public sector are generally not
 sufficent to provide a decent standard of living. According
 to the Code, regular work is not to exceed 10 hours per day
 nor 48 hours per week, with a 40-hour workweek being the
 norm. The minimum weekly day of rest must be 24 consecutive
 hours, usually on Sunday. Every salaried worker has the right
 to an annual paid holiday accumulated at the rate of at least
 2 1/2 workdays per month of service. Several articles of the
 Code provide for safe working conditions and the continued
 good health of workers. These as yet represent the goal
 rather than the practice.
