 FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
 The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which became independ-
 ent following the breakup of Yugoslavia, is a parliamentary democracy. President
 Kiro Gligorov, elected by-Parliament in 1990, was directly reelected in October. In
 multiparty parliamentary elections, which international monitors judged generally
 free and fair despite numerous procedural irregularities, the Social Democratic Alli-
 ance of Macedonia, the former Communist party, emerged with a clear majority.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs oversees the security apparatus, including uni-
 formed police, border police, and the state intelligence service. A civilian minister
 directs the Ministry, and a parliamentary commission oversees operations.
 Historically, FYROM was the poorest of the Yugoslav republics, and its economy
 was closely tied to the other republics, especially Serbia. Conflict in the region and
 international sanctions imposed on Serbia-Montenegro have led to severe economic
 difficulties. In February Greece imposed a trade embargo on FYROM in a dispute
 over the country's name, flag, and constitution, which contributed to a sharp drop
 in gross domestic product. Oficial unemployment is about a third of the work force.
 Major exports are manufactured goods and machinery and transport equipment.
 The human rights situation in the FYROM is impaired by delay in the enactment
 of legislation to provide mechanisms for implementing the rule of law and protection
 of human rights provided for in the Constitution. Police occasionally abuse detainees
 and reportedly harass the political opposition. They also do not abide strictly by con-
 stitutional provisions regarding arraignment of the accused, the maximum period of
 pretrial detention, and the accused's right to counsel at the time of arrest.
 Minorities, including ethnic Albanians, Turks, and Serbs, have raised various alle-
 gations of human rights violations and discrimination. Ethnic Macedonians occupy
 preeminent positions in state institutions, including state-owned companies. Ethnic
 Albanians continue to demand increased Albanian-language education, greater rep-
 resentation in public sector jobs, and improved access to the media. Te Govern-
 ment has agreed in principle to many of these demands but has done little, citing
 resource constraints as the reason.
 Ethnic-Albanians dispute unofficial 1994 census figures that credit them with 22.9
 percent of the population, and claim to constitute up to 40 percent of the population.
 -Nevertheless, the 1994 census, carried out with the assistance of the Council of Eu-
 rope, was generally pronounced to have been satisfactory by European experts who
 monitored it.
 Underlying ethnic tension did not produce any major clashes during 1994. Ten-
 sions flared temporarily when a fight between groups of Macedonians and ethnic Al-
 
 
 banians resulted in the death of a Macedonian youth. It appeared, however, that
 the fight was not ethnically motivated but rather a clash between two gangs known
 to the police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment and punishment. However, police occa-
 sionally used excessive force against criminal suspects following their arrest. In
 April Jove Bo &ovski was reportedly fired at and severely wounded while in plice
 custody. He also alleges that he was severely mistreated during his 4 days of deten-
 tion. Police state that he was in custody during the alleged period but that the gun-
 shot wound was self-inflicted.
 Of 10 ethnic Albanians charged with conspiracy in the so-called Albanian Para-
 military affair, 9 alleged mistreatment by the police over a period of 3 days. Their
 complaints were consistent and credible (see Section i.e.). The Government rejected
 the allegations and took no action against the police in this case.
 Government sources stated that allegations of excessive force during the first 9
 months of 1994 resulted in the conviction of four policemen on criminal charges and
 the punishment of two by administrative means.
 d Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no confirmed reports of arbi-
 trary arrest or detention, although opposition political parties have alleged police
 harassment of their members. There is no systematic use of detention as a form of
 nonjudicial punishment. Incommunicado detention is not practiced.
 The Constitution states that a person must be arraigned in court within 24 hours
 of arrest, but police do not always meet this deadline for filing charges. The Con-
 stitution also sets the maximum duration of detention pending trial at 90 days.
 However, prisoners in the Albanian Paramilitary case, accused of fomenting an
 armed uprising against the Government, were held for almost 7 months before their
 trial began in May.
 The accused must be informed of his or her legal rights and the reasons for arrest
 or detention. The accused is entitled to contact a lawyer at the time of arrest and
 to have a lawyer present during police and court proceedings. The police ignored
 this provision in their initial interrogations of those accused in the Albanian Para-
 military case. The prisoners claimed they were held incommunicado and mistreated
 for 3 days before being formally charged and sent to a pretrial detention facility.
 According to human rights observers and criminal defense attorneys, police often
 violate the 24-hour requirement and deny immediate access to an attorney.
 Although the law requires judicial warrants for arrests, police sometimes ignore
 this provision, and judges issue the warrant only some time after the arrest has
 taken place.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria!.-Constitutionally, the courts are autonomous and
 independent. Municipal and district courts and the Supreme Court form a three-tier
 court system. A Constitutional Court deals with matters of constitutional interpreta-
 tion. Political considerations do not appear to influence most trials, but there was
 one major exception during the year.
 The Albanian Paramilitary case, which was tried in Skopje in May and June, was
 at least in part politically motivated. The prosecution presented substantial evidence
 that most, if not all, of the 10 defendants had committed firearms and hard cur-
 rency trading offenses. However, there was some indication that the arrests and
 prosecution of a Deputy Minister of Defense and a former secretary general of the
 National Democratic Party (PDP), a party representing ethnic Albanians, may have
 taken place as a result of political intrigue involving the Government and the PDP,
 apparently maneuvering over jobs.
 The prisoners were held for almost 7 months before the trial. During the trial,
 defense attorneys were not permitted to call several witnesses for the defense or to
 have independent experts examine the evidence. The court allowed confessions al-
 leged by the defendants to have been coerced to be admitted into evidence. The de-
 fendants claimed that they were acting purely in self-defense against the Yugoslav
 army, and that they had ceased their activities when FYROM's own army was
 formed over 2 years ago. The defendants were convicted on all counts and sentenced
 to terms ranging from 5 to 8 years. The case is now on appeal.
 There is a widespread credible perception that bribery is not uncommon in the
 courts in FYROM.

 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence.
 Although no instances of abuses were substantiated, officials of the rightwing oppo-
 sition Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) charged that the
 state security service tapped their telephones
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and public information, as well as freedom to establish private media outlets, and
 forbids censorship. The Government generally respected these freedoms.
 There are daily newspapers in Skopje, the capital, and in other cities, as well as
 numerous political and other publications. An Albanian and a Turkish newspaper,
 which the Government subsidizes, have nationwide distribution. The bulk of news-
 papers and magazines published in the country are government owned and govern-
 ment oriented.
 Opposition parties made alleged government control and manipulation of the
 media a major theme of their October election campaigns. The state-owned media
 reported such charges and in general did a creditable job of covering the rallies,
 statements, and press conferences of all the major parties running in the elections.
 The overall balance of coverage, however, was in favor of the Government.
 The Government owns the only modern, high-speed printing plant in the country,
 as well as most newspaper kiosks. Opposition groups complain that the company
 charges high prices for the services of the printing plant.
 Newspapers may be imported from Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, and Greece only
 with the permission of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 Ethnic Albanians complain that there are not enough Albanian-language media
 outlets. The Government provided funds to make the state-owned Albanian-lan-
 guage newspaper, Flaka, a daily rather than a thrice weekly publication. The Gov-
 ernment has also agreed in principle to increase the minimum amount of broadcast
 time in the Albanian language on state television (5 hours weekly).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them. Organizers of large assemblies
 must notify police in advance, but permits are usually granted. Dozens of opposition
 rallies occurred during the election campaign with no major incidents, as did a large
 antigovernment demonstration to protest alleged election fraud in October. The op-
 position held mock protest balloting to mark their boycott of the second round of
 elections October 30; these rallies were also peaceful.
 The Political Party Registration Law requires poitical parties and nongovern-
 mental organizations to register with the Internal Affairs Ministry. About 70 politi-
 cal parties are registered, including ethnically based parties of Albanians, Turks,
 Serbs, and llama. After a spit in the largest Alhanian party in February, the Min-
 istry denied registration to the "radical" faction of the party under the party's origi-
 nal name, ruling that the name belonged to the original faction of the party. Can-
 didates of the "radical" faction ran as independents in the October elections. Later
 in the year, many political parties experienced technical difficulties in reregistering,
 but there was no indication that this was politically motivated.
 c. Freedom of Religio.-The Government does not generally interfere with the
 practice of religion. However, the refusal of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Serbia-
 Montenegro to recognize the independence of the Macedonian Orthodox Church has
 led to difficulties for Serbs in FYROM to worship in their own church. On a number
 of occasions, the Government has refused Serbian Orthodox priests permission to
 enter the country, and one priest was arrested for "fomenting ethnic hatred" and
 forbidden to practice as a priest for 1 year.
 While only the Macedonian Orthodox Church is mentioned by name in the Con-
 stitution referring to the freedom of religion, it does not enjoy a special status. How-
 ever, members of other religious communities credibly charge that the Government
 actions on its behalf reflect its favored position in the country.
 All churches and religious communities may establish religious schools and social
 and philanthropic organizations, but no religious schooling is provided for in the
 law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are permitted free movement within the country as well as the
 right to leave and return The Government may restrict these rights for security,
 public health, and safety reasons but fully respects them in practice. The law on
 citizenship is highly restrictive. It requires 15 years of residence, thus denyng citi-
 zenship to some citizens of the former Yugoslavia who lived legally in FYROMat
 the time of independence. Ethnic Albanians are especially affected by this law.
 
 
 When the last old Yugoslav passports expired in 1994, those without citizenship
 were left without travel documents.
 Ethnic Albanian political leaders also charge that Ministry of Internal Affairs offi-
 cials responsible for making decisions about citizenship discriminate against ethnic
 Albanian applicants. These officials appear to be more exacting in their documen-
 tary requirements, fail to act on applications expeditiously, and reportedly demand
 bribes in return for a favorable decision.
 While FYROM accepted a number of refugees from Croatia and Bosnia at the
 start of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, it restricted entry of additional refu-
 gees in 1992 and now accepts only citizens and other former residents of FYROM
 or repatriation. The Government is concerned about the possibility of a flood of ref-
 ugees from neighboring Kosovo in the event of violence there, a possibility that
 many fear would upset the ethnic balance in FYROM and be a disastrous blow to
 its economy.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens directly elected a President for the first time in October, and at the same
 time chose a new Parliament in the second multiparty elections in the country's
 postwar history, the first since independence. Opposition groups charged the Gov-
 ernment with massive fraud and announced a boycott of the second round. Inter-
 national monitors under the auspices of the Council of Europe and the Conference
 on Security and Cdooperation in Europe (CSCE), judged the elections generally free
 and fair despite widespread irregularities attributed to careless organization.
 Ethnic minorities, including Albanians, Turks, Serbs, and Roma, have political
 parties to represent their interests. Minorities complained that the political struc-
 tures were biased against them: Albanians credibly claimed that Albanian-majority
 districts had far more voters than Macedonian ones, thus violating the "one-person,
 one-vote" principle. The ethnic Turkish and Serbian communities were disappointed
 because the previous Parliament had failed to pass a new election law providing for
 20 seats to be elected by proportional representation, thus depriving their disersed
 members from electing a candidate on an ethnic basis. Ethnic Albanians complained
 that discrimination against them in citizenship decisions effectively disfranchised a
 large portion of their community (see Section 2.d.).
 The unicameral Parliament of 120 members, elected for a 4-year term, governs
 the country. The Prime Minister is selected by the party or coalition that can
 produce a majority in Parliament and is formally appointed by the President, who
 is Head of State and commander in chief of the armedforces. Government ministers
 may not be members of Parliament (M.P.'s). Following an opposition boycott, the
 three-party ruling coalition, the Alliance for Macedonia, took 95 of the 120 par-
 liamentary seats. The Alliance formed a Government that also includes ministers
 from the ethnic Albanian PDP.
 There are no formal restrictions on the participation of women in politics and gov-
 ernment. There are 2 female ministers (out of 19) and 4 female M.P.'s (out of 120).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups and ethnic community representatives meet freely with for-
 eign representatives without government interference. Human rights groups that
 exist in the FYP.OM are conspicuous by the low level of their activity. There is no
 indication that this is the result of government hindrance of the groups. The Forum
 for Human Rights, a nongovernmental human rights group, operates freely. The
 Government does not oppose visits or investigations by international human rights
 groups. The mediator on ethnic issues of the International Conference on the
 Former Yugoslavia has visited the country frequently to discuss various issues with
 representatives of minority groups and with the Government.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution guarantees equal rights to all citizens regardless of sex, race
 color of skin, national and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property, and
 social status.
 Women.-Women have the same legal rights as men. Although Macedonian soci-
 ety, in both the Muslim and Christian communities remains traditionally patriar-
 chal and advancement of women into nontraditional roles is limited, some profes-
 sional women have achieved prominence. Women's advocacy groups include the
 Union of Macedonian Women and the League of Albanian Women in Macedonia.
 A crisis hot line for women was established in Skopje during 1994.
 
 
 890
 Children.-Limited resources constrain FYROM's strong commitment to the
 rights and welfare of its children. There is no pattern of societal abuse against chil-
 dren.
 NatonallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-A variety of national/ethnic groups, mainly
 Macedonians, Albanians, Turks, Roma, Serbs, and Vlachs comprise FYROMs popu-
 lation of 2.2 million. All citizens are equal under the law. The Constitution provides
 for the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identity of minori-
 ties, including state support for education in minority languages. The 13-member
 Council on Ethnic Relations, representing the country's main ethnic groups, has not
 played an active role.
 Ethnic tensions and prejudices are evident. The Government is committed to a
 policy of peaceful integration of all ethnic groups into society but faces political re-
 sistance and the persistence of popular preJudices in the lower levels of administra-
 tion. Moreover, the Government has had difficulty providing the additional services
 sought by minorities, such as more education in minority languages.
 Representatives of the ethnic Albanian community, by far the largest minority
 group with about 23 percent of the population, are the most vocal in charging dis-
 crimination. Expressing concern about government manipulation of the data, the
 ethnic Albanian community boycotted a 1990 census. Trats of a boycott also
 marred to some extent a census held during the summer of 1994 to correct the situ-
 ation. Experts from the Council of Europe, however, were generally satisfied that
 the Government carried out the census fairly and accurately and that almost all of
 the ethnic Albanian community took part. Final results show ethnic Albanians with
 22.9 percent of the population, Turks with 4 percent, Roma 2.3 percent, and Serbs
 2 percent. About 8,500 citizens declared themselves as Vlachs.
 Underrepresentation of ethnic Albanians in the military and police is also a prob-
 lem. Even in areas settled mostly by ethnic Albanians, only 4 percent of police per-
 sonnel are ethnic Albanians. The Ministry of Internal Affairs maintains that it is
 making efforts to recruit qualified ethnic Albanian police cadets, but ethnic Alba-
 nian leaders allege continued discrimination against those who apply. Military serv-
 ice is a universal male obligation, and most young men, whatever their ethnic ori-
 gin, serve. The proportion of ethnic Albanians in the ranks is now estimated at 25
 percent, although in the officer corps it is lower.
 Albanian-language education is a crucial issue for the ethnic Albanian community
 in order to preserve Albanian heritage and culture. Almost all ethnic Albanian chil-
 dren receive 8 years of education in Albanian-language schools. Only a third of them
 go on to high school, partly because of the lack of available classes and partly be-
 cause in rural areas many ethnic Albanians see no need to educate their children,
 especially girls, beyond the eighth grade. The right to instruction in a minority lan-
 guage in primary and secondary school is permitted by the Constitution, but, by
 law, university-level education must be in the Macedonian language. In December
 police partially demolished a small structure that was to house an Albanian-lan-
 guage university being established by ethnic Albanians in Tetovo.
 Ethnic Turks complain of governmental, societal, and cultural discrimination, spe-
 cifically their dispute over the Education Ministry's refusal to support Turkish-lan-
 guage education for children who do not speak Turkish. Parents have banded to-
 gether to hire teachers of their own, although the law does not authorize such prac-
 tice.
 Serbs also complain of discrimination, alleging censorship of the Serbian press
 and inability to worship freely in the Serbian Orthodox Church (see Section 2.c.).
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs acknowledges that it has temporarily banned some
 imported Serbian publications.
 Rema comprise about 2.3 percent of the population. There is little evident tension
 between the Roma and other communities, and they have benefited from govern-
 ment provision of supplementary Roma-language education. However, the Govern-
 ment did not publish a promised Roma grammar in 1994. There is some Roma-lan-
 guage broadcasting.
 People With Disabilities.--Social programs to meet the needs of the disabled exist
 in FYROM to the extent that government resources allow. Discrimination on the
 basis of disability is forbidden by law. There are no laws or regulations mandating
 accessibility for disabled persons. Most buildings in the FYROM are not easily ac-
 cessible to disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that citizens, except for
 military.and police personnel and civil servants, have the right to form and join
 trade unions.
 
 
 891
 The Council of Trade Unions of Macedonia (SSM) is the successor organization
 to the former Socialist Labor Confederation. It maintains the assets of the old
 unions and is the Government's main negotiating partner on labor issues. While its
 officers may tend to oppose strikes because of     a   of the past, they appear
 to be genuinely independent of the Government. An association of independent and
 autonomous unions was formed in 1992, and independent unions have been able to
 organize without harassment by the Government or SSM.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and many brief strikes occurred
 in 1994, mainly by employees of state-owned companies who were receiving their
 pay months late. Often, the ompanies, cut off by the Greek embargo from many
 foreign markets, simply did not have the money to pay their workers. Trade unions
 are free to affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively-The Constitution implicitly
 recognizes employees right to bargain collectively, but collective bargaining is still
 in its infancy. Parliament has not adopted legislation in this area. Although no law
 prohibits antiunion discrimination, no instances were reported in 1994.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Ministries of Labor and Inter-
 nal Affairs effectively enforce legal prohibitions against forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment for Children.-The constitutional minimum age
 for employment of children is 15. Younger children, however, are often seen ped-
 dling cigarettes or other small items, or working in family-owned shops or on faily
 farms. Children are permitted to work 42-hour weeks but may not legally work at
 night. Education is compulsory through the eighth grade. The Ministries of Labor
 and Internal Affairs are responsible for enforcing laws regulating the employment
 of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The average monthly wage in October was
 $200 (8,287 denars). The minimum monthly wage is, by law, two-thirds of the aver-
 age monthly wage, or about $133. The economic crisis meant that few workers could
 support a family on their wages alone.
 The official workweek is 42 hours, with a minimum 24-hour rest period and gen-
 erous vacation and sick leave benefits.
 The Constitution calls for safe working conditions, temporary disability compensa-
 tion, and leave benefits. Laws and regulations on worker safety exist, but credible
 reports suggest that the Ministry of Labor and Social Work, which is responsible
 for enforcing regulations pertaining to working conditions, does not enforce them
 strictly.
