 URUGUAY
 Uruguay has been ruled since 1973 by a collegiate military
 government composed of the President, currently a retired
 military officer. and the three service chiefs. Major
 decisions are made by the military's general officers.
 Although currently suffering a serious recession, Uruguay is
 one of the more advanced of the developing countries. Its
 economy is largely one of free enterprise capitalism, although
 the Government owns or regulates monopolies in key sectors and
 fixes many basic prices. Uruguay has had advanced social
 welfare programs and limits on the political role of the church
 since early in this century. In Uruguay's largely homogeneous
 society, there is no statutory discrimination on basis of race,
 religion or sex, and women hold high governmental positions.
 However, women workers, especially in the private sector, do
 not always receive pay equal to that of men.
 Active or retired military officers head all of Uruguay's 19
 police departments, as well as local governments in all the
 states, three cabinet ministries are headed by active or
 retired military officers, and military men hold high positions
 in all other ministries. The Government must approve elected
 officers of private organizations, and government permission is
 required to hold political meetings, except for meetings of
 elected convention delegates working on the party platform.
 Because of its continuing concern about Marxist activity, the
 Government maintains tight control over university and secondary
 education and over labor organizations. A military-controlled
 agency -- DINARP -- monitors the press.
 In the late 1960's, political malaise and economic stagnation
 contributed to the breakdown of institutions and the develop-
 ment of urban terrorism by the Marxist-oriented Tupamaros. In
 1972, an elected government passed a national security law
 which limited individual rights and expanded police and
 military powers. The Armed Forces dissolved Congress and
 assumed power in 1973, because of differences with the
 legislature over the anti-subversion campaign. From the
 beginning, however, the military have declared their intention
 to restore democratic institutions. In 1980, following popular
 rejection of a plebiscite on a government-sponsored draft
 amending the 1967 Constitution, generally perceived as a
 referendum on military rule, the Armed Forces established a
 timetable in 1981 calling for internal political-party
 elections in 1982, general elections in 1984, and the
 inauguration of the elected government in March 1985. This
 timetable has been adhered to, and the Government has often
 publicly renewed its commitment to it.
 The Uruguayan human rights record for 1983 was mixed. While
 there has been continued progress in the democratization
 process, the number of national security prisoners remains
 high, and the Government continues to close down publications
 for specified periods of time. The major positive development
 has been the continued -- although bumpy -- progress in the
 transition back to democracy. The conventions of the three
 legal parties, whose members were elected in November, 1982,
 each met several times as a body; smaller groups of politicians
 gathered frequently to work on party platforms, organizations,
 and planning. In May 1983, military men and political party
 leaders formally initiated negotiations on new constitutional
 provisions, preparatory to the 1984 general elections. Those
 formal negotiations broke down in July, primarily because of
 
 
 706
 differences between the political parties and the government
 over the role of the military in the next civilian government.
 They were succeeded by intermittent informal discussions which
 have not yet been completed. Nevertheless, military leaders
 have reiterated their commitment to return to an elected
 constitutional government in March, 1985.
 In 1983, for the first time in ten years, the Government
 allowed three major demonstrations: labor unions sponsored a
 gathering on May 1, students organized a major rally on
 September 25, and a major political rally was held on November
 27. The political parties, however, were refused permission
 for a rally they wished to sponsor on August 6.
 About 140 "national security" prisoners charged with crimes
 such as subversive activities, were released during the year.
 Several hundred people, including some leading politicians,
 were temporarily detained. In September, a member of the
 Blanco political party's 15 person national directorate was
 detained for five days and proscribed from political activity
 for two years. However, in November, proscriptions were lifted
 for him and 25 other politicians, including Colorado Party
 leader Jorge Batlle. In December, a Colorado Party National
 Directorate member was arrested and held until January 1984, on
 a charge of slander of the Armed Forces. The most active
 Uruguayan human rights organization, "Servicio Paz y Justicia"
 (SERPAJ), charged that several youths arrested in June were
 tortured.  (SERPAJ itself was proscribed by the Government in
 August.) After a hiatus of over two years, the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was allowed to resume visits
 to national security prisoners in Uruguay, making two visits in
 1983.
 The press greatly expanded the scope of political reporting and
 commentary in the first half of 1983 but suffered new
 restrictions under a decree announced on August 2. Seven
 periodicals were temporarily closed, and two others shut down
 permanently. Starting December 17, the Government began
 requiring review of weekly publications before their
 distribution. If the Government objects to any articles, the
 issue is cancelled and the weekly absorbs the printing costs.
 The total number of "national security" prisoners dropped from
 958 in October 1982, to 843 on October 1, 1983.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1  Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There is no indication that any killings for political reasons
 occurred in Uruguay in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearances in Uruguay in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 An Uruguayan human rights group, "Servicio Paz y Justicia"
 (SERPAJ), alleged that several youths arrested in June were
 
 
 707
 tortured. SERPAJ claimed to have obtained written testimony
 from relatives of the detainees, attesting that several of the
 women prisoners were raped by guards and that one male prisoner
 received such severe electrical shocks that he was hospital-
 ized. They add that several of the prisoners were hung by
 their wrists, naked, in an outdoor courtyard during cold winter
 nights. These allegations have not been independently
 verified, and the Government has not responded publicly to
 these charges.
 Some groups have claimed that prison conditions have deterio-
 rated, but such charges diminished after the International
 Committee of the Red Cross began its visits in May. According
 to the Government, treatment of prisoners is firm, but the
 physical and psychological integrity of the prisoner is
 respected. The Government adds that it provides the same
 quality of medical care to prisoners as is provided for members
 of the Armed Forces. Upon release, however, prisoners are
 generally required to reimburse the state for at least part of
 the cost of their detention, unless they can prove inability to
 pay.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In 1983. over 500 persons were detained, at least briefly, for
 non-violent expressions of opinion during numerous illegal
 anti-government demonstrations. Most of those detained were
 released within hours. Twenty-five young people were arrested
 in June and brought to trial for membership in the outlawed
 Communist Party. A convention delegate from the legal Blanco
 Party was detained for several days twice during the year and a
 rancher was held for several weeks for criticizing the govern-
 ment. Another Blanco activist was detained for two weeks in
 November for undisclosed reasons under "emergency security
 measures." The secretary of a leader of the Colorado Party, a
 second major legal political party, was detained for about 16
 hours and questioned about the activities of her employer.
 Additionally, an elected member of the Blanco Party directorate
 was detained for five days on charges that he had distributed
 leaflets calling for a peaceful "lights-out and pot-banging
 demonstration." A Colorado Party National Directorate member
 arrested in December remained in jail until January 9, accused
 of public slander of the Armed Forces. Charges against him
 have not been dropped.
 Individuals arrested under the civilian or ordinary penal code
 are normally brought before a civilian judge within 48 hours
 and allowed access to a defense lawyer at that time. But
 "national security" prisoners are normally dealt with in the
 military legal system, where they are not granted such rights.
 In cases where the Government determines that "emergency
 security measures" are necessary, a decree signed by the
 President and the Ministers of Defense and Interior may be
 issued to hold detainees for extended periods of time. Some of
 these prisoners are sometimes held for days or even weeks
 before defense lawyers or relatives are notified or granted
 access to them. One "national security" prisoner, who had
 completed his sentence in 1981, was held until September 1983,
 when he was released to go into exile. Others are released
 before formal legal proceedings are begun.
 
 
 708
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Independence of the judiciary was formally restored in 1981,
 but the full independence of the civilian judiciary has not
 been re-established. Under Uruguay's legal tradition, both the
 civil and military judiciarfes primarily use written procedures
 which are usually closed to the public. Juries are not used;
 the judge makes a decision based on written summaries and the
 declaration of the accused and the witnesses. The defendant in
 a civilian or military court may employ a lawyer of his own
 choosing or use a lawyer provided by the government.
 An individual accused of subversive activities is subject to
 trial under the military justice system. The
 Government-provided lawyer for the defendant is often a
 military officer, as is the judge. During his appearance
 before the judge, the defendant has an opportunity to denounce
 any mistreatment by authorities; but some Uruguayan lawyers
 allege that there are few such denunciations because the
 defendant is returned to the custody of the same police or
 military unit which he may have accused of mistreating him.
 Legal proceedings were begun in 1983 against about 25 persons
 arrested for subversive activities. About 140 such prisoners
 were released during the first nine months of the year, after
 serving part or all of their sentences. On October 1, the
 number of "national security" prisoners was 843, down from 958
 a year earlier. About 300 of these prisoners have been
 convicted of violent crimes, including murder, kidnapping,
 armed robbery, etc., while many others were convicted of member-
 ship in organizations advocating the violent overthrow of the
 Government. In May 1983, a new law was enacted liberalizing
 the rules for early release or parole which could eventually
 advance the release of up to two hundred prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government, as a rule, does not interfere in the private
 lives of its citizens but has done so in the case of opposition
 leaders and persons suspected of subversion. It is widely
 assumed that telephones of some political leaders, and perhaps
 other persons, are "tapped" by authorities. There are also
 reports that some correspondence is subject to monitoring.
 Guarantees of inviolability of the home are respected in
 non-security cases but are suspended under the interim security
 measures for persons suspected of terrorism, subversion, or
 other national security violations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The information media are restricted in Uruguay. During 1983,
 there were nine closures of the press and other forms of
 harassment. On many occasions, editors and publishers have
 been summoned by the Government for warnings, including
 lengthy, middle-of-the-night sessions. The Government's press
 and public relations office (DINARP), run by military officers,
 frequently advises media elements not to discuss certain
 topics. As a result, journalists generally avoid publishing
 articles which might provoke the authorities. Guidelines on
 what can be published have not been made public, and many
 journalists regard the system as arbitrary. Some highly
 
 
 709
 critical articles have brought no response, while less critical
 stories have resulted in closure of a publication. The
 Government, however, claims that it does not interfere with the
 press except to control political information which could cause
 disturbances in the population.
 The uneven application of vague guidelines has resulted in
 occasional periods of increased freedom and other periods of
 increased restriction. On August 2, after several months in
 which weeklies controlled by the political parties had grown
 increasingly bold, the Government decreed that "all political
 activities of a public nature are temporarily suspended and the
 dissemination, through the media, of all types of news reports,
 commentaries or recordings which, directly or indirectly, refer
 to such political activities, is prohibited." During the
 following months, reporting of internal political developments
 was much more limited, and direct criticism of the Government
 was rarely attempted. In 1983, the Government's reaction to
 perceived violations of the guidelines resulted in the closure
 of nine publications -- two permanently, one for six months,
 and five others for four to twelve weeks, and a daily for three
 issues. One journalist was prohibited from writing in the
 local press, and others were barred from covering events in the
 Presidential Palace. Several journalists from the electronic
 media were prohibited from interviewing ranking government
 officials.  In addition to reports on political events, the
 Government has reacted by banning publications for publishing
 such items as the following: an article on economics by a
 proscribed politician; a photograph of a proscribed politician;
 coverage of a neighborhood demonstration against high prices;
 coverage of pollution of the city beaches; and complaints about
 the upkeep of a soccer stadium in a small town in the
 interior. On December 17, the Government closed down a radio
 station for 30 days for broadcasting the Blanco and Colorado
 party conventions. That same day, the Government imposed new
 restrictions on political party weeklies by requiring that
 entire press runs be printed before copies are studied for
 possible censorship. If the Government objects to any
 articles, the issue is cancelled and the weekly must absorb the
 printing costs.
 While many foreign publications circulate in Uruguay, issues
 with articles critical of the country have been prohibited from
 entering the country. The Government has prohibited books by
 alleged Marxists and in years past have expelled alleged
 Marxists from teaching positions and other government employ-
 ment. The Ministry of Education appoints the university rector
 and approves course material at all levels. Provincial
 governors (mostly military men) and local police chiefs in
 isolated areas in the interior of the country, enjoy consider-
 able leeway in the application of restrictions on the media in
 their areas; a police chief in Minas banned the Tennessee
 Williams play "The Glass Menagerie." Several actors and other
 performers have been prohibited from exercising their
 professions in Uruguay.
 It is widely assumed that the Government maintains surveillance
 of political gatherings, particularly the party conventions. A
 convention delegate was arrested for criticisms he made of the
 local government during a regional party convention.
 
 
 710
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the rights of freedom of assembly and association
 remain restricted, these were expanded over the previous year.
 Only three political parties are legal in Uruguay: the Blanco,
 the Colorado, and the Civic Union. Parties which are specifi-
 cally proscribed include the Christian Democratic, Socialist,
 and Communist. Members of the Communist Party are subject to
 arrest. For the first time since the military take-over in
 1973, the conventions of each of the legal political parties
 met on several occasions during 1983. Smaller groups of party
 officials, including the elected Executive Committees, also
 convened regularly to discuss party strategy and platforms. In
 its August 2 decree, the Government extended its restriction
 against the right of peaceful assembly by prohibiting the
 parties from organizing any public activities, other than
 gatherings specifically related to the preparation of party
 platforms. Although the Government did not allow the legal
 parties to hold a combined public rally on August 6, it did
 authorize a major political rally sponsored by the parties on
 November 27.
 Uruguayan law permits the formation of unions, federations, and
 confederations. In practice, the Government has allowed only
 the formation of provisional worker associations which function
 as unions but are not recognized formally as such. Several
 informal -- but not legally recognized -- confederations exist,
 and one, the Workers Interunion Plenarium (PIT), organized a
 May 1 rally which was authorized by the Government. With no
 right to strike, the influence of the unions is extremely
 limited. They are currently organizing in preparation for the
 return to democratic government in 1985. While the PIT has
 functioned principally as a labor organization, it has also
 been active in pursuing political objectives. The PIT and
 several other confederations maintain relations with inter-
 national bodies, including the International Labor Organization.
 Students are prohibited from forming unions or other organiza-
 tions. However, a student cultural organization, Asociacion
 Cultural de Estudiantes de Educacion Publics or Cultural
 Association of Students of Public Education, founded in 1982
 but never legally recognized, became increasingly active in
 1983. The Association organized a week-of-the-student that
 included many cultural and educational activities and
 culminated in a public march and gathering authorized by the
 Government. Although the objectives as well as the slogans of
 the Association have clear political content, it has not been
 singled out for persecution.
 There are many private associations, especially professional
 associations. The Electoral Court supervises the election of
 officials in such associations, and the Government has, on
 occasion, prevented certain individuals from running for
 office. Any public gathering requires Government authoriza-
 tion. In 1983, the Government usually, although not always,
 granted permission for meetings of professional associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is constitutionally guaranteed and respected
 in Uruguay. The Korean-origin Unification Church has been
 
 
 711
 allowed to register and operate despite opposition from certain
 critical elements.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on internal travel, although recently-
 released national security prisoners are required to report to
 authorities every 15 days. Some individuals who were unable to
 obtain passports attributed this to their leftist political
 affiliations. Several of these individuals, convinced that
 they would not be given passports and weary of waiting, left
 illegally and face possible arrest upon their return. Under
 executive-ordered arrests, the detainee has the constitutional
 right to choose exile, rather than continued detention, but
 this right is granted on a very selective basis.* Several
 persons, one a non-Uruguayan, made use of that provision in
 1983. A minority of the several hundred thousand Uruguayans
 living abroad left for political reasons and some would
 probably face arrest for alleged involvement with subversive
 organizations if they were to return. Others, including Blanco
 Party leader Wilson Ferreira, actually face orders for their
 arrest, if they return.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 While Uruguayans are not currently able to vote for a change of
 government, democratic elections for a constitutional govern-
 ment are scheduled for November 1984. The military have held
 effective power in Uruguay since 1973. Executive power is
 vested in the President, who is currently a retired General,
 and in the three service Commanders-in-Chief. The President is
 chosen by the Council of the Nation, formed by the Board of
 Generals and the Council of State, or legislative body.
 However, the influence of the Council of State is limited.
 Since it first assumed power, the military has declared itself
 to be a transitional government. In 1981, the Armed Forces
 established a timetable for a return to democracy, including
 internal political party elections in November 1982, general
 elections in November 1984 (possibly preceded by a constitu-
 tional plebiscite), and inauguration of an elected government
 in March 1985. Military spokesmen have often reiterated their
 commitment to that timetable and so far have adhered to it.
 Three political parties are authorized, the Blanco, Colorado,
 and Civic Union. The Blancos and Colorados are coalitions,
 representing a broad range of social and political interests.
 In previous elections, these parties together have tradition-
 ally won over 90 percent of the vote, although in the last
 presidential elections, in 1971, the percentage fell to 82
 percent. Within those parties, factions expressing strong
 opposition to the military government won over two-thirds of
 the vote in the 1982 internal party elections. With convention
 delegates and party leaders elected proportionally, the parties
 are thus dominated by anti-government majorities.
 Under the blanket provisions of an institutional act decreed in
 1976, over ten thousand Uruguayans remain proscribed from
 political activity. Most of these are current or past
 "national security" prisoners or past candidates for electoral
 offices from Marxist or Marxist-affiliated parties. Many
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 46
 
 
 712
 politicians from the traditional parties were proscribed in
 1976, and a new institutional act, decreed on August 2, 1983,
 provided for proscription of additional politicians whose
 "conduct, actions or omissions disturb the public tranquility
 and order." Proscriptions on all but 25 politicians from the
 traditional parties were lifted in 1981, and on November 12,
 1983, the Government lifted the proscription on all but one of
 those remaining.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The human rights situation in Uruguay is on the agenda of the
 United Nations Human Rights Committee and of the Organization
 of American States. The Uruguayan Government has established
 an office of human rights in the Foreign Ministry to deal with
 these organizations. The Government has also received official
 visitors interested in human rights, including a special
 representative of the U.N. Secretary-General who, in recent
 years visited prisoners; his reports are confidential. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) resumed visits
 to Uruguayan prisons in 1983 for the first time since 1980. In
 May 1983, the ICRC gave private interviews and medical
 examinations to "national security" prisoners in Uruguay and
 visited again later in the year.
 The Government criticizes Amnesty International for being
 consistently hostile and partial to the extreme left. Other
 non-government organizations and some foreign journalists have
 been refused interviews with top government officials,
 reflecting the military's conviction that the reporters are
 biased against them. Few such investigators, however, are
 prohibited from entering the country and meeting with private
 citizens, including opposition figures.
 In May 1983, representatives of the U.S. Committee to Protect
 Journalists and Pen American Center, visited Uruguay to
 investigate freedom of the press. Their report detailed
 government actions and restrictions against the press during
 the previous months.
 Local human rights groups in Uruguay include the "Servicio Paz
 y Justicia" (SERPAJ), the Uruguayan Human Rights Committee, and
 the Human Rights Committee of the Colorado Party. SERPAJ,
 which included several Catholic and Methodist churchmen along
 with lay people, worked closely with relatives of prisoners.
 In July, SERPAJ publicly alleged torture of some young people
 arrested in June. In August, three SERPAJ leaders held a
 two-week fast, leading up to a day of "national reflection,"
 coinciding with a day of protest called by the political
 parties. On August 31, the Government proscribed SERPAJ,
 claiming that it was promoting political objectives and
 attempting to incite the public against the authorities. It
 asserted that one of the SERPAJ leaders had previously been
 imprisoned for his connection with the Tupamaro guerilla
 movement. The Uruguayan Human Rights Committee, which formed
 in August, is composed largely of distinguished citizens,
 including many lawyers and ex-government officials, mostly from
 the traditional political parties. This committee has become
 increasingly active in the final months of 1983. The human
 rights committee of the Colorado party is mainly dedicated to
 preparing relevant parts of the party platform, although it
 
 
 713
 also has listened to complaints about current problems, and
 some members have made attempts to intercede with the
 Government on certain cases--to no apparent avail. Local human
 rights groups have had little effect, although SERPAJ has
 raised public consciousness about human rights issues, paving
 the way for the formation 6f the other groups in 1983. Amnesty
 International, in its 1983 report, expressed concern about "the
 large number of prisoners of conscience." Freedom House in
 1983 described Uruguay as "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Uruguay's 1982 per capita gross domestic product of $3,417 was
 lower than in the previous two years. The incidence of extreme
 poverty is low, although it has increased over the past year;
 the vast majority of the population enjoys an adequate diet and
 at least minimal standards of living. Uruguay had a population
 of 2.9 million in 1983 and an annual population growth rate of
 only .3 percent.
 Life expectancy at birth was 70.7 years in 1980, infant
 mortality was 27.6 per 1,000 live births in 1981. In 1975, 84
 percent of the population had access to safe water. Health
 care is free to the poor and available at nominal cost to
 others. The caloric supply available for consumption in 1977
 in.Uruguay was 104.7 percent of nutritional requirements.
 Uruguay had a 94 percent literacy rate in 1975 and virtually
 all children receive a primary school education. The adjusted
 primary school enrollment ratio was 105 in 1979. Secondary
 school attendance is relatively high, and university education
 is free. Male students outnumber females in higher education
 by a small margin. There is no variation by sex at the primary
 and secondary level.
 Women in Uruguay are accorded equality before the law. They
 attend the National University and pursue professional careers
 in large numbers. The cabinet included one female minister,
 until she was replaced in mid-December, and another woman
 serves on the Supreme Court of Justice. However, pay is not
 always equal for women and men, especially for ordinary workers
 in the private sector. There are few women in important
 positions in both major parties, and a recent proposal to
 require 15 percent representation for women has made little
 progress. There are also some barriers to equality stemming
 from traditional social patterns and from restricted employment
 opportunities.
 For half a century, social welfare and wider income distribu-
 tion were prime objectives of economic policy. Income in the
 postwar period was as evenly spread in Uruguay as in Western
 Europe. However, the country's economic policies were not
 successful in stimulating economic growth. Output stagnated in
 the period 1955-74 while inflation soared. After 1974, under
 new policies, the economy grew significantly until 1981.
 However, during 1982, the economy shrank 9.5 percent, and has
 declined still further in 1983. Although the rate of price
 change declined to 20 percent in 1982, it is expected to reach
 over 50 percent in 1983. Unemployment has increased from less
 than six percent in 1981 to an officially estimated 15 percent
 currently -- which does not take account of shorter working
 hours and increased underemployment. The index of real wages
 is currently about 45 percent below what it was ten years ago.
