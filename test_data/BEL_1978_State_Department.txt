 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a con-
 stitutional monarch. Although the King (Chief of
 State) is technically the source of all executive
 authority, the Council of Ministers (cabinet) is
 actually responsible for governmental decisions. The
 Council of Ministers, led by the Prime Minister (Head
 of Government), holds office as long as it retains the
 confidence of the Parliament. Elections are held at
 least every four years by universal suffrage with
 obligatory voting and a form of proportionate repre-
 sentation.
 The bicameral Parliament consists of a Senate and
 a Chamber of Representatives. Of the 181 Senators, 50
 are elected by Provincial Councils, 25 by fellow Sena-
 tors and the remainder are elected directly.
 Belgium is scrupulous in observing internationally
 recognized human rights. It has a long tradition of
 respect for human rights.

 e. Invasion of the Home

 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Belgium continues to enjoy one of the highest per
 capita incomes in the world ($6,900) and is one of the
 most affluent countries in Europe. The Government is
 committed to policies ensuring that these benefits are
 distributed equitably throughout the economy. As a
 result, the Government pursues a generous wage and
 social benefit policy.
 There is a relative absence of class distinction. A
 common educational system serves all economic levels.
 Belgium's tax system redounds to the advantage of the
 relatively poorer classes. Women are highly regarded
 in Belgium and many have positions of distinction,
 power and importance in the fields of politics, busi-
 ness, diplomacy, science, medicine and the arts, to
 name but a few. Belgium for years has had a problem
 caused by linguistic division. The North is largely
 Dutch-speaking and the South, French-speaking, with
 Brussels a-bilingual island. A long-term solution to
 the problems caused by the language difference is the
 priority goal of the Government.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic
 fashion. Labor is well-developed.
 4. Government Attitgde and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Belgian Government's willingness and past record
 regarding independent, outside investigation of
 alleged human rights violations is exemplary. Speci-
 fically, the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in
 January, 1977 circulated in the United Nations a pro-
 posal that countries should waive voluntarily the
 right, conferred on them by Article 6(b) of Resolution
 1503, not to consent to the carrying out of an investi-
 gation concerning human rights. No requests have been
 made for outside investigation of the human rights
 situation in Belgium.
