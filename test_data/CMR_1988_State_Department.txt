 CAMEROON
 Political power in Cameroon is heavily concentrated in the
 Presidency. The President appoints all government and party
 officials and makes all major decisions, although key
 parliamentarians in the National Assembly and others have
 behind-the-scenes influence. Cameroon had an active
 multiparty system when it became independent. Under former
 President Ahidjo, all parties were gradually consolidated into
 the Cameroon National Union, which was renamed in 1985 under
 President Paul Biya the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement
 (CPDM). Cameroon's political system is a product of the
 country's ethnic and linguistic diversity, which includes 230
 languages and 3 separate European traditions (French, British,
 and German). Both French and English are official languages,
 although English-speakers (Anglophones) allege political
 discriminatiQn by the majority French-speakers
 (Francophones). A careful balancing act, within the party, is
 required to maintain political cohesion.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the National
 Police (Surete National), the National Intelligence Service
 (Centre National pour les Etudes et Recherche, CENER), the
 Ministry of Territorial Administration, Military Intelligence,
 and, to a lesser extent, the Presidential Security Service.
 The Ministry of Territorial Administration is in charge of
 prisons, and the National Police has the dominant role in
 enforcing internal security laws.
 Cameroon's economy remains relatively strong, with a per
 capita gross domestic product of about $1,200 (1987) that
 places Cameroon among the middle-income developing countries.
 Nonetheless, it remains plagued by many problems of
 underdevelopment, and its economy declined in 1988 as revenues
 from oil, coffee, cocoa, and other raw material exports
 declined trom previous years. Cameroon's diversified
 agricultural base and the Government's conservative economic
 policies help mitigate the effects of declining terms of trade
 and other external difficulties.
 President Biya, who has held office since 1982, has advocated
 greater "democratization" within Cameroon, and modest steps
 were taken in 1987 local and 1988 national elections to expand
 Oolitical participation. Nevertheless, one-party control
 remains firmly in place, and there was only a single candidate
 in the 1988 presidential elections. Moreover, the
 Government's human rights record continues to be marked by
 harassment and arbitrary detention of journalists who write
 articles critical of the Government and of those who speak out
 publicly against the Government. By most estimates, 10 to 20
 political detainees remain in custody from the arrests that
 followed the attempted coup in 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 
 
 43
 CAMEROON
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is proscribed by the criminal code, which renders
 evidence obtained by torture inadmissible in court. In
 addition, the penal code prohibits public servants from using
 force against any person. Nevertheless, there were credible
 reports of severe beatings of suspects while in custody in
 1988. Poor prison conditions, including inadequate food,
 sanitation, and medical care, remain problems. Prisoners
 reportedly have suffered from severe malnutrition unless
 provided food by friends or families. An American citizen who
 was detained for 26 hours in 1988 was not fed at all nor
 provided any toilet facilities during his detention. Persons
 under "administrative detention" (i.e., political detainees)
 are kept in special camps or prisons to which access by
 families and friends is severely restricted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Cameroonian law, a person arrested on suspicion of
 committing a nonpolitical offense may not be held more than 48
 hours without a court order. However, after an investigating
 magistrate has determined that the case should be brought to
 trial and has issued a warrant to that effect, there is no
 limitation on how long the detainee may be held in "preventive
 detention" pending trial. Accused persons awaiting trial
 constitute the majority of persons in the prisons at Yaounde
 and Douala. Release on bail is permitted by law only in the
 Anglophone provinces, whose legal system retains features from
 the era of British rule. Even there bail is granted only
 infrequently. There have been cases of local or provincial
 authorities ordering the continued detention of individuals
 because of personal disputes even after a court ordered their
 release. The National Intelligence Service, CENER, does not
 respect fully the penal code requirement that detainees be
 brought before a magistrate for investigation of possible
 offenses and holds detainees incommunicado. In 1988
 Cameroonian immigration officials detained an American citizen
 for 26 hours without explanation and repeatedly denied him
 permission to notify the U.S. Embassy of his detention.
 Persons may also be held in administrative detention under
 legislation pertaining to subversion. The penal code defines
 detention as the "loss of liberty for a political felony or
 misdemeanor." Such detention by regional authorities is
 initially for 1 month, renewable twice, and may be extended up
 to an additional 6 months by the Minister of Territorial
 Administration. Those arrested and placed in administrative
 detention do not disappear--their families are told where they
 are, although not always promptly--and they are released
 eventually, although the detention may be lengthy. Under
 state of emergency provisions, invoked following the 1984 coup
 attempt and still in force in three western provinces,
 authorities may order detention for up to 1 week for persons
 judged "dangerous to public security." The Minister of
 Territorial Administration may also order detention of such
 persons for up to 2 months. The order is renewable without
 limitation. The state of emergency provisions reportedly were
 used in 1988 on one occasion in the West Province.
 By year's end, Albert Mukong, writer and well-known critic of
 the Government, had been held without charge since mid-June
 for publicly criticizing the lack of choice in Cameroon's
 elections. The legal justification for his continued
 
 
 44
 CAMEROON
 detention was unclear. An estimated 10 to 20 political
 detainees, most of whom were apprehended around the time of
 the 1984 coup attempt, remained in administrative detention at
 the end of 1988.
 Local police occasionally harass citizens and threaten to
 detain them unless bribes are paid. While these actions are
 not condoned by high government officials and have been
 criticized sharply by the President, the problem appeared to
 increase during the year. In mid-1988, the Secretary of State
 for Internal Security publicly reminded police of their duty
 to enforce the law fairly and of the unacceptability of
 corruption. Small numbers of low-ranking police officials are
 regularly dismissed for corruption.
 While certain political figures remain outside the country,
 Cameroon does not engage in the practice of forced exile.
 Early in his first term, President Biya publicly encouraged
 all those living abroad for political reasons to return to
 Cameroon without fear of reprisal. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Trial
 Trial by a presiding magistrate is guaranteed by law, and this
 practice is followed with the exceptiQn of persons held under
 administrative detention or state of emergency regulations.
 Public trials are also guaranteed by law, although exceptions
 are allowed for the public good or for national security
 reasons. Trials which involve prominent persons or which are
 controversial have sometimes been held in private.
 Magistrates in Cameroon are career civil servants responsible
 to the Minister of Justice and are required to have law
 degrees. Their decisions are usually not subject to
 government interference, and they generally are considered to
 conduct fair trials. There was an instance in 1987, in which
 a magistrate was apparently the object of a retaliatory
 transfer after rendering a civil judgment against the
 Government. The Minister of Justice has publicly cautioned
 magistrates from awarding "excessive" damages against the
 State, and there have been reported cases of refusal of the
 Government to pay damages even where a court has found against
 it. Defendants in felony cases are provided attorneys if they
 cannot afford to engage their own.
 Crimes involving subversion or illegal use of weapons, as well
 as crimes involving the military, are tried by military
 tribunal. Each tribunal has three members, and its presiding
 officer must be a.magistrate. In some cases, the magistrate
 is a civilian, but often he is a military officer. As in
 felony cases tried in the regular court system, defendants are
 entitled to either public or private counsel.
 Amnesty International's (AI) 1988 report states that a number
 of persons convicted in connection with the 1984 coup attempt
 were tried by military courts which did not conform to
 internationally recognized standards of fairness. The trials
 were secret, lawyers were given little time to prepare a
 defense, and defendants had no right of appeal. In 1988 there
 was concern that some who had been acquitted during those
 trials, and others who had completed their sentences, had not
 been released from prison. The Government did not respond to
 repeated inquiries about these concerns.
 
 
 CAMEROON
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence
 are violations of Cameroonian law. There are reports that
 police enter homes without warrants during periodic searches*
 for criminals in low-income neighborhoods. Police officials
 also sometimes enter homes and demand to see receipts 'for
 household property as a customs law enforcement measure.
 Surveillance of suspected political dissidents and the
 monitoring of mail and of telephone conversations are common.
 Membership in the nation's sole legal political party, the
 CPDM, is encouraged and is open to all, but membership is
 voluntary.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution of 1972 provides for the freedom of
 expression and press, but under Cameroonian law and practice
 these freedoms are restricted. There is no evidence that
 anyone is punished for privately criticizing the Government.
 Public criticism, on the other hand, invites imprisonment, as.
 in the case of Albert Mukong, who was jailed without trial in
 mid-1988 for having been critical of Cameroon's elections
 during a British Broadcasting Corporation radio interview in
 London. A singer, Koko Ateba, was jailed until late 1988
 after singing a song deemed insulting to the presidential
 couple at the inaugural ball in May. The Government took
 harsh action against several independent journalists in
 March. Two journalists were jailed for 4 months for writing
 an article critical of the visiting former French President
 Giscard d'Estaing. Three other newspaper journalists were
 detained for several weeks in connection with articles
 concerning a police criminal investigation.
 The Government publishes two official newspapers, French and
 English editions of the Cameroon Tribune, and controls
 television and radio. The Government censors stories that it
 finds objectionable. The English edition of the Cameroon
 Tribune was seized on March 25, 1988, because it reported the
 resignation of the Speaker of the Cameroonian National
 Assembly. It appeared 9 hours later, with a half-page
 advertisement on the front page in place of the article.
 Official journalists, bound by rules governing the behavior of
 civil servants, enjoy much less latitude with respect to
 editorial comment than do their private counterparts. Most
 official journalists are civil servants who may be transferred
 to less desirable jobs if they do not censor their own
 reporting.
 The 1988 dismissal of the Director General of the Cambroonian
 Radio and Television Corporation was caused in part by the
 broadcasting of a story on poor housing conditions for
 university students. This has led to concern that television
 journalists no longer have the leeway they hag in the past to
 monitor sensitive social issues and governmental corruption.
 The number of private publications diminished somewhat-during
 1988, but close to 15 newspapers publish on a regular   �
 schedule. No written ground rules exist, and the private
 press must submit each issue to censors. Issues bf
 foreign-printed periodicals and books have been seized because
 
 
 CAMEROON
 they contained articles about Cameroon which the Government
 considered inflammatory or defamatory.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedoms of assembly and association, while provided for
 in the Constitution, are restricted in practice and in law.
 The Cameroonian penal code prohibits public meetings,
 demonstrations, or processions without prior government
 approval, and organizations must register with the
 Government. While there have been no reports that such
 permits have been denied, large public meetings in which the
 Government does not play a role are virtually unknown.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Cameroon is a secular state; there is no established
 religion. Roughly 20 percent of Cameroonians are Muslim, 30
 percent Christian, and the rest animist. Officials of the
 Government and party are drawn from members of all
 denominations. Freedom of religion is provided for in the
 Constitution, but is limited with respect to a few smaller
 sects. In order for a religious group to exist and function
 legally, it must be approved and registered with the Ministry
 of Territorial Administration. The Ministry on at least one
 occasion rejected an application from a small religious group
 on the ground that it was too nearly identical to an existing
 group.
 The Jehovah's Witnesses were banned in 1970 and periodically
 have been targets of harassment since then. In the most
 recent known incident, a Jehovah's Witness, Augustine Kong,
 was sentenced to 2 years in prison in 1987 in an illegal
 border crossing case. According to AI's 1988 report, the
 organization has been pressing the Government to release Kong.
 Observance of traditional religions is not discouraged by the
 Government, although acts of witchcraft, magic, or divination
 "liable to disrupt public order or tranquility, or to harm
 persons or property" are outlawed, with potential penalties of
 up to 10 years' imprisonment.
 Missionaries played a major role in the development of
 Cameroon and continue to be active. Foreign clergy suffer no
 ill-treatment. There are no particular restrictions on places
 of worship, training of clergy, conversion, religious
 education, or religious participation in charitable
 activities. Independent Muslim and Christian publications
 exist in Cameroon, and there is no evidence that they are
 censored more heavily than the secular press. The exception,
 again, is the Jehovah's Witnesses, who are not allowed to
 publish or distribute their religious materials.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by
 law. In practice, police frequently stop travelers to check
 identification documents as a security and immigration control
 measure. Exit visas are required to leave the country and
 sometimes are obtainable only after long bureaucratic delays.
 These delays may represent attempts by the Government to
 
 
 47
 CA4EROON
 discourage or even prevent departure; or attempts by officials
 to solicit bribes. The Government has also been known to
 refuse issuance of a passport, or to confiscate an already
 issued passport, in order to prevent someone from traveling
 abroad. Cameroonians who leave the country must deposit sums
 sufficient to buy a return air ticket for repatriation should
 they become stranded abroad. There are no restrictions on
 voluntary repatriation, nor is there any forced resettlement.
 Married women and children are required to obtain the
 permission of their husbands/fathers to obtain an exit visa.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safehaven for
 thousands of displaced persons and refugees. The Government
 currently acknowledges the presence in Cameroon of
 approximately 50,000 Chadians, some 5,000 of whom have been
 recognized by the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) as political refugees and permitted to live
 at the UNHCR camp at Poli. Many of the remaining Chadians
 have integrated into the Cameroonian economy and do not
 receive government or international assistance. Cameroon
 returns illegal Chadian immigrants to Chad from time to time,
 but there have been no confirmed reports of forced
 repatriations of recognized Chadian refugees. Cameroon is
 also host to refugees from South Africa, Zaire, Angola, and
 other African nations, and there are roughly 100 Namibians in
 Cameroon as students.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As Cameroon continues to be a one-party state with political
 power and administrative responsibility concentrated in the
 Presidency, citizens do not have the right to change the party
 in power through the electoral process. The President
 appoints all governors, prefects, and cabinet ministers.
 Former President Ahidjo resigned in 1982 and was followed in
 office by his constitutional successor, the then Prime
 Minister, Paul Biya. President Biya received his own mandate
 in a single-candidate election in 1984, and subsequently
 withstood a coup attempt by forces linked to Ahidjo. In March
 1988, the National Assembly unexpectedly approved without
 debate several government-proposed laws and constitutional
 amendments authorizing the President to shorten his term and
 call for a presidential election. One month later, President
 Biya again ran unopposed for a new 5-year term and received 98
 percent of the vote.
 While the Constitution implies the legality of other political
 parties, in fact, only the CPDM party is permitted.
 Membership in the CPDM is open to all religious and ethnic
 groups. No one attempted to gain legal recognition for a
 second political party in 1988, although critics of the
 Government decried the lack of any meaningful choice. The
 election law also theoretically permits multiple candidates
 for the Presidency, but alternate candidates from within the
 CPDM were discouraged in 1988 from seeking signatures on
 nominating petitions.
 All members of the 180-seat National Assembly must be members
 of the CPDM. Candidates were screened by the party, but,
 National Assembly elections with multiple candidacies were
 held for the first time in 1988. The impact of this step
 toward opening up the political process was reduced when the
 CPDM, apparently fearing an exacerbation of political and
 ethnic rivalries, limited the number of candidates in these
 
 
 48
 CAMEROON
 elections to no more than two candidates per Assembly seat.
 In many districts, there was only one candidate per seat. The
 electoral outcome did produce a new National Assembly with
 about 120 first-time legislators. The next legislative
 elections are due in April 1993. Balloting is secret. In the
 1988 elections, there were few irregularities at the polls and
 no accusations of election fraud.
 The significance of the nationwide 1987 multicandidate
 municipal elections--also a first in Cameroon history--was
 reduced when the CPDM issued a list of those persons it
 expected to see elected as mayors from among the newly elected
 municipal councillors.
 A number of women are quite active in political life both
 within and outside the women's wing of the CPDM. Many women
 ran for offices in various elections, and two currently serve
 as ministers. About 14 per cent of the newly elected National
 Assembly consists of women. There are no female governors or
 prefects.
 Dissident groups, including the Union des Populations du
 Cameroun (UPC, which has been banned since the early 1960's)
 and the Cameroon Democratic Party, periodically send letters
 or pamphlets into the country (usually seized by customs
 officials), or are heard on foreign radio broadcasts. These
 groups seem to have few adherents in Cameroon. A number of
 former UPC members are now active in the CPDM.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not respond publicly or privately to
 inquiries from any human rights organizations, including from
 AI. The Constitution affirms support for the freedoms
 guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
 the United Nations Charter. Under President Biya, the
 Government has given increased attention to human rights
 issues, e.g., in public statements in forums such as the
 United Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all
 Cameroonian citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis. President
 Biya often has taken a strong public stand against the dangers
 of tribalism, but there remains deep-seated suspicion among
 ethnic groups. The split between Francophones and Anglophones
 has served, in some measure, to emphasize ethnic differences.
 Anglophones are a distinct minority, representing only about
 20 percent of the population, and charge discrimination by the
 Francophone majority. For example, Francophones need not have
 passed English for admission to the university, but
 Anglophones must have passed French.
 Girls made up 45.5 percent of elementary students in 1984-85,
 the last year for which statistics are available. Women are
 underprivileged in access to both higher education and
 professional opportunities. Girls from the southern part of
 the country, although disadvantaged at the secondary education
 level when compared with boys from the same areas, have a
 considerable educational lead over girls and boys from the
 Eastern and Northern Provinces. One of the goals of the sixth
 
 
 CAMEROON
 5-year plan for economic, social, and cultural development is
 to improve educational opportunities for women.
 Women enjoy equal rights under the Constitution and are
 politically active in the party and the sole labor union. The
 women's wing of the party has developed programs aimed at
 encouraging the economic and social productivity of
 Cameroonian women. Women are represented in the modern wage
 sector, although not proportionately in the upper levels of
 administration and in the professions. Women serve in the
 armed forces. Polygyny is permitted by law and custom, but
 polyandry is not.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor code recognizes the right of workers to establish
 trade unions without prior authorization and to join trade
 unions of their choosing. In practice, there is but one
 umbrella labor organization in the country, the Organization
 of United Cameroonian Workers (OCWU), which operates parallel
 to the official political party. The top union leadership is
 chosen by the Government. Other unions in the country are
 subordinate to the OCWU. The OCWU permitted multiple
 candidates to run in worker delegate elections in late 1987
 and early 1988. The OCWU retains the right to approve
 candidacies, thus assuring political orthodoxy. The OCWU does
 not play a major role in Cameroonian politics, although it has
 a membership of approximately 450,000 workers in a working
 population of more than 3 million. It pursues individual
 worker grievances and seeks improvements in government
 programs for worker safety and training.
 The OCWU participates in government-regulated labor
 negotiations, but strikes are illegal. Political activity by
 trade unions, excepting action designed to protect economic
 and other interests, is prohibited. The OCWU maintains
 contact with foreign trade union organizations, including the
 American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial
 Organizations, but such contact requires government
 authorization. Cameroon is a member of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), and union members comprise the labor
 component of the Cameroonian delegation to ILO meetings. The
 OCWU is also a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity. It maintains contact with the Central African
 Trade Union Organization, but is not among the most active
 within the group.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor code recognizes the right of trade unions or trade
 union federations to engage in collective bargaining with
 employers or groups of employers. In practice, collective
 bargaining is rare, due to the small size of the modern
 industrial sector and the small number of large employers.
 Under the law, all employers of more than 10 workers must
 permit the election of a worker representative from among the
 employees. This individual has a statutory right to discuss
 labor conditions with the employer on behalf of the employees
 and enjoys special protection from arbitrary dismissal.
 Candidates for these positions must be approved by the OCWU.
 Although this system has potential for success, worker
 representatives have used the position more for their own
 
 
 50
 CAMEROON
 benefit than that of fellow workers. Labor laws are applied
 uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, the ILO
 Committee of Experts has noted that provisions of the labor
 code, the law establishing the National Civic Service for
 Participation in Development, legislation respecting prisons,
 and the Merchant Shipping Code are in violation of the ILO
 Conventions on forced labor. The Government has stated
 repeatedly that amendments to bring these laws into compliance
 are being processed or are under study.
 d: Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Cameroonian national labor code sets the minimum working
 age at 14, a rule which appears to be respected in the modern
 sector. Labor inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Insurance are empowered to enforce provisions of
 Cameroon's labor code, as are labor courts. In rural areas
 where subsistence farming occupies 80 per cent of Cameroon's
 citizens, children participate in agricultural work alongside
 adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Under the labor code, the minimum annual paid vacation is 18
 days, and the legal workweek is 40 hours for nonagricultural
 employees and up to 48 hours per week for agricultural
 workers. In order to make room for younger workers, civil
 servants are encouraged to retire upon reaching the minimum
 retirement age of 55. Minimum monthly wages are set by the
 Government for all public and private sector jobs. Wage
 rates--which range from $62 per month to $103 per month--are
 based on geographic zones, types of industry, and worker
 qualifications and seniority. The lowest wages are
 insufficient to support a family; but, in most cases, they are
 supplemented by a second job or another family member's
 earnings. Workers with middle-range wages also are likely to
 need second incomes to support a family, especially in Yaounde
 and Douala. Occupational health and safety is mandated by
 law, based on ILO standards. In theory, these standards are
 enforced by Ministry of Labor inspectors and labor courts, but
 they lack the means for effective enforcement.
