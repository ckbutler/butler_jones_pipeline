 CHILE
 Since independence in 1810, Chile has experienced alternating
 periods of authoritarian and parliamentary rule. Until
 1973 Chile had had a democratic system for over four
 decades.
 In the late 1960s and early 1970s, government policies
 for dealing with underlying social and economic problems
 led to an increasing polarization of Chile's social and
 political forces. In 1973 the armed forces broke with
 a longstanding tradition of non-interference in the politi-
 cal process and overthrew the elected government of Salvador
 Allende, for the avowed purpose of preventing the transformation
 of Chile into a Marxist state.
 Rather than returning power to civilians after the coup,
 the military, led by General Augusto Pinochet, embarked
 upon a wide-ranging effort to change the Chilean political
 and economic system. In the years following the 1973
 coup, the Pinochet regime undertook to curb dissent through
 a series of repressive measures unprecedented in contemporary
 Chilean history. These included mass arrests, torture,
 summary executions, exile, and the "disappearance" of
 hundreds of persons. This period also saw the banning
 of all political parties, the dissolution of or intervention
 in labor unions, the closing of many newspapers and radio
 stations, and the purging of the educational system.
 While no confirmed "disappearances" have occurred since
 October 1977, arbitrary detention and torture remained
 problems in 1979. Political parties remain formally
 dissolved, and basic freedoms of speech and assembly
 are restricted, although some informal political activity,
 criticism and limited press discussion is tolerated.
 Labor union activity continues to be restricted but restraints
 were eased in 1979 under a new labor law. The continuing
 "state of emergency" gives the Government extraordinary
 authority similar to that unde.r.a state of siege. While
 institutionalized or legal guarantees against violations
 of the integrity of the person are weak, there are some
 signs that the courts and the press are taking more interest
 in defending human rights.
 The Pinochet regime has pledged eventual restoration
 of elected government. A government commission is pre-
 paring a draft constitution which the Government states
 will be submitted to a plebiscite. However, the Government
 has not set a date for relinquishing control and it has
 stated that it expects the military to play a significant
 political role indefinitely. Economically, the Government
 is committed to ending the import substitution economic
 policies of the previous decades and to developing an
 economic system based on the free movement of trade and
 capital with a minimum of government interference.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Cases of torture have declined since 1976, although about
 a dozen credible incidents were reported during 1979.
 For example, a man apprehended while attaching an incendiary
 device to an unoccupied police van died in August, after
 six days in the hands of police and the National Information
 Center (CNI --successor organization to the National
 Intelligence Directorate, DINA). Even the pro-Government
 media reported the death widely, and the Government and
 the courts opened investigations. A civilian judge deter-
 mined that either arresting police or interrogating CNI
 agents were responsible, but he relinquished jurisdiction
 to the military justice system on the grounds that both
 groups of suspects were on active military duty. The
 military prosecutor had nothing to report on this case
 by the end of 1979. The media continues to follow the
 case. Most reports of torture assign blame to CNI and
 say victims were beaten and subjected to electric shock.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Protesters detained en masse during peaceful demonstrations
 have complained of police harassment while being held
 in precinct houses (such detainees may be legally held
 for up to five days before arraignment). In prison,
 persons detained for subversive or terrorist activities
 are normally separated from common criminals. Prisoners
 are able to receive visits from and communicate with
 family, friends, legal counsel, and representatives of
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 Allegations of summary executions are now very rare.
 However, in one case the courts, pressed by the victim's
 relatives and the Catholic Church, initiated a still
 ongoing investigation into the suspicious death of a
 man who security agents claimed blew himself up rather
 than face arrest in August, 1979.
 The last two reported disappearances occurred in October,
 1977. Sixteen bodies discovered in a lime kiln at Lonquen
 in December, 1978, accounted for some of the approximately
 650 documented cases of missing people, the bulk of whom
 disappeared under suspicious circumstances between September,
 1973, and late 1976 (a dozen disappeared during 1977).
 Chilean courts found that a squad of police had executed
 the Lonquen sixteen, but the guilty benefitted from an
 April, 1978, general amnesty, which applies to officials
 as well as opponents of the Government. Nineteen more
 post-coup victims were found at Yumbel in October, 1979.
 That case remains in the hands of a civilian judge.
 Another judge is investigating a large number of unmarked
 graves in Santiago's'general cemetery where a number
 of missing persons may have been interred.
 The Chilean Government has failed to investigate fully
 and prosecute three former security officers indicted
 in the U.S. for complicity in the 1976 assassinations
 
 
 272
 of ex-Chilean Ambassador to the U.S. Orlando Letelier
 and a U.S. citizen, Ronni Moffitt. In October 1979 the
 Chilean Supreme Court denied a U.S. Government extra-
 dition request for the three officers, and chose not
 to call for an investigation.in Chile of the assassination
 charges.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Although the Chilean Government has denied holding political
 prisoners, at any one time during 1979, approximately
 25-30 people have been under detention charged with non-
 violent seditious activity. Another 30-50 people are
 in jail on charges of engaging in violent actions for
 political reasons (e.g., bombings, murder, armed robbery).
 In theory, the right of habeas corpus exists; however,
 in internal security cases the courts often do not act
 on such petitions in a timely manner. State of emergency
 powers permit the President to order the detention of
 persons without charge for up to 5 days. Civilian and
 military courts have another 5 days, from the time of
 arraignment, to decide whether to indict. When peaceful
 demonstrators have been picked up in large-scale arrests,
 they are frequently held for the full 5 days under presidential
 discretion, then charged with internal security code
 violations. Civilian judges have on several occasions
 taken an additional 5 days to decide that the evidence
 does not justify indictment. According to law, CNI has
 limited authority to arrest on its own initiative; in
 practice it has been able to obtain vaguely worded warrants
 on the basis of which it can make arrests on its own
 discretion. When arrests are made in internal security
 cases, warrants are often not produced and arresting
 officers not identified.
 During 1979 the vast majority of those detained for unauthorized
 demonstrations were released within a few days; no one
 was criminally indicted for such activity. Generally,
 relatives and friends report detentions; the Government
 acknowledges them; and the press reports them.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Usually persons detained for essentially political reasons
 are charged with violations of either the pre-coup arms
 control law (if alleged to possess unregistered weapons
 or explosives) or the 1958 internal security law, which
 has been substantially amended to strengthen the current
 government's powers. Arms control violations go before
 a military prosecutor, whose decisions are automatically
 reviewed by a 5-member military court of 2 civilian judges
 and 3 professional military judges. Appeal to the civilian
 Supreme Court is also possible. Defendants have the
 rights of any Chilean citizen before the law, including
 the right to legal counsel. An April 1979 decree makes
 all members of an organization responsible for the acts
 of each member and establishes legal presumption of guilt
 in cases covered by the decree; it has not yet been invoked,
 however.
 The Inter-American Human Rights Commission reported in
 October, 1979 that the rights to a fair trial and of
 
 
 273
 due process were subject to significant limitations principally
 because of the active role of the military courts in
 judicial proceedings and the reluctance of the civil
 courts actively to investigate human rights violations.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 This is not a widespread abuse in Chile, although human
 rights organizations report that few of the searches
 which do occur meet all the applicable legal requirements.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Chile is an urban society, with only about 25% of its
 population of 11 million living in rural areas. For
 many years its economy has depended largely on revenues
 gained from the export of copper. For the last 40 years
 the economy came under increasing state direction. Governments
 controlled prices, established high protective tariffs,
 and nationalized many foreign and domestic companies.
 The sweeping transformation of Chilean life envisioned
 by the Pinochet Government has reversed the 40 year trend
 toward increasing public sector activity in favor of
 a mixed economic system based on free-enterprise capi-
 talism. The Government greatly reduced tariff protection,
 devalued the peso, freed interest rates, prices and the
 sale of land, sold off all but the largest state-owned
 enterprises, eliminated a great number of special interest
 subsidies, balanced the budget and welcomed foreign investment.
 After the new economic policies were introduced in 1975,
 GNP growth in real terms in the period 1976-79, increased
 an average of 7.5% per year. Per capita GNP in 1979
 was $1566. Inflation decreased from 340% in 1975 to
 39% in 1979. Real wages have increased 56% since 1975.
 Unemployment has decreased, according to official figures,
 from a peak of 19.6% in March 1976 to 12.5% in 1979.
 Critics of the Government argue that the true unemployment
 rate, including underemployment, exceeds 15%. A large
 stop-gap minimum employment program composed of public
 works projects and vocational training was established
 in 1975 to alleviate some of the unemployment and, as
 of December, 1979 employed approximately 161,000 people.
 Based on information from a 1979 University of Chile
 study of the Santiago metropolitan area, personal income
 is increasing at a faster rate among the poor than the
 rich since 1976. Critics of the Government's economic
 policies have argued that the income of the poor fell
 disproportionately between 1974 and 1976. In any case,
 the distribution of wealth is still highly concentrated.
 Opposition economists estimate that of approximately
 95,000 firms 1.9% control 53.7% of total assets and receive
 55.6% of total profits.
 The Government has revamped the tax structure by instituting
 a uniform 20% value added tax in place of a 16.5% cascading
 
 
 274
 sales tax, taxing corporate retained earnings but exempting
 capital gains, abolishing a large number of exemptions
 and preferences, reassessing property taxes, and increasing
 income tax rates.
 The Government has adopted a policy of divesting itself
 of previously expropriated land and business firms and
 transferring them to private ownership.
 The most recent official figures (1978) show that social
 expenditures (health, social welfare, public housing,
 social security, education, and regional development)
 increased in constant dollars to 1.4 billion dollars
 in 1979, compared with 778 million in 1975. Social expendi-
 tures in 1979 constituted 47.8% of the budget compared
 with 43.2% in 1975. Primary schools, vocational institutions
 and universities have all received increased funding,
 but the emphasis has changed as primary schools and vocational
 institutions now receive 65% of the total education budget
 compared with 54% in 1974. Corruption does not appear
 to be a significant factor in the administration of programs
 dealing with the poor.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 A basic "Constitutional Act" decreed by the Government
 in 1976 states that "any individual or group action is
 illegal and against the institutional order of the republic
 if such action is aimed at spreading doctrines which
 oppose the family, propose violence or a society based
 on class struggle; or which are against the constituted
 regime or the integrity or function of the state of law."
 In curbing dissent, the Government usually cites other
 more specific legal provisions and decrees outlawing
 Marxism and the advocacy of violent revolution.
 The media are technically free from prior censorship,
 but in practice the Government informs publications and
 broadcasters when they are considered to be getting out
 of line. Under emergency power authority, local military
 zone commanders appear to have the discretion to close
 down media indefinitely. A recent case in which a zone
 commander suspended an opposition-oriented newsweekly
 is being challenged in the courts.
 The Government operates the leading television network.
 Although ostensibly not under direct government supervision,
 the other TV channels, operated by the universities (which
 are managed by officials appointed by the Government),
 use considerable discretion. There are several periodicals
 and at least one radio station critical of the regime.
 "Non-Marxist" books and pamphlets critical of the Government
 are permitted free circulation. With occasional reverses,
 press freedoms increased in 1979.
 Chile respects freedom of religion. The generally progressive
 Catholic hierarchy, along with representatives of several
 other religious communities, has taken the lead in defending
 human rights. This has resulted in occasional tensions
 with the Government, but sporadic harassment of the Church's
 
 
 275
 social action programs has not spilled over into the
 area of religious teaching and worship.
 Virtually all meetings require prior approval of the
 local military zone commander. In practice, permission
 is regularly denied when the subject is politically sensi-
 tive. Demonstrators who meet without authorization are
 sometimes charged with violating the internal security
 code. The courts rarely indict persons on internal security
 grounds for having participated in peaceful demonstrations,
 but protesters can spend up to ten days under detention
 before release. Over one thousand demonstrators were
 detained for short periods during 1979.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Although during the first years of this government "Relega-
 cion" (Internal Exile) was a frequent punishment, it
 has fallen into disuse, as has expulsion. Chileans are
 free to leave their country. The Government has been
 generally forthcoming in granting safe-conducts for opponents
 who obtain asylum in embassies.
 Some one million Chileans live abroad, principally for
 economic reasons; Over half of them have resided for
 many years in Argentina, mainly Patagonia where they
 provide the basic labor pool. Many thousands fled Chile
 when the current government took power; hundreds more
 sought asylum in embassies; other thousands -- convicted
 of internal security crimes -- had jail sentences commuted
 to exile. Government decrees require those people who
 left Chile illegally or irregularly to file a petition
 before a Chilean consul if they seek to return. The
 Interior Ministry reviews all petitions; as a matter
 of policy it rejects any from those who are considered
 to have engaged in anti-government activities while abroad.
 The Government has released no current figures on petitions
 received, rejected, approved, and under consideration.
 The available evidence indicates that few receive approval.
 In a recent court case the Interior Ministry was required
 to substantiate the grounds for rejecting a petition
 and its rejection was overridden by the judiciary.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Partisan political activity is banned. All political
 parties have been dissolved. Elections for government
 office are non-existent; indeed, elections for almost
 anything are only permitted under special circumstances.
 Following its coup, the Government assumed authority
 to amend the Constitution. With Congress dissolved,
 the Government exercises legislative powers delegating
 executive authority to President Pinochet. The courts
 are technically autonomous, but appear to have been passive
 or sympathetic to Government desires in internal security
 cases. Although somd judges have recently taken a more
 assertive posture, the judiciary is far from being a
 counter-weight to the Government.
 Notwithstanding the formal ban on political activity,
 certain non-Marxist parties, notably the Christian Democrats
 
 
 276
 and some ex-Radicals, are able to continue to operate
 on a limited basis, and with extreme caution. Even some
 Socialists and splinter leftist groups maneuver among
 themselves with tacit Government acquiescence. Communists
 are sometimes detained under internal security code charges,
 but normally only when caught disseminating propaganda.
 In a change of tactics, however, the Government in December
 1979, invoked for the first time its decree prohibiting
 all partisan political activity. In two cases now before
 the civilian courts, the Government charged a group of
 five Democratic Socialists and a dozen ex-members of
 the Allende Government with "flagrant violation" of the
 ban. All those accused are free on bond pending judicial
 investigation.
 Women rarely are granted access to the highest management
 positions in or out of government. Many do hold professional
 jobs in health, education and, increasingly, in business
 and the bureaucracy.
 During the past year, the Government promulgated a series
 of decrees which constitute a labor plan. The effect
 of these decrees is to ease restrictions on union meetings
 and the registration of new unions. They also provide
 detailed rules for collective bargaining, strikes and
 lockouts and stress "open shop" and plant-level unions.
 Vocal criticism of the plan has come from almost all
 trade union leaders, who assert that it is designed to
 fragment the union movement and keep workers from effectively
 negotiating with employers. As of the end of November
 1979, two out of nine rounds of collective bargaining
 had been completed. Of 844 contract proposals covering
 80,000 workers, 15 resulted in strikes involving 6,200
 workers. Management, so far, has been willing to enter
 collective negotiations with a view to reaching a quick
 agreement and to ignore some of the labor plan's internal
 time deadlines and the prohibition against bargaining
 with labor federations.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-government Investigation of Alleged Violation
 of Human Rights
 The Government set a precedent when, in July 1978, it
 allowed members of the special ad hoc working group of
 the UN Commission for Human Rights to conduct a long-
 delayed visit to Chile. Although the ad hoc group subsequently
 disbanded, a Special Rapporteur submits-an-nual reports
 to the Commission. Another UN official studies the problems
 of missing Chileans, and yet another is in charge of
 a special fund for Chilean victims of human rights abuses.
 A Chile item appears each year on the agenda of the UN
 General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Commission.
 The 1979 UN General Assembly passed a resolution expressing
 "particular concern that the Chilean authorities have
 failed to take and urge effective measures, as requested
 in its resolution 33/175, to investigate and clarify
 the fate of persons reported to have disappeared for
 political reasons," and urges the authorities of Chile
 to respect and promote human rights in accordance with
 the responsibilities it has undertaken under various
 international instruments.
 
 
 277
 The Inter-American Human Rights Commission also maintains
 a watching brief on the Chilean situation. The OAS General
 Assembly in October, 1979, adopted a resolution based
 on the Commission's 1979 report noting that "there remain
 in Chile serious limitations on the exercise of human
 rights" and urged the Government of Chile "to intensify
 its adoption and implementation of the measures necessary
 effectively to preserve and ensure the full exercise
 of human rights in Chile." In late 1978 the ICRC reduced
 its Chilean presence to one local employee primarily
 because of the substantial decline in the number of political
 prisoners. Earlier it had played an active role in prison
 visits in attempts to locate missing persons. The Inter-
 governmental Committee for European Migration (ICEM)
 also has been active in Chile, conducting a program permit-
 ting convicted political prisoners an opportunity to
 serve out their sentences in exile. The Government cooperated
 in making this program possible. Counting all categories
 of refugees, ICEM has moved some 20,000 people out of
 Chile since the coup.
 Amnesty International, the International Commission of
 Jurists and other non-governmental organizations have
 shown special concern about the Chilean situation. Although
 the Government believes that virtually all of the reports
 produced by these organizations exaggerate the scope
 and volume of abuses, it has permitted visits by their
 representatives.' For example, it did not harass a Catholic
 Church-sponsored international symposium on human rights
 held in Santiago in November, 1978. Religious organizations
 such as the World Council of Churches and the Catholic
 Church have been the most active defenders of human rights
 in Chile. The Chilean Commission for Human Rights came
 into existence last year, and the Government has permitted
 it to continue its operations. Chile has signed, but
 not yet ratified, the American Convention on Human Rights.
