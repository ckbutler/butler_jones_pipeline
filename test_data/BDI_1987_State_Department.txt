 BURUNDI
 The Republic of Burundi is a one-party state led by President
 Pierre Buyoya, an army major who came to power in September
 1987 through a bloodless coup. At present, the nation is ruled
 through a 31-member Military Committee for National Salvation,
 but Buyoya has promised a speedy return to civilian government,
 and 16 of 20 ministers named recently are civilians. The
 National Party for Unity and Progress (UPRONA) is the only
 significant political entity in Burundi. As President of the
 Republic and head of the ruling military committee, Buyoya
 plays a dominant policy role. With the Constitution suspended
 officially, Buyoya currently exercises legislative and
 regulatory powers as well. The dominance of the minority
 Tutsi over the majority Hutu ethnic group has been the central
 political and social reality of Burundi for several centuries,
 and continues under t~e new Government, although Buyoya has
 announced a policy of tribal reconciliation and has promised
 to increase Hutu participation in the country's emerging
 political institutions and even in the military.
 The Burundi Armed Forces are well equipped and well trained to
 maintain law and order. In addition, there is a regular police
 force responsible for public order and a separate force of
 security police responsible primarily for internal state
 security, including the monitoring of dissent. The state
 security police have the same powers of arrest as the regular
 police and are subject to the same process of judicial review
 of detentions.
 Burundi is a poor country with one of the highest population
 densities in Africa. Most Burundi (90 percent) earn their
 livelihood as subsistence farmers working small, privately
 owned plots. The small monetary economy is based on coffee,
 which accounts for 85 percent of foreign exchange earnings.
 Recent gains in food production and agriculture have been
 largely offset by the high population growth rate.
 The major development in 1987.-was the coup d'etat which
 brought Buyoya to power. In the months prior to the coup, the
 Government of former President Bagaza took an increasingly
 hard line against any form of dissent. In particular, -Bagaza
 sought to weaken, if not destroy, the Roman Catholic Church
 through church closings, the arrest and expulsion of priests,
 and the placement of severe restrictions on the freedom to
 worship. Other religions were persecuted also, and large
 numbers of Seventh-Day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses were
 imprisoned without charge under harsh conditions. Bagaza's
 excesses were a major cause of resentment against the old
 Government and Buyoya has made the protection of human rights
 a major goal of his administration. In the first days
 following the coup, the Military Committee freed all political
 prisoners, announced a partial amnesty for other prisoners,
 opened the closed churches, and invited all exiles to return.
 By mid-October, Buyoya had announced further liberalization,
 including authorization for weekday masses and religious
 schools and the reinstitution of the office of catechist.
 Buyoya also has encouraged discussion and pledged wide
 democratic debate within the party structure. The new
 President has preserved the civilian character of the
 bureaucracy and taken steps to reduce corruption. The
 Military Committee is moving more slowly in reinstituting the
 national assembly, with elections not expected for several
 years. While the Constitution has been suspended, government
 operations which rely on constitutional provisions continue as
 before.

 BURUNDI
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no allegations of killings for political motives or
 reports of summary executions.
 _b., Disappearance
 No disappearances caused by the Government or by other groups
 were reported. Prison authorities during the Bagaza era
 reportedly could not account for all persons who had been
 detained, but whether those unaccounted for died in prison,
 escaped, or were released remains to be determined.
 c. Torture and Other -Cruel,.Inhuman, or-Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law, but prior to the coup cruel
 treatment of suspects or detainees often occurred in the form
 of beatings at the time of arrest or interrogation. These
 beatings, when combined with other harsh conditions,-
 occasionally led to serious injury or even death. In fact,
 two Jehovah's Witnesses-are-reported to have died in May as a
 direct-result of such mistreatment. Since the coup, there
 have been no reports of-tortUre or:*ruel punishment:-'Thb new
 Government has expressed an interest in having regular visits
 by the International'Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 Prison conditions remain severe due to the lack of adequate
 hygiene, medical care  and food. Prisoners are segregated
 according to the nature of their crimes,'allowed regular family
 visits, and participate'in rehabilitative work programs,
 including agricultural production. . Due to inadequate prison
 budgetst food rations are likely to remain limited, and
 families are encouraged and expected-to'provide supplemental
 food and other personal items to-their imprisoned relatives.-
 The Government recognizes this is a serious problem and has
 begun a program of prison renovation.
 d. 'Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Police-officers are empowered to detain suspects without an
 arrest warrant but must submit a written report to the public
 prosecutor's office within 24 hours. The public prosecutor
 examines the report and can either-order the release of the
 detainee-or issue an arrest warrant valid for 5 days. The
 public prosecutor then must state the charges before a
 magistrate-in the presence of the-detainee. The-magistrate
 either releases the detainee or issues orders confirming the
 detention, initially for 15 days and subsequently for 30-day
 periods as necessary-to prepare the case for-trial. Bail is
 set only.in cases of embezzlement or similar crimes involving
 financial-wrongdoing.          -
 Since the coup, the prescribed procedures for arrest and
 imprisonment have been followed. Previously, the elapsed time
 between an arrest and the notification of the public prosecutor
 often extended to several days, and detainees did not always
 appear before a magistrate within the allotted 5 days after
 arrest. Relatives or consular representatives are almost
 always made aware of arrests or detentions, generally at the
 
 
 BURUNDI
 time of incarceration, and detainees usually are permitted to
 go to their homes prior to being brought to the place of
 detention.
 The Government does not exile its nationals. Citizens of
 other countries suspected of criminal activity or lacking
 proper residency documents are expelled. Forced or compulsory
 labor is not permitted under current law, but most citizens
 are expected to perform community service on Saturday mornings.
 This last measure had caused serious problems during the Bagaza
 era for Seventh-Day Adventists who are forbidden by their faith
 from working on Saturday, their Sabbath. The Buyoya Government
 has agreed to let the Adventists perform this service on
 another day.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary's independence is limited by the requirement to
 adhere to the guidance and recommendations of the party, the
 Government, and the President. Judges are appointed by and
 serve at the pleasure of the President. Nevertheless, there
 is a high degree of autonomy in the court's daily
 administration of justice. Though court decisions cannot be
 overturned by the executive branch, the President has the
 power to pardon or reduce sentences.
 Burundi has separate court systems to deal with military,
 civil/criminal, and state security cases. Military tribunals
 have jurisdiction only over military personnel. The State
 Security Court has jurisdiction over both civilian and
 military personnel, and its proceedings need not be made
 public. To date, this Court has never been used. Burundi law
 provides the right to counsel, and indigents are provided
 defense counsel by the State. Pretrial proceedings may
 involve lengthy investigations. The public prosecutor's
 office generally dismisses cases where the evidence in support
 of the charges is weak, and only proceeds to trial when it
 believes guilt has been established. The courts are still
 hampered by a lack of trained legal personnel and by heavy
 case loads.
 During the past 7 years, the Government has taken steps to
 improve the judicial system, and the 1984 party congress
 recommended additional judicial reforms. New courts have been
 created, the number of magistrates has tripled, and training
 seminars and conferences have been held.
 Following the coup d'etat, all political prisoners or
 political detainees in Burundi were released. Since then two
 former Ministers in the Bagaza Goyernment have been arrested
 on criminal charges of corruption. This contrasts sharply
 with the situation during the months immediately prior to the
 coup, as Bagaza's security service arrested and detained ever
 larger numbers of suspected dissidents, including Burundi's
 former ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva. Amnesty
 International, in its 1987 Report, estimated that there may
 have been about 100 political prisoners held at any one time
 in 1986. These included several former ministers from
 President Micombero's regime, who were being held for
 criticizing the Government's religious policy.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of private correspondence and of the home
 are ensured in the Constitution and respected in practice. A
 judicialwarrant is required for a law enforcement official to
 enter and search a private residence.
 Membership in the major political party and its affiliated
 organizations is open to all, but is not required. The State
 Security Office monitors political dissent through the state
 security police and by employing informers who report on
 discontent and dissent as well as on criminal activity.
 Section 2 Respect for'Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press'
 The Government controls all domestic print and broadcast
 media.- The French-language daily and Kirundi-language weekly
 are published by the Ministry of Information, which also
 operates  the domestic radio and television stations. The
 media':have been required to support the fundamental policies
 of the 'party and the Government. Some criticism of the
 Government is permitted in the printed press, but journalists
 are state employees and are subject to disciplinary action if
 their criticism goes beyond what is considered tolerable. The
 Government rarely interferes with the distribution of foreign
 news publications and never interferes with radio reception
 from foreign sources.
 In the -fir-st months following the coup, there has been an
 unprecedented outpouring of public debate and questioning on'
 formerly taboo subjects such as ethnic relations and official
 corrupti1f. -Academic freedom has been limited in the past in
 that primary and secondary school teachers were expected to
 support government policies. It is not yet known whether *this
 will continue. At the university, professors come from many
 different countries, both east and west, and are permitted to
 lectuie freely in their subject areas, conduct research, and
 diaw independent conclusions. Public censorship occurs only
 in the case of sexually explicit foreign film material or-
 publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In the past, the express authorization of the Government was
 requirdd Tor-all political meetings. This-requirement
 effectively guaranteed government control of all public forums
 and limited association for political purposes to participation
 in the party or its affiliated youth, labor, or women's
 movements. This restriction-has not been enforced since the
 coup, but it is not yet known whether it will be withdrawn
 officially.
 The parts controls the National Trade Union Confederation
 (UTB), and has institutionalized this single trade hniOn
 structure by means of legislation. The principal role of the
 UTB, to which virtually the entire salaried work force
 belongs, is to serve as an intermediary between workers and
 employers in labor matters. The UTB arbitrates individual and
 collective labor disputes and often forces employers to revise
 their practices. Unauthorized advocacy of a strike or lockout
 is a criminal offense. Therefore, though they are technically
 permissible, there have been no strikes in recent years. The
 
 
 BURUNDI
 UTB participates in the International Labor Organization and
 is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 In 1986 the UTB held an extraordinary meeting to adopt its
 statutes, and the proceedings were relatively democratic.
 The Government permits nonpolitical private associations, but
 requires that they be registered and accorded legal recognition
 before they may function.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ex-President Bagaza saw organized religion as a threat to his
 power and sought to diminish the role of the church in the
 everyday life of the people. To accomplish this, he placed a
 series of ever more repressive restrictions on where and when
 people could worship. Further, there was an official, though
 undeclared, policy of harassment against organized religion,
 particularly the Catholic Church. This harassment took the
 form of imprisoning a number of priests, nuns, and lay
 officials, expelling or denying visa renewals for missionaries,
 closing down churches, abolishing the office of catechist,
 expropriating church schools and property, and engaging in a
 vicious media campaign which accused the church of everything
 from sowing ethnic discord to having Nazi sympathies. This
 program was extremely unpopular with the Burundi people, and
 President Buyoya and his Military Committee have acted quickly
 to remove many of the most serious restrictions. Specifically,
 Buyoya has freed all religious prisoners (along with the
 political prisoners), reopened the closed churches, authorized
 weekday masses, reinstituted the catechists, and stated that
 Catholic seminaries and the "Yaga-Mukama" literacy/catechism
 classes may be reestablished. Further, the church will be
 permitted to make radio broadcasts and publish newspapers and
 books. Several other issues, such as the disposition of
 confiscated property and the return of former missionaries,
 are currently the subject of discussions between church
 leaders and the Government.
 Although these reforms will restore the church to a key role
 in the development of the country, religious expression in
 Burundi continues to be carefully restricted by civil laws and
 regulations. The Burundi Government believes religious
 organizations must be subject to the same sorts of rules and
 restrictions which apply to secular organizations. All
 religious associations must receive approval from the
 Government to operate in Burundi and are expected not to
 engage in political activity critical of the regime in power.
 The legal repres.ntative of each religious sect must be.a
 Burundi citizen.
 During the Bagaza regime, two religions, the Seventh-Day
 Adventists and the Jehovah's Witnesses, were banned. However,
 an international delegation of Seventh-Day Adventists has been
 told by the Minister of Interior that the Adventists will be
 allowed to reorganize. The previous problem relating to the
 Adventists' refusal to do Saturday work has been resolved by a
 mutual agreement that the Adventists will perform their
 community service on some other day. The Jehovah's Witnesses
 have not yet requested to be reinstated as a recognized
 religion, so it is not yet known whether they will be allowed
 to reestablish themselves in Burundi.
 There are no barriers to the maintenance of links with
 coreligionists in other countries, Religious beliefs do not
 
 
 BURUNDI
 exclude people from participation in the party or from
 receiving social benefits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is generally free within Burundi, although government
 policies discourage urban migration. Foreign travel and
 emigration are relatively free. Prospective Burundi travelers
 must have exit visas as well as passports. In the past, some
 foreigners applying for exit visas were required to prove they
 had no outstanding debts. During 1987 until the coup d'etat,
 many missionaries and other long-time foreign residents were
 denied the rendwal of their residence permits. The Buyoya
 regime has reversed this trend and renewed the permits of
 several residents and missionaries previously threatened with
 expulsion.
 The Government has cooperated closely with the office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Burundi claims to shelter 262,000 refugees, but most are
 long-time residents who now are well assimilated.. The UNHCR
 estimates that there are approximately 70,000 refugees,
 primarily Tutsis of Rwandan origin who fled to Burundi in the
 1960's. Many are well integrated in Burundi, although they
 may acquire citizenship only through marriage to a Burundi
 citizen. During 1987 increasing numbers of Rwandan and other
 refugees lost their jobs when theywere replaced by Burundi
 citizens of matching qualifications, despite the provision in
 Burundi law granting-refugees the right to work. In July
 1987, the Ministry of Interior declared that any refugee
 holding a.job would be allowed t6 keep it, and any unemployed
 refugee could fill jobs for which'there were no qualified
 Burundi. The Ggvepnment periodically repatriates Rwandan
 nationals who lack residence permits or who have been arrested
 on suspicion of criminal activities. Refugees who fled from
 Burundi in the 1970's and earlier continue to return and have
 full rights as citizens. Some 5,000 Burundi who were
 repatriated forcibly from Tanzania in April 1987 were welcomed
 and given materials to reestablish themselves in less
 populated areas.
 Section 3 Respect for Po6litical Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Burundi citizens do not have the right to change their
 government. Political participation can take place only
 within the one-party structure, and voters can express
 dissatisfaction only by voting against incumbents. The party
 is open to all Burundi supporting its principles and claims a
 membership of approximately 1.4 million, over three-quarters
 of the adult population. The party regularly holds local and
 regional meetings, where party members discuss issues and make
 recommendations. While there Are multiple candidates for
 party positions, balloting is not secret.
 Since Septemibei 1987, the 31-member Military Committee for
 National Salvation (MCNS) is the supreme body of the nation,
 charged with directing policies and government decisions.
 Most executive decisions are taken by the 10-member Executive
 Committee of the MCNS. The President has indicated that the
 Military Committee will rule until civilian government
 institutions, presumably including the National Assembly, are
 reconstituted. The President has been invested by the
 
 
 36
 BURUNDI
 Military Committee with legislative and regulatory authority,
 executing this authority within the guidelines decided by the
 committee.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Buyoya Government has cited the Bagaza regime's abuse of
 human rights as one of the reasons for its overthrow. It has
 pledged to protect the rights of all Burundi citizens and to
 work with humanitarian organizations, including permitting
 regular ICRC prison visits in the future. In 1986 the Bagaza
 regime authorized the ICRC to schedule periodic visits to
 prisons, and visits were made. The scheduled visit for August
 1987 was postponed without explanation, but shortly thereafter
 it was revealed that Burundi prisons were holding a greatly
 increased number of political prisoners. The Bagaza Government
 permitted Amnesty International to visit Burundi in 1987.
 Burundi is a party to several United Nations instruments on
 human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The minority Tutsi have for centuries dominated the majority
 Hutu. Civil strife in 1972, which culminated in government
 sanctioned massacres, resulted in the deaths of around 150,000
 Hutu and caused another 200,000 to flee to neighboring Rwanda
 and Tanzania. During the Second Republic beginning in 1976,
 the level of ethnic tension markedly declined, and Tutsi-Hutu
 tensions are not believed to have played a role in the
 downfall of the Bagaza regime. Thousands of Hutu refugees
 have returned to Burundi over the past several years. While
 the Government is far from representative of the Burundi
 population as a whole (85 percent Hutu, 14 percent Tutsi, and
 1 percent other), Buyoya has appointed Hutus to all levels of
 government, including 7 to his 20-member Cabinet, and 6 out of
 15 provincial governors.
 Intermarriage also has contributed to a blurring of ethnic
 distinctions. The low level of economic development in rural
 areas affects both Tutsi and Hutu, making the difference in
 economic status between the two groups scarcely discernible in
 the countryside. However, because of their longstanding
 dominance of the government and access to education, the Tutsi
 predominate in the modern economic sector. The military
 remains under Tutsi control, and Tutsi dominance is expected
 -to,ontinue under Buyoya's rule. Nevertheless, there is no
 evidence that Hutus are denied equal protection under the law.
 Women in society hold a secondary position, although their
 status is undergoing considerable change from traditional
 patterns. The suspended Constitution provided for legal
 equality. The current legal code prohibits polygamy and a
 dowry requirement, allows women some control over family
 -matters, and provides for land inheritance by women. Although
 fewer women than men obtain a formal education, once a degree
 is attained women can generally find suitable employment. The,
 Government has not discriminated against women in hiring.
 Women are represented at all levels in the political life of
 the country, including two in the Buyoya Cabinet. Their main
 vehicle of political expression is the Burundi Women's Union
 which is affiliated with the party. The party remains
 dominated by males.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 More than 90 percent of the population of Burundi are
 subsistence farmers. Some increased monetization of the
 economy is occurring with the increase in coffee and tea
 production. Worker rights are guaranteed by the Burundi labor
 code and by the National Collective Interprofessional Labor
 Convention, but these rights have relevance primarily for
 workers in the small wage sector of the economy. Working
 hours vary between 40 and 45 hours per week; Saturday
 afternoons, Sundays, and holidays are times of rest. Children
 under the age of 12 may not be employed in any capacity, nor
 may children under the age of 16 be engaged in dangerous or
 strenuous work. But, as a practical matter, many children are
 obliged by custom and circumstance to help their families in
 subsistence agriculture. In the modern economic sector,
 minimum health and safety standards are monitored by the
 Ministry of Labor, but enforcement of these standards is
 limited, in part due to the lack of inspectors.
 Burundi has a high population growth rate. The number of
 available workers for salaried jobs far exceeds demand. As a
 result, labor costs are low. The established minimum wage of
 approximately $1.12 per day is barely adequate to provide a
 decent living for workers and families. Wages are higher in
 the few private sector businesses.
