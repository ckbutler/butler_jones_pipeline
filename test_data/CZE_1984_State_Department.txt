 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is a centralized Communist
 state in which the Communist Party leadership decides all
 important political, economic, and social questions, and
 determines the scope of individual human rights. There has
 been no change in the top leadership since the purges of
 1969-71, when about half a million supporters of Alexander
 Dubcek and the Prague Spring were expelled from the party and
 dismissed from their jobs.
 The regime does not tolerate initiatives independent of the
 Communist Party, even if they are apolitical. People whose
 private initiatives have triggered state harassment in 1984
 include jazz musicians, peace activists, and Roman Catholics
 who circulated petitions to invite the Pope to visit
 Czechoslovakia.
 As in previous years, the harshest repression has been
 directed at religious activists, and at individuals and groups
 who monitor human rights abuses in Czechoslovakia. The latter
 include: VONS (Committee for the Unjustly Persecuted); and
 signatories of Charter 77, a document issued in January 1977
 and signed by over 1,000 Czechoslovak citizens calling on the
 Czechoslovak Government to honor its human rights
 obligations. In 1984, the Czechoslovak Government sought to
 avoid major trials of well-known figures that would attract
 unfavorable publicity. It relied instead on more subtle forms
 of repression, including arrests of lesser-known individuals,
 frequent detentions and interrogations, intrusive
 surveillance, forced emigration, discrimination in employment,
 and denial of education opportunities to the children of
 dissidents. A new technique in 1984 was the implementation of
 an onerous regime of 'protective supervision' against several
 released political prisoners. Under 'protective supervision,
 the former prisoners' movements and activities are severely
 restricted, making it impossible for them and their families
 to lead a normal life.
 Czechoslovakia has a well-funded and abundantly staffed
 security apparatus, directed by the Ministry of the Interior
 and the Communist Party hierarchy. This apparatus includes a
 uniformed police force (public security) which fulfills much
 the same role as a Western police force, and a secret police
 force (state security), which deals with people it judges to
 be past, present, or future opponents of the regime. This
 powerful internal security force is one of the main pillars of
 the party's control.
 The Czechoslovak economy is centrally planned and allows
 little or no private enterprise or ownership in manufacturing,
 retail operations, agriculture, or services. When the
 Communists took power in 1948, Czechoslovakia had one of the
 most advanced economies in Europe, one that had escaped much
 of the destruction of World War II. But in recent years the
 economy has stagnated, burdened by excessive central planning,
 obsolete equipment and infrastructure, and a lack of
 incentives for innovation and initiative.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no reports or allegations of political
 killings in Czechoslovakia in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports or allegations of disappearances in
 Czechoslovakia in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although the Constitution states *inviolability of the person
 shall be guaranteed,' there are numerous reports of the
 beating of detainees during interrogations. Reports of
 mistreatment have been most frequent in political cases.
 Beatings have also been reported in places other than police
 stations under circumstances that led the victims to believe
 that police or security officials were responsible.
 Prison conditions in Czechoslovakia are poor and sometimes
 approach a level of cruel and inhuman treatment, especially
 under the the 'third category' of imprisonment (harshest
 regime), which is often applied to political prisoners. In
 general, cells are small and unheated; family visits are
 strictly limited; and prisoners report that they receive such
 punishments as reduction in pay and limitations on free time,
 bathing, and exercise periods for failing to meet
 unrealistically high work standards. Diet and medical
 facilities are reliably reported to be deficient; as a result,
 several people have left jail in seriously debilitated
 condition.
 Prisoners or former prisoners who make public complaints of
 mistreatment are severely punished. In December 1983, Jiri
 Wolf was charged with "divulging state secrets' and sentenced
 to 6 years (harshest regime) for reporting on harsh conditions
 in Minkovice and Valdice prisons, where he had previously been
 imprisoned. In January 1984, Frantisek Hanzlicek was
 sentenced to 10 months because he complained that police used
 physical force to get him to confess to possession of drugs.
 In June, Jiri Gruntorad was given an additional 14-month
 sentence for complaining of a beating by a prison guard.
 In its July 1982 meeting, the World Psychiatric Association
 accused Czechoslovakia of misusing psychiatry for political
 purposes, causing Czechoslovakia to resign its membership in
 the organization. Several cases of abuse have been documented
 in recent years, but it does not appear to be a widepsread
 practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Individuals in Czechoslovakia are frequently arrested,
 detained, or subjected to searches and interrogations for
 expression of views contrary to those of the regime. In
 general, arrests are couched in legal terms and carried out
 with warrants. Although searches, detentions and
 
 
 950
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 interrogations are usually performed with warrants, in many
 recorded instances they have been carried out in contravention
 of Czechoslovak law. Under the law a person may be detained
 for up to 48 hours without charge, although in practice this
 limit is often exceeded. It is normal for political activists
 to be detained repeatedly for 48 hours at a time and then be
 released without being charged. Searches, detentions, and
 frequent interrogations are among the tactics used by the
 regime when it has decided to persecute, rather than prosecute.
 According to the law, if the authorities decide to press
 charges, the detainee may be held for 60 days in investigative
 detention. This period can be and often is extended at the
 request of the prosecution. Miklos Duray, a well-known
 activist for the Hungarian minority in Czechoslovakia, was
 arrested in Bratislava on May 10, 1984, and after 6 months has
 still not been brought to trial. Several current political
 prisoners, including Rudolf Battek, Ivan Jirous, Jan Wunsch,
 Stanislav Kolar, and Antonin Kunrt, were held in investigative
 detention for 6 months or more before being brought to trial.
 The number of persons now being held in pretrial detention is
 difficult to estimate. The number is probably fewer than 100,
 but it can fluctuate substantially.
 Generally, persons arrested for expressing views opposed by
 the regime are charged with "subversion," "incitement,*
 'defamation of the Republic," or "damaging the interests of
 the Republic abroad.' Individuals who have maintained
 unauthorized contacts with foreign diplomats have on occasion
 been charged with "espionage.' People arrested for religious
 activities are usually charged with "obstructing state control
 of religion' or 'abuse of religious office.' Many of these
 articles of the criminal code are so elastic that they could
 encompass almost any activity.
 Internal exile and house arrest have not been imposed formally
 in Czechoslovakia since the 1950's. In 1984, however, for the
 first time, the Czechoslovak Government introduced a regime of
 'protective supervision," which combines features of both, on
 released political prisoners. In the best known cases,
 Charter 77 activists Ladislav Lis and Jiri Limomisky are
 required to report daily at a specified time, 7 days a week,
 to a local police station. Tardiness of more than 5 minutes is
 punished, and 3 violations can lead to additional sentences.
 In May, Lis was given a 3-month sentence for a minor
 infraction. They must provide information on all employment
 and salaries, observe very tight curfews, and obtain prior
 permission to travel outside their places of residence.
 They--as well as any guests found in their homes--are subject
 to searches at any time. Terms of 2 to 3 years' protective
 supervision have been imposed on other political prisoners
 scheduled for release in 1985, including Rudolf Battek, Ivan
 Jirous and Vaclav Soukup.
 Forced exile has also been used by the Czechoslovak Government
 to rid itself of critics. In some cases people who had been
 working or visiting abroad with official permission were
 stripped of citizenship and refused the right to return. Many
 Charter 77 signatories, as well as people active in artistic
 and intellectual fields, are reluctant to accept invitations
 from Western institutions for fear they will not be allowed to
 return to Czechoslovakia.
 Forced exile is often aimed against people who have already
 
 
 951
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 served a jail sentence. Upon their release, or while still in
 prison, they are pressured to emigrate. If they refuse, they
 and their families are denied jobs and schooling, harassed,
 and threatened with rearrest. Frequently, after a year or
 more of this treatment, these ex-prisoners apply to emigrate.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 According to Czechoslovak law, people charged with criminal
 offenses in Czechoslovakia are entitled to a fair and open
 public trial. The law provides that the accused has a right
 to be informed of the charges against him, to have counsel,
 and to present a defense. However, the practice is quite
 different, especially where political offenses are concerned.
 In political cases, only immediate family members of the
 accused are permitted to attend. Representatives of the
 press, diplomatic corps, and friends of the defendant are
 routinely barred. When there is no immediate family (as in
 Jiri Wolf's trial in December 1983), the trial is for all
 practical purposes a closed one, and friends of the defendant
 are likely to have great difficulty in obtaining information
 on the proceedings.
 Court-appointed lawyers do not always vigorously represent
 their clients. Defense witnesses are sometimes prevented from
 testifying. Defense attorneys who have defended their clients
 with vigor have been disbarred and occasionally prosecuted.
 Defendants do exercise their right to defend themselves in
 court, and occasionally have the charges dismissed or reduced
 at the original trial or on appeal. But an appeal can also
 result in an increase in the sentence or addition of charges.
 The judiciary is not independent of the Government and
 Communist Party. In theory, judges can be removed only by the
 Federal Assembly (Parliament) or by either of the Czech of
 Slovak National Council. In practice, they are subject to
 more direct control and supervision by the Communist Party, to
 which most judges and lawyers belong.
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 difficult to estimate. Human rights groups within
 Czechoslovakia have documented some 30 cases currently in
 prison, but they believe that the total figure is closer to
 300. In almost all of the documented cases, the prisoners
 have been sentenced as a result of their political or
 religious activities or beliefs, or for disseminating
 information outside of official channels. None is believed to
 have used or advocated the use of violence. The undocumented
 cases include Jehovah's Witnesses, people caught trying to
 leave the country without permission, and others who believe
 that publicity would only worsen their plight. The Government
 does not admit to having political prisoners, and accurate
 statistics are impossible to obtain.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Czechoslovak Government does not accept the concept of a
 sphere of private life independent of government
 interference. Not only does it seek to gain control over
 leisure-time activities, but it also grants itself full rights
 to interfere with privacy of communications.
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 61
 
 
 952
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Those who are considered opponents of the regime bear the
 brunt of heavily intrusive surveillance. They, their
 families, and friends are routinely subjected to such measures
 as bugging of homes, tapping of telephones, and monitoring and
 destruction of mail. Discrimination in education and
 employment is regularly practiced against the families of
 dissidents and religious activists. After 16 years few of the
 half million Communist party members who were purged in
 1969-71 have been 'rehabilitated' and allowed to return to
 their jobs. Many of their children have faced discrimination
 in education and employment. Children of Charter 77 activists
 Jiri Dienstbier and Vaclav Benda have been denied entrance to
 high schools of their choice. Fear that their children will
 be denied higher education is a major factor in preventing
 open dissent among intellectuals and white-collar workers.
 A special problem exists for religious believers who wish to
 raise their children in their faith. Organization of
 religious instruction or ceremonies in private homes is
 forbidden. It was reported that at least one priest lost his
 state permit in 1984 because he provided educational materials
 to a woman who wanted to teach her children about religion.
 Parents must seek the permission of the local authorities for
 their children to receive religious education at school.
 However, many Czechoslovak citizens believe that such a
 request could be damaging to a child's future education and
 career prospects.
 Contacts with individuals and receipt of information from the
 West are discouraged. Czechoslovaks in many professions are
 required to file a report each time they have a conversation
 with a Westerner. Broadcasts of Radio Free Europe in Czech
 and Slovak are jammed in Prague and other major cities,
 although they can often be heard in rural areas. Voice of
 America, BBC, and other Western broadcasts are not jammed.
 Many people who live near the western or southern borders are
 able to receive West German or Austrian television broadcasts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Czechoslovak Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and press, in practice these freedoms do not exist.
 The Constitution states that they must be exercised "in
 accordance with the interests of the working class.0 In
 effect, individuals may not voice opinions publicly that
 differ from party policy or question the legitimacy of party
 rule, the fundamental principles of the 'socialist' state, or
 the regime's relationship with the Soviet Union. Likewise,
 academic freedom is severely limited by political directives.
 In order to publish, writers must belong to the
 state-controlled Union of Writers. All newspapers and
 magazines are published by political parties or mass
 organizations (e.g., the Youth League, Revolutionary Trade
 Union Movement, or Sports Federation) which are controlled by
 the Communist Party. All legal religious literature and
 periodicals come under Communist Party supervision.
 Publishing houses and the news media, all state-owned, are
 self-censored under Communist Party guidelines. In cases
 where insufficient care is exercised, fines are imposed or
 editors may be fired.
 
 
 953
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Only a limited number of Western non-Communist periodicals are
 allowed into the country, and they are beyond the reach of
 ordinary citizens. Since the early 1970's libraries have
 restricted access to Western publications of a political
 character to individuals who have obtained special permission
 from their employers, documenting their need for the material
 for official purposes. Periodicals such as Time and Newsweek
 are locked in cabinets controlled by special personnel. Books
 and periodicals published within Czechoslovakia during the
 1968-69 period or other publications considered ideologically
 'harmful" are subject to similar controls.
 Printing and photocopying equipment, except typewriters, are
 controlled by the Ministry of Interior and cannot be legally
 obtained by individuals. Reproduction of printed materials is
 limited to 11 typewritten copies. For this reason, samizdat
 (self-published) materials are usually "published' by a chain
 of typists, each of whom produces the legally permitted 11
 copies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although freedom of assembly is protected in theory by the
 Constitution, it is tightly controlled in practice. Public
 meetings may be held only with permission of the police, and
 this permission is given only when the meeting supports state
 objectives. When the authorities wish to have a large rally
 (May Day or 'peace" demonstrations), people are often
 pressured to attend.
 All labor unions and professional groups are controlled by the
 Communist Party and are subordinated to it. Independent
 organizations are banned. An abortive attempt to form an
 independent trade union in the early 1980's was suppressed.
 At least one Czech (Jan Wunsch) is still in prison charged
 with 'subversion* because of his contacts with and support for
 the Polish independent trade union Solidarity.
 Membership in the official trade unions or professional
 associations is virtually obligatory for workers and those
 seeking to practice a profession. Strikes, collective
 bargaining, and lobbying are not permitted. Workers have
 little influence over production or economic planning,
 although they have had occasional successes in bringing about
 improvements in working conditions at the local level and in
 reducing production norms.
 The right and duty to work are guaranteed in the
 Constitution. In practice, people who are considered
 dissidents have difficulty retaining professional positions
 and are often forced into menial jobs, a practice which was
 condemned by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The
 same fate has befallen individuals purged from their jobs
 because they were considered politically unreliable.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government espouses *scientific atheism' as the only valid
 system of belief. Freedom of religion is provided for in the
 Constitution but is strictly limited in practice. Those who
 practice religion openly are effectively disqualified from
 advancement in many fields, although this is less true in
 Slovakia, a more traditionally Roman Catholic area, than in
 the Czech lands.
 
 
 954
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 In order to function legally in Czechoslovakia, a church must
 be officially registered. Religious groups that emphasize
 proselytizing, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, are
 banned outright, and their members suffer frequent harassment
 and arrest. Jehovah's Witnesses have been reported in several
 prisons, but they shun publicity, so there are no reliable
 estimates of their number.
 The Roman Catholic Church, which claims 11 million (at least
 nominal) adherents, is the largest of Czechoslovakia's 18
 officially registered religious bodies. The official press
 occasionally acknowledges that alongside the registered
 Catholic Church there exists an "underground Church" in
 Czechoslovakia, made up of secretly ordained priests and
 bishops, laymen and laywomen, and members of religious orders.
 Male orders are banned; female orders may exist legally but
 have not been allowed to accept new members for some time.
 There are no reliable estimates of the size of the
 "underground Church.'
 State control over the Catholic clergy begins in
 Czechoslovakia's two remaining seminaries (in Litomerice and
 Bratislava) where students, whose number is limited, need
 state approval to be admitted and to be ordained. In
 addition, the state must approve each priest's assignment to a
 parish or higher office. As a result of these restrictions,
 many priests have to cover more than one parish, and only 3 of
 Czechoslovakia's 13 dioceses have resident bishops.
 OPacem in Terris," the state-sponsored "peace association" of
 clergy has been a major instrument of state control over the
 Catholic Church since it was founded in 1970. The association
 has been losing ground since 1982 when the Vatican banned
 clergy participation in political organizations worldwide.
 Although Cardinal Tomasek and the overwhelming majority (as
 much as 80 percent according to one report) of the clergy in
 the Czech lands and Slovakia have disassociated themselves
 from "Pacem in Terris," priests associated with the
 organization have retained control of Katolicke noviny
 (Catholic News), the only legally published Catholic newspaper.
 The printing of religious literature is severely restricted,
 and Bibles are in short supply. A Czech-language Bible was
 published several years ago, but it has long since been sold
 out. There are no known plans for another printing run of the
 Bible. The gap is filled by Bibles smuggled in from abroad
 and by samizdat. Despite harassment and occasional prison
 terms for the 'publishers,' some 700 titles have been
 "published" on religious themes in samizdat.
 Activities and public statements by priests, including sermons
 and homilies, are closely monitored by the state. Priests who
 oppose "Pacem in Terris" or are believed to be associated with
 the "secret Church" are subject to harassment, which may
 include revocation of their licenses and/or prosecution on
 charges of "abusing religious office" or "obstructing state
 supervision over churches and religious societies." Two
 Catholic priests, Josef Kajnek and Adam Rucki, are known to
 have had their licenses revoked in 1984. There are no reports
 of large-scale detentions of Catholic activists in 1984, as
 there were in 1983. However, there have been complaints of
 mistreatment of individuals who gathered thousands of
 signatures on petitions inviting the Pope to visit
 
 
 955
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Czechoslovakia in 1985. Travel by official religious leaders
 to and from Czechoslovakia is usually authorized.
 The numerous Protestant denominations registered by the
 Government operate under similar constraints as the Catholic
 Church: proselytizing is forbidden; religious education is
 strictly forbidden and may not be organized in private homes;
 religious ceremonies are restricted for the most part to
 church premises (although some traditional pilgrimages are
 permitted); and education of clergymen is carefully limited.
 Protestant clergymen active in Charter 77 are subject to
 particular harassment: at least two ministers had their
 licenses revoked in 1984.
 The Jewish community, measuring several thousand, has a
 central religious organization, financially supported and
 controlled by the Government. There are synagogues and prayer
 houses open for worship. In addition, in Prague, there is a
 Jewish Museum operated by the state. There are no Jewish
 schools or rabbinical seminaries, but there are two rabbis,
 one in Prague and one in Bratislava.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Except for the restrictions imposed on political prisoners
 under the 'protective supervision' regime, freedom of movement
 within Czechoslovakia is generally not restricted, although
 travel in some areas near the western and southern borders or
 in the vicinity of military installations is prohibited.
 Travel to Western countries is difficult since travelers must
 obtain permission and, unless visiting close relatives, a hard
 currency authorization.   The number of such authorizations
 issued each year is far below the demand. Travelers to the
 West must usually leave some member of the immediate family at
 home to insure their return. These restrictions are often
 relaxed for retired persons.
 Travel by citizens of Czechoslovakia to other East European
 countries has become more difficult in recent years. A
 special passport is now required for trips to Yugoslavia, but
 so far this has failed to reduce the number of Czechoslovak
 citizens who defect to the West via Yugoslavia. Travel to
 Poland has been severely restricted since 1981. The
 restrictions were moderated somewhat in 1984 to permit group
 travel, visits to immediate -family, and travel for
 humanitarian or medical purposes. Travel to Hungary has been
 made more difficult by limiting the amount of currency which
 may be exchanged and the number of trips which may be made in
 one year. Citizens who are deemed politically 'unreliable'
 may find that they not only are denied permission to travel to
 the West; they also cannot visit other East European countries.
 The right to emigrate is extremely limited. It is generally
 enjoyed only by those wishing to join a foreign citizen
 spouse, or in the case of retired persons, foreign citizen
 children abroad. Others wishing to emigrate find their
 applications accepted, only in rare circumstances, and then
 only after a long and arduous wait. Those who do apply may
 suffer reprisals such as demotion or loss of employment after
 application. Czechoslovakia occasionally denies the right of
 repatriation by stripping the citizenship of those citizens it
 wishes to keep out. Emigration passports are not valid for
 
 
 956
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 return without special endorsement, and in some cases
 permanent exile is a condition for emigration or study
 abroad. Many former Czechoslovak citizens who wish to visit
 their former homeland are denied visas.  In 1984, the
 daughter of Charter 77 activist Jiri Dienstbier was permitted
 to accept a scholarship for university study in Austria (after
 being denied the opportunity to continue her education in
 Czechoslovakia). To get permission, however, she was required
 to relinquish her Czechoslovak citizenship.
 The only significant refugee group within the country is
 composed of Communists who have fled from non-Communist
 countries. The largest group in this category are Greeks, but
 others including Spaniards and Indonesians are known to reside
 in Czechoslovakia. There are no known instances of forced
 repatriations from this group. There is a moderate outflow of
 refugees from Czechoslovakia, primarily persons who leave the
 country legally on vacation to non-Warsaw Pact countries and
 do not return. This may amount to about 10,000 people
 annually, but precise statistics are unavailable.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All significant decisions regarding the Government, the
 economy, and society are made exclusively by the leadership of
 the Communist Party. Through its apparatus, the party
 leadership also determines who will be placed in
 decisionmaking positions not only within its own ranks, but
 also throughout the structures of state authority, economic
 decisionmaking, the media, and mass organizations. Real power
 is enjoyed by only a few top-level officials in the party
 Presidium and Secretariat.
 Ordinary citizens, especially those who are not party members,
 have no role in selecting their leaders or in making important
 political or economic decisions. Four minor political parties
 are permitted to organize and publish their own newspapers,
 but must conform their activities to Communist Party
 directives. All parties, together with the state-controlled
 mass organizations such as the Youth League, Trade Union
 Movement, and Women's League are represented in the National
 Front. This organization is completely controlled by the
 Communist Party. Among its tasks is the nomination of a
 single slate of candidates to stand unopposed at all
 elections. There is little evidence of meaningful public
 discussion of social, political, or economic issues. The
 Government has reacted to attempts to democratize the
 political process by arrest and imprisonment.
 Women are equal under the law, and there are small, token
 numbers of women in the professions and in higher-ranking
 party, government, and managerial positions. However, there
 is only one female member of the party Secretariat, and she
 holds her position ex officio as the Chairman of the Women's
 League. There are no female federal ministers or
 ambassadors.
 About 600,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Czechoslovakia,
 primarily in Slovakia along the border with Hungary. The
 state provides primary education in Hungarian in these areas,
 as well as Hungarian-language radio and television programs.
 Hungarians are proportionally represented in federal and local
 legislative bodies, but are underrepresented in prestigious
 
 
 957
 -CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 jobs in the economy and the state apparatus. Miklos Duray,
 mentioned in Section l.d., is in prison facing charges
 stemming from his activities on behalf of Hungarian minority
 rights.
 The Gypsies, who number about 250,000, are the only other
 sizable minority in Czechoslovakia. They are generally viewed
 by Czechs and Slovaks as occupying a lower social stratum.
 There is, however, an increasing number of Vietnamese laborers
 temporarily residing in Czechoslovakia. A February 1983
 Czechoslovak Press Agency release put their number at 30,000.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Czechoslovak Government reacts strongly to expressions of
 concern about human rights violations in Czechoslovakia either
 by other governments or by non-governmental institutions. For
 example, Czechoslovakia's practice of using political criteria
 in the field of employment and dismissals was the subject of a
 critical paragraph in the 1983 report of the ILO's Committee
 on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. In
 1984 the Czechoslovak Government refused to appear before the
 Committee to discuss the matter. It has delayed or denied
 visas to members of international human rights organizations
 such as the Helsinki Watch Committee and Amnesty
 International. Two groups within Czechoslovakia concern
 themselves with human rights. One is Charter 77, a group of
 individuals who signed a document first issued in January 1977
 which calls on the Government to honor its commitment to
 international arrangements on human rights, including the
 Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
 Europe, as well as human rights guarantees which exist at
 least on paper in the Czechoslovak Constitution. The second
 group, the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly
 Persecuted (known by its Czech initials VONS), uses public
 records and reports from friends and relatives of the accused
 to issue communiques in cases where it believes the police,
 the courts, or the prisons have abused citizens' human
 rights. These communiques are distributed to the Czechoslovak
 authorities. As noted in earlier sections of this report,
 members of both of these groups, together with the loosely
 organized network of religious activists concentrated in
 Slovakia, are targets of considerable persecution by the
 regime. In its 1984 report, Amnesty International cited its
 concern over the continued detention of prisoners of
 conscience in Czechoslovakia, as well as poor prison
 conditions, persecution of religious activists, harassment of
 former political prisoners by the authorities, and use of the
 death penalty. Freedom House rates Czechoslovakia "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In Czechoslovakia, a country of approximately 15.5 million
 inhabitants, the basic needs of food and health care are met,
 and the stable, largely urbanized population enjoys a
 reasonably adequate material existence. Health care is
 universally available through a national system administered
 and financed by the Government and paid for in part by
 employee deductions. There are reports, however, that prompt
 treatment is only secured through payment of bribes. Average
 life expectancy at birth is 72.2 years, and the infant
 mortality rate is 15.3 per 1,000 live births. There are
 
 
 958
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 occasional deficiencies of supplies and services, but these
 are attributable more to economic constraints or management
 deficiencies than to deliberate neglect of human needs. The
 average diet is more than adequate, with 140 percent of needed
 calorie supply for normal nutritional requirements available
 for consumption.
 Education is compulsory to 15 years of age. Literacy is
 nearly universal. Secondary and university education are free
 of charge, and opportunities exist for evening study at the
 advanced secondary and technical levels. However, there are
 many reports that the selection of students for courses and
 schools, particularly those leading to more desirable careers,
 is based on their parents' political standing and
 reliability. Official policies also deliberately favor
 children from workers' families in the admissions process.
 There has been criticism of the insertion of political
 criteria in admission to higher education.
 Czechoslovakia has had a rising standard of living since the
 end of World War II, but recent figures show a slowing down in
 the rate of growth. A pension system provides a minimum
 income; in addition, some retirees are allowed to supplement
 their pension payments by working. Nonetheless, access to
 goods and services varies significantly, with elites among
 Communist Party members, artists, and professional athletes
 enjoying privileges far above the norm.
 About 90 percent of Czechoslovak women of working age are
 employed. Most of them have lower-paying, less skilled jobs,
 although they tend to receive pay equal to that of their male
 colleagues in those positions. There are inconsistencies in
 the responsibilities women are asked to assume: they are
