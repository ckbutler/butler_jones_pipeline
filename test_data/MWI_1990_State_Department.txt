 MALAWI
 Malawi's political, economic, and social development has been
 dominated by Life President Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda ever
 since he led it to independence in 1964. Dr. Banda is also
 Life President of Malawi's sole legal party, the Malawi
 Congress Party (MCP). The Cabinet and Parliament are
 subordinate to the MCP Central Committee. Only candidates
 selected by the party and approved by the President may
 contest parliamentary elections. Constitutional amendments
 and laws passed by the Parliament mirror decisions already
 taken by President Banda.
 Police and party security organs--notably the Security and
 Intelligence Service (SIS), the MCP Youth League, and the
 Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP)--closely monitor a wide range of
 the population's activities. The Police Mobile Force and the
 youth groups committed serious human rights violations in
 1990. In contrast, the army has eschewed internal politics
 and is widely recognized for its professionalism.
 Small, densely populated, and landlocked, Malawi possesses few
 exploitable natural resources. While it is dependent on
 agriculture for export earnings and employment, sound policies
 have produced a national food surplus in most years. Malawi's
 human rights performance stands in sharp contrast to its
 economic achievements and humanitarian handling of Africa's
 largest refugee population.
 The Government and party continued in 1990 to control
 political life, including strict controls on freedom of press
 and assembly. Its use of long-term detention to control
 political opponents and critics was highlighted in 1990 by the
 death in prison of Gomile Kumtumanji, one of the independence
 heroes, who had been kept in detention for 21 years without
 charge or trial. However, by the end of 1990, the Government
 undertook a review of political detentions, and some detainees
 were released early in 1991; In March police used excessive
 force in quelling a public demonstration against corruption,
 killing 10 to 20 people. The Government clamped a total media
 blackout on the incident, but it did eventually dismiss the
 Inspector General of Police and initiate limited steps to
 upgrade the quality and training of police officers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political killings in 1990. However, on March
 18, in Lilongwe, the paramilitary Police Mobile Force fired
 automatic rifles into a crowd protesting alleged police
 corruption. Government secrecy prevented precise information
 on the events, but credible reports indicate the police killed
 between 10 and 20 persons. The crowd was protesting the
 killing of a driver by a local businessman who had a history
 of bribing police to ignore his mistreatment of his
 employees. The businessman was taken into protective custody
 and released once the public furor subsided. The Inspector
 General of Police was fired the following month.
 International human rights groups, including a report by the
 organization, Africa Watch, sharply criticized the excessive
 use of force by the police and the Government's handling of
 the incident.

 MALAWI
 In the murder case of Mkwapatira Mhango, public relations
 secretary of the Malawi Freedom Movement (MAFREMO), who lost
 his life along with most of his family when his home in Lusaka
 was firebombed on October 13, 1989, two Zambians and two
 Malawians (one of whom subsequently died in jail) were
 arrested in Lusaka as culpable agents of Malawi's security
 establishment. The Zambian High Court dismissed their
 applications for habeas corpus on February 6, and no further
 action was taken during the year.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of permanent disappearance for
 political reasons in 1990. There are frequently cases of
 temporarily missing persons as the Government almost never
 publishes the names of detainees and uses incommunicado
 detention in some instances, especially in political cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Allegations of institutionalized torture persist, but have not
 been proven. Beatings during arrest and detention are illegal
 but common. Guilty officers are rarely disciplined.
 Fred Sikwese, a Ministry of External Affairs official who died
 in March 1989 after being detained for espionage the previous
 month, probably died from internal injuries received while
 being beaten by his interrogators. The Government denied that
 torture had occurred, but it ignored the appeal of Amnesty
 International (AI) for an impartial investigation. Frackson
 Zgambo, an airport official who was detained with Sikwese, and
 who remains in detention without charge, told Malawian
 journalists who were allowed to visit him in November 1989
 that allegations of his torture were unfounded, but his
 ability to be candid while still in detention is questionable.
 Prison terms and conditions are harsh and frequently
 degrading, particularly in Nyachikadza Prison on the Shire
 River marshes in southern Malawi, where malaria is also a
 constant danger. Women appear to be particularly ill-treated,
 including at the country's main prison in Zomba. Reports
 persist that many become pregnant by their warders and that
 their babies are severely malnourished due to their mothers'
 poor diet.
 Prison visits by responsible officials in 1989 appear to have
 curbe& some of the worst abuses; in 1990 prisons were
 providing better diets, access to reading materials, family
 visits and less physical abuse.
 Malawi's most celebrated prisoners, Orton and Vera Chirwa,
 remained in Zomba Central Prison. Orton Chirwa, colonial
 Nyasaland's first African lawyer and Malawi's first Minister
 of Justice, is now 72 years old and is believed to be in poor
 health. Vera Chirwa shares a cellblock with Margaret Marango
 Banda, a prominent Anglican women's lay leader (and Aleke
 Banda's cousin--see Section l.d.) who was detained in the
 summer of 1988 upon her return from a church conference in
 England, where she allegedly met with dissident Malawians.
 Ms. Chirwa and Ms. Banda exercise outdoors together, but the
 terms of their solitary confinement prohibit them from
 speaking with one another. They are denied access to visiting
 clergy which minister to the prison's other inmates. Their
 diet is insufficient, and the fact that they send their milk
 
 
 214
 MALAWI
 rations to imprisoned mothers with small children further
 reduces their caloric intake. Ms. Banda, who apparently
 suffers from diabetes, is believed to be in poor health and to
 receive inadequate medical attention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Preservation of Public Security Act, the Minister of
 Justice (a position held by President Banda) may order the
 arrest, search, and detention of persons considered a threat
 to the preservation of public order. The Act was amended in
 1977 to eliminate a 30-day limit. Persons arrested under this
 law can be, and usually are, detained without charge or
 trial. The President is supposed to review such cases every 6
 months, but this constitutional safeguard has had no
 observable effect.
 For example, when Malawi's longest serving political prisoner,
 Martin Mwachipisa Munthali, served out his 10-year sentence
 for illegal possession of firearms in 1975, he was immediately
 redetained without charge and remained in prison at the end of
 1990. Kalusa Chimombo, another long term political prisoner
 and a prominent member of the Teachers Association before his
 detention in 1978, remained in prison at year's end. AI
 alleges that Chimombo's crime was to forget the "life" from
 Life President Banda's title when offering the obligatory
 thanksgiving to the Chief of State at a teachers' function.
 Police officers may also arrest persons on their own authority
 for up to 28 days before a formal detention order is served.
 In fact, persons often have been held for months before being
 served detention papers. In April, after the March shooting,
 the appointment of a new Inspector General of Police led to
 improved police performance in ensuring that nonpolitical
 detainees were processed within the 28-day limit. In
 addition, to raise the caliber of police, the new Inspector
 General instituted a requirement for a college diploma for
 entry into the force and solicited over 200 applications from
 the University of Malawi.
 The Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP), an agroparamilitary youth
 wing of the MCP, legally has the same powers of arrest as the
 police but has been prevented by the police from exercising
 them. The MYP keeps a small detention center at its main
 Mountain View Training Camp near Blantyre. New MYP detentions
 are rare.
 Detentions that have occurred or come to light in 1990
 include: Ishmael Mazunda, a senior medical tutor at a
 teaching hospital near Blantyre, who was detained in November
 1989 after he helped expel students caught stealing and using
 drugs (their parents were influential party members); Lyton
 Kapenda, a secondary school teacher in Rumphi, who was
 detained in December 1989 after complaining about government
 discrimination against northerners; Dr. Mvura, a retired
 veterinary surgeon in Mzuzu, who was detained in July 1990
 also after complaining of antinorthern discrimination; and
 Oscar Mhango, who was detained in Blantyre in August 1990
 after asking rhetorically why political pluralism should not
 come to Malawi. Like most detainees in Malawi, these persons
 were held incommunicado.
 Other detainees whose cases continue to draw international
 attention include: Brown Mpinganjira, former deputy chief of
 Information, detained in 1986 for providing information to a
 
 
 215
 MALAWI
 foreign journalist; Dr. Goodluck Mhango, a veterinary surgeon
 with the MYP, detained in September 1987 because his brother
 (murdered in 1989) wrote articles critical of the Government;
 Professor Jack Mapanje, head of the University of Malawi's
 Department of Literature, detained as well in September 1987
 for planning to publish a volume of poetry deemed critical of
 the President; Professor Blaise Machira, who reportedly
 suffers from mental illness, detained in April 1988 for
 denouncing President Banda: Alfred Chiluwe and Gilbert Gwaza,
 government statisticians detained in May 1988 after allegedly
 contacting dissidents while studying in the United States; and
 Dr. George Mtafu, Malawi's only neurosurgeon, detained in
 February 1989 after remarking on the President's mental acuity.
 Independence hero Gomile Kumtumanji--who had held more cabinet
 and senior party posts than any other official when he was
 detained in 1969--died in Zomba Prison on April 13, without
 ever having been charged. When the prison's commissioner
 released the body to Kumtumanji's family, the commissioner and
 his deputy were briefly detained and subsequently fired.
 Aleke Banda, once a confidant and likely successor to
 President Banda (no relation), was quietly released from
 Mikuyu prison in late 1988 and is currently restricted to a
 house on Mpyupyu Prison Farm near Zomba. Banda's terms of
 confinement continued to improve in 1990, and he is now
 allowed periodic visits from family members. He is still
 denied a radio and reading material. Detained in 1980, Aleke
 Banda has never been charged.
 Government secrecy precludes an accurate estimate of political
 detainees in Malawi, but at the end of 1990 experienced
 observers put the number at under 100 and possibly no more
 than 50. However, as the Government releases political
 prisoners the same way it detains them--in secret, it is
 difficult to confirm reports of releases of detainees.
 While forced exile has not been used as a means of political
 control, there is a small but constant exodus of persons who
 leave for political reasons. Many students and some
 government officials studying abroad never come back. In late
 1988, the chairman of the Malawi National Education Board,
 Donton Mkandawire, was dismissed for allegedly packing the
 education system with fellow northerners. Fearing detention,
 he fled to Botswana.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Malawi has both traditional and European court systems. Legal
 counsel is permitted only in the modern courts. The right of
 appeal exists in both systems. Both are empowered to try
 capital offenses, including treason, but the modern courts in
 practice hear mostly civil cases. Neither judiciary is
 independent. Although executive interference is infrequent,
 the Presidency does not hesitate to intervene in cases of
 interest to it, particularly those of a political or security
 nature. Last year, the Prisons Service refused--with no legal
 justification--to free inmates whose release was ordered by
 the Appeals Court.
 The European court system consists of the magistrate courts,
 the High Court, and the Supreme Court of Appeal. The
 President appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court and,
 after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission, other
 court justices   Most are well qualified, but magistrates tend
 to be recent law school graduates with limited experience.
 
 
 216
 MALAWI
 The courts are open to the public, and defendants are charged
 publicly. Crowded dockets, however, can delay serious cases
 from being heard for up to 4 years. In criminal cases, the
 defendant waits in prison during the interval. The Government
 has a modest legal aid scheme, but its overworked lawyers
 cannot hope to meet the demands placed on it.
 Most political cases do not come before the regular courts.
 This is also true in cases involving alleged corruption by
 government officers. While many such officials fired by the
 President in recent years may have transgressed the Civil
 Service's strict code of probity, innocent civil servants have
 suffered as well without'benefit of a fair hearing. In
 December 1989, for example, President Banda sacked one of his
 Government's most capable senior civil servants for alleged
 disloyalty. The government-run radio added subversion to the
 allegations against him, although this charge appears to have
 been dropped after his interrogation by the SIS, and he was
 released. The civil servant lost all pension rights despite
 25 years of dedicated government service.
 The traditional courts, which try over 90 percent of all
 criminal cases, are the most accessible to the average
 Malawian. Over 300 traditional courts, dispersed among
 Malawi's 24 districts and 3 regions., hear several hundred
 thousand civil and criminal cases each year. Traditional
 court justices are appointed directly by the President,
 including to the National Traditional Appeal Court. In
 practice, they are drawn from the ranks of MCP officers and
 exercise their party responsibilities concurrently. Police
 officials handle the prosecution, and defendants conduct their
 own defense.
 Each district has at least one specially trained traditional
 court officer (TCO) who is required to visit each court at
 least once a month. The TCO, a relatively senior civil
 servant, may petition the commissioner of traditional courts
 for remedial action, to include acquittal or a stiffer
 sentence. Recognizing its dependence on well-qualified TCO's,
 the Government began a special training course in late 1990 to
 upgrade their skills and also started a program to recruit
 female TCO's.
 The Executive Branch seldom interferes in traditional court
 cases but does so routinely in political and security cases.
 For example, the President directed that the Chirwas be tried
 by a traditional court in 1983, where few, if any, procedural
 safeguards are available. He subsequently commuted their
 death sentences to life imprisonment. Many human rights
 organizations, including AI, continue to call for the Chirwas'
 release and stress their 1983 trial was "grossly unfair."
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the
 property rights of those suspected of economic crimes such as
 illegal currency transactions. These revocations sometimes
 have political overtones and have been heavily weighted
 against the Asian community. When the Forfeiture Act is
 invoked, the person loses all worldly possessions, including
 business, financial, and personal assets. Revocation of
 property rights is carried out by executive fiat with no
 judicial review. The Forfeiture Act has not been invoked
 since 1988. In 1990 cases from previous years were reviewed
 and, in a few instances, partial restitution was made for the
 first time.
 
 
 MALAWI
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police may enter houses of suspects at will under special
 entry authority to conduct searches for incriminating evidence
 or suspects. Telephones are routinely tapped, and an
 extensive network of informers reports private statements and
 actions to the Government. Authorities open some domestic and
 international mail.
 Malawian law permits the Government to designate certain
 districts as "special areas" where citizens may be stopped,
 questioned and searched on the street. Most special area
 districts are in the north.
 Membership in the ruling Malawi Congress Party is not legally
 mandatory, but it is frequently coerced. Based on the 1987
 census, over 7a percent of the adult population holds at least
 nominal party membership. Membership is expected of those who
 seek access to government services or entrance to local
 markets. The annual renewal fee is only about 35 cents, but
 this can equal a day's pay for a minimum wage earner in rural
 areas. When, the President visits an area, financial
 contributions from individuals and businesses are also levied.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech is severely circumscribed in Malawi. It is an
 offense, punishable by 5 years' imprisonment, to publish
 anything likely "to undermine the authority of, or public
 confidence in, the Government." It is punishable by life
 imprisonment to send out of the country "false information"
 which may be "harmful to the interests or good name of
 Malawi." In practice, giving critical information to foreign
 journalists can result in detention without trial. Any
 discussion of Malawi's politidal future or speculation about
 the President's age is also prohibited. Local media do not
 submit material to the Government beforehand but exercise
 careful self-censorship. Even so, journalists, including
 senior editors, have been jailed for extended periods after
 overstepping undefined boundaries.
 Malawi's two newspapers and government-owned radio exist
 primarily to catalog the President's words and deeds. There
 was considerable print coverage on worldwide democratic
 developments during 1990, but the radio, which reaches the
 less literate majority of Malawi's population, afforded little
 coverage of such trends. Criticism of various government
 departments' efficiency occasionally appears in the newspapers
 and often in parliamentary debate.
 Foreign journalists must request permission to enter Malawi
 and specify in advance the topics they intend to cover. The
 Government continues to permit some Western journalists to
 visit Malawi. Two foreign journalists, who were based in
 Malawi and had written articles the Government considered
 critical, could not get their visas renewed in 1990, and they
 left.
 All publications, posters, recordings, and movies entering
 Malawi are screened and edited by the Censorship Board. The
 current list of banned items includes over 1,300 titles.
 
 
 MALAWI
 Limited academic freedom of inquiry into the natural and
 social sciences exists at the University of Malawi. Its
 Center for Social Research undertakes and publishes research
 on politically sensitive subjects such as the extent of
 malnutrition in Malawi. There was no negative impact on the
 Center after a criticial N.Y. Times article was published.
 Academic freedom, however, is circumscribed. Academics have
 been detained in the past, but there were no such incidents in
 1990. There is no government or political science faculty at
 the University. President Banda is nominally the latter's
 Chancellor, while the MCP Treasurer General exerts a more
 direct hand as Chairman of the University Council. A proposal
 to create a private univdrsity was turned down a few years ago
 by President Banda.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political meetings are not permitted outside the framework of
 the Malawi Congress Party. Persons may be imprisoned if they
 further the aims of an "unlawful society", defined as "any
 group considered to be dangerous to the good government of the
 Republic." A gathering of three or more persons can be
 construed as an unlawful assembly under Malawian law.
 In the nonpolitical sphere, individuals and organizations
 generally are free to meet and associate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state or preferred religion, but religious groups
 are required to register with the Government. Jehovah's
 Witnesses, whose religious convictions prevent them from
 joining the MCP or any other political party, have been banned
 since 1967. In 1989, a Jehovah's Witness representative
 reported that whole families were arrested in the period
 1986-88 and were still in Dzeleka Prison. Other reports
 indicate that Witnesses are.also held in Zomba Prison. The
 Government appeared to suspend its persecution of Witnesses in
 1990, but at year's end showed signs of breaking a tacit truce
 with the controversial sect. Following a critical remark by
 President Banda, Finance Minister and Central Region Party
 Chairman Louis Chimango railed against the Jehovah's Witnesses
 on December 2 for trying to persuade people not to renew party
 memberships. Chimango threatened "punitive measures."
 In October 17, 1989, a group of MCP youth leaguers, tasked
 with rounding up dancers for President Banda's annual mothers'
 day stadium ceremony in Blantyre, beat up a dozen women
 belonging to the Bible Believers, who protested that their
 sect prohibits dancing. This excessive zeal may have
 contributed to the dismissal of the regional party chairman.
 Religious groups generally may establish places of worship and
 train clergy. Religious publications, like others, may not
 criticize the Government or the party. Most religious groups
 are free to establish and maintain links with coreligionists
 in other countries, and members are free to travel abroad.
 Malawi's sizable Muslim minority (estimated at 20 percent of
 the population) conducts its religion and builds mosques
 freely. Foreign Islamic organizations have been allowed to
 fund the latter. President Banda publicly and repeatedly
 stresses the importance of providing the same rights and civic
 services to Muslims which the Christian majority enjoys.
 
 
 MALAWI
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Legal provisions exist for restricting movement of those
 convicted of political or criminal offenses. Denial of
 passports on political grounds is more common and frequently
 extends to family members of persons in political disfavor, as
 well as to those persons the Government suspects may. criticize
 it if allowed to travel abroad. Civil servants-and employees
 of state-owned enterprises must obtain written permission to
 travel abroad, even on vacation. Obtaining such a clearance
 can take up to several months. Formal emigration is neither
 restricted nor encouraged. However, Asian residents and
 citizens, while free to travel within the country, must reside
 and work in one of four urban areas (Lilongwe, Zomba, Mzuzu,
 and Blantyre/LimbeY. In Lilongwe, a planned capital, they
 must also live within certain neighborhoods.
 Malawi hosts the largest refugee population in Africa. Over
 900,000 Mozambicans--more than 10 percent of Malawi's
 population--are now located in rural areas in 11 districts.
 Some of the refugees live in camp-like situations, but many
 live within or adjacent to existing villages. In both cases,
 their presence has increased deforestation and put pressure on
 scarce arable land. The strain on Malawi's economy, as well
 as its transportation and social services networks, has been
 severe. Although signs appeared in 1990 that Malawi's rural
 population has tired of the refugee burden, President Banda
 still insisted that Malawi will continue to offer asylum to
 all who are forced to flee Mozambique's civil war.
 Similarly, President Banda has emphasized that Malawi will
 never be a party to forced repatriation, and government
 officials have maintained that stance in dealing with the
 Mozambican Government and the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) on repatriation. The Government has
 generously shared its own limited resources and has cooperated
 enthusiastically with international relief efforts. The
 latter are coordinated by a committee chaired by the Ministry
 of Health. The UNHCR and other international assistance
 groups travel freely to assess relief needs and to investigate
 allegations of protection problems. UNHCR officals recognize
 Malawi's refugee performance as one of the best in the world.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Malawi cannot change their national government
 through democratic means. Major, and many minor, political
 decisions are made by the President or his closest
 associates. Opposition political parties or movements are
 prohibited, but there are externally based political
 opposition movements such as the Malawi Freedom Movement, the
 Socialist League of Malawi, Congress for a Second Republic,
 and the Malawi Democratic Union.
 The Malawi Congress Party structure provides for some choice
 among candidates for party (every 3 years), parliamentary
 (every 5 years), and other offices--all by secret ballot.
 All nominees for political seats, however, are carefully
 selected by the MCP and approved by the President. Public
 campaigning, which might publicize or encourage a charismatic
 leader, is not permitted. The National Assembly, consisting
 of both elected and a few appointed members, is mainly
 
 
 220
 MALAWI
 concerned with ratifying government policy. Its powers are
 broadly based in law but highly circumscribed in practice.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local nongovernmental human rights organizations are not
 permitted. The Malawi Law Society in recent years has been
 able to debate in public aspects of existing law but has not
 addressed human rights issues directly. The Law Society
 represents both government and private lawyers.
 The Government does not welcome foreign intercession and does
 not permit organizations such as the International Committee
 of the Red Cross and AI to visit prisons or conduct human
 rights investigations in Malawi. A specific request from AI
 to do so was turned down in 1990. The President apparently
 took into account international appeals in 1984 when he
 commuted the death sentences meted out the previous year to
 the Chirwas, but he has since declined all appeals for
 clemency in their cases. Similarly, in 1989, he rejected high
 level foreign'representations, delivered in person, on behalf
 of Margaret Marengo Banda, Professor Jack Mapanje, and Dr.
 George Mtafu. During most of 1990, there was no official
 response to human rights concerns raised by the U.S.
 Ambassador and other Western envoys with senior government and
 party officials. However, in December, the Government
 undertook a review of political detentions, and some detainees
 were released in 1991.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are strong regional differences between the north and
 the south. Northerners have experienced considerable
 discrimination by the Government in the past, most recently in
 1989 when President Banda lent his weight to a campaign which
 resulted in many northerners losing jobs in the south and
 being forced to return to their region or into exile abroad.
 Most of the 20 to 30 prominent northerners arrested in 1989
 remained in detention without charge or trial at the end of
 1990. In 1990 the Government sought to downplay regionalism
 as a domestic issue, and some northerners continued to hold
 important positions, notably within the Ministry of Justice,
 including the posts of Solicitor General and Chief Public
 Prosecutor. They are currently represented on the Supreme
 Court of Appeals.
 Asian residents, whether Malawian citizens or not, have been
 compelled to transfer ownership of rural shops and trucking
 businesses to ethnic Africans. Strict rules govern where
 Asians may own property, although these have been relaxed
 somewhat in practice. Changes in the citizenship law in 1986
 eliminated a provision whereby persons who held foreign
 passports could reside indefinitely in Malawi and raised the
 possibility that Asian children born in Malawi would become
 stateless persons in their own country. These developments
 have led many in the small but prosperous Asian community of
 about 5,000 persons to leave Malawi and others to question
 their long-term future there.
 In contrast, Malawi's first lady, C. Tamanda Kadzamira, went
 to considerable lengths in 1989 and 1990 to draw Asian women
 into her new National Women's Development Organization (CCAM),
 
 
 221
 MALAWI
 and encouraged several to play prominent and responsible roles
 in the movement. In Malawi's influential urban areas, the
 CCAM has largely eclipsed the MCP's Women's League. Like
 other party organs, the latter is not open to Malawians of
 Asian or European descent.
 In Malawi women are equal under the law. However, males have
 an advantage in education, reflecting Malawi's still very
 traditional society. Although tribal leadership structures
 remain primarily matrilineal, women do not have opportunities
 equal to those of men. Most women are unable to complete even
 a primary education and are at a serious disadvantage in the
 job market.
 The Government has initiated broad programs to reverse
 existing discrimination against women. The Government has
 cooperated enthusiastically with international donor agencies
 seeking to enhance educational opportunities for women at all
 levels, e.g., with U.S.-assisted programs to enable women
 university students to pursue studies in nontraditional fields
 such as engineering, and to advance women's basic education.
 In the secondary school system, 35 percent of the places have
 been reserved for women.
 The Government is also slowly giving recognition to the-
 importance of women as agricultural producers, as
 approximately 70 percent of all smallholder farms, and over 50
 percent of subsistence holdings are headed by women. The
 Ministry of Agriculture now has a separate women's extension
 program specifically designed to accommodate their needs.
 Women enjoy access to maternal health services and to
 extension programs, but infant and child mortality, mainly due
 to malnutrition, remain extremely high. In practice, women
 are often disadvantaged under the law through ignorance. The
 fledgling National Commission of Women in Development began a
 project in late 1989 to educate women on their legal rights.
 There is no tradition of violence against women. President
 Banda has made his opposition to any mistreatment of women
 very clear. Several small ethnic groups continue to practice
 female circumcision.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Only nongovernment workers have the legal right to associate
 and to form and join trade unions. Unions represent 10 to 20
 percent of Malawi's small wage-earning labor force, and most
 organized wage workers are unskilled laborers on large
 agricultural estates. Unions are required by law to affiliate
 with the Trade Union Congress of Malawi (TUCM). The TUCM,
 like both the Employers Consultative Group and the Associated
 Chambers of Commerce, is a private organization independent of
 the Malawi Congress Party. In practice, however, union
 activities are highly circumscribed by the Government.
 Restrictive colonial labor legislation has been subsumed into
 Malawian law largely intact.
 Malawi law permits strikes, but these are extremely rare.
 Ministry of Labor officers are quick to intervene at the first
 hint of labor unrest. Management-labor councils also mediate
 labor issues at the workplace.
 
 
 222
 MALAWI
 Under government supervision, the TUCM associates with
 international organizations and is a member of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity, the Southern
 African Trade Union Coordination Council, and the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. With
 government approval, the TUCM receives practical and financial
 assistance from the American Federation of Labor and Congress
 of International Organizations and other Western labor
 organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the legal right to organize, but the law does
 little to restrict antiunion discrimination by employers.
 Complaints are resolved by the Ministry of Labor. Collective
 bargaining is protected by law, but its use is limited by
 market realities. The Government does not intervene overtly
 in the collective bargaining process. There are no export
 processing or free trade zones in Malawi, although the concept
 is under study. Labor legislation is applied uniformly
 throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor, which was widely practiced during colonial
 times, has never been formally outlawed, but it is opposed by
 the Government and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age is 14, but this applies only to the
 small urban wage sector where it is enforced by labor
 inspectors from the Ministry of Labor. In the large
 subsistence agriculture sector, where most Malawians work,
 children help on family farms at a younger age. Many also
 work on plantations where they are paid substantially less
 than the minimum wage.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Less than 15 percent of the work force is employed in the
 formal wage sector. In May 1989, minimum daily wages nearly
 doubled in Malawi's three cities, to 80 cents; wage rates in
 rural areas increased to 65 cents per day. In practice, wages
 for experienced skilled workers are increasing sharply as the
 supply diminishes. Large numbers of skilled workers are
 finding better paying jobs in South Africa, Botswana, and
 Zimbabwe. Workers in rural areas, however, are still poorly
 paid. Perhaps half receive less than the minimum wage.
 For those fortunate enough to hold paying jobs, wages and
 working conditions are generally adequate to maintain a decent
 standard of living. Malawi's low wage levels reflect the
 abundance of unskilled labor and the Government's policy of
 limiting the urban-rural income gap to stem migration into the
 towns. Wage earners fare slightly better than the vast
 majority of the population which works in subsistence
 agriculture. Many subsistence farmers supplement their
 earnings by also working as tenants on nearby estates. Labor
 laws address normal employment practices but do not cover
 tenancy agreements, and abuses are widespread.
 Paid holidays and safety standards in the workplace are
 required by law. However, enforcement of safety standards by
 Ministry of Labor inspectors is erratic.
