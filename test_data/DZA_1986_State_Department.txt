 ALGERIA
 According to its Constitution, Algeria is a Socialist, Islamic
 state in which ultimate power is vested in a single political
 party, the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN). As Secretary
 General of the party, President of the Republic, and Minister
 of Defense, Chadli Bendjedid holds the key decisionmaking
 positions. Nonetheless, most important decisions are taken by
 consensus involving the military, the Government, and the
 party elites. These elites are bound together by the common
 experience of a harsh struggle for independence, obtained from
 France in 1962. A sense of "revolutionary, anticolonial
 mission" is basic to their self-perception of what Algeria is
 and ought to be. This revolutionary consensus is the principal
 source of popular legitimacy for the Government and the nation.
 In January 1986 Algerian voters overwhelmingly approved a
 referendum on revisions to the National Charter, the country's
 basic political document, first promulgated in 1976. Though
 retaining Algeria's Socialist orientation, the revised Charter
 places increased emphasis on the Islamic roots of the country's
 political and economic system and calls for greater private
 sector participation in service and light industries and the
 achievement of agricultural self-sufficiency. The current
 5-year plan (1985-1989) reaffirms the Government's shift in
 emphasis from heavy industry to development of agriculture,
 job creation, and the satisfaction of unmet social needs in
 the fields of housing, education, and health. The major
 decline in 1986 of government hydrocarbon revenues has
 adversely affected performance in some of these areas, as has
 the continued high rate of population growth.
 Urban police and the rural-oriented gendarmerie generally
 adhere to constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment. Military security forces, in practice, are
 given greater leeway to make arrests, and there are charges of
 abuse and torture. Those making such charges have not,
 however, been able to document them.
 Although the Constitution contains human rights guarantees,
 civil liberties remain restricted. Political rights, in
 particular, are circumscribed by the party and the Government
 which limit the electoral choices and restrict public debate
 to officially sanctioned forums and issues. A number of
 prominent human rights activists have been imprisoned and
 otherwise penalized for their activities. Algerians have the
 right to possess private property and are generally free to
 pursue private interests without state interference. Some
 Berber elements claim to'be the object of discriminatory
 treatment. The Government, however, has sought to reduce
 tensions with Berbers, who constitute from one-fourth to
 one-third of the population, by accommodating some of their
 cultural demands and investing heavily in the development of
 Berber-dominated areas.
 The human rights situation remained essentially unchanged in
 1986 except for the Government's forced repatriation in May of
 between 20,000 to 30,000 drought victims from Niger and Mali
 who had sought refuge in southern Algeria over the previous
 2 years. Although there had been increasing confrontation
 between the Government and the Berber minority in 1985, there
 were no overt confrontations in 1986, and a few members of two
 illegal, predominantly Berber organizations were released
 after completing their sentences. Others serving longer
 sentences remain in prison, as do a group of political

 oppositionists arrested 2 years ago who are still awaiting
 trial.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are not
 condoned nor known to be practiced. There were no accusations
 of such practices in 1986.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and in 1986 there were no
 confirmed reports of torture. However, Amnesty International's
 1986 Annual Report, covering the year 1985, said it had
 received reports of torture and other ill-treatment of
 prisoners.
 Persons convicted of civil crimes are sent to provincial civil
 prisons, while those found guilty of more serious crimes
 against the State, such as treason or terrorism, or those who
 have committed crimes which carry the death penalty, such as
 murder, kidnaping, or rape, are sent to one of three
 penitentiaries. Conditions in both types of institutions
 range from primitive to modern; conditions in penitentiaries
 are reportedly worse than those found in the more numerous
 civil prisons. In the primary civil prison in Algiers,
 prisoners are often crowded together, and sanitary arrangements
 are poor. Better conditions are found in some outlying
 prisons. Although all prisons have medical facilities, and
 each prison has a contract with a local doctor who visits the
 prison regularly to treat ill prisoners, medical care is
 generally rudimentary. Seriously ill prisoners may be sent to
 local hospitals. Prisoners in both civil prisons and
 penitentiaries are fed a bland, starchy diet, and long-term
 prisoners rely on family support to augment this diet.
 Families are allowed to visit civil prisons once a week; it is
 considerably more difficult to visit prisoners held in
 penitentiaries. At the discretion of local prison authorities,
 conjugal visits are sometimes permitted in civil prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that no one may be prosecuted,
 arrested, or held except as provided by law. It also provides
 that detention for questioning in criminal investigation cases
 cannot exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be charged
 or released. The penal code provides for informing detainees
 immediately of charges against them. Algerian law does not
 include a bail system. Lawyers are allowed access to their
 clients at any time. Meetings take place under the visual
 supervision of a guard.
 Despite these constitutional safeguards, military security
 forces have held suspects up to a month before releasing or
 charging them. Military security, officials are authorized to
 
 
 1104
 ALGERIA
 investigate not only military offenses but also cases
 involving internal security and espionage. In cases that
 involve subversion, they may also investigate civil crimes.
 Once charged, an individual may be held under preventive
 detention while his case is investigated. This detention can
 last years: as of October 1986, an undetermined number of
 political oppositionists (perhaps as many as 15) associated
 with former President Ben Bella remained in prison. They
 reportedly were arrested for distributing antigovernment
 tracts 2 years ago and are still awaiting trial.
 Persons arrested for the expression of views critical of or
 different from those of the Government are generally charged
 with disturbing the public order, associating with illegal
 organizations, or, in extreme cases, threatening state
 security. Recent sentences of persons convicted of these
 crimes range from 1 year to life imprisonment. Amnesty
 International has noted its concern about cases of prolonged
 incommunicado detention.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have free access to counsel, and there is no
 harassment of defense counsel. As far as is known, defendants
 are made fully aware of the charges against them at the time
 they are bound over for trial. Trials are public, although
 not generally publicized, and defendants have the right to
 appeal. The judicial system is divided into three parts:
 civil courts, military courts, and the State Security Court.
 There are no Islamic courts in Algeria.
 The civil courts are generally independent of executive or
 military control. Military courts deal directly with espionage
 and with offenses committed by military personnel. The State
 Security Court at Medea is not in permanent session but has
 jurisdiction over cases that are deemed "to endanger the
 national security." At least a ministerial-level decision is
 required to refer a case to the State Security Court which
 generally provides procedural protection similar to that of
 civilian courts. Interested observers are allowed to attend
 trials held in this court.
 In its 1986 Report covering 1985, Amnesty International said
 it was concerned by reports that confessions presented as
 evidence in one trial of 40 detainees had been obtained under
 torture.
 All political prisoners arrested prior to February 1979,
 including former President Ben Bella, have been released since
 President Bendjedid took office. The Government has continued
 to encourage additional supporters of Ben Bella to return.
 Ben Bella himself has remained abroad. Following a letter-
 writing campaign by Amnesty International, the internationally
 known human rights lawyer Ali Yahia Abdennour, convicted in
 December 1985 for helping to found the Algerian Human Rights
 League earlier in the year, was released in June upon
 completing an 11-month sentence. Also released in June was
 Nourredine Ait Hamouda, son of a famous revolutionary war hero
 who had been convicted.along with Ali Yahia for membership in
 both the Human Rights League and another illegal, predominantly
 Borber organization, the Sons of Martyrs of the Revolution.
 
 
 1105
 ALGERIA
 Other defendants in the case who received longer sentences
 remain in prison.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Membership in political organizations is not required, except
 for senior government and military officials who must be
 members of the party. There is an efficient police force
 responsible for tracking possible sources of dissent, which is
 believed to use informer systems. Telephone monitoring systems
 are believed to be used, rarely with prior court authorization.
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally is honored in practice except in cases involving
 military security. Police may not enter a house without a
 warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating magistrate,
 nor may they enter a residence during night hours.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it
 also states that such freedom may not be used to "undermine the
 foundations of the Socialist revolution." All print media are
 published either by the Government or the party, and all
 journalists are government employees. The distribution of
 foreign newspapers and magazines is controlled.
 Some foreign publications are available in small quantities.
 However, the French-language weekly Jeune Afrique is
 proscribed, and the French daily Le Monde is occasionally
 seized. Radio and television stations are also government
 controlled. The Government does not permit criticism of its
 authority, of socialism, or of the one-party system. Criticism
 of specific domestic programs and policies as well as the
 performance of government utilities and state enterprises is
 allowed, including on state-run television and in the weekly
 organ of the ruling FLN party, Revolution Africaine.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All nongovernment associations must be approved by state
 authorities who have traditionally refused to recognize groups
 with political, economic, or social views that differ from
 those of the FLN. There is only one legal political party and
 one labor union, the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA).
 These and other mass organizations for youth, women, farmers,
 veterans, and professional groups are all tightly controlled
 by the party and constitute the primary government-recognized
 associations. They play key political roles in mobilizing
 popular support for various government programs and elections
 and maintain relations with recognized international bodies in
 their fields, such as the International Labor Organization.
 Workers and employers do not have the right to organize
 independent unions. Strikes are illegal in the public sector,
 but workers have successfully used strikes and work stoppages,
 without sanction of the national union, to win more pay and
 protect benefits. Most labor-management disputes, however,
 are solved by union representatives and Labor Ministry
 inspectors meeting with managers. While collective bargaining
 in the strict Western sense is not practiced, the UGTA does
 
 
 1106
 ALGERIA
 engage in industry-wide negotiations on behalf of workers
 under its umbrella.
 Although individuals are technically free to assemble, security
 personnel watch public gatherings closely, and all nonparty
 associations must receive government recognition to exist
 legally. Unlike in previous years, no major demonstrations
 resulting in significant arrests occurred in 1986. However,
 both the Human Rights League and the Sons of Martyrs groups
 continue to be refused official recognition.
 Some very limited political opposition, such as student
 demonstrations, is tolerated. Opposition political tracts are
 sometimes circulated, almost certainly with official knowledge,
 but persons caught with them may be subject to arrest.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Legally an Islamic state, Algeria protects the rights of the
 very small Christian and Jewish minorities to worship in their
 churches and synagogues. There is little evidence of
 individual prejudice. Proselytizing is not permitted. The
 Christian clergy directs its activities to the non-Muslim
 non-Algerian community.
 The Islamic clergy is government trained. Friday sermons are
 not formally censored, but government monitoring constrains
 the clergy's freedom of expression. Religious travel such as
 the pilgrimage to Mecca is government organized.
 Fundamentalists responsible fpr an August 1985 attack on a
 police academy outside Algiers remained at large at the end of
 1986. The fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood is banned, and
 its members are reportedly subject to police harassment. This
 group is rooted in a centuries-old tradition of North African
 mysticism and has been used as a vehicle for propagating
 fundamentalist ideas such as the creation of an Islamic state
 in Algeria that would subordinate secular authority to that of
 religious leaders.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 guaranteed by law and generally is respected in practice. One
 of the first acts of the Bendjedid Government was to remove
 the exit visa requirement. However, the human rights lawyer,
 Ali Yahia Abdennour, was prevented by authorities from leaving
 Algeria after his release from prison in June when his passport
 was taken from him at the airport as he was attempting to leave
 Algeria to attend a human rights meeting in Paris. Government
 permission is necessary to travel to Morocco. Men who are
 19 years or older must have proof of completion of mandatory
 2-year military service, and employees of state organizations
 who are paying back educational scholarships through work must
 have valid leave papers to exit the country. Passports may
 sometimes take months to acquire, although this situation is
 improving. The amount of hard currency which Algerians may
 carry abroad (the equivalent of $200 every other year) remains
 the primary limitation on foreign travel.
 Except for foreign diplomats, who must apply for permission to
 travel farther than 50 kilometers from Algiers, travel within
 Algeria is generally unrestricted, except in areas designated
 as "military zones." Visitors must register with the police
 if they are staying overnight in a locality. Gendarmerie
 
 
 1107
 ALGERIA
 checkpoints in the countryside routinely inspect vehicle
 registrations and, occasionally, search vehicles. The
 50-kilometer limit for diplomats is not strictly enforced, and
 permission to travel farther is quickly granted upon
 application.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 It is estimated that more than 100,000 refugees from the
 Western Sahara live in camps in southwestern Algeria. They
 are largely supported by the Government and, to a much lesser
 extent, by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 In May the Government moved to expel an estimated 20,000 to
 30,000 Sahelian drought victims from Niger and Mali who had
 taken refuge in southern Algeria in recent years, and who the
 Government claimed had failed to register in one of the four
 established refugee camps near Tamanrasset or who had drifted
 away from these camps. These expulsions reportedly took place
 under difficult conditions, and there were reports at the time
 that perhaps as many as 30 refugees died of thirst or
 starvation while attempting to make their way back to Algeria.
 According to various sources, about 15,000 duly registered
 drought victims remain in the camps and continue to be
 supported by the Government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Major political decisions are made by the top leadership of
 the party, Government, and military, all three headed by
 President Bendjedid. The political process is confined to the
 single party, which significantly limits deviation from the
 path prescribed by ruling authorities. Basic policy decisions
 are not strictly questioned, but popular grievances are aired
 within the party organization. Some diversity of views is
 also evident in the National Popular Assembly, the provincial
 and local councils, and the government-controlled press. The
 National Assembly, in particular, has asserted itself recently
 and managed to modify key aspects of important pieces of
 government-sponsored legislation during its 1986 sessions.
 There is universal adult suffrage. All candidates for public
 office are nominated by the party, but voters usually have a
 choice among two or more candidates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Algerian Government does not readily discuss its human
 rights problems with outside governmental or nongovernmental
 organizations. The Algerian Human Rights League, which
 attempted to establish itself as an independent human rights
 organization in 1985, still has not received government
 approval and, as noted above, some of its members have been
 imprisoned. There were no visits to Algeria by any
 international human rights organizations during 1986.
 Algeria participates in U.N. and regional human rights forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 It does not appear that minority groups are treated unfairly
 in terms of their access to jobs, housing, education, and
 health care. The Government's difficulties in meeting these
 social needs are mostly linked to the country's extremely
 
 
 1108
 ALGERIA
 rapid population growth, and minorities seem to fare no better
 or worse than the Arab majority under these circumstances.
 The Government has given extra attention to building houses,
 schools, and municipal infrastructure in Berber regions, and
 the rate of school attendance among Berbers is higher than in
 most other parts of the country. Nevertheless, Berber
 particularism remains strong and is fueled mostly by Berbers'
 desire to preserve their distinctive cultural identity and
 language in the face of the Government's emphasis on the
 development of Algeria's Arab identity. Berber spokesmen
 assert that the Government seeks to repress the distinct
 Berber culture.
 Women generally enjoy equality under the law, but there are
 exceptions. For example, the 1984 family code permits male
 polygamy, makes it more difficult for a woman than a man to
 obtain a divorce, and awards only 4 months of alimony to the
 woman in the event of divorce, regardless of the husband's
 means and the circumstances under which the divorce was
 obtained. Both culture and tradition make it difficult for
 women to follow an independent path; a woman remains throughout
 her life under the legal "tutelage" of a man, regardless of
 her age or civil status. About 250,000 Algerian women work
 outside the home, and an increasing number are trained and
 employed in the more liberal professions. Ten women are
 delegates in the National Popular Assembly, two are members of
 the party's Central Committee, one is a state minister, and
 women serve in the armed forces. However, working women
 represent less than 3 percent of the female population and
 less than 8 percent of the labor force.
 The literacy rate in Arabic or French (or both) among males
 over the age of 9 is 65 percent and only 40 percent for females
 in the same category. However, an effort has been made to
 close the gap separating women from men in education.
 According to government statistics, 72 percent of all
 school-age girls were enrolled in 1985. Algeria also has
 launched a nationwide program encouraging "birth spacing" as a
 means of safeguarding a mother's health, improving infant
 care, and reducing the high population growth rate. The
 program provides free access to contraceptives and counseling
 on a voluntary basis. Abortion is illegal.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Algeria's 1978 General Workers' Statute provides for a normal
 workweek not to exceed 44 hours, a full 24-hour rest period,
 and a minimum wage. It prohibits employment of persons under
 16 years of age. The Statute also sets out minimum worker
 safety standards and standardizes pay according to the work
 performed. Although the law has not yet been fully implemented
 in all economic sectors, most of its provisions are respected.
