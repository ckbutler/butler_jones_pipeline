 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic'of Vietnam (SRV) is a totalitarian state
 ruled by the Vietnamese Communist Party, the sole source of
 power. While the party is attempting to promote younger
 leaders to decisionmaking levels, the current leadership is
 essentially from the same group which fought the long war of
 independence from France, took power in the north after the
 country was partitioned in 1954, launched the armed effort to
 gain control of the southern Republic of Vietnam in the early
 1960's, and unified Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in 1975.
 A nationalist movement has characterized Vietnam's history for
 more than 1,000 years. Resistance against encroaching Chinese
 empires to the north and Vietnamese expansion at the expense of
 declining civilizations (the Cham and Khmer) to the south and
 west have had a major effect on Vietnamese political culture,
 reinforcing a perception of Vietnam as the natural leader of
 Indochina and fostering a narrow sense of identity in the
 generally northern-based Vietnamese leadership group.
 These perceptions have important implications for human rights
 in Vietnam. Regional, religious, ethnic, and other groups
 outside of the northern, Communist core are viewed with
 suspicion. The loyalty of southerners has been questioned
 because of their separate political and cultural history. The
 Central Committee named by the Sixth Communist Party Congress
 in December has a larger number of southern members than had
 been chosen in the past. The practical effects of this change
 on regional power-sharing, however, cannot yet be.determined.
 Many religious leaders, despite legally guaranteed freedom of
 religion, have been imprisoned on political charges.
 Tremendous pressure has been brought to bear on ethnic Chinese
 Vietnamese, who are considered a potential fifth column. Those
 who have not fled are closely watched. Cham Muslims in the
 south and the tribesmen of the central highlands are targets of
 government campaigns to erase their cultural identities.
 The public security apparatus is pervasive in the surveillance
 and control of the citizenry. Arrests for alleged political
 crimes do not require warrants; the Government can imprison
 those suspected of political crimes in "reeducation camps"
 without trial or charge. Fundamental rights and liberties are
 severely restricted.
 Vietnam also plays the key role in determining the state of
 human rights in neighboring Cambodia. Major violations of
 Cambodian human rights have been perpetrated during the
 Vietnamese occupation. The fundamental right of
 self-determination continues to be denied to the Khmer people.
 Because Vietnam has substantial control over the policies and
 actions of its surrogate regime, the People's Republic of
 Kampuchea, it must bear significant responsibility for that
 Government's violations of human rights.
 Vietnamese from the south are still subject to arrest for past
 association with the former government; all Vietnamese are
 subject to arrest for espousing political ideas contrary to
 accepted Communist ideology. Hanoi has denied basic civil
 rights, working papers, and ration coupons to many Vietnamese
 deemed politically unacceptable. Former reeducation camp
 prisoners and others without government-sanctioned employment
 often are forced to move to "New Economic Zones," where it
 frequently proves impossible to wrest even minimum subsistence
 from the land. The only option then left is to flee these
 areas to live illegally in the underground economy.

 There was no improvement in the human rights situation in
 Vietnam during 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Former reeducation camp prisoners have reported summary
 executions for escape attempts and resistance to-camp
 authorities. A former inmate in a prison for persons who have
 attempted to leave Vietnam illegally has reported that
 prisoners who refused to obey guards' orders were executed.
 Other reports indicate that inmates have been shot attempting
 to escape from the camps. Conditions in the camps are brutal;
 a significant number of deaths result from malnutrition,
 exhatstion, and other unnatural causes. There is little
 current information on the activities of minority and ethnic
 Vietnamese resistance groups against government authority. In
 the past, these groups have targeted Vietnamese military units
 and, less often, public security and administrative officials.
 The number of such attacks in recent years appears to be small.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of systematic political kidnaping by
 government security organizations since the period immediately
 following the fall of the Saigon government in 1975, when
 thousands were taken into custody extralegally. There have
 been no reports of disappearances or hostage-taking by forces
 resisting government authorities.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Reports from refugees are consistent and credible concerning
 the severity of the conditions for prisoners in the reeducation
 camps. Prisoners face severe and often arbitrary punishment
 for minor infractions of camp rules, substandard nutrition, and
 poor or nonexistent medical care. Political prisoners
 routinely are made to do hard labor. These conditions have
 resulted in acute suffering, permanent physical impairment, and
 often times death. It has been reported that persons
 imprisoned for attempting to flee Vietnam have been beaten to
 death during interrogation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention., or Exile
 For major crimes, including alleged political offenses, public
 security officials may legally apprehend and search suspects
 without a warrant, then hold them for an indefinite period.
 Refugees have reported that authorities sometimes wait several
 months before notifying relatives of those arrested.
 For routine crimes, a suspect may be apprehended on a warrant
 which stipulates the nature of the crime and which authorizes
 detention for 2 months prior to trial. A 2-month extension of
 the detention period may be obtained on application. There is
 no provision for bail or legal counsel prior to trial. Those
 suspected of political crimes may be sent to reeducation camps
 without trial or formal charge. The Government continues to
 hold large numbers-of persons in the camps; one report cites as
 many as 60,000 detainees in reeducation camps as recently as.
 
 
 838
 VIETNAM'
 1983. However, in October 1985, Minister of Justice Phan Hien
 asserted that no more than 10,000 prisoners were being held in
 the camps.
 Camp populations are composed of political prisoners, persons
 apprehended attempting to flee the country, intellectuals,
 chaplains, and clergy from both Buddhist and Christian groups,
 as well as former officials and military officers associated
 with the Republic of Vietnam. The Government uses the camps to
 remove from society those persons which it sees as dissident
 elements, particularly leaders. In the camps, authorities
 attempt to produce conformity through confinement, hard labor,
 self-criticism, and indoctrination. Many detainees have
 indeterminate sentences and the prospect of indefinite penal
 labor. According to one report, basic sentences for many
 former Republic of Vietnam officials range from 2 through 7
 years. The report asserted that the length of sentence was
 directly correlated to rank and position held (former
 intelligence and psychological warfare officers were given
 longer than normal sentences) and inversely correlated to the
 bribe paid by the detainee's family. While thousands of
 prisoners reportedly have been released over the past 11 years,
 including many military prisoners below the rank of colonel,
 some have been rearrested.
 Forced labor has been used by Vietnamese, and by local
 authorities in Cambodia under Vietnamese control, for projects
 to improve the logistical infrastructure for Vietnamese
 occupation troops. Credible reports indicate that the
 Vietnamese have also used forced Cambodian labor to construct
 military fortifications and defensive barriers along the
 Thai-Cambodian border. A number of government projects in
 Vietnam have used forced labor provided by reeducation camp
 prisoners. The adverse effects of this labor, exacerbated by
 the withholding of medical treatment, include malnutrition,
 exhaustion, and in many cases death.
 On August 29, 1986, Vietnamese authorities announced an amnesty
 for prisoners who had made "good progress in reeducation." The
 announcement said sentences would be reduced in some cases,
 while immediate release was possible for prisoners who had
 completed two-fifths of their sentences. It has not been
 possible to assess the the actual effect of this amnesty.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Vietnamese legal system is characterized by arbitrary
 detention, without charge or other form of legal process, under
 the guise of reeducation. The defense counsel is supposed to
 ensure that proper legal procedures are followed, in accordance
 with the defendant's rights under the Constitution, and to
 explain the proceedings to the defendant. However, the defense
 counsel is not an advocate for the defendant as is the rule in
 other countries that have both common law and civil law
 systems. In general, the legal system operates as an agency
 for the enforcement of regime directives; it has no
 independence from political intervention.
 Whether a new penal code announced in mid-1985 has engendered
 any true reform in the legal system is not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government operates a nationwide system of population
 
 
 839
 VIETNAM
 surveillance and control through party-appointed block wardens
 who use informants to keep track of each person's activities.
 This system exists in both urban and rural areas. It works
 imperfectly in southern Vietnam, however, partly because of a
 shortage of trusted party workers. There have been reports of
 official and nonofficial security wardens conducting searches
 of homes for draft-age males in order to fulfill draft quotas.
 There continue to be reliable reports that Ministry of the
 Interior officials inspect and sometimes confiscate mail and
 packages sent to Vietnam, particularly those sent to
 politically suspect persons or to persons of Chinese origin.
 Outgoing mail is also subject to inspection and censorship.
 The regime has widely publicized its program to relocate
 millions of people to "New Economic Zones" in virgin or
 unproductive rural areas in order to expand agricultural
 production. Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese were resettled
 in these remote zones during the years following the fall of
 the Republic of Vietnam. In many cases, the resettlement
 process has involved forms of coercion. The resettlement
 program targeted those whose views and backgrounds were seen as
 politically suspect and who were often therefore unable to find
 employment. Conditions in these zones reportedly range from
 extremely poor to life threatening. Almost no basic services
 are provided. Many resettled persons found it impossible to
 maintain life in these zones and have returned to the cities
 where they are forced to live without the ration cards and
 neighborhood registration cards essential to procuring regular
 employment, food, and essential services. Without these
 documents, they can be arrested arbitrarily and returned to the
 New Economic Zones or imprisoned.
 Reports indicate that the Government continues to pursue the
 relocation program, despite its cost in human suffering. The
 1981-8-5 plan called for the relocation of 1 million persons. A
 Ministry of Labor official claimed in August 1985 that the 1985
 goal of relocating 200,000 workers would be met. An editorial
 in the official newspaper Nhan Dan in March said, "tasks
 concerning labor and population redistribution have been
 intensified and expanded for 1986, the first year of the
 1986-90 5-year plan." The focus of the editorial was the need
 for proper planning and preparation for the new zones; it
 indicated that people leaving assigned areas because of being
 "sent to places thousands of kilometers away with shortages in
 all categories" has "undermined the people's concept of and
 confidence in the task."
 The official rationale for the massive relocation of the people
 has been to increase production, particularly of cash crops
 such as coffee and rubber, and to reduce unemployment in urban
 areas. Although many workers in the zones are brought in under
 formal contracts, the implementation of quota requirements
 sometimes arbitrarily interferes with a person's right to live
 in a place of his own choosing.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is severely limited in Vietnam. The Ministry
 of Culture and Information and Communist Party organs control
 all newspapers, books, and other publications, as well as all
 cultural exhibitions. The Government controls and censors all
 public sources of information and promotes "revolutionary
 culture" in the arts. Many prominent artists and writers have
 
 
 840
 VIETNAM
 been arrested. Refugees report that the Government has
 implemented electronic jamming against the shortwave radio
 operated by a Vietnamese resistance group which broadcasts into
 Vietnam. Independent criticism of the party and the Government
 is forbidden except within limits set by authorities, and
 appears to. be condoned only when authorities use it to
 criticize the laxity of officials or groups who do not meet
 Party norms. Self-censorship by journalists operates without
 question, given the pervasive control of the party. Informants
 in the block surveillance system insure that even private
 criticism of. the regime is greatly inhibited.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are prohibitions against meeting either publicly or
 privately to criticize or protest.government actions or
 policies. Nongovernmental organizations, such as church
 groups, can meet only for approved and narrowly defined
 objectives, such as religious services.
 In lieu of independent labor groups, "unions" have been set up
 under the Vietnam Federation of Trade Unions, which is
 controlled by the Communist Party. Claiming 3 million members,
 the Federation's stated goal is to increase party control and
 production, rather than to improve and protect the welfare of
 its members. There is no right to bargain collectively or to
 strike. Mass organizations, such as women's federations, have
 been organized in other sectors of the population. They
 periorm the same functions of control, propaganda, and policy
 dis emination within their respective sectors as do the labor
 organizations.
 'c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government tolerates the existence of religious groups and
 allows religious services, but has. consistently attempted to
 divide and control the Catholic, Buddhist, and Cao Dai
 churches, the Muslim community, and other religious groups.
 The Government perceives religious groups as potential seedbeds
 of subversion and political opposition. It has attempted to
 prevent their growth by blocking publication of religious
 materials and prohibiting the training of new clergy. The
 Government has.attempted to co-opt religious groups by
 promoting organizations and leaders controlled by it.
 Refugees have reported constant government harassment of the
 Catholic Church. Priests who do not follow government
 regulations are subject to confinement in remote villages,
 house arrest, and incarceration. There are reportedly over 100
 priests detained in reeducation camps. Many former military
 chaplains of all faiths have been imprisoned since 1975.
 Catholic priests and nuns are subject to police surveillance.
 Most religious are required by the authorities to work full
 time in secular occupations, thus limiting their church
 activities. The Government has also restricted communication
 between rural parishes and their bishops and has sharply
 curtailed the ordination of new Catholic clergy. While six
 seminaries were theoretically reopened in 1980, no candidates
 met the new enrollment criteria. A former seminarian has
 reported that no Catholic priest has been ordained since then.
 Authorities routinely disapprove half of the applications of
 parishioners requesting permission to attend services.
 Required "voluntary" work and other activities are scheduled by
 authorities during times of regular church services. In some
 
 
 841
 VIETNAM
 areas, daily masses must be celebrated before 6 a.m. or after 6
 p.m. Sermons must be cleared or monitored by the local
 police. The Government does not permit the printing or
 importation of Bibles. Meetings between members of different
 parishes are prohibited. No church building can be repaired
 without government authorization; a number of churches have
 been allowed to fall into complete disrepair.
 Harassment of clergy and their congregations occurs in other
 ways as well. Catholics are required to register as such with
 the authorities, although Buddhists are not. Catholics are
 discriminated against in employment. As a result of this
 persecution, the size of Catholic congregations has decreased
 steadily since 1975.
 In the south, the Catholic Church appears to have more
 successfully survived in the cities than in the countryside.
 However, the teaching role of the Church has been severely
 restricted, and many churches and all but one Catholic seminary
 in the south have been closed. In central Vietnam, thousands
 of Catholics have been forcibly relocated and made to work on
 government construction projects. In 1982 authorities took
 steps to bring the Catholic Church under closer government
 control by creating the Catholic Patriotic Association. This
 attempt to weaken links with the papacy by developing a
 national Catholic church has been ignored by the great majority
 of clergy and church members.
 Protestant churches have been similarly restricted. Church
 buildings have been taken over by authorities under various
 pretexts. Protestant churches in the highlands have all been
 closed, as has the sole Protestant college and theological
 seminary. There have been continuing reports of harassment of
 those evangelical churches which have been allowed, albeit with
 severe restrictions, to hold services in urban areas. Church
 members may not attend services with other congregations, but
 are restricted to their own. Authorities are said to have
 forbidden at least one group from meeting at all.
 Most of Vietnam's 30,000 Muslims are members of the Cham
 minority, which the regime distrusts. The linkage of Cham,
 Khmer Krom, and hilltribe (Montagnard) groups created the only
 sizeable resistance movement in Vietnam: the United Liberation
 Front of Oppressed Races (FULRO). In its repression of the
 Cham, the Government has eliminated the position of mufti
 (religious leader) within the Muslim communities, disbanded
 organized Muslim associations, and severed links with overseas
 Muslims. The regime forbids the religious pilgrimage to Mecca,
 and has not given permission for the Muslim community to
 participate in the Koran reading contest held annually in
 Malaysia. Many Muslim schools have been closed, but most
 mosques remain open. Importation and publication of the Koran
 is forbidden.
 About half of Vietnam's population is Buddhist, the majority
 belonging to the Mahayana sect. Vietnamese authorities have
 tried repeatedly since 1975 to suppress and intimidate the
 Mahayana leadership. Officials have seized temples and
 transformed them into public buildings. They have arrested
 monks intermittently since 1975. Hundreds of monks remain in
 reeducation camps, while many others are under house arrest.
 The travel of those not detained is severely restricted.
 Government permission is required for monks to travel or stay
 overnight away from their home temples. Some reports allege
 that local authorities seek to control and restrict the
 
 
 842
 VIETNAM
 community of Buddhist monks by forbidding the traditional
 donation of food. The majority of pre-1975 monks in the south
 have been forced to leave the monkhood, and few young men are
 allowed to join the community. Teaching of monks must often be
 conducted in secret, and most pagoda schools have been closed.
 Monks. of the once politically active An Quang, Xa Loi, and Vinh
 Nghiem pagodas are kept under close government surveillance and
 the. pagoda. are rarely open to visitors.
 The regime's suppression of the Buddhists became more
 systematized as a result of a conference, which it organized in
 November 1981 and which established the Unified Vietnam
 Buddhist Church. The group.'s charter states that it is "the
 only Buddhist organization representing Vietnamese Buddhism in
 all other relations in the country and with other countries."
 Strong controls are outlined in the charter: all Buddhist
 pagodas are placed under the control of local people's
 revolutionary committees; prayer sessions and meditations as
 well as meetings between monks.of different pagodas are allowed
 onlywith the permission of the local committees. Reports
 suggest that the new church has no appeal to most Buddhists,
 who view it simply as a creature of the regime.
 Most of the Therevada Buddhists are ethnic Khmer (Khmer Krom).
 They comprise about 800,000 persons living in southern and
 southwestern Vietnam, and have provided the Vietnamese forces
 occupying Cambodia with interpreters and staff. Nevertheless,
 the Khmer Krom is distrusted by the Vietnamese, partly for
 historical reasons. A number of Therevada leaders have been
 imprisoned.
 Other religious groups have also been persecuted by the
 regime. The Hoa Hao (an anti-Communist Buddhist armed sect)
 strongly resisted the Communist takeover of the south in 1975.
 As a result, the Government violently repressed the sect and
 arrested virtually all of its leaders. The regime maintains
 tight control over Hoa Hao areas. Similarly, the regime has
 arrested many of the leaders of the Cao Dai, a uniquely
 Vietnamese armed sect comprising elements of Buddhism and
 Christianity. Refugees have reported police occupation of the
 Cao Dai Holy See in Tay Ninh City. The official press has
 claimed that Cao Dai leaders used the Holy See to establish an
 antigovernment subversive organization, broadcasting and
 printing antigovernment messages, and storing arms for an
 uprising. Some leaders have been tried and executed for these
 activities, according to the official media. The trial of 2
 Cao Dai leaders and 31 alleged accomplices was publicized in
 August 1983. Since the Hanoi regime views religion as a
 possible source of political opposition, adherence to a
 religious sect is incompatible with membership in the Communist
 Party. Party membership is, in turn,. a prerequisite for
 political, economic, and educational advancement in Vietnam.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Approval is required for all foreign travel. Identity cards
 are required for internal travel. No one is allowed to change
 his residence or work location without permission from the
 authorities. Since public security cadre frequently check each
 household's occupants against the official family register,
 unauthorized absences can subject families to intrusive
 surveillance and other harassment. Permission for temporary
 travel abroad, is normally granted only to government officials
 or approved spokesmen for quasi-governmental organizations.
 
 
 843
 VIETNAM
 Several factors have combined to fuel the exodus of more than 1
 million people since 1975. Among them are severe political
 repression, ethnic and religious persecution, discrimination in
 economic, cultural, and educational opportunities, fear of
 imprisonment or of forced resettlement to remote areas, and
 fear of being conscripted to fight in Cambodia.
 In early 1978, the Vietnamese adopted a program to "facilitate"
 the departure of ethnic Chinese and others as refugees. The
 program was administered through special offices at the
 provincial level which charged large fees for exit permits and
 passage. At its height in early 1979, the boat exodus of
 mostly ethnic Chinese reached over 40,000 people a month.
 Those fleeing were exposed to extreme hardship at sea, where
 untold thousands of lives were lost.
 At the International Conference on Vietnamese Refugees held in
 Geneva in July 1979, Vietnam announced a moratorium on these
 refugee departures. Information from refugees who have left
 Vietnam since then indicates that, in general, the authorities
 are no longer officially assisting such departures, although
 many assist extra-officially for a financial consideration. In
 May 1979, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) reached agreement with Vietnam on the legal departure
 of persons under the Orderly Departure Program (ODP).
 Emigration under this program started slowly, with only some
 13,000 departing Vietnam in the 27 months between July 1979 and
 October 1981. Vietnam then expanded the program. Cumulative
 departures through September 1986 totaled 113,600. In January
 1986, the Vietnamese halted UNHCR interviews of ODP candidates,
 complaining of slow processing of persons on Vietnamese lists
 and the creation of the so-called backlog. Negotiations to
 resume the interviews continue.
 Refugees continued to leave Vietnam clandestinely during 1986,
 although at a somewhat slower rate than in previous years.
 Hanoi and provincial radio stations have broadcast reports of
 executions or lengthy jail sentences for organizers of failed
 escape attempts, as well as lesser punishments dealt to others
 implicated. Currently, male offenders can expect sentences of
 3 months or more at hard labor, depending on their role in the
 departure attempt, while female offenders receive 1 to 3
 months, with childless women often receiving longer sentences.
 Reeducation camp releasees who attempt flight can expect to be
 returned to the camps for an indefinite term. Property, often
 including the means of livelihood, is confiscated from those
 caught trying to escape, as is the property left behind by
 those who succeed.
 Few have returned to Vietnam after fleeing the country. Those
 who escaped in the immediate aftermath of the fall of South
 Vietnam in 1975, and later returned, were incarcerated in the
 camps. In only a few isolated cases has Hanoi accepted
 repatriation in recent years; in effect, those who emigrate
 lose their citizenship. Some who left Vietnam prior to 1975
 and acquired nationalities and travel documents of other
 countries have been permitted to return as visitors.
 Since the illegal occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam, large
 numbers of Vietnamese, possibly as many as several hundred
 thousand, have settled in Cambodia. Although some of these
 persons are former residents expelled by the Khmer Rouge,
 others are first-time settlers.
 
 
 844
 VIETNAM
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All authority and political power is vested in the Vietnamese
 Communist Party. Political opposition to this system is not
 tolerated. The Political Bureau (Politburo) of the Central
 Committee of the Vietnam Communist Party is the supreme
 decisionmaking body in the nation. The Politburo's powerful
 Secretariat oversees day-to-day implementation of directives.
 The party leadership selects candidates for the Central
 Committee, while periodic national party congresses merely
 ratify the previously selected candidates. Each congress is
 made up of delegates from the party apparatus of each province,
 who are similarly selected by those at higher levels.
 Ostensibly the chief legislative body, the National Assembly in
 fact approves without dissent the policies set by the
 Politburo. National Assembly elections are held in Vietnam
 every 5 years, most recently in 1981. The elections scheduled
 for 1986 have been postponed until April 198.7. Local elections
 are held more frequently. Suffrage is effectively mandatory as
 one must vote in order to have ration cards validated. Voters
 may only strike out from the single list presented to them the
 names of candidates for whom they do not wish to vote .
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Vietnam is not a'member of any international human rights
 organization, nor is it active in promoting human rights in
 other countries.
 Foreign delegations and journalists who have been allowed to
 visit reeducation camps have been shown only model camps.
 Former prisoners have described extensive preparations to
 beautify camps prior to visits, temporary removal of most
 prisoners during the visit, and careful briefing of the
 remaining prisoners by Communist Party cadre on what to tell
 delegation members. The Government does not permit the
 existence of private human rights groups in Vietnam.
 Vietnam reacts strongly to criticism of its human rights
 policies. In March 1986, an official newspaper, Nhan Dan,
 called the State.Department's human rights report to the
 Congress "a brazen slander and a manifestation of the hostile
 attitude of the U.S. toward the Vietnamese people."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Gradual assimilation and co-option appear to be the
 Government's long-run strategy for most minorities. The
 Government has created special schools in the Hanoi area to
 train minority cadres to be the "eyes and ears" of the party
 among their own people. Highland minorities in central Vietnam
 are subject to repression if suspected of ties with resistance
 groups. Officially programed resettlement of ethnic Vietnamese
 into the highlands is designed to increase government control
 over minority groups once dedicated to hunting, gathering, and
 slash-and-burn agriculture. As new inhabitants change ancient
 land use and ownership patterns, the tribes are being forced
 into settled agriculture. Minorities in the south, such as the
 Chinese, Indian, and Khmer, have been encouraged to leave the
 country.
 
 
 845
 VIETNAM
 Although southerners have been appointed to some ministerial
 and National Assembly positions, the leadership's distrust of
 them is a significant factor in the assignment of political
 responsibilities. Non-Communist southerners who were involved
 in the National Liberation Front before 1975 have been
 systematically deprived of political power. Even Communist
 southerners were rarely raised to senior positions before the
 Sixth Congress.
 Ethnic Chinese are severely discriminated against through
 denial of officially sanctioned employment and educational
 opportunities. Former military officers of the Republic of
 Vietnam are systematically denied employment; the children of
 former military and civilian officials are denied university
 education by a review of family backgrounds which culls out
 "undesirable elements." Persons released from reeducation
 camps are formally denied civil rights for an indefinite period
 and are subject to severe restrictions in employment and travel.
 Primary education is claimed by the authorities to be universal
 (97 percent in 1980), but some children, such as the Amerasians
 (the children of Americans who served in Vietnam), are not
 allowed to attend school. Education above the elementary
 level, particularly at higher levels, is often restricted to
 those with approved political backgrounds. The party committee
 in each school reportedly has the final determination as to who
 will graduate. Similarly, study abroad is restricted to
 politically acceptable persons.
 Despite the promises of the Communist Party to emancipate
 women, and the important administrative and productive roles of
 Vietnamese women in the war against the United States, women in
 Vietnam today do not have the positions in the leadership of
 the country which their numbers would warrant. There are no
 women in the Vietnamese Politburo and only a handful in the
 149-member Central Committee. A total of 108 (22 percent) of
 the current National Assembly members are women. Despite
 having proved themselves in administration during the war,
 Vietnamese women have retreated from management positions they
 held at that time.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 No current information is available on minimum age laws,
 occupational safety laws, or other legislation concerning
 conditions of labor. Wages and hours of work are regulated by
 the Government. Wages for most workers are generally at or
 under basic subsistence levels.
 At least 55,000 Vietnamese workers have work under contract in
 various occupations in the U.S.S.R. and in Eastern European
 countries. A significant portion of their wages is deducted to
 help pay for Vietnam's debt to those countries. It appears
 that most of these workers enter this work program in order to
 escape the poverty and unemployment of present day Vietnam.
