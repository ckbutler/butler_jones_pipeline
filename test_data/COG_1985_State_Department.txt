 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo is officially a
 Marxist-Leninist state and is governed by an elite group of
 party, cabinet, and military officials through the single legal
 party, the Congolese Labor Party (PCT). The president of the
 party, currently Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso, serves as
 President of the Republic and Chief of State.  The President
 nominates the 13-member political bureau, the key policy-making
 group, which is approved by the 75-member central committee.
 Within the central committee, members from the northern regions
 of the country are in the majority and hold the balance of
 power, even though they represent a minority of the
 population. The military and security services are also firmly
 under the control of the northerners, and they ultimately hold
 the key to power in the Congo. The need to maintain consensus
 among the political leaders representing traditionally
 conflicting areas provides a check on arbitrary policies.
 The security apparatus, which is under the direction of the
 presidency, is headed by the state security organization (DSGE)
 and is patterned after those in Eastern Europe. Its principal
 objective is to protect the State, i.e., to watch for any
 possible political dissident activity. There are also party
 core groups in all ministries, labor organizations, mass
 organizations, and urban areas (arrondissements) which monitor
 activities of coworkers and neighbors. In addition to the
 DSGE, there are the regular police forces whose discipline is
 generally improving with continuing Eastern European and Cuban
 training.
 With its small population (1.8 million) and relatively high per
 capita income (about $1,230), the Congo is one of Africa's more
 prosperous countries. The economy is based predominantly on
 petroleum, which accounts for about 90 percent of export
 earnings. Beginning in 1979, the Congo experienced a period of
 high economic growth and began the implementation of a five
 year plan (starting in 1982) with heavy investment in
 infrastructure. With the decline in oil prices, and the lack
 of any significant increase in other sectors, notably forestry
 and sugar, the debt burden has climbed to over 50 percent of
 the gross national product (GNP), and the Congo is entering a
 period of austerity.
 The human rights situation in the Congo changed little in
 1985. No organized opposition to the Government is permitted.
 In November, the Congo experienced the first open unrest since
 President Sassou took power. High school students rioted in
 Brazzaville to protest a new government policy on college
 scholarships. The military put down the rioting, killing four
 students and severely wounding at least seven. The DSGE has
 been criticized by Amnesty International for use of torture.
 While not politically free, the Congolese go about their daily
 lives with a minimum of government or police interference.
 Terrorism is not a problem and the crime rate is relatively
 low. Contacts between Congolese and foreigners are possible,
 and the Congolese, while refraining from direct political
 criticism of the Government, discuss frankly economic and
 social problems. The right to own private property is
 respected. There is a tendency toward a more open society with
 expanded contacts with the West.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 During 1985, there were no reported cases of killing for
 political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1985, there were no reported cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The practice of beating suspects at police stations and the
 state security offices in the course of interrogations is not
 uncommon. Neither is it uncommon for the public or the police
 to beat thieves caught redhanded. There was one reported case
 recently of a thief being beaten and then dying from having a
 hot iron applied to his genitals. Such extreme measures,
 however, are not common.
 Instances of torture of political prisoners, who are held
 incommunicado, have been reported and usually involve
 electroshock and suspension by ropes from the ceiling
 accompanied by beating. These reports are considered
 reliable. Use of such methods is usually restricted to those
 accused of crimes against the State. (See le below)
 Prison conditions in general are poor, and there is a lack of
 adequate food, hygiene, and medical care.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Whereas the Constitution guarantees protection against
 arbitrary indictment, arrest, and detention, in practice a
 warrant is not required to make arrests. There is a habeas
 corpus provision, but it does not apply in cases involving the
 security of the State. Individuals detained for nonpolitical
 offenses are entitled to an attorney and are judged by a
 generally impartial judiciary. Given the slow pace of
 administrative processing, despite the Government's steps to
 increase the number of magistrates and to improve the
 processing of cases, persons awaiting trial are often detained
 for considerable periods. There is no independent bar
 association. All lawyers are under the general authority of
 the Government (procureur general). In criminal cases, lawyers
 are provided by the Government for those who do not have money
 to pay for their own defense.
 The charging of a detainee usually depends upon the seriousness
 of the crime and the economic situation of the family. For
 lesser crimes, the person is usually taken to jail, where he
 may be beaten, and is then held for a few days until he obtains
 his release on bail or on his own recognizance pending a trial,
 which may or may not ever take place. An individual accused of
 a serious crime (murder, rape, etc.) is held in prison until
 the trial which may be months or even years later. At the time
 of trial, the defendant has the right to a lawyer. Both
 detainees and prisoners may be visited by family or friends who
 bear the responsibility of providing food, medicines, etc.

 CONGO
 There is no known forced labor in the Congo.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for a Supreme Court which is in
 practice an arm of the Executive rather than an independent
 body. By law, the right to a fair and public trial exists in
 all cases, but some detainees have been held for long periods
 without trial. The legal system is not insulated from
 political interference. However, it is not uncommon to have a
 higher court reverse the verdict in the event of irregularities.
 The amended Constitution provides for nonprofessional judges to
 be elected to all courts below the Supreme Court. The stated
 purpose of this change was to "popularize justice," i.e.,
 provide a role for tribal or regional peers to influence the
 formal judicial process. According to the law, any Congolese
 citizen may now become a judge but can adjudicate cases only in
 collaboration with trained judges. Each nomination must be
 approved by the party. Within the constraints noted above, the
 judicial process is relatively fair and open for those accused
 of common crime.
 According to the Congolese Government, there are no political
 prisoners in the Congo. The persons cited by Amnesty
 International as political prisoners being held incommunicado
 were allegedly associated with two acts of terrorism (bombings)
 in mid-1983. They have never been brought to trial. There is
 one known French political prisoner, also allegedly associated
 with the bombings, being held incommunicado at his home. The
 only known purely political prisoner is Thystere Tchicaya, the
 former number two figure in the party, reportedly arrested for
 his opposition to President Sassou. He is believed-to be under
 house arrest and is not permitted any contact with the outside
 world.
 Political prisoners are held incommunicado, and it is
 reasonable to assume that torture has been used to extract any
 information desired by the police that is not freely given.
 However, it should be noted that political prisoners held
 incommunicado in the past have since been liberated and are now
 leading normal lives with no apparent ill effects. Some have
 even managed to regain their earlier status and are serving as
 government ministers.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is little interference by the Government with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence. Individuals are not forced to
 participate in the party or its organs. In general, so long as
 the individual does not engage in any activity in opposition to
 the Government, he is not oppressed or harassed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of spbech and press are restricted, despite guarantees
 in the Constitution. The State owns and controls the media
 (except for one weekly religious newspaper). The Government
 allows some domestic criticism of policies and programs judged
 not to be politically sensitive, but it.does not allow its
 ultimate authority to be challenged. Journalists may raise
 
 
 CONGO
 issues and concerns only within general guidelines laid down by
 the party. The party is selective in the kinds of news and
 information it permits Congolese journalists to publish from
 various outside sources of information. Television viewers
 have access to Zairian media programs. While the Government
 controls the local press, foreign journalists are permitted to
 move freely about the country. The state censorship board
 reviews the content of newspapers, movies, books, and records.
 Publications are subject to censorship if they contain critical
 articles. For example, one issue of a church newspaper was
 seized and burned as a result of some mild criticism of the
 Third Party Congress, and a warning to the church was later
 published in the party's official organ.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is limited by the State's
 perceived self-interest. Political meetings are permitted for
 only the party and its organizations. Government permission is
 not required for groups to assemble for religious and social
 purposes but is required for use of official facilities.
 Government authorization is needed to start a formal club or
 organization.
 Given its past active political role, the labor movement is
 closely scrutinized and controlled by the Government and
 party. The labor code adopted in March 1975 is quite liberal,
 if taken at face value. The right of association is
 guaranteed, though there is only one umbrella union, the
 Congolese Trade Union Confederation (CTUC), which is an
 appendage of the party. The party approves the national
 leadership of the CTUC. It is prohibited from striking,
 although wildcat strikes do occur with relative impunity. The
 Trade Union Confederation is represented in every ministry and
 state-owned enterprise and serves on mandatory boards which
 include a union representative along with a member of the
 administration and the party. Known as the "determinant
 trilogy," this structure is responsible for ensuring that the
 three major points of view are represented in the
 decisionmaking process and serves as the Congo's form of
 collective bargaining. The local unions within the
 Confederation have been able to persuade the Government to
 provide workers with increased benefits. So long as political
 subjects are avoided, there is a certain degree of democratic
 give and take. However, no group is allowed to form an
 independent, alternative union outside the party, which led to
 a complaint to the International Labor Organization (ILO) that
 the Congo was not observing the Convention on Freedom of
 Association (no. 87). The Confederation maintains relations
 with recognized international organizations such as the ILO.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In theory, freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. In
 practice, party members are prohibited from practicing any
 religion. Religious organizations (churches, the Salvation
 Army, etc.) must obtain the Government's permission to work in
 the Congo. Jehovah's Witnesses, for example, are not permitted
 in the Congo, allegedly because Witnesses do not recognize the
 authority of the State. With the aforementioned exceptions,
 the party does not normally interfere in religious affairs.
 The Catholic Church, the largest congregation, maintains a
 seminary for the training of its clergy and has missions all
 over the country. Masses are held in the various local
 
 
 86
 CONGO
 languages as well as in French. The Catholic Church publishes
 the only independent newspaper, La Semaine Africaine. Catholic
 and other missionaries are active in running private missions
 and clinics and providing other social services for the
 handicapped, etc. While some of these services are joint
 ventures between church and government, many of the former
 services provided by churches have been abolished, and the
 Government is officially atheist. Christmas Day is called
 Children's Day.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises limited control over the internal
 movement of its citizens through identification card checks.
 There are control points in Brazzaville manned by soldiers who
 occasionally open fire on people who fail to follow their
 instructions or who inadvertently drive into restricted zones
 at night. Congolese citizens who wish to travel abroad require
 exit authorization from the Office of State Security. For
 average citizens this is a fairly routine process. However,
 those who are suspected of traveling for political motives
 encounter some difficulty. Government employees traveling
 abroad must obtain permission from the appropriate government
 office. Passports must be returned to the Office of State
 Security after the traveler's return from abroad.
 The Government exercises tight control over travel by
 foreigners to the Congo. Most visas are for one entry only,
 exit visas are required, and those desiring to travel into the
 interior must obtain permission from the appropriate ministry.
 There have been no known instances of Congolese being refused
 the right to return to their country. Citizenship may be lost
 under conditions established in the nationality code. For
 example, citizenship may be lost by taking citizenship in
 another country or because of a conviction for espionage.
 There are no known cases of a native-born Congolese being
 denied citizenship as a punishment.
 The Congo is the home of about 1,200 exiles and refugees,
 mostly from surrounding Central African states. While refugees
 are subject to surveillance and occasional harassment by the
 Congolese Government, there were no cases of forcible
 repatriation in 1985. The Congo is a signatory of the U.N.
 Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and
 a representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees is resident in Brazzaville.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congo is governed by an elite group of party and cabinet
 officials. The center of power is the 13-man political bureau,
 chosen by the President but approved by the-75 member central
 committee. While the President is the most powerful single
 individual, his authority is limited by his need to maintain a
 consensus in the political bureau. The balance of power in the
 political bureau and in the central committee is held by
 northerners to the detriment of the far more numerous
 southerners. Military officers occupy key positions among the
 ruling group and help ensure its continuation in power. The
 Congolese people do not have the right to change their
 government through democratic processes. Opportunities for
 political involvement by Congolese citizens are limited to the
 
 
 87
 CONGO
 Marxist-Leninist Congolese Labor Party, including the national,
 regional, and local assemblies and the "mass" organizations.
 No other political parties are permitted to operate. Party
 membership, which presently numbers approximately 8,700 out of
 a total population of 1.92 million is highly controlled on the
 basis of loyalty and political performance.
 While the Third Party Congress in 1984 declared the National
 Assembly the supreme organ of state, the national, regional,
 and local assemblies are "elected" from single-party approved
 lists. Representatives of the National Assembly are chosen
 from all walks of life, including traditional leaders,
 peasants, and workers. The Assembly has some impact on social
 and economic issues, and assemblies at the local and regional
 levels may discuss issues before the decisions are made at the
 national level.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no human rights organizations in the Congo. Amnesty
 International in its 1985 report was concerned about the
 long-term detention without trial and torture of political
 prisoners. Freedom House rated the Congo "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of 1.8 million is growing at the rate of 3.1
 percent per annum. Per capita GNP is high for Africa, about
 $1,230, and due mainly to oil production. There is a marked
 disparity between urban and rural standards of living which
 results in heavy migration from the countryside. It is
 estimated that the average per capita GNP of rural Congolese is
 less than one-twelfth that of their urban counterparts. The
 Congo has a mixed economic system, with approximately 80
 percent of the economy in the hands of the private
 sector--predominantly foreign-owned and -operated.
 Improvements in health and nutrition have resulted in an
 increase in the average life expectancy to over 63 years. The
 infant mortality rate (1985) is 110 per 1,000 live births. The
 fertility of the soil, abundance of indigenous fruits,
 vegetables, and fish, and the reliability of water sources
 around the country have all fostered a naturally hospitable
 environment for the sparse population. Safe water is available
 in urban areas for about 46 percent of the population, compared
 to only 8 percent in the countryside. The Congolese diet
 generally meets caloric intake requirements, but protein intake
 is generally insufficient. Adequate health care remains spotty
 in urban areas and is almost nonexistent in rural areas.
 The Congolese have tried to maintain the educational system
 left to them by the French, and have a historically high
 literacy rate (variously estimated at between 50 and 80 percent
 of the adult population). The emphasis on education is heavy,
 and many children who do not finish school return as adults to
 continue their studies. The current number enrolled in primary
 school as a percentage of age group is not available, but as
 early as 1965 was 114 percent (male 134 percent, female 94
 percent). The percentage of students in secondary education
 has jumped from 10 percent in 1965 to 69 percent in 1982.
 Urban migration, however, has resulted in serious overcrowding
 of facilities and a loss in the quality of teaching. The Congo
 
 
 CONGO
 sends large numbers of students abroad, predominantly to Cuba
 and Eastern Europe due to the availability of scholarships.
 Working conditions for Congolese are generally good. These
 include a minimum working age of 16 (in the modern sector), a
 maximum 40-hour workweek, at least one day of rest per week,
 family benefits and medical aid, but no social security and a
 minimum hourly wage of 34 cents for city employees and 29 cents
 for agricultural workers. Domestic workers must be paid at
 least $60 monthly. There is a code of occupational safety and
 health, though it is probably honored only in the breach.
 Revenues from taxation and royalties on oil production allow
 the Government to hire large numbers of Congolese for various
 government organs or state corporation administrations.
 Consequently, compared to other Africans, many Congolese have a
 generally high standard of working conditions and social
 benefits.
 Under the Constitution, women have the same rights as men in
 the private, political, and social domains, and for equal work
 they are entitled to the same social benefits. There is a
 large disparity in practice, however, between salaries for men
 and women, and women are relegated to a secondary role in the
 modern sectors of society. In traditional society, women are
 still the chief decisionmakers. Five women are members of the
 central committee, and one is Minister of Basic Education and
 Literacy, the only woman in the 27-member cabinet.
