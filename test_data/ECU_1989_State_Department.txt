 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and
 71-member unicameral Congress chosen in free elections.
 Members of the Supreme Court, chosen by Congress, preside over
 an independent judiciary. In 1989 Ecuador celebrated the 10th
 anniversary of its return to democracy after 7 years of
 military rule. Fourteen registered political parties, a free
 press, and numerous and active labor unions characterize an
 open and lively political system. President Rodrigo Borja of
 the Democratic Left party completed the first year of his
 4-year term in August. Although the Popular Democracy (a
 Christian democratic party) withdrew its members from the
 executive branch coalition in July, it continues to cooperate
 with the President's party in the legislature, as does the
 small Communist party, the Broad Front of the Left (FADI).
 Congressional elections are currently scheduled for June 1990.
 The President controls the police through the Ministry of
 Government. In 1989 there were few charges of police abuse of
 citizens for political reasons, although Ecuadorian human
 rights activists charge that lower level police officials
 sometimes resort to force during investigations of common
 crime.
 A small group of violent leftwing terrorists, Alfaro Vive
 Carajo (AVC), that maintains links with the Colombian M-19
 group, continues to operate in Ecuador. A few AVC members are
 in jail, having been sentenced for participation in violent
 crimes.. Other AVC members were released from prison after
 completing their sentences. The Borja Administration and the
 AVC signed an accord in March 1989 in which the AVC agreed to
 integrate itself into legitimate political activity.
 Ecuador has a basically free enterprise economic system
 although the Government controls petroleum production and
 export. Petroleum, agricultural products, and fish account
 for the bulk of exports. High foreign debt, unfavorable terms
 of trade for key export items, and extensive rural poverty,
 especially among highblood Indians, burdened the economy in
 1989.
 Most human rights were well respected by the Government in
 1989. Problem areas included police or military mistreatment
 of suspects during criminal investigations, brutal prison
 conditions, lengthy detentions without charge, and faulty
 judicial procedures.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political killings in Ecuador in 1989.
 Some human rights observers believe the killing by unknown
 assailants on September 6 of journalist Francisco "Pancho"
 Jaime, who published a satiric magazine in Guayaquil
 lampooning top politicians in Ecuador, was politically
 motivated. Others discount this, believing it was likely a
 personal matter. No arrests have been made in the case. One
 person was shot and killed during a January 9 demonstration in
 Quito, but it remains unclear who did the shooting. There
 were no cases of excessive use of force by police resulting in
 extrajudical killings in 1989 as there were in previous years.
 
 
 563
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance attributable to
 government forces in 1989. Four of the cases still unresolved
 at the end of 1988 remain unresolved. The 1985 disappearance
 of Consuelo Benavides Cevallos led to a multiparty
 congressional investigation which concluded in 1989 that
 Benavides was killed within a week of her disappearance, and
 that the naval forces stationed in Esmeraldas Province
 probably were responsible for the disappearance and killing.
 The Supreme Court decided in 1989 not to hear the case brought
 by the Benavides family and recommended that a lower court
 hear the family's suit. That case was in progress in
 Esmeraldas at year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture and other such forms of intimidation or
 punishment are prohibited by law, there are persistent
 credible reports that excessive force is used by lower level
 police officials, particularly against youthful suspects
 during investigations of common crimes. There have been no
 instances in recent years of police officials being tried and
 punished for such conduct.
 Prison conditions continue to be so brutal as themselves to
 constitute cruel and inhuman treatment. Beatings for
 disciplinary purposes are common. Use of solitary confinement
 in an arbitrary manner as a disciplinary measure also
 continues, although the Director of Prisons indicated to human
 right activists his intention to end the practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and prolonged
 detention without charge. The criminal code provides for a
 judicial determination of the legality of detention and
 requires that arrested persons must be charged within 48 hours
 of arrest. In practice, some suspects are held substantially
 longer than 48 hours before being charged. Five members of
 the AVC, who were being held without charge in connection with
 a 1985 murder case, were released in October; they had been
 imprisoned since 1985. Preventive detention is limited to 48
 hours by law. In 1989 there were no cases of arrest for
 crimes which could be construed as political. Forced exile is
 not practiced.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Congress elects the Supreme Court and has the power to
 impeach judges, to set the budget of the judicial branch, and
 to ratify the Supreme Courtts judicial review decisions. From
 time to time, the Supreme Court investigates allegations of
 judicial inefficiency or improprieties and may remove judges
 of lower courts. In November the Congress enacted a law
 granting authority to remove lower court judges to provincial
 courts.
 The autonomous Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal (TGC) is
 composed of representatives named by the President, the
 Congress, the judiciary, municipalities, business, and labor.
 The TGC is empowered by the Constitution to investigate
 
 
 564
 ECUADOR
 breaches of constitutional or human rights. The TGC submits
 its findings to Congress but has no statutory power to enforce
 sanctions. Military courts may try only those cases involving
 infractions of military regulatiohs or acts against military
 installations.
 As in most civil law systems there is no trial by jury;
 judges play a central role in deciding guilt or innocence. In
 theory, defendants have the right to counsel as soon as
 arrested, although in practice this can take time and depends
 on defendants' economic resources. They can call witnesses on
 their own behalf, cross-examine all witnesses, refrain from
 testifying against themselves, and appeal to higher courts.
 Althouqh a public defender system is mandated by the
 Constitution, the quality, reliability, and availability of
 the defenders are inconsistent.
 Due to both inefficiency and corruption, detainees often face
 extended periods of pretrial detention after being charged and
 tried. Time spent awaiting trial and sentencing counts toward
 completion of the final sentence, but some long-term detainees
 have been found innocent, and, because of incompetent defense,
 many prisoners never see their final sentences reduced
 concomitantly. The poor and other disadvantaged groups who
 cannot afford to hire private lawyers usually face the longest
 periods of pretrial detention.
 According to some human rights activists and political
 figures, corruption charges against Abdala Bucaram (President
 Rodrigo Borjals opponent in the 1988 presidential campaign and
 mayor of Guayaquil in the mid-1980's) as well as the ongoing
 suit against the son-in-law of former President Febres-Cordero
 are politically motivated, and demonstrate that the Ecuadorian
 legal system is open to political manipulation.
 There were no political prisoners in 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police are required to have a warrant to enter a private home
 or business except in cases of hot pursuit. The police
 generally respect the sanctity of private homes and
 correspondence, although there have been cases of illegal
 entry in past years. Police surveillance is permitted and
 used in practice in criminal investigations. No specific
 cases of illegal surveillance or entry were reported in 1989.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 communication and this is respected in practice. Most of the
 major media organs--television, print and radio--are in
 private hands, although the Government owns one radio
 network. The Government occasionally requires television and
 radio to broadcast government programs featuring the President
 and requires newspapers to carry a minimum amount of news
 prepared by the National Secretariat of Social Communication.
 The media are lively and open, and represent the spectrum of
 political opinion from conservative to Communist. There are
 two major dailies in the capital, three in the principal
 commercial center, Guayaquil, and more than 20 additional
 
 
 565
 ECUADOR
 papers published daily throughout the country. There are also
 numerous newsmagazines published in Ecuador. There are four
 national television networks and over 400 radio stations, as
 well as programming from the United States available in
 Ecuador by cable, all of which operate freely, without
 censorship.
 There is no evidence of government interference with academic
 freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights of free assembly and
 association for peaceful purposes, rights which are generally
 respected in practice. Public rallies require prior approval
 (which is generally granted unless public order or safety are
 threatened) from local government agencies.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it relates to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice.
 There is no official state religion, although the population
 is nominally over 90 percent Roman Catholic. There are active
 Protestant and Jewish communities in the major cities. The
 Constitution prohibits discrimination against persons for
 religious reasons, although members of the clergy of any
 religious faith are barred from election to the Congress, the
 presidency, or vice presidency. Foreign-based religious
 orders are active in Ecuador and generally have cooperative
 relations with the Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides all citizens the right to travel
 freely throughout the country, choose their place of
 residence, and depart from and reenter Ecuador freely. These
 rights are respected in practice. Persons from other
 countries have readily found asylum in Ecuador. Some human
 rights activists and lawyers report that Ecuadorian
 immigration authorities have occasionally not respected the
 right of foreigners in deportation proceedings. No cases of
 forced resettlement were reported in 1989.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Following 7 years of military rule, free and open democratic
 elections for president took place in 1979, 1984, and 1988.
 Congressional elections take place every 2 years, with the
 next scheduled for June 1990. There are currently 14
 political parties legally registered in Ecuador, including 2
 Communist parties--the Soviet-oriented FADI and the more
 extreme Popular Democratic Movement (MPD) (more sympathetic to
 the Chinese Communist Party), both of which are represented in
 Congress. In total, 11 of the 14 registered parties are
 currently represented in the legislature. Voting is mandatory
 for literate citizens over 18 years of age, and voluntary for
 the illiterate. Active duty members of the military service,
 according to the Constitution, may not vote. All citizens,
 regardless of sex, religion, socioeconomic status, or ethnic
 origin, have the right to form and join political parties.
 
 
 566
 ECUADOQR
 Only legally registered political parties can present
 candidates for election, and a candidate has to be a member of
 a legally registered party to stand for election.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1989 there were no reports of lack of cooperation by the
 administration of President Rodrigo Borja with either domestic
 or international human rights groups. There were complaints
 that lower level security officials occasionally did not
 cooperate in reviews of specific human rights cases. However,
 human rights observers agree that at the political level
 government officials are normally cooperative and often try to
 resolve problems which occur in the first instance at lower
 levels.
 The organizations most active in monitoring human rights in
 Ecuador during 1989 were the Ecuadorian Ecumenical Commission
 on Human Rights, the Latin American Human Rights Association
 (ALDHU, headquartered in Quito), and the Ecuadorian
 Congressional Commission on Human Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the Constitution specifically outlaws discrimination
 for racial, religious, linguistic, gender, political, or
 social reasons, in practice such discrimination does occur.
 There is no overt or legally sanctioned discrimination against
 these groups, but historically the urban poor have been and
 remain predominantly black, Indian, or of mixed ethnic
 background. The vast majority of the Indian population is
 rural and poor. Indigenous groups complained that government
 programs encouraging economic development and migration to
 sparsely populated areas traditionally inhabited by various
 Indian tribes are destroying indigenous cultural and economic
 life. The Government promotes colonization in the Oriente,
 which has the effect of negating the land rights of the
 indigenous people of the region. This colonization process
 reflects a desire on the part of some in the Government to
 fortify the frontier with Peru. Other government agencies are
 attempting to establish mechanisms to ensure that the rights
 of the Indian population are protected, but to date these
 efforts have been only minimally successful, if at all.
 Even though some changes in law in 1987 and 1989 granted
 additional rights to women in the areas of property, divorce,
 and inheritance, women still suffer discrimination under civil
 law. No recent data on women in the Ecuadorian work force are
 available but women's rights activists agree that women's wage
 rates are lower than men's even in the same occupation.
 Violence against women probably occurs with greater frequency
 than is reported in the media or in official data. Wife
 beating is believed to be common but is rarely reported. Wife
 beating is not prohibited by law. Human rights groups believe
 that in this male-dominated traditional society, women are
 either afraid or ashamed to report rapes when they occur. In
 addition, until recently, Ecuadorian men had the legal right
 to beat a female relative caught in an "illicit" sexual act.
 In 1989 there were no official government programs designed to
 address the problem of violence against women.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers by law enjoy the right of association in forming and
 belonging to trade unions, as well as the right to strike.
 The only limitation on these rights is the prohibition against
 unionization for the military, police, and those government
 employees (the vast majority).who are covered by the
 Ecuadorian Administrative Code. (Public employees covered by
 the Ecuadorian Work Code do have the right to form unions and
 to strike).
 Approximately 12 to 15 percent of the labor force is
 unionized. There are four large labor centrals or
 confederations, and numerous unaffiliated unions, some of
 which are quite effective, such as the National Drivers*
 Federation. Unions are free of government control and are
 free to join international labor organizations. The
 Confederation of Free Trade Union Organizations is affiliated
 to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU).
 In a rare instance, the Government took into custody the
 president of the National Drivers Federation in an attempt to
 break a June strike, but the union leader was only held for 48
 hours and the strike took place anyway.
 In its 1989 report, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Experts (COE) reiterated its observation that
 several of the provisions of Ecuador's labor code are
 incompatible with ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of
 Association. Among them: prohibitions on public employees
 forming trade unions; the requirement that members of works
 councils' executive committees be Ecuadorian; dissolution of a
 works council when union membership falls below 25%;
 prohibition of unions participating in political or religious
 activities; and the penalty of imprisonment for instigators of
 collective work stoppages. The Government's failure to bring
 its legislation into compliance with Convention 87 and
 Convention 105 on forced labor (see below) was the subject of
 a -special paragraph" in the report of the Committee on
 Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CACR) to the
 1989 International Labor Conference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 All private employers with more than 15 employees who belong
 to a union or employees, association are obliged by the Labor
 Code to negotiate collectively when the union so requests.
 This broad right does not extend to most public sector
 employees, nor to management in certain entities with social
 or public objectives, "nor to employees of entities financed
 by municipal or central government taxes, tariffs, or
 subsidies." The Labor Code prohibits discrimination against
 unions, and requires that employers provide space for union
 activities if the union requests. However, the report of the
 ILO's COE, cited above, noted Ecuadorian law does not provide
 protection against antiunion activity at the time of
 recruitment.
 The Labor Code provides for resolution of labor conflicts
 through an Arbitration and Conciliation Board which consists
 of the labor inspector of the Ministry of Labor, two
 representatives named by the workers, and two named by the
 
 
 568
 ECUADOR
 employer. Participation in this arbitration process is
 voluntary, and strikes and lockouts are permitted even while
 arbitration is under way.
 The ICFTU executive board in I-ay 1989 resolved to ask the
 ICFTU general secretary to lodge a complaint with the ILO
 against the Government of Ecuador for its actions in
 connection with a strike against the National Brewers Company
 because these actions "contribute to flagrant disregard for
 recognized iiternational labor standards." Some observers
 within Ecuador's labor movement, however, are not in agreement
 that the employer is guilty of "flagrant disregard."
 The labor law is enforced uniformly throughout the country;
 there are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is prohibited under the Constitution as well
 as the Labor Code. In 1989 there were no reports of forced
 labor. The ILO's COE called on the Government to repeal
 Decree 105, which provides punishment, including compulsory
 labor, for anyone who participates in a work stoppage.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Persons of less than 14 years of age are prohibited by law
 from working, except in special circumstances such as
 apprenticeships. Those between ages 14 and 18 are required to
 have parental or guardiar'permission to work. In practice, in
 rural areas and in the active informal economy which is
 particularly evident in major cities, many children under the
 age of 14 work in family-owned businesses, as shoeshiners,
 street peddlers, or on-family-owned farms. Rudimentary
 enforcement mechanisms exist but are totally inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek, a 15-day
 annual vacation, a minimum wage, and employer-provided
 benefits. The minimum wage was recently raised to
 approximately $47 per month. This minimum wage is not
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and his family. Many must supplement the minimum wage with
 income from other sources. Employers are responsible for
 maintaining safe and clean working conditions. The Social
 Security Institute is responsible for enforcement, which is
 generally adequate.
