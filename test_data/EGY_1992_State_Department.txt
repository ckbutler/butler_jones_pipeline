 EGYPT
 The Arab Republic of Egypt is by its Constitution a "socialist democratic state"
 in which Islam is the religion of the State. President Hosni Mubarak was reelected
 to a second 6-year term in 1987 by the People's Assembly. The Cabinet is appointed
 by, and responsible to, the President. The National Democratic Party (NDP) has
 been in power since 1978 and commands large majorities in the elected People's As-
 sembly and the Shura (consultative) Council. One opposition party is represented
 in the People's Assembly. Some opposition parties boycotted the 1990 People's As-
 sembly election.
 In addition to regular police, there are two security services under the Ministry
 of Interior. the General Directorate for State Security Investigations (GDSSI); and
 the Central Security Forces (CSF), a 300,000-strong force that is sometimes used
 to make arrests, enforce curfews and bans on public demonstrations, and take part
 in paramilitary operations against armed extremists. Both have been implicated in
 many reports of torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees. According to
 the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total military expenditures for
 1989 were $3,499 million. There is no indication that efforts will be made to reduce
 these expenditures in the near future, although the Government says its military
 modernization will result in force reductions.
 Egypt has a mixed economy dominated by an inefficient public sector. With sup-
 port from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the Government is
 moving slowly to restructure, or privatize, many state-owned companies. It already
 has reduced subsidies on consumer and capital goods and services and has liberal-
 ized the currency and interest-rate markets. Rising prices and unemployment were
 serious problems in 1992.
 The Constitution provides for various human rights, including a multiparty politi-
 cal system, regular elections, rule of law and an independent judiciary, freedom of
 opinion, and the right to peaceable private assembly. Many of these rights are freely
 practiced. However, the pattern of human rights abuse seen in Eg'pt over the past
 few years remained essentially unchanged in 1992, and many basic rights continue
 to be significantly restricted. The primary abuses were the torture of hundreds of
 detainees by security forces, the Government's failure to punish those responsible,
 and infractions under the Emergency Law, especially the incidence of arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention without trial. Two military trials of suspected Islamic extremists
 set a disturbing precedent. Islamic extremists attacked government officials, Egyp-
 tian Christians, foreign tourists, and murdered a prominent secular Muslim intellec-
 tual. The NDP dominates the political scene to such an extent that, as a practical
 matter, Egyptians do not have a meaningful ability to change their government.
 Women an Christians face discrimination based on tradition and some aspects of
 the law. Important worker rights are restricted, including prohibition of the right
 to strike.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-According to the Egyptian Organiza-
 tion for Human Rights, there was one apparently extrajudicial killing in 1992, a de-
 tainee who died in December due to police torture.
 In August and September, citizens in two Nile delta towns staged antipolice riots
 in protest against the deaths of two arrested per-sons who allegedly died after re-
 lease as a result of mistreatment while in police custody. The Government claimed
 that the deaths were not related to alleged police abuse and promised an investiga-
 tion.
 More than 80 persons were killed in civil disturbances in 1992, the highest re-
 corded level since 1981. Most violence was instigated by Islamic extremists. The ex-
 tremists killed 47 persons including 27 Copts and 9 police officers. In antiextremist
 operations, security forces killed at least 33 persons, including 6 innocent bystand-
 ers. Local and international human rights observers maintain that security forces
 have become accustomed to using lethal force quickly and usually do not give the
 warning prescribed by law. The number of innocent bystanders killed by security
 forces indicates an excessive use of lethal force.
 On August 23, police in Assiyut killed seven Islamic extremists. The Government
 claimed the suspects opened fire on a police patrol, but opposition press reports sug-
 
 
 991
 gested the victims were not given sufficient opportunity to surrender. Selim al-Amir
 Sormani, a reported Islamic extremist leader in Assiyut, was killed by police on Au-
 gust 21 while they were attempting to arrest him. Ahmed Mohamed al-Kafrawi,
 sought for the robbery and murder of a Coptic jewelry store owner, was killed in
 November in a 90-minute gun battle with Cairo police who were searching for him.
 Throughout the year Islamic extremists killed a number of security officers and
 at least 27 Copts. Seeking revenge for the killing of a Muslim by a Copt in a land
 dispute, a group of Islamic extremists entered a predominately Christian village in
 Assiyut Governorate on May 4 and shot to death 13 Copts and a Muslim bystander.
 In October, six Copts were killed in Sohag Governorate during 2 days of anti-Chris-
 tian rioting. In November suspected Islamic extremists opened fire on a tourist bus
 carrying 55 Coptic pilgrims, wounding 10 passengers, and a Coptic pharmacist was
 stabbe in Assiyut. In Giza Governorate, a Coptic shop owner was killed by sus-
 pected Islamic extremists in October.
 On June 8, two Islamic extremist suspects shot to death Farag Foda, a noted
 human rights activist and critic of Islamic fundamentalism, outside his office in
 Cairo. The police arrested an assailant who reportedly said that Foda was slain for
 his secularist views. Subsequently, the Government assigned guards to the homes
 and offices of some prominent Muslim secularists who were viewed as possible fun-
 damentalist targets.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of new disappearances in 1992. The
 cases of three persons reported missing in previous years, Zakariya al-Sayed Bakr,
 Mustafa Mohamed Abdehamid Othman, and Nasra Fathi Ibrahim, remain un-
 solved. Except in the case of Othman, the Government has not responded to inquir-
 ies about their fate. In the Othman case, the Government claims he was released
 from prison in 1989, while the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR)
 claims he was never released and was probably killed under torture.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There is convincing evidence that police and security forces systematically practice
 torture. Perpetrators are seldom punished, although officers convicted of torture
 may receive up to 10 years in prison, and murder charges may be brought against
 those responsible for a victim's death. Government officials deny that torture is an
 official policy and maintain that all torture allegations are investigated. In Decem-
 ber a court in Fayyoum Governorate sentencedfour policemen to 3 to 5 years in
 jail for the 1990 death by torture of detainee Nasser Mustafa Khairy. The court
 found that the prison doctor had falsified Khairy's medical report, sentenced him to
 1 year in jail and revoked his medical license. However, as a matter of practice, the
 Government fails to investigate torture allegations effectively or prosecute those in-
 criminated in mistreating detainees.
 Most torture is perpetrated by officers of the Interior Ministry's GDSSI. Torture
 is used primarily to extract information about Islamic extremist groups, to coerce
 those being tortured to end their antigovernment activities, and to deter others from
 such activities. In 1992 nearly all torture victims were persons suspected of belong-
 ing to, or having knowledge of, extremist Islamic groups. Amer Abdel Menem, a
 journalist for the Islamist newspaper AI-Shaab, was detained in July and August
 and allegedly tortured because his paper criticized the Government.
 On December 15, a local human rights group released a report documenting 315
 cases of alleged torture by GDSSI officers and others in camps of the Central Secu-
 rity Forces in Assiyut, Qena, Fayyoum, Beni Suef, and Hurghada. The Government
 responded that all prisons and detention camps are under the control of the Pros-
 ecutor General's office, and there are no such "undeclared prisons."
 Physical abuse by local police of those arrested for criminal offenses is common
 (see Section L.a. concerning a detainee killed in December by police torture.).
 The following is the generally accepted pattern of security forces' procedure where
 torture is involved: Individuals, mostly Islamists, are arrested during early morning
 hours at their homes by a large squad of armed officers. Police deny information
 to family and friends as to where the individuals are being taken. Arrests occur
 under the Emergency Law which permits arrest without warrant and detention for
 90 days without a court order or a formal indictment of charges. Detainees are
 taken to a security forces' office or camp and handcuffed, blindfolded, and ques-
 tioned about their associations religious beliefs, and political views. During interro-
 gation, detainees are frequently stripped to their underwear; hung by their wrists
 with their feet touching the floor or forced to stand for prolonged periods; doused
 with hot and cold water; beaten; and subjected to electric shocks. The insertion of
 solid objects, including electric devices, into the anus has been reported.
 Written records of detainees' whereabouts are not kept while they are in the secu-
 rity forces' custody (usually about 10 days). A written record only begins when the
 security forces formally remand the detainee to the prison authorities, a practice
 
 
 992
 that invites abuse and frustrates the investigation of torture complaints. The secu-
 rity forces have also transferred some detainees from the regular prisons to other
 facilities where they are interrogated tortured, and then returned to prison. No
 written records are kept on such translers.
 Female detainees have been threatened with, and in some cases subjected to,
 rape. To facilitate apprehending male fugitives, security officers have also detained
 female family members as hostages.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are widely
 practiced, most often against Islamic extremists and others accused of threatening
 national security, including some nonviolent Islamists. Such arrests and detentions
 are conducted under the State of Emergency which has been in effect since Presi-
 dent Anwar Sadat's assassination in 1981. Under authority of the Emergency Law
 powers, which were extended until June 30, 1994, the Interior Minister may detain
 a person without indictment for 90 days. Detention orders also may be issued by
 public prosecutors, who have limited powers to commit individuals to confinement.
 Some detainees are not allowed to inform their relatives of their detention and
 access to legal counsel is often delayed. In theory, those arrested under the Emer-
 gency Law should be released after 90 days; in practice the Government sometimes
 rearrests detainees who have been released by court order-in effect detaining them
 without due process for prolonged periods without trial. Most detainees, however,
 are released after interrogation, and there has been a continuous flow of new arrests
 and releases from detention under the Emergency Law. An estimated 1,780 persons
 were in detention at the end of the year under the Emergency Law, many of whom
 may have been detained for political reasons.
 Under ordinary criminal procedure, arrested persons are charged with violations
 of specific laws, have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of arrest,
 and should be formally charged with in 48 hours of arrest or be released. Arrests
 under this procedure occur openly and with warrants issued by a district prosecutor
 or a judge. There is a system of bail. However, the regular Penal Code also gives
 the State wide detention powers. State prosecutors may obtain court orders to de-
 tain persons for 45 days and to confine them for up to 6 months to complete inves-
 tigations. Detainees are often released without explanation or acknowledgment that
 charges have been dropped.
 Followin  the outbreak of Islamic extremist violence the People's Assembly in
 July pasd several antiterrorism amendments to the Penal Code. These amend-
 ments broadened the definition of terrorism to include "spreading panic" or obstruct-
 ing the work of authorities. The amendments allow the police to hold suspects for
 24 hours before obtaining arrest warrants and prescribe the death penalty or life
 imprisonment for membership in a terrorist group.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria!.-There are three levels of criminal courts: primary
 courts, Appeals Courts, and the Court of Cassation, the final stage of criminal ap-
 peal. There is also a Supreme Constitutional Court, but its jurisdiction is limited
 to constitutional challenges.
 It does not hear criminal appeals. There are no juries, and criminal cases are
 heard by tribunals. Most trials are public.
 There are two special courts for criminal cases: the State Security Courts and the
 Courts of Ethics. The State Security Courts have jurisdiction over serious offenses
 such as armed insurrection. Three judges preside over upper and lower division tri-
 bunals, but two military officers may be added by presidential decree to an upper
 division tribunal. Defendants before a State Security Court may be charged under
 the penal code or the Emergency Law. When an indictment is handed down under
 the Emergency Law, the court is designated an Emergency State Security Court. A
 defendant has no judicial appeal from an Emergency State Security Court; however,
 he may file an appeal for clemency from the President who is empowered to amend,
 commute, or cancel a sentence or order a retrial. These powers mean that an acquit-
 tal may be canceled and the defendant retried for the same offense.
 The Prime Minister, acting on powers delegated from the President, has some-
 times refused to ratify acquittals from Emergency State Security Courts and ordered
 the defendants retried. Typically, these retrials never take place, and the defendants
 are released.
 Courts of Ethics hear cases falling under Law 95 of 1980, which makes illegal
 such activities as endangering the public safety," inciting youth "to depart from re-
 ligious values and loyalty to the fatherland," and denying the three "heavenly reli-
 gions." In recent years, the Ethics Courts have been used to try "economic crimes"
 such as corruption and drug trafficking. An Ethics Court conviction denies the de-
 fendant the right to engage in certain occupations and activities. A person may be
 tried in a State Security Court and an Ethics Court on similar indictments: in the
 former for criminal offenses, in the latter for economic gains associated with those
 
 
 993
 offenses. Ethics Courts have confiscated economic gains obtained under indictable
 offenses and may add prison terms to those that the State Security Courts mete out.
 If the Ethics and State Security Courts reach different verdicts, the defendant may
 appeal to the President for a pardon.
 In October President Mubarak ordered 2 cases involving 48 suspected Islamic ex-
 tremists tried in military courts. On December 7, the court acquitted nine defend-
 ants, sentenced eight to death (seven in absentia), and the remainder to prison
 terms. An administrative court later suspended the sentences on grounds that the
 military court lacked jurisdiction. The Government is appealing the suspensions.
 The defendants have no right of judicial review but may appeal to the President for
 clemency.
 The President appoints all judges based on nominations from the Higher Judicial
 Council, a constitutional body designed to ensure the independence of the judiciary.
 The Council is composed of senior judges, lawyers, and law professors, and is
 chaired by the President of the.Court of Cassation. It regulates judicial promotions,
 salaries, transfers, and disciplinary actions. Judges may be appointed as prosecutors
 and vice versa.
 In recent years, the judiciary has at times shown considerable independence from
 the executive branch. Judges have ordered inquests into torture cases; acquitted de-
 fendants when confessions were extracted by torture; challenged the legal ban on
 worker strikes; defended nonviolent political expression; overturned bans on prohib-
 ited political parties; overturned an election law which discriminated against inde-
 pendent candidates; and dissolved the People's Assembly elected thereby. However,
 the judiciary is still subject to considerable political and other outside influence. The
 Ethics Court allows nonjurists to try cases- the President may appoint military
 judges to Emergency State Security Courts, from which there is no appeal; and the
 executive branch does not always enforce court orders--sometimes rearresting per-
 sons, without formal charge under the Emergency Law, who earlier had been re.
 leased by court order.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In 1992
 there continued to be substantial abridgment, under the Emergency Law, of con-
 stitutional provisions regarding the right to privacy. Under the Constitution, homes,
 correspondence, telephone calls, and other means of communication "shall have
 their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall b6 guaranteed." Police must obtain war-
 rants before undertaking searches and wiretaps. Courts have dismissed cases in
 which warrants were issued without sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct
 searches without proper warrants are subject to criminal penalties, although in
 practice these are seldom imposed.
 The Emergency Law, however, empowers the State to search persons or places
 without warrants. The security agencies frequently place political activists, sus-
 pected subversives, journalists, and writers under surveillance, screen their cor-
 respondence (especially international mail), search them and their homes, and con-
 fiscate personal property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government has largely refrained from curtailing political
 expression. Egyptians openly express their views on a wide range of political and
 social issues, including vigorous criticism of the Government, without fear of govern-
 ment retribution. There are, nevertheless, a number of limitations on freedom of
 speech and press. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are often targets of criticism,
 but the press law stipulates fines or imprisonment for criticizing the President or
 a foreign head of state. In recent years, opposition journalists have, within limits,
 criticized the President without harassment, although he may not be satirized in
 cartoons.
 Most major dailies are goernment owned, their editors in chief are appointed by
 the President, and they generally follow the government line. However, criticisms
 of overnment policies are frequently found in these government-owned newspapers.
 'Re opposition newspapers are privately owned and associated with political par-
 ties. Most are weeklies with small circulations, except the respected opposition daily
 Al-Wafd and the smaller Islamist semiweekly Al-Shaab. Opposition newspapers fre-
 quently publish tough criticisms of the Government, which in turn inspire rejoinders
 from the establishment press. They also give greater prominence to human rights
 abuses in Egypt than do state-run newspapers, although the Islamist press tends
 to cover only abuses of Islamists. Even though the opposition press is independent,
 much of it is printed and distributed by a government-owned publishing house.
 
 
 994
 The Government influences the press in several ways. The Higher Press Council,
 chaired by the speaker of the Shura Council and composed of senior press figures,
 has the power to approve applications for new publications. Most Council members
 are close to the ruhng National Democratic Party and are thus inclined to follow
 the Government's lead. The Prosecutor General may ban reporting on an issue if
 there is an ongoing criminal investigation. Opposition journalists-have been har-
 assed or arrested. In October Adel Hussein, the editor of the opposition newspaper
 Al-Shaab, was questioned by state prosecutors for publishing articles which alleg-
 edly incited public opinion, misrepresented government policies, and impaired Egyp-
 tian-Sudanese relations.
 The Government firmly controls the right to publish through its power to license
 the media and through controls and influence on private organizations and political
 parties. The newsletter of the Arab Women's Sidarity   Aociation (AWSA) was
 banned when AWSA was ordered disbanded in December 1990 for alleged violations
 of the private organizations law (see Section 2.b.). In May the opposition newspaper
 Misr al-Fatah suspended publication for several weeks during a leadership struggle
 in the Misr al-Fatah political party. When new party leaders more friendly to the
 ruling National Democratic Party took over, the newspaper reappeared-with a less
 critical editorial line.
 Radio, television, and the Arabic-language news service are government owned
 and follow the government line. State-owned television and radio are more re-
 stricted in the news they cover than are newspapers. Political parties do not have
 access to broadcast facilities, even during election campaigns. The state monopoly
 on broadcasting is gradually being weakened by satellite dishes which bring inter-
 national programming to a yawing number of Egyptians, although this does little
 to afford the public access to local opposition parties views.
 Books and works of art may be confiscated or banned by decree of various min-
 istries without a court order. The Ministry of Interior regularly confiscates leaflets
 and other works by Islamic fundamentalists; the Ministry of Defense may ban
 works about sensitive security issues- and plays and films must pass Ministry of
 Culture censorship tests as scripts and as final productions. The Ministry of Culture
 also censors foreign films but is more lenient when these are in video format. The
 Ministry of Information censors television productions. Censors ensure that foreign
 films made in Egypt portray Egypt in a favorable light. Censors review scripts be-
 fore filming, are present during filming, and have the right to review the film before
 it is sent out of Egypt.
 The Islamic Research Association at Al-Azhar University has legal authority to
 censor the publications of the Koran and Islamic scriptural texts. In May Al-Azhar
 authorities declined to approve the shooting in Egypt of scenes for an American
 company's documentary on the Bible, reportedly because the film's account of bib-
 lical stories varied from the teachings of the Koran. In recent years, the Association
 has also passed judgments on the suitability of nonreligious books and artistic pro-
 ductions. Although these pronouncements do not have the force of law, A-Azhar as-
 serts the right to confiscate works it finds offensive. At the Cairo book fair in Janu-
 ary, a group of Al-Azhar clerics removed from display eight books five of which
 were critiques of political Islam long available in the Egyptian market. The books
 were eventually returned and displayed by order of the President.
 Islamic  activists  are  frequently  arrested  and  detained  for  distributing
 antigovernment pamphlets. The Government's new antiterrorism laws (see Section
 1.d) may inhibit freedom of expression, especially for proponents of Islamic law or
 for journa lists who have contacts with groups the authorities deem terrorist groups.
 The Government does not impinge on academic freedoms at universities. How-
 ever, some critics maintain that Islamist influence, which they believe induces dis-
 crimination against Christian studcnts, has gained prominence in public primary
 and secondary schools.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There ontinue to be substan-
 tial restrictions on this freedom. Under the Emergency Law, Interior Ministry ap-
 proval is required forpublic meetings, rallies, and protest marches. Permits are gen-
 erally granted for indoor rallies and those restricted to universiV campuses. The
 Ministry of Social Affairs has the authority to license and dissolve private organiza-
 tions." Licenses may be revoked if a private organization engages in political or reli-
 gious activities. The Private Organizations Law authorizes the Ministry to "merge
 two or mote associations to achieve a similar function," a provision that can be used
 to mege an undesirable organization out of existence.
 In May a court upheld the Government's 1991 decision to dissolve the Arab Wom-
 en's Solidarity Association (AWSA) and transfer its assets to the Islamic Women's
 Association. AWSA was founded in 1985 by feminist-secularist author Nawal al-
 Saadawi. The court argued that AWSA violated the Private Organizations Law
 
 
 995
 when it engaged in political or religious activities by publishing articles on political
 and religious subjects in its newsletter, sponsoring conferences of a political nature,
 opposing tenets of Islamic law, and harming Egypt's relations with other Arab coun-
 tries. AWSA is appealing the decision, and Ms. Saadawi still controls its assets, al-
 though the newsletter is still banned.
 Since 1985 the Government has refused to license as "private organizations* the
 Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) and the associated Arab Organi-
 zation for Human Rights (AOHR) on grounds that they are political organizations.
 Both continue to operate openly from the same Cairo office (see Section 4).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution guarantees "the freedom of belief" and
 the practice of religious rites. There are, however, important limitations. Islam is
 the state religion. Most Egyptians are Muslim, but approximately l0per cent of the
 population, 5 million    le, belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, the largest
 Christian minority in Sh iddle East. There are other small Christian denomina-
 tions. The small Jewish community practices its religion without harassment. Mem-
 bers of reconied religions maintain links with coreligionists abroad.
 Foreign ceg pursue their ministries without harassment, but non-Muslims are
 barred from proselytizing.
 Islam accepts Christian and other converts, but Muslims face legal and social
 pressure if they convert to another faith. There is no clear legal prohibition against
 conversion or proselytizing of Muslims, but Article 98f of the Penal Code prohibits
 any person from 'degrading or disdaining any of the holy religions or any of its reli-
 ous sects" with "the intention of harming national unity and social peace." This
 is interpreted as forbidding conversion of Muslims. Conviction under Article 98f is
 pUnishable by imprisonment. Egyptian ourts have upheld the principle that Mus-
 insmay not change their identity papers to reflect conversion to a new religion.
 As a consequence, married male converts from Islam must still register their chil-
 dren as Muslims, as the law regards the fathers as Muslims.
 Security forces harassed, detained for prolonged periods, and sometimes tortured
 Egyptian Christians for proselytizing Muslims. An 1856 Ottoman decree still in
 force requires non-Muslims to obtain what is now a presidential decree to build or
 repair a place of worship. Coptic Christians maintain that they are frequently un-
 able to obtain such authorization, and as a result some communities use private
 buildings and apartments for religious services. In the first 6 months of 1992, the
 presidency issued two permits to construct Protestant and Coptic Orthodox church-
 es. Christian and moderate Muslim intellectuals have argued for legislative reform
 to abolish the Ottoman decree and other limits, while Islamic fundamentalists have
 defended the building restrictions.
 In theory, mosques must also be licensed by the Government. The Penal Code pro-
 hibits using a place of worship for antigovernment speeches, and the Ministry of Re-
 ligious Affairs proposes themes and monitors sermons. In practice, however, the
 Ministry cannot control all sermons, especially at "unauthorized" mosques. In 1992
 the Government increased its efforts to bring private mosques under admiistrative
 control to counter Islamic extremism. In recent years the police have closed several
 unlicensed churches and mosques, although others continue in opration.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Egyptians and foreigners are free to travel within Egypt except in cer-
 tain military areas. Egyptian males who have not completed compulsory military
 service may not travel abroad or emigrate, although this restriction can be cir-
 cumvented. Unmarried women under 21 must have permission from their fathers
 to obtain passports; married women require permission from their husbands. Citi-
 zens who leave "te country have the right to return, and millions of Egyptians work
 abroad.
 The deportation of Egtian citizens and aliens granted political asylum isprohib-
 ited and not practiced. Egypt ishost to thousands of refugees, but only a few are
 granted the right to resettle oin Egypt. In the past, some Ethiopians andother chri-
 cans seeking documentation as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees have been detained by the police and transported to areas near the
 Libyan or Sudanese borders where they were released. Some have returned to their
 countries; others have found their way back to Egyptian cities.
 Approximately 100 Palestinians have been held in long-term detention on security
 charges. Some have been tortured. Many entered Egypt illegally from the Israeli-
 occupied territories. Others are legally resident in Egypt and are under investiga-
 tion for alleged political actitioes, including, in some cases, opposition to Egypt's al
 liance with the members of the coalition against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 
 
 996
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The rulin National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the 454-seat People's As-
 sembly, the Shura Council, local governments, the mass media, labor, the large pub-
 lic sector, and the licensing of new political parties, newspapers, and private organi-
 zations. Thus, as a practical matter, Egyptians do not have a meaningful ability to
 change the national government. The police did not interfere in the November 1992
 local council elections in which opposition parties defeated the ruling NDP in sev-
 eral constituencies. However, the ection rules prevented fair competition: the elec-
 tions were based on a winner-take-all party-list system that favors the NDP; the
 government manipulated the announcement of the election date; some licenses for
 opposition political rallies were denied; and all parties, including the NDP, were de-
 nied access to state-owned radio and television. In 1990, the Supreme Constitutional
 Court found the party-list system unconstitutional for national elections. In early
 1992, the Government drafted legislation that would have abolished the lists in local
 elections, but it never brought the bill to a vote.
 In the 1990 People's Assembly election, NDP candidates won 383 seats of 444
 elected, independents won 55, and a leftist party won 6. Seven opposition parties
 boycotted the election. The Constitution reserves 10 Assembly seats forresidential
 appointees, which assures some representation for Copts and women. Women were
 granted suffrage in 1956. Ten women hold Assembly seats: seven elected and three
 appointed. The single female Cabinet member has served since 1978. Six Copts sit
 in the Assembly: one elected and five appointed.
 The Assembly debates government proposals, and members exercise their author-
 ity to call Cabinet ministers to explain policy and legislation, but it has little effec-
 tive power. The legislature does not have sufficient authority to challenge or re-
 strain the executive and many executive branch initiatives and policies are carried
 out by ministerial decree without significant legislative oversight. Presidential ap-
 pointments do not require legislative approval- the executive initiates almost all leg-
 islation; the Assembly may not modify the budget except with the Government's ap-
 proval; there is no recent record of an Assembly defeat of a major executive pro-
 posal; and there is little oversight of the Interior Ministry's use of Emer en  aw
 powers. The executive prepares the military budget, and it is not debated publicly.
 Roll-call votes in the Assembly are rare. Votes are generally reported in aggregate
 terms of yea's and nay's, and thus constituents have no independent method of
 checking a member's voting record.
 There are 10 officially recognized opposition parties. New parties must be ap-
 p roved by the Parties Committee, a semiofficial body. In 1992 the Political Parties
 Committee disapproved the applications for recognition of three parties. A fourth
 party withdrew its application before final adjudication. Meanwhile, administrative
 courts overturned two previous committee disapprovals in favor of the People's
 Democratic Party and the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party but upheld the Commit-
 tee's disapproval of the Egyptian Socialist Party. In December the People's Assem-
 bly approved a law that bans meetings organized by parties that are still in the
 process of formation.
 In May the Parties Committee recognized the new leadership of the Misr al-Fatah
 party after a group of party dissidents, reportedly supported by the NDP, ousted the
 old leadership. Critics argue that the Committee's recognition of the new leaders
 constituted unwarranted government interference in the affairs of an opposition
 party.
 To form a party without a license is a felony. The law prohibits political parties
 based on religion. Nevertheless, Muslim Brotherhood partisans are publicly known
 and openly voice views associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. Some have served
 in the Assembly as independents or members of other recognized parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no officially recognized local human rights organizations in E$ypt, as
 the Government refuses to license them as private organizations (see Section 2.b.)
 on the grounds that they are political organizations. Nevertheless, the Egyptian Or-
 ganization for Human Rights (EOHR) and the associated Arab Organization for
 Human Rights (AOHR) operate openly out of the same Cairo office, and EOHR's
 lawyers visit prisons and collect information from government offices. Both EOHR
 and AOHR have challenged the ruling on their legal status in the courts. EOHR's
 last court hearing was in 1991, and no further hearings are scheduled; AOHR has
 not had a court hearing since 1989 and none are scheduled. EOHR lawyers report
 being exposed to provocations and threats, including questioning by the security
 forces.

 In February a Middle East Watch (MEW) delegation visited Egypt to investigate
 reports of arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention, and torture. MEW representatives
 met with the Minister of Interior and the Prosecutor General, visitedprisons and
 interviewed detainees without interference, and released a 224-page report in Cairo
 in July. In May President Mubarak received the Secretary General of Amnesty
 International
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4gion, Language, or Social Status
 Egtian law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects of the law and many
 traditional practices discriminate against women. Under Egyptian law, women need
 their husband's or fathe's permission to obtain a passport or travel abroad (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.). Only males can transmit Egyptian citizenship. In rare cases this means
 that children born to Egyptian mothers and stateless fathers are themselves state.
 less.
 Laws affecting marriage and personal status generally correspond to a person's
 religion, which for most Egyptians is Islam. A 1979 liberalization of the family sta-
 tus law strengthened a Muslim woman's rights to divorce and to child custody. In
 1985 the changes were found unconstitutional on grounds they conflicted with Is-
 lamic law and were repealed.
 Under Islamic law non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim
 women, biut non-Musfim women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim fe-
 male heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian wid-
 ows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her par-
 ents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits
 all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs have the duty to provide for all family
 members who need assistance.
 Egyptian women have employment opportunities in government, medicine law
 academia, the arts, and, to a lesser degree, business. About 100 officers in the Egyp-
 tian diplomatic service are women, including three ambassadors. Social pressure
 against women pursuing a career is still strong, and some Egyptian feminists say
 that a resurgent Islamic fundamentalist trend lmits further gains. Women's rights
 advocates also point to other discriminatory attitudes and practices such as female
 circumcision; Islamic practices on marriage, divorce, and inheritance; and the male
 relative's role in enforcing women's compliance with religiously prescribed codes of
 sexual conduct.
 Family violence against women does occur, but its extent is unknown. Abuse with-
 in the family is seldom discussed publicly, owing to the value attached to personal
 privacy in this traditional society.
 There are few reliable statistics on female genital mutilation (circumcision), but
 the practice is less common in the cities. The less extreme form of excision and the
 more dangerous infibulation are practiced in some parts of upper Egypt. Female
 genital mutilation is not against the law, but doctors are prohibited from performing
 it in government hospitals.
 The apprximately 5 million Copta are the objects of violent assaults by Islamist
 extremists and of discrimination by the Government. In 1992 Islamic extremists
 killed at least 27 Copts, robbed and murdered Co ptic shopowners, and burned scores
 of Copt-owned properties, including several churches. Seeking revenge for the killing
 of a Muslim by a Copt in a land dispute, a group of Islamic extremistr, entered a
 predominately Christian village in Assiyut Governorate on May 4 and shot to death
 13Copts and a Muslim bystander. In October, six Copts were killed in Sohag
 Governorate during 2 days of anti-Christian rioting. In November, suspected Islamic
 extremists opened fire on a tourist bus carrying 55 Coptic pilgrims, wounding ten
 passengers; and a Coptic pharmacist was stabbed and Copt-owned prperties
 burned during anti-Christian rioting in Assiyut City. In Giza Covernorate, Coptic
 properties were burned in April and a Coptic shop owner killed by suspected Islamic
 extremists in October.
 Extremists also obstructed church repairs and construction and harassed Copt-
 owned businesses. In some cases, extremists have imposed "taxes" on Christian resi-
 dents to protect their person and property. Security forces arrest extremists who
 perpetrate violence against Copts, but the Government does not always prevent at-
 tack~s and does little to correct nonviolent forms of discrimination-including its
 own.
 Government discriminatory    practices include: suspetd    statistical  under-
 representation of the size of the Christian population; delays in issuing church
 building and repair permits; the detention and mistreatment of some Muslim con-
 verts to Christianity, laws preventing Muslims from changing their identity papers
 to reflect their conversion to Christiamty (upheld in a 1980 curt decision) a ru-
 quirement that public school students-including Christians-memorize      oranic

 verses as part of their Arabic studies; heavy emphasis on Islamic television pro-
 gramming--some carrying anti-Christian themes; job discrimination in the public
 sector, the police, the armed forces, and government agencies; discrimination in ad-
 mission to state medical schools, as some Islamists find medical treatment of Mus-
 lim women by Christian doctors and pharmacists offensive; and underrepresentation
 in government. There are no Copt governors and few Copts in the upper ranks of
 the armed forces, police, and diplomatic service.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assciation.-Egyptian workers may, but are not required to, join
 trade unions. A union local, or worker's committee, may be formed if 50 employees
 express a desire to organize. Most union members, about 25 percent of the labor
 force, are employed by state-owned enterprises. The law stipulates that "high ad-
 ministrative" officials in government and public enterprises may not join unions.
 There are 23 trade unions, all required to belong to the Egyptian Trade Union
 Federation (ETUF), the sole legally recognized labor federation. The International
 Labor Organization's Committee of Experts (COE) has long noted that the law re-
 quiring all national trade unions to join a single federation infringes upon workers'
 freedom of association. The Government has shown no sign that it intends to accept
 the establishment of more than one federation. The ETUF leadership asserts that
 it actively promotes workers' interests and that there is no need for another federa-
 tion. ETUF officials have close relations with the NDP, and some are members of
 the People's Assembly and the Shura Council. They speak vigorously on behalf of
 workers concerns, but public confrontations between the ETUF and the Government
 are rare. Disputes are more often resolved by consensus behind closed doors.
 The Government considers strikes a form of public disorder, not a contractual dis-
 pute. Hence, they are de facto illegal. Nevertheless, strikes do occur. The union lead-
 ership keeps its distance from workers who organize job actions because the law em-
 powers the Government to remove from office any union executive board member
 who provokes a strike. Strikers may be sentenced to up to 2 years in jail, and those
 who incite others to strike may receive mre severe penalties. A 19771law stipulates
 hard labor for strikers in key industries, the disruption of which would pose a
 "threat to the national economy." In the past, police have used lethal force to break
 up strkes at state-ron companies. In some cases, the Government has forcibly relo-
 cated strikers to new jobs in different parts of the country. Strikes occurring in 1992
 were brief and isolated. The ETUF leadership is seeking the right to strike as part
 of economic reform.
 The ETUF is affiliated with the International Confederation of Arab Trade
 Unions and participaes in the tripartite forums of the ILO and the Arab Labor Or-
 ganization.  me unions within the ETUF have affiliated with international trade
 union organizations, and others are in the preess of doing so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectioely.-Law 137 of 1981 authorizes
 collective bargaining agreements for the public and private setor. In theory, the
 law should apply to the export processing zones. However, Egypt's public sector is
 undergoing reorganization, and the law has not yet been applied. There have been
 no known agments negotiated under this law. Furthermore, the law does not
 speciv how disputes arising from negotiated agreements would be resolved. Never-
 theless, in 1992 the ETUF eadership began training union leaders in collective bar-
 gaining techniques. Meanwhile, the Government atil sets wages, hours, and condi-
 tions of employment by law. Unions may negotiate work contracts with public enter-
 prises if the latter acquiesce voluntarily, but unions otherwise lack collective bar-
 gaining power in the state sector. However, the ETUF leadership anticipates a
 greater role for collective bargaining as a result of the Government's economic re-
 form program and is training union leaders in collective bargaining techniques.
 Labor law and practice are the same in the export processing zones as in the rest
 of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 12. Education is compulsory until age 15. An employee must be at least 15 to
 join a labor union. The labor law of 1981 states that children 12 to 15 may work
 6 hours a day, but not after 7 p.m. and not in dangerous or heavy activities. Child
 workers must obtain medical certificates and work permits before they are em-
 paoed. A 1989 study estimated that two-thirds of the child labor population of per-
 haps 720,000 work on farms. However, some children also work as apprentices in
 repair and craft shops and as workers in heavier industries such as brickmaking
 and textiles. It is difficult to verify how closely the Ministry of Labor enforces child
 labor laws, especially in familyowned enterprises.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work--For government and public-sector employees,
 the minimum wage for a 6-day, 48-hour workweek is determined by a combination
 of law and presidential decree. Base pay is supplemented by a complex system of
 fringe benefits and bonuses that may double or triple a worker's take-homepay. It
 is doubtful that the average family could survive on a worker's base pay in the pri-
 vate sector, and larger private companies generally observe the requirement and
 pay bonuses as well. Smaller firms do not always pay the minimum wage or bo-
 nuses.
 The Ministry of Labor sets worker health and safety standards, which also apply
 in the export processing zones, but enforcement and inspection are uneven.
