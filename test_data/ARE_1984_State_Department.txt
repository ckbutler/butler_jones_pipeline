 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven small,
 traditional Arab shaykhdoms, formed in 1971 when Great Britain
 relinquished its special treaty relationship with the rulers.
 The emirates are unequal in size, population, natural
 resources and economic development. Abu Dhabi, the largest
 and wealthiest, serves as the national capital and has played
 a predominant role in the federation. Under Abu Dhabi's
 ruler, Shaykh Zayid, who is also president of the Emirates,
 considerable progress has been made toward the formation of an
 effective central government structure. However, the
 individual emirates continue to exercise extensive authority
 over their own economic resources and development planning,
 police and security forces, law courts, and social welfare
 policies. The rulers in each of the seven emirates have
 almost monarchical powers within their own domains. Although
 democratic institutions are lacking, there is considerable
 respect for personal freedom.
 The Emirates' Islamic and tribal traditions have shaped its
 outlook on political and legal organization and its national
 leadership's attitude toward human rights. Under the
 Provisional Constitution adopted in 1971, political control in
 each emirate remains in the hands of its hereditary ruling
 families. The rulers of the seven emirates or their deputies
 form the Supreme Council, the nation's highest executive and
 legislative body, which rarely meets. The Supreme Council
 elects two of its members to be the federation's president and
 vice president. The president then appoints a prime minister
 and his cabinet.
 Since 1971, the ruler of Abu Dhabi has been president of the
 federation; the ruler of Dubai, the emirate second to Abu
 Dhabi in power and influence, has served as vice president.
 Since 1979, the latter has also served as prime minister.
 A Federal National Assembly of 40 members, appointed by the
 rulers of each emirate, advises the Government on legislation
 and reviews its operations. While the Assembly's views are
 not binding on the Government, in practice they are given
 serious consideration.
 The population of the United Arab Emirates is about 1,260,000,
 including about 200,000 citizens hosting approximately
 1 million guest workers. The presence of this large foreign
 population has not stirred up significant resentment among
 Emirate citizens, who tend to isolate themselves socially from
 the expatriates but regard foreign skills and labor as
 essential to their own prosperity. However, as oil revenues
 have decreased sharply, concern has mounted over the
 tremendous proportion of foreigners in the population. As a
 consequence, and to prevent expatriates--particularly Arab
 expatriates--from developing a vested interest in the society,
 the Government has become considerably more stringent in
 granting visas for dependents.
 It has taken other measures to reduce the number of
 foreigners, including administrative deportations for
 infractions of the law, fees for health services, and
 restrictions on public education benefits. There have also
 been across-the-board layoffs, from the managerial level to
 unskilled laborers. The drawdown in population has proceeded
 relatively smoothly, with little disruption to the economy or
 the society.

 There was little perceptible change in the Emirates' attitude
 toward human rights during 1984. Islamic and tribal
 traditions remain strong. There has been some recent movement
 toward the extension of jurisdiction of Muslim Shari'a law in
 limited areas, and in rare instances, usually involving
 powerful ruling families, the administration of tribal justice
 has taken precedence over applicable due process standards.
 Liberalization of social and governmental institutions
 proceeds gradually. In 1971, when the federation was founded,
 widespread illiteracy and a lack of political consciousness
 outside the tribal context were the norm. Thirteen years
 later, education of children is compulsory, and the literacy
 rate has risen to about 56 percent. Traditional, informal
 methods of decision-making are slowly evolving toward more
 structured and modern practices in the context of established
 governmental institutions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing during 1984.
 b. Disappearances
 No disappearances were reported in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading
 treatment. Some emirates, including Abu Dhabi and Sharjah
 (the latter for alcohol offenses only), apply traditional
 Islamic procedures and penalties in criminal cases which are
 tried in religious (Shari'a) courts. Transgressions by
 Muslims of Shari'a law (drinking or possession of alcohol, or
 publicly violating the Ramadan Fast, for example) are punished
 by public caning, in addition to fines and/or imprisonment.
 Theoretically, the amputation of a hand for theft may be
 imposed by Shari'a courts, but there have been no known
 instances of this in recent years. Theft generally brings
 imprisonment and subsequent deportation if the offender is
 foreign. Prison conditions, while uncomfortable because of
 overcrowding and lack of air conditioning, are tolerable.
 Prison diet and medical care are adequate. Incarcerated
 individuals are permitted visits from family members, lawyers,
 and, if expatriates, from consular officials, although in
 practice consular access may be difficult to obtain. There is
 no evidence that the authorities condone mistreatment of
 prisoners or that abuse is practiced.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The laws of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without
 probable cause, and prolonged detention without trial is
 rare. An individual is usually charged within a few days.
 One report of arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention was
 received in 1984.
 Although the Provisional Constitution does not specifically
 guarantee habeas corpus, police are generally required to
 
 
 1418
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 report any arrest to a designated court judge within 48
 hours. The judge then determines if there is sufficient
 evidence for a trial. If so, the individual is brought to
 trial fairly promptly; if not, he is released. There appear
 to be no instances of preventive detention. Exile as a form
 of punishment apparently does not exist.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Emirate courts provide trials before experienced civil or
 religious judges. The judges are mainly Egyptians, Sudanese,
 and Palestinians since there are as yet few Emirate-citizen
 jurists. As foreign judges serve on limited employment
 contracts, they may not be independent enough to restrain the
 Government in a politically sensitive case. Interference in
 the judicial process by rulers of various emirates does
 occur. Dubai is a notable exception. The Provisional
 Constitution provides for broad judicial review powers.
 Except for the rare cases involving national security, ruling
 families and the executive agencies usually respect the
 independence of the courts. A ruler will occasionally pardon
 a convicted person or commute a sentence, but only subsequent
 to judicial proceedings.
 There are no jury trials. In civil courts, the accused may be
 represented by counsel of his choice. No public defender
 system exists. Criminal courts based on European models
 function alongside the Islamic courts. Crimes and penalties
 are defined by law--civil or Shari'a--and the accused is
 presumed innocent until found guilty. In Shari'a court,
 counsel is not permitted. Definition of the crime and the
 penalty are drawn from religious sources.
 Public access to trials may be limited to those with a concern
 in the case. If political or security matters are involved,
 access is severely restricted. No such trials took place in
 1984. Special labor courts have been established to handle
 disputes between workers and employers and are widely believed
 to be fair in their judgments.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Provisional Constitution guarantees freedom from arbitrary
 search, and probable cause of criminal activity is required
 before they may enter a private home. There have not been
 reports of arbitrary interference with privacy during 1984.
 In prior years, such interference has occurred when national
 security considerations were involved.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Emirate citizens are constitutionally guaranteed freedom of
 speech, communication, religion, and assembly within the
 limits of the law. Individuals--citizen and foreign--may
 express their views orally on a wide range of public issues
 without fear of official harassment. Radio and television are
 owned by the Ministry of Information and Culture or by
 individual emirate governments. Sensitive subjects, including
 critical treatment of the Government or society, religion, or
 inter-Arab disputes, are avoided. There is television
 censorship of Western entertainment that might offend
 
 
 1419
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 conservative Muslim sensibilities. A press law codifies the
 powers of censorship, media closure, and control of
 reporting. Newspapers are subsidized--not owned--by the
 Government. In practice, discreet guidance and
 self-censorship set the media tone. Mild criticism of poor
 execution of government policy is permitted, criticism of the
 policy itself or its formulation is not. There are no clear
 guidelines, however, regarding what is responsible and what is
 not. Visits by foreign journalists require Ministry of
 Information approval and controls on them have been
 tightened. Books, films, periodicals, and foreign newspapers
 are censored for coverage of subjects considered pornographic,
 derogatory of the Arabs or Islam, favorable to Israel, or
 critical of the ruling families. While enforcement is
 inconsistent, and material banned from publication or
 distribution in one emirate may appear in another, airport
 customs officers, particularly in Abu Dhabi, often confiscate
 books, magazines, newspapers, or videotapes with objectionable
 content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no political parties and all organized public
 gatherings must have permits. Clubs and other organizations
 must be licensed by the federal or emirate governments. Thus,
 by declining to issue a license or permit, the authorities can
 and do ban possibly worrisome political activities. In the
 fall of 1982, following the Sabra and Shatilla massacres, the
 authorities did permit three spontaneous demonstrations; they
 were peacefully controlled by security forces. Spontaneous
 demonstrations are usually not permitted. There were no
 similar demonstrations in 1983 or 1984.
 Labor is not permitted to organize and there is no legal
 provision for the right to strike or to engage in collective
 bargaining. Foreign workers dare not strike; they would be
 summarily deported. Individual workers, or even small groups,
 may bring grievances to a conciliation committee at the
 Ministry of Labor, which will arbitrate the dispute. The
 rulings are widely regarded as fair. However, because of
 language barriers and the ignorance of many foreign laborers
 about the avenue for redress of grievances, the facility is
 not utilized as much as it might be. The Government is
 concerned about the labor conditions of foreign employees,
 particularly the semiskilled and unskilled. Aware that many
 have been misled and exploited by unscrupulous labor agents,
 it has tightened up considerably on visa procedures and work
 permits. The declining need for unskilled labor has
 engendered even more firmness in this regard, and people
 without proper documentation are promptly deported. The
 Government continues to improve the labor law covering
 conditions of employment, compensation, inspection of the
 workplace, and enforcement procedures. Some abuse of foreign
 labor persists, contrary to government policy, as enforcement
 is difficult and intermittent.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Provisional Constitution establishes Islam as the state
 religion. Non-Muslims (virtually all of whom are aliens) are
 free to practice their faiths so long as this does not
 conflict with public policy or violate public morals.
 Christian churches and schools are officially tolerated and
 have occasionally received support from individual rulers. In
 
 
 1420
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 1982, the Abu Dhabi emirate placed stricter controls on both.
 Two Christian churches, once located on its principal
 thoroughfare, Corniche Road, were relocated and rebuilt on new
 suburban lots donated by Shaykh Zayid, thereby reducing the
 Christian profile in the city. Catholic priests and
 Protestant ministers are permitted to function in an open but
 discreet fashion. Traditional restrictions forbidding
 religious proselytizing of Muslims have been reemphasized.
 The Education Ministry has increased the pressure on private
 schools to enforce stricter sex segregation and to strengthen
 Arabic/Islamic studies for Muslim students.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restraints on freedom of movement within the
 country although visits to certain areas, such as oil
 installations, require permission from security authorities.
 Foreign travel and emigration for all citizens are
 unrestricted. Exit visas are not required. The right of
 return is extended to all Emirate citizens. Some non-citizens
 who leave the country for more than six months are not
 permitted to return. However, strictures on some categories
 of employees were relaxed in 1984. Although lacking
 formalized procedures for handling refugees or applications
 for political asylum, the country has traditionally provided a
 haven for many people of the area who have left their own
 countries for economic or political reasons. A United Nations
 Development Program office in Abu Dhabi helps those who claim
 refugee status get to a United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) mission abroad. During the past year, many
 Iranian refugees have sought to enter the country, often
 illegally, and mainly by boat. Some have been allowed to
 remain, but they must demonstrate that they face retribution
 or persecution if repatriated to Iran. Increasingly, because
 of tensions emanating from the Gulf war and increased security
 concerns, plus the contracting economic situation, the
 overwhelming majority are intercepted by Emirate Coast Guard
 vessels and sent back. In a few cases, tacit permission to
 remain is granted. The Government has extended assistance to
 specific groups of refugees on an ad hoc basis and contributes
 to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and UNHCR.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The United Arab Emirates has no formal democratic institutions
 and the mass of its people have no voice in the selection of
 their Government. The positions of the individual rulers are
 not defined by any constitutional document; their roles have
 evolved from traditional patriarchal concepts of authority
 exercised in nomadic societies. Primogeniture may be one
 element in choosing a successor. However, a ruling family
 generally selects its most-capable and respected member to
 wield political power. The leading clan within the tribal
 society owes its position among other clans to its reputation
 for responsiveness and fairness in providing leadership and
 settling disputes.
 Intermarriage between the ruling family and other influential
 families of other clans creates a nexus of informal channels
 which form the traditional basis for participation in the
 political process. Rulers try to develop a consensus before
 acting, which slows the decision-making process but mitigates
 
 
 1421
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 against the need for harsh measures to compel compliance. The
 much-treasured tradition that any member of the society may
 approach the ruler to petition him in person tends to keep the
 latter from becoming too authoritarian or too remote from his
 subjects.
 The Provisional Constitution, adopted in 1971, left the
 traditional political system in each emirate intact, and in
 effect extended that system to the federal-national level.
 Executive and legislative powers remain firmly in the hands of
 the seven rulers.
 So far, Emirate citizens have not exerted pressure on the
 Government for formal democratic institutions. A small and
 privileged minority among the large numbers of expatriates,
 few citizens feel aggrieved. There is no suffrage for males
 or females. Women play no public role. Foreigners are
 expected to refrain from political activities; they jeopardize
 their residence status if they become involved in internal
 affairs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The United Arab Emirates is responsive to foreign criticism of
 its human rights performance. Sensitivity to allegations of
 mistreatment of lower income foreign workers has resulted in
 efforts to give this group more legal protection by improving
 and updating the labor law. No human rights group visited the
 country in 1984. Amnesty International did not include the
 United Arab Emirates in its 1984 report. Freedom House calls
 the United Arab Emirates "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Emirates' population is about 1,260,000 and is currently
 growing at an annual rate of 4.4 percent. About 55 percent of
 the estimated 1 million guest workers are from South Asia; 25
 to 30 percent are other Arabs, mostly Egyptians, Palestinians,
 and Lebanese; the remainder are Westerners and East Asians.
 Many of these foreigners occupy key managerial, professional,
 and technical posts in the public and petroleum sectors.
 Emirate citizens now predominate in government service.
 Emirate nationals enjoy important benefits in real estate,
 business ownership, and government scholarships. Only
 nationals are eligible for promotion in government ministries
 and departments. Some foreigners have had government-financed
 scholarships, but this is being phased out. Few foreigners
 are offered citizenship, despite the fact that thousands,
 particularly professional-level Arab expatriates, have lived
 and worked there for many years, often occupying extremely
 responsible government positions.
 Oil income has continued stable after a sharp decline in the
 first half of 1983. The Government still has ample funds for
 continued, though reduced, economic and social development.
 The recent glut in the oil market, however, has caused
 planners to cut budgets following a reassessment of national
 Sriorities. Export and reexport revenues for 1983 totaled
 15.4 billion, making the 1982 per capita gross national
 product one of the highest in the world--$23,767. The per
 capita income of the lowest-paid segment of the population,
 
 
 1422
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 laborers from the Indian subcontinent, is far below the
 average, but still about three times more than most could earn
 in their own countries. Medical treatment is free to all
 citizens. Foreigners must pay fees, instituted in 1983-84,
 for medical services. Within the last decade, life expectancy
 for citizens has increased from 55.4 years to 69 years because
 of improved health care and sanitary conditions. World Bank
 statistics show infant mortality at 37.5 per 1,000 live births
 in 1984. Previous figures had aroused public concern and
 prompted the Ministry of Health to review child care practices
 regarding sanitation and nutrition.
 Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the two most industrialized of the
 Emirate states, have undertaken programs to expand the number
 of low-cost housing units. Water and electricity are provided
 to residential users at subsidized prices. As the country has
 very limited arable land and sparse water resources, most food
 is imported and the water is desalinated. Virtually the
 entire population has access to safe drinking water.
 Citizens, and foreigners to a more limited extent, may buy
 some basic commodities at subsidized prices.
 Primary and secondary education is free for all citizens, as
 is university study at the United Arab Emirates University in
 Al-Ain. Foreigners who work in the Government have access to
 free primary education. Foreigners in the private sector must
 send their children to private schools, for which they must
 pay. Primary education is compulsory for nationals from ages
 6 to 12. Within the last few years, teacher training programs
 have been expanded and large numbers of new schools built.
 There are now 140,000 children of all nationalities attending
 about 400 primary and secondary schools. The most reliable
 estimates put the literacy rate at about 62.5 percent. In
 1981, the primary school enrollment ratio for women was 92.9
 percent of all primary school-aged girls in the population.
 Traditional conservatism and strong family pressures, plus the
 still honored tradition of girls marrying in their early
 teens, have prevented many women citizens from continuing
 their education beyond the primary level. This in turn has
 limited their role in the economic and cultural life of the
 country. The number of Emirate women in the workforce is
 minimal. However, the Government is encouraging women to
 pursue their education, and they are beginning to find
 employment in the news media and government offices, as well
 as in the traditionally accepted fields of health and
 education. Women are permitted to drive automobiles and may
 appear in public unveiled.
 The largest economic enterprises are state-owned or combine
 state ownership with private equity participation. Otherwise,
 commerce is relatively unrestricted, except for laws designed
 to ensure that Emirate citizens share in and control the
 nation's economic life.
