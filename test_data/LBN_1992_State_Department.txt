 LEBANON
 According to its Constitution, Lebanon is a parliamentary democratic republic. By
 tradition, the President is a Maronite, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the
 Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies a Shi'a Muslim. The 128 deputies are divided
 equally between Christians and Muslims. General parliamentary elections were held
 in 1992 for the first time in 20 years but in an atmosphere of acrimony and discord.
 The Government continued to consolidate its authority over Lebanese territory,
 reasserting control over government buildings and properties long controlled by var-
 ious militias, icluding Hizballah, the Lebanese Forces, and the Druze Progressive
 Socialist Party. Hizbaah and its allies (supported by Iran) refused to disarm and
 were responsible for operations against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and its sur-
 rogate militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), inside Israel's self-proclaimed "secu-
 rity zone," prompting retaliatory raids.
 Much of Lebanon, however, remains outside direct government control, and the
 presence of non-Lebanese forces further impinges on Lebanese central authority.
 Palestinian groups in the south still operate autonomously in their refugee camps
 and maintain a separate and arbitrary system of justice to deal with fellow Palestin-
 ians. A security and defense pact signed in 1991 by Syria and Lebanon establishes
 a framework for joint cooperation between Lebanese and Syrian armed forces, but
 Syrian military and intelligence elements in fact operate independently of Lebanese
 authorities.

 Syrian troops in parts of Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Biqa' Valley numbered
 35,000. According to the Tail Agreement, the Governments of Lebanon and Syria
 were to take a decision in September to redeploy Syrian troops to the western en-
 trances to the Biqa' Valley, with redeploment to occur shortly thereafter. However,
 as of the end of the year no decision  a been taken, and there had been no signifi-
 cant movement of Syrian troops.
 Israel has about 1,000 troops in southern Lebanon but maintains controls in and
 near its self-proclaimed "security zone,' largely through the SLA. The SLA main-
 tains a separate and arbitrary system of justice in the zone, without reference to
 central Lebanese authority. In 1992 Israel also undertook occasional military oper-
 ations outside the security zone. In areas controlled by Syria and Israel, soldiers
 from those countries as well as local militias sometimes conducted security and
 other functions normally reserved to a central government. According to the US.
 Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Lebanon's total military expenditures for
 1989 were roughly estimated to. be between $259 million and $273 million. Any de-
 crease in spending is unlikely in the near future as the Government is faced with
 rebuilding its armed forces following the 16-year civil war.
 Lebanon's free enterprise economy deteriorated sharply. Excess government
 spending and a lack of public confidence produced a 70-percent devaluation of the
 currency and inflation of over 50 percent. The advent of Prime Minister Rafiq al-
 Hariri's Government in November 1992 brought renewed confidence in the economy.
 The pound improved, and prices dropped amidst expectations that the new govern-
 ment would embark on needed budget reforms and obtain foreign construction aid.
 Although there was some improvement in the human rights situation attributable
 to the consolidation of central government authority, normal constitutional and legal
 protections still did not apply in the large part of Lebanon outside government con-
 trol. Civilians continued to be victims of artillery and aerial attacks, bombings, snip-
 ing, abductions, summary executions, and assassinations. The level of violence was,
 however, at its lowest level since civil strife began in 1976.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The overall number of political
 killings declined further in 1992 as the Government consolidated its authority over
 portions of the country. However, there were some politically motivated killings by
 rival Palestinian factions, mostly in Sidon and the nearby refugee camps, but also
 in Beirut and the Biqa' Valley. At least 25 such killings occurred in the months of
 October and November alone. Among the assassinated were the Palestine Liberation
 Organization's (PLO) Chief for the Fatah militia in Lebanon, the head of the Abu
 Nidal Organization in the Biqa' Valley, the spokesman of the Fatah Revolutionary
 Councl, and a major in the Fath movement. An officer in the Christian Lebanese
 Forces (LF) militia was assassinated in May.
 Some political and religious figures, including candidates in and opponents of the
 parliamentary elections, received death threats, but none was caedout. The num-
 ber of bomb attacks dropped sharply compared with 1991. On December 30, 1991,
 a boyrapped car exploded in the Basta district of West Beirut, a densely popu-
 lated Sbi'a neighborhood. Twenty were killed and 100 persons were wounded in the
 attaek. No one claimed responsibility.
 On February 15, Israeli helicopters rocketed the automobile of Hizballah Sec-
 retary Gneral Abbas Mussawi, whio was killed along with his wife and infant son
 as well as his driver and bodyguard.
 b. Disappearance.-Despite improvement in the overall security situation, thou-
 sands ' " ebanon's inhabitants kidnaped during the years of civil unrest remained
 unaccounted for. Lcal militias and non-Lebanese forces appeared to be responsible
 for most of these kidnapings. Some victims are believed tohave been summarily ex-
 ecuted. The last Western hostages, two German nationals, were released in June.
 The Government has taken no judicial action against the groups which had held
 these and other Western hostages.
 Two lawyers who were members of the Iraqi Ba'ath p arty disappeared in Feb-
 ruary while attempting to leave the country by ferry. There were credible reports
 that they were arrested by the state security service and handed over to Syrian au-
 thorities. A lawyer and three cornpanions were kidnaped in August in an area of
 southern Lebanon under the control~ of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
 (UNIFIL). They were returning from an election rally in Israel's self-proclaimed "s-
 curity zone." The lawyer was released after 115 days in captivity, and the body of
 one of his companions was found in southern Lebanon; there was no word on the
 
 
 1046
 fate of the other two or on the identity of the kidnapers. Gunmen kidnaped an offi-
 cial of the Christian Kataib party in September.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were reports of beatings and the use of-excessive force against detainees by
 the Lebanese security services. One nongovernmental human rights organization
 transmitted to the Minister of Justice in September a report of beatings and mis-
 treatment of persons detained by military security for circulating antielection lit-
 erature (see Section 1.d.). The Minister did not reply. It was said that the military
 used excessive force in interrogating students associated with the Lebanese Forces
 who were arrested in October.
 Overcrowding in Lebanese prisons reportedly reached a point in 1992 that threat-
 ened the health of detainees. In some cases, up to 30 detainees were being held in
 20-square-meter cells.
 Incidents of torture by Lebanese militias and Palestinian factions appeared to
 have declined in number with the extension of the central Government's authority.
 There were, however, credible and persistent reports of torture and abuse by Syrian
 security elements and at the SLA's al-Khiam prison in Israel's self-proclaimed secu-
 nity zone.'
 I Arbitrary Arrest. Detention, or Exile.-By law, arresting officers must refer sus-
 pects to a prosecutor within 24 hours of arrest. Some government prosecutors, how-
 ever, authorized the indefinite detention of suspects for interrogation without ref-
 erence to a court or a judge. Every person arrested has the right to legal counsel,
 but there is no public defender's office. The Lebanese Lawyers' Syndicate estab-
 lished an office in 1992 to serve those who could not afford a lawyer. Bail is per-
 mitted in most cases (excluding felonies).
 Militias have virtually ceased the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for in-
 definite periods in those areas where the central Government has extended its au-
 thority. There are widespread and credible reports, however, of arbitrary detention
 by the SLA, Hizballah, and Syrian security elements. Palestinian elements arrested
 individuals without due process; the press has reported, for example, that 62 per-
 sons are held by the PLO Fatah movement in southern Lebanon, accused of murder
 and violent attacks.
 Military security arrested 70 to 80 civilians in July and Augst, accusing them
 of distributing pictures of ousted General Michel Aoun (former Prime Minister and
 Lebanese Armed Forces Commander) and pamphlets calling for a boycott of Leb-
 anon's parliamentary elections. They were held for periods ranging from 36 hours
 to about 2 weeks without judicial proceedings. Several claimed they were beaten
 and mistreated during detention. At least another dozen civilians were detained by
 military security for alleged involvement in dynamite attacks during the electoral
 campaign; all but two were released after several weeks' detention. No judicial pro-
 ceedings were initiated. Nearly two dozen students who comprised a political action
 group supportive of the Lebanese Forces were arrested in October and held incom-
 municado for nearly 2 weeks. They were eventually charged with threatening the
 security of the State and released on bail. It is said they were warned against fur-
 ther political activity. An unknown number of civilians were arrested by the army
 in November and remain in detention. They were printing pamphlets which chal-
 lenged the Taif Accord, ridiculed the commander of the army, and lionized an army
 officer who killed himself while assembling an explosive in an apparent plot to blow
 up an army installation. One international human rights group reported that be-
 tween 15 and 50 arrestees were being held, out of as many as 200 initial arrestees;
 the army admitted it had arrested 11 civilians. Twelve persons were indicted on De-
 cember 28 and may be sentenced to jail terms ranging from 2 months to 2 years.
 Associates of the arrestees privately believed their number exceeded the army's fig-
 ure but fell well short of the group's figure. In December the Attorney General
 began an investigation of Amnesty International (A) char s regarding the arbi-
 trary nature of the arrests, the absence of due process, and te use of torture during
 interrogation. Prolonged pretrial detention is reported to be a continuing problem.
 The SLA continued to hold at least 200 Lebanese detainees in a facility in the
 town of al-Khiam in southern Lebanon. It is not known how many Palestinians were
 detained at the center. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has
 not been permitted access to those held at al-Khiam. As noted in Section 1.c., there
 are credible reports that prisoners suffer torture and are denied contact with their
 families.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Lebanese law, practice, and custom provide the
 right to a fair public trial, with each confessional group having its own court for
 family and personal status cases and with a separate military courts-martial sys-
 tem. Palestinian elements continued to operate an autonomous and arbitrary system
 
 
 1047
 of justice in parts of the country, however. Rival Palestinian factions often try their
 enemies without due process, and these trials cannot be considered fair. For exam-
 ple, the Palestinian Revolutionary Judicial Court tried (for murder) and sentenced
 to death in September three members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council at a refu-
 gee camp in southern Lebanon.
 Although the judiciary is considered relatively independent and impartial and
 courts exist throughout the country, influential politicians continued to be able to
 intervene to protect supporters from detention and prosecution. The appointment of
 judges, like that of all other government appointments is based on the confessional
 system (allocating appointments based on an individual's religious affiliation).
 Efforts to speed up adjudication and clear up a backlog of cases which had devel-
 oped during the war years suffered a setback when lawyers stopped work in August
 and September to protest the kidnaping of an attorney in the south. A large but
 unknown number of prisoners remained in jail without recourse to the courts as a
 result of this strike. Other causes of trial delays included a shortage of judges and
 obstacles to conducting investigations in areas outside effective government control.
 Aside from the Aounists currently being held, there is no information that others
 are being held as political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Leba-
 nese authorities generally evince no interest in controlling personal life. Laws re-
 quire that government prosecutors obtain the equivalent of a warrant before enter-
 ing homes, except when the Lebanese Army pursues an armed attacker. Rights of
 privacy, however, were violated frequently by militias and non-Lebanese forces. It
 is widely believed that various factions in Lebanon and the Government use in-
 former networks and monitor telephones to gather intelligence on their adversaries.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Violations of international humanitarian standards with respect to treat-
 ment of prisoners taken by nongovernmental groups dropped markedly in 1992 but
 continued to occur in areas outside the control of the central Government.
 The situation in the south remained explosive. Militia attacks against the SLA
 and Israeli troops, as well as Israeli air strikes and commando raids on alleged
 guerrilla and terrorist targets, led to casualties among the civilian population of
 southern Lebanon. Credible reports indicate that during the fist half of 1992, 28
 civilians died, 150 were wounded, and 400 houses and buildings were damaged as
 a result of Israeli raids and attacks. On February 20, Israeli forces launched a mili-
 tary operation outside the Israeli "security zone." Israeli tanks drove into the vil-
 lages of Kafra and Yater after the IDF clashed with UNIFIL troops. Residents of
 the two villages sought refuge in Sidon and Beirut.
 On March 23, five persons were killed and an unspecified number wounded in a
 clash in Beirut between Syrian security forces and a unit of the Lebanese Internal
 Security Force (ISF). It is widely suspected that two Lebanese ISF members in-
 volved in the incident were detained for several days by the Syrians and later hand-
 ed over to Lebanese authorities, who jailed them for about 1 month. They were
 never charged.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Lebanon has a strong heritage of freedom of
 opinion, speech, and press. Governmental authorities traditionally have respected
 the rights of those who opposed government policies through peacefu means.
 However, a law exists that prohibits attacks on the "dignity of the President," and
 the Government has attempted to stifle direct public criticism of the President of
 Lebanon and the President of Syria. For example, 23 university students were de-
 tained for several days after distributing caricatures lampooning the 2 leaders. The
 owner of %i prominent periodical was interrogated after publishing an attack on
 President Hrawi. Another prominent journalist received threats after he criticized
 the timing of the parliamentary elections. Dozens of newspapers and magazines are
 published throughout Lebanon, traditionally representing a wide spectrum of opin-
 ion. While the press in Lebanon is nominally independent, virtually all newspapers
 and many magazines are financed by specific Lebanese and foreign groups. As a re-
 suit, these supporters, which included Lebanese political and militia figures as well
 as foreign governments, were able to influence the content of the press.
 Some direct press criticism of Syria is found in the media, athough journalists
 and editors are known to practice a high degree of self-censorship. The Lebanese-
 Syrian security agreement of 1991 contained a provision effectively banning infor-
 mational activity that could endanger the security of either state. The owner of a
 major news aer was subjected to interrogation after publishing an article scath-
 ingly critical of a donation to the London zoo by the Amir of Kuwait.
 
 
 1048
 Diverse political groups, particularly militias, operated a wide variety of radio and
 television stations, but heavily slanted propaganaa diminished with the acceptance
 by most groups of the spread of government authority. The Government continued
 during 1992 to study ways to compel all radio and television stations to register,
 as well as other methods of controlling the media, but no action was taken.
 Lebanon has a flourishing private educational system, born in part from the inad-
 equacy of the public schools, and its tradition of academic freedom survived the
 years of civil war. Students exercise the right to form campus associations, although
 l'nks between some students' groups and ormer militias are a source of anxiety or
 administrators. The Government does not formally interfere with student groups,
 but in 1992 the army arrested some students linked to the Lebanese Forces (see
 Section 1.d.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Lebanese are theoretically free
 to assemble and associate in a peaceful manner. B law, any group wishing to orga-
 nize a rally must obtain the prior approval of the Tnterior Ministry. This law is not
 uniformly applied. The police and army succeeded for the most part in protecting
 rallies organized on behalf of candidates in the parliamentary elections. Hizballah
 held many demonstrations and marches in its areas of strength throughout the
 year, unhindered by the authorities. Amal and Druze groups also held rallies. How-
 ever, the army obstructed several peaceful demonstrations organized by Christian
 political elements throughout the year, including an antielections rally, a dem-
 onstration protesting the army's takeover of government-owned property held by the
 Lebanese Fores militia, and a rally organized on behalf of a kidnaped Kataib party
 official.
 Israel did not permit political grou s opposed to the Israeli occupation to operate
 in areas under the control of the IEDor the SLA, nor did the Syrians allow groups
 openly hostile to them to operate in areas they controlled.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Lebanese practice their various religions freely. These
 sects include numerous Christian denominations, Muslims (Sunni, Shi'a, and oth-
 ers), and Druze. There is no state religion, but Lebanon's confessional political sys-
 tem means that a wide range of government positions are filled on the basis of reli-
 gion.
 There are no restrictions on particular religi ous groups, foreign clergy, or places
 of worship. The various religious groups are free to publish religious material, par-
 ticipate in charitable activities, and provide religious education for their children.
 Many religious goups operate private schools.
 The confessional carr of the society makes conversion to another religion dif-
 ficult, except in the case of women, who often adopt the religion of their husbands
 in the relatively rare cases of mixed marriages. Conversion can mean ostracism
 from family and friends. In small villages, local religious leaders often exert pres-
 sure on members of their congregations not to take part in the religious activities
 of other religioun groups.
 d. Freedom of Movenwnt Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Lebanese traditionally have enjoyed freedom of travel, both domestic
 and foreign, but the occupation of parts of Lebanon by non-Lebanese forces has re-
 suited in impediments to internal travel. The spread of government authority has
 removed some of the barriers to internal travel which existed during the years of
 war, prompting a boom in internal tourism, but many barriers remain. The Govern-
 ment was con fronted with the problem of providing appropriat shelter to an esti-
 mated 800,000 Lebanese displaced during the years of civil unrest and still unable
 to return to their homes until issues of security and financial aid have been re-
 solved.
 Checkpoints were maintained by Lebanese and Syrian troops in areas under gov-
 ernment or Syrian control. In parts of the south, militias maintained checkpoints.
 The SLA and IDF maintaindtight restrictions on the movement of people and
 goods into and out of Israel's security zone and other areas under their control, such
 as the city of Jazzin.
 The authorities did not restrict foreign travel by Lebanese citizens. There was no
 legal impediment to voluntary repatriation by Lebanese or Palestinians with valid
 identity papers.
 Lebanon does not grant citizenship to male Palestinians and other foreigners.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Constitutionally, Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which the people theo-
 retically havee tright to change their government. However, until the parliamen-
 tary elections in 1992 the people had not been able to exercise this right during 16
 years of civil war. The flawed nature of the Parliamentary elections casts doubt on
 
 
 1049
 the ability of the Lebanese people to change the government through democratic
 means. According to the Constitution, direct elections must be held for the Par-
 liament every 4 years. Parliament, in turn, elects a President every 6years. The
 President and Parliament choose the Cabinet. Political parties may be formed and
 some in fact flourish. Since the emergence of the post-1943 state, national policy has
 been determined largely by a relatively restricted group of traditional regional and
 sectarian leaders. The 1943 National Pact allocated political power on an essentially
 confessional system based on the 1932 census. The unwritten National Pact stipu-
 lated that the President would be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni
 Muslim, and the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi'a Muslim Until 1990, seats in
 Parliament were divided on a 6-to-5 ratio of Christians to Muslims. Positions in the
 government bureaucracy were allocated on a similar basis.
 Efforts to alter or abolish the confessional system of allocating power were at the
 center of Lebanese politics for more than 3 decades. Those religious groups most fa-
 vored by the 1943 formula sought to preserve it, while those who perceived them-
 selves to be disadvantaged sought to revise it on the basis of updated demographic
 data or to abolish it entirely. The struggle gave a strongly sectarian coloration to
 Lebanese politics and to the continuing civil strife in the country. Under the Na-
 tional Reconciliation Agreement reached in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in October 1989,
 Members of Parliament agreed to alter the National Pact to create a 50-50 Chris-
 tian-Muslim balance in the Parliament and reorder the powers of the different
 branches of government. Constitutional amendments embodying the political re-
 forms stipulated in the Taif Ag ment, which represented a dramatic political and
 psychological change, became law in 1990. They included an expansion of the num-
 ber of seats in Parliament and the division of seats equally between Muslims and
 Christians and the transfer of some powers from the President to the Prime Min-
 ister and Council of Ministers.
 The first parliamentary elections in Lebanon since 1972 were held in 1992. The
 elections were not prepared and carried out in a manner to ensure the broadest na-
 tional consensus. The turnout of eligible voters in some Christian locales was ex-
 tremely low, with many voters not participating in the elections because they ob-
 jected to voting in the presence of non-Lebanese forces. There were also widespread
 reports of irregularities, which might have been obviated had there been foreign ob-
 servers. There were credible reports of the Syrian Government's involvement in the
 formation of candidacy ticket alliances, as well as widespread credible reports of
 irregularities in the process of voting and the counting of ballots. The electoral rolls
 were themselves in many instances unreliable because of the destruction of records
 and the use of forged identification papers. As a consequence, the results do not re-
 flect the full spectrum of the body politic in Lebanon.
 Elements of the 1992 electoral law, which paved the way for elections, represented
 a departure from stipulations of the Taif Agreement, expanding the number of par-
 liamentary seats from 108 to 128 and employing a temporary districting arrange-
 ment designed to favor certain sects and political interests.
 An estimated 17 Palestinian factions operate in Lebanon, ranging from several
 characterized as  lslamic" to numerous pro- and anti-Arafat organizations, many
 built around prominent individual leaders. Most Palestinians live in refugee camps,
 better described as neighborhoods or ghettos, under the control of one or more politi-
 cal factions. Leaders are not elected, and there ae no representative institutions
 which would permit popular participation in running the camps. Fundamental pro-
 tections and feedoms expected of governments exist in some but not all Palestinian
 areas.
 There are no legal barriers to participation by women in politics, but the culture
 discourages open participation. Nevertheless, three women were elected to Par-
 liament in 1992.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Vioations of Human Rights
 Several local associations are devoted to human rights, including the Foundation
 for Human and Humanitarian Rights (Lebanon), the Lebanese Association for
 Human Rights (headed by a Member of Parliament), and a children's rights lobby.
 None of these organizations reported government intimidation or interference in its
 activities. There were no known requests by international human rights organiza.
 tions to investigate the situatio i anon in nnn1992, although ccasonal inquiries
 were made. The Government did not object to international invesiticons of human
 rights in Lebanon. However, the limited control exercised by the Government over
 some militias and non-Lebanese armed forces hindered its ability to respond to in-
 uiries regarding human rights abuses outside areas of central government control.
 
 
 1050
 The SLA has refused requests for access by the ICRC and international humani-
 tarian groups to visit the prison facility it maintains at al-Khiam in southern Leb-
 anon.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of government. The
 amended Constitution of 1990 embraces the principle of abolishing confessionalism
 as a criterion for filin  all government positions, but no practical steps have been
 taken toward this end. he Shi'a Muslim community is now the largest confessional
 group in Lebanon, as the proportion of Maronites in the population declined signifi-
 cantly during the war.
 Although the Government in 1991 ended its practice of denying work permits to
 Palestinians, a strong bias against Palestinians continues to compel often highly
 trained Palestinian refugees to take menial or marginal work. Palestinians and
 other aliens may own land only of a limited size and only after the approval of five
 district offices. The law applies equally to all aliens, but for politicl, cultural and
 economic reasons it is unevenly applied to the disadvantage of Palestinians and, to
 a lesser extent, Kurds. Under Lebanese citizenship law, only Lebanese males can
 transmit citizenship to their spouses and children.
 Approximately 180,000 stateless undocumented persons also suffer broad discrimi-
 nation since they are not accorded the legal rights enjoyed by the rest of the popu-
 lation. This figure includes Kurds, Syrians, and the inhabitants of Wadi Khalid, an
 area in dispute between Lebanon and Syria. These people are not allowed to benefit
 from such government services as the national social security fund or to be em-
 ployed by the government. Some encounter difficulties in obtaining employment in
 the private sector as well.
 Lebanese women, many of whom possess advanced professional degrees, are able
 to work outside the home. Increasing numbers of unmarried and divorced women
 work out of necessity. The idea that women should be supported by men prevails,
 however, and many, including those with professional training, remain home with
 their families or until their children are grown. Men exercise considerable control
 over women, often restricting their activities outside the home such as travel or con-
 tact with friends and relatives. Women may own property but may not be able to
 exercise full control over it due to both legal and cultural restrictions. For example,
 the law stipulates that a woman must obtain the prior approval of her husband to
 open a business or engage in trade.
 . Violence against women occurs but, owing to the value attached to personal pri-
 vacy in this traditional society, the issue is normally discussed only in private. Since
 no official statistics are produced on the subject, and it is widely believed that most
 abused women do not seek medical treatment or legal redress, it is difficult to esti-
 mate the extent of the problem. Many experts nevertheless acknowledge that the
 problem is a serious one.
 Divorce is not permitted among Catholics and those adhering to the Catholic rite,
 but other Christians may obtain divorces. Divorce is permitted to Muslims, although
 Shi'a and Sunni practices and legal arrangements differ.
 The plight of children is a growing concern in Lebanon. Children's rights activists
 report that large numbers of children are neglected abused exploited and even sold
 to disreputable adoption agents at a going rate of $5,000 'for an infant. Hundreds
 of abandoned children are found each year in the streets and at the doors of orphan-
 ages and other social welfare institutions. Juvenile delinquency is also rising. The
 Government's limited financial means have hindered efforts to build adequate facili-
 ties to rehabilitate delinquents. Many are detained in ordinary prisons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except government employees, may
 form and join unions and have a legal right to strike. Worker representatives must
 be chosen from those employed within the bargaining unit. Trade unions may deter-
 mine their own policies and programs as long as they do not involve themselves in
 politics. The active labor force is estimated at 600,000 persons, many of whom are
 members of Lebanon's 160 labor unions and associations. Twenty-three of the
 unions with about 250,000 workers, are represented in the General Confederation
 of Workers (CGTL). Lebanese authorities do not control or restrict unions, although
 union leaders allege that there have been unsuccessful attempts by the Government
 to interfere in elections for union officials.
 Palestinians in Lebanon are permitted to organize their own unions. Restrictions
 on their right to work in the country, however, make this right more theoretical
 than real. Few Palestinians participate actively in trade unions in Lebanon. There
 was a widespread national strike in May in protest against deteriorating economic
 
 
 1051
 conditions, including severe inflation and currency devaluation. The strike was con-
 cluded upon the resignation of the Government. Similar strikes on July 29 and Oc-
 tober 14 succeeded in shutting down much of the commercial sector. Power plant
 workers also went on strike during the year.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international federations and confederations, and
 Lebanese unions maintain a wide variety of affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and tobarain collectively exists in law and practice. Most workers' groups en-
 gage in some form of collective bargaining with their employers. Stronger federa-
 tions are able to obtain significant gains through their own collective bargaining ef-
 forts. Weaker unions relyheavily on the mediation of the CGTL, which negotiates
 across-the-board pay increases with private employers' associations. The CGTL often
 assists unions not affiliated with it in their bargaining efforts and on occasion has
 assisted nonunionized workers. There is no government mechanism to promote vol-
 untary labor-management negotiations, and workers are not protected against
 antiunion discrimination. While such discrimination exists, its practical impact on
 union rights is negligible largely because of CGTL activism, or example, in the
 past workers have encountered resistance by some employers to plans to form or
 join a union, forcing them to seek CGTL's help.
 There are no special economic incentives or export p rcessing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Mrhile not prohibited by law,
 forced labor is not practiced or condoned by the Government.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Lebanese law spcifies the mini-
 mum age of 16 for employment of children, but many younger children work in fam-
 ily businesses. The Ministry of Labor enforces the minimum age requirement. How-
 ever, as has occurred throughout the Government, the civil war left the Labor Min-
 istry with few resources an5 a demoralized and corrupt staff. Therefore, the law is
 not rirously applied
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage is set by the Min-
 istry of Labor, but the law is not enforced effectively in most of the private sector.
 In theory the courts could be called upon to enforce it, but in practice they are not.
 Trade unions, however, are actively engaged in assuring the payment of at least
 minimum wages in both the public sector and large-scale private sectors, such as
 teaching and transport. Inflation and the devaluation of the currency have made it
 impossible for a worker and family to live on the minimum wage; most workers
 have to earn additional income to make ends meet.
 Labor law prescribes a standard 6-day workweek of 48 hours. In practice, workers
 in the industrial sector work an average of 35 hours a week, and workers in other
 sectors of the economy work an average of 30 hours a week. The law includes spe-
 cific occupational health and safety regulations. Enforcement, which is the respon-
 sibility of the Ministry of Labor, is uneven.
