 ANGOLA
 Throughout 1994 the Government of the Republic of Angola and the National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) remained embroiled in a bru-
 tal civil war. However, the Government, led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos,
 and UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, also engaged in peace negotiations in Lusaka
 under the auspices of the United Nations and with the help of three observer coun-
 tries, Portugal; Russia, and the United States. The two parties signed a peace agree-
 ment, the Eusaka Protocol on November 20 which calls for a cease-fire, the with-
 drawal and disarming of UN hA, and the creation of a new national army made up
 of fighters from both sides. However, at year's end, very little progress had been
 made in implementing the Lusaka Protocol
 Fighting resumed in October 1992, after UNITA declared the results of the Sep-
 tember 1992 elections fraudulent. The United Nations considered these elections
 free and fair. Since the renewed fighting UNITA has captured control of as much
 as 70 percent of the country, but the majority of the population has remained in,
 or fled to, government-controlled areas. The Government continued to have the dip-
 lomatic support of the international community and the U.N. Security Council
 throughout the year. By May the Government began to redress the military situa-
 tion and b  year's end had retaken several strategic p ints from UNITA. The cease-
 fire established by the Lusaka Protocol went into effect on November 22. Despite
 violations on both sides, confirmed by U.N. observers, the cease-fire appeared to be
 generally holding through the year's end.
 To counter UNITA, the Government continued a major buildup in 1994 of its mili-
 tary and police organizations and also continued to arm urban civilians. These civil-
 ians, sympathetic to the governing party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation
 of Angola (MPLA), assisted government forces during the outbreak of hostilities that
 led to the resumption of the civil war. All of these organizations, including the Gov-
 ernment and UNITA, were responsible for persistent human rights abuses. The
 MPLA controlled tightly the 220-member National Assembly and harassed the few
 opposition deputies, including UNITA deputies, in attendance. MPLA leader Presi-
 dent dos Santos continued to manipulate the party in order to consolidate political
 control and neutralize potential opposition.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for internal security; it created the Rapid
 Intrvention Police, a paramilitary 'goup, in late 1992 to quell civil unrest. The
 Ministry has on occasion loaned the Rapid Intervention Police to the armed forces.
 Angola has great economic potential with extensive petroleum and diamond re-
 serves, rich agricultural land, and latent hydroelectric resources. However, the econ-
 omy continued to contract in 1994 as a result of war and misguided economic policy.
 Areas under government control in 1994 suffered from hyperinflation-from 800 to
 1,000  percent, scarcity  of consumer   goods, massive   unemployment    and
 underemployment, and continuing pervasive corruption. UNITA-controlled areas re-
 portedly experienced similar problems, with perhaps the exception of pervasive cor-
 ruption. Subsistence agriculture, traditionally the main source of income for the ma-
 jority of Angola's approximately 10 million citizens, continued to be severely con-
 strained by war-related damage, including heavy use of land mines by both sides.
 Human rights deteriorated further in the face of an intensified armed conflict and
 the failure of the Government and UNITA to stop egregious violations of humani-
 tarian law. Miliaryand securi.ty forces on both sides flagrantly disregarded fun-
 damental humanitaran values i their treatment of prisoners of war (POW's), their
 extrajudicial killings of unarmed civilians, including humanitarian relief workers,
 women, children, and the elderly. Both sides repeatedly interfered for political pur-
 poseswi   internationally provided humanitarian assistance. Informed observers es-
 timated that approximately 1,000 persons died daily at the beginning of 1994 and
 that at least 100,000 persons have perished since fighting resumed in 1992. Other
 
 
 human rights abuses included mistreatment of detainees, deplorable prison condi-
 tions, arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trials, broad restrictions on freedom of
 speech, press, and association, and violence against women and children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra"udcial Killing.-There were credible accounts that
 government military officers killed civilian men, women, children, and elderly per-
 sons suspected of being UNITA sympathizers after they recaptured N'Dalatando in
 May (see Section 1.g.). As the war worsened throughout 1994, common criminal vio-
 lence often was indistinguishable from politically motivated violence. Fighting be-
 tween members of the military and police and among military police and bandits
 in a large open-air market on the outskirts of Luanda regularly resulted in fatali-
 ties. There were eyewitness accounts of police killing unarmed civilians, including
 youths and street children in Luanda, and of violent, unexplained deaths, such as
 the August discovery of a well-known journalist who was found stuffed in a garbage
 can in a Luanda suburb. Unknown assailants assassinated the Vice Governor of
 Malange Province in early July. It is widely believed that the killing was for politi-
 cal reasons.
 In January the National Assembly Subcommittee for Human Rights released an
 investigative report, which failed to find the Government culpable for the events of
 "bloody Friday January 23, 1993," when military, national police, and civilians mas-
 sacred unknown numbers of Bakongo residents of Luanda, Lubango, Benguela, and
 Namibe provinces. The head of the political opposition party, Partido Democratico
 Para 0 Progresso-Alianca Nacional Angolana (PDP-ANA), whose members are al-
 most exclusively Bakongo, proclaimed the report a whitewash, alleging that it con-
 tained testimony by policemen who participated in the "ethnic cleansing" and that
 the investigation was carried out by-National Assembly deputies politically aligned
 with the rulingMPLA. Opposition National Assembly deputies boycotted the ple-
 nary session scheduled to debate the report for fear of MPLA reprisals. The report
 was approved ultimately, but the session did not have a quorum.
 In June UNITA admitted to executing summarily South African mercenaries
 fighting for the Government and subsequently published their photographs in
 UNITAs newspaper Terra Angolana.
 b. Disappearance.-Throughout 1994, both Government and UNITA officials ac-
 cused one another of abductions, disappearances, and the killing of civilians. The
 details of these incidents are unavailable.
 The Government's Ministry of Assistance and Social Reinsertion encouraged pro-
 grams of U.N. agencies and international nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) to
 search for family members of orphans and abandoned children.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were unsubstantiated reports that the police tortured detainees. Interior Min-
 istry personnel routinely beat detainees held in Comarca de Luanda, a prison on
 the outskirts of Luanda, to extract information or confessions prior to bringing them
 to trial. In many cases, the police routinely beat and then released arrestees rather
 than go through the effort of preparing a formal case. No new information was
 available on the Laboratoria, where, according to credible reports, government per-
 sonnel tortured detainees in 1993.
 The Government, the Angolan Human Rights Association, and the National As-
 sembly Subcommittee on Human Rights acknowledged publicly that conditions in
 Angola's prisons are inhumane. Cells designed for 10 prisoners contain 30 and are
 divided by open toilets and sewage. Prisoners die of malnutrition and tuberculosis.
 Many prisons, lacking financial and other support from the Government, failed to
 supply prisoners with food and medicine, and prisoners had to depend on inter-
 national relief organizations and their families and friends for basic support. Al-
 though the Government reportedly authorized access early in the year to all prisons
 for members of the National Assembly's Subcommittee on Human Rights, by mid-
 year the deputies abandoned the project to improve prison conditions due to govern-
 ment opposition.
 While detailed information is lacking, there are reliable reports that the Govern-
 ment and UNITA are both culpable of abuse of human rights of prisoners and of
 prisoners in uniform. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had
 only limited access in 1994 to prisoners.
 d.Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Transfer of the judicial process and pris-
 on system portfolios from the Interior Ministry to the Justice Ministry did not occur
 as agreed to by the Council of Ministers in 1993, and Interior Ministry officials sys-
 tematically, arbitrarily, and secretly detained people for all categories of crime,
 
 
 3
 without trial, for indeterminate periods of time. The rights of detainees were not
 respected.
 Under Angolan law, a person caught in the act of a crime can be arrested and
 detained immediately. Otherwise, the law states that arrests require a warrant
 signed by a judge or a provincial attorney general, followed by a public statement
 0 the grounds for arrest. The prosecuting attorney and defense attorney have a
 maximum of 90 days to prepare a case. Detainees are to be allowed prompt access
 to family members and a lawyer.
 The number of POW's and other political and security detainees held by the Gov-
 ernment at year's end was unknown. The Secretary-General of the Angola Human
 Rights Association (AHRA) remained in detention, and the Supreme Court had not
 responded to his appeal. The trial of the President of the AHRA was repeatedly
 postponed and remained pending at year's end.
 While there were no known well-nown UNITA sympathizers under government
 detention in Luanda in 1994, the Government kept senior UNITA leaders in Luanda
 under surveillance and did not allow them to travel abroad. The two highest rank-
 ing civilian UNITA leaders were not allowed to travel abroad from October 1992
 until November 1994. The Government made efforts to integrate senior UNITA
 leaders into Angolan society.
 UNITA arrested two Angolan humanitarian relief workers in Huambo in July for
 violating "state security." One was held incommunicado; the other was held indefi-
 nitely without charge but was allowed visitors. When government forces recaptured
 Huambo in November, these two relief workers disappeared. The ICRC estimated
 that there were hundreds of persons, both military and civilian, arrested and de-
 tained by UNITA in connection with the conflict or for security reasons. UNITA did
 not allow ICRC full access to their detainees, despite promises to do so, and only
 a limited number of detainees could be visited by the ICRC in the cities of Huambo
 and Uige. At the end of 1994, and with the recapture of Huambo by government
 forces, there was no information about the whereut ofthe detainees. The ICRC
 also acknowledged that UN1TA has held an unknown number of MPLA activists
 captured in other areas such as Caimbanmbo since the renewal of hostilities in 1992.
 e. Denial o Fair Public TriaL-In October 1991, the Code for Penal Process was
 amended nominally to guarantee a public trial, establish a system of bail, and recog-
 nize the accused's right to counsel and to testify. Despite these legal safeguards, and
 despite Ministry of Justice calls for judicial reform, significant shortcomin  in the
 administration of justice persisted. As noted in Section 1.d., the Ministry oInterior
 frequently arbitrarily arrested and detained people, often without the objective of
 a trial. Trials for political and security crimes are handled exclusively by the Su-
 preme Court. There were no known political or security trials in 1994.
 The court system is comprised of a Supreme Court at the appellate level and mu-
 nicipal and provincial courts (the latter under the authority of the Ministry of Jus-
 tice) of original jurisdiction. Although the 1992 law on constitutional revision speaks
 of an independent judiciary, as does the 1991 amended Constitution, in practice the
 judiciary is not independent. The President of the Republic has strong appointive
 powers, including of Supreme Court judge (for life terms), with no requirement for
 National Assembly confirmation. At the end of the year, the President had filled
 only 9 of the 16 positions. The Court serves as an appellate tribunal for questions
 of law and fact, but it does not have authority to interpret the Constitution. The
 Constitution reserves this role for a Constitutional Court, a bench that remained
 empty throughout the year.
 Municipal courts normally deal rapidly with routine civil and misdemeanor cases
 on a daily basis. Judges are normally respected laymen, not licensed lawyers. The
 jud   an  two laymen selected by the full court act as jury. Routine cases are nor-
 mally dispatched by a court within 3 months. The verdict is pronounced the day fol-
 lowing the conclusion of the trial, in the presence of the defendant.
 UNITA has not set up an independent judicial system, but it has a military and
 civilian court system in several provinces. Trials are never public. UNITA President
 Dr. Jonas Savimbi appoints the judges. The juries consist of elderly men chosen
 from the community. Reportedly the accused person has the right to a lawyer. Two
 national humanitarian assistance workers arrested in Huambo were to be tried in
 private and were not permitted outside counsel; however, they disappeared when
 government forces recaptured the city.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.The
 Government routinely maintains surveillance of certain groups, such as UNITA and
 other opposition National Assembly deputies, opposition party leaders, known or
 suspected Angolan or foreign UNTA sympathizers, and foreign diplomats. The law
 requires judicial search warrants, and in practice the law is respected. However, as
 
 
 far as known there were no search warrants issued before the roundup of Lebanese
 and other foreign businessmen in 1993.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Both government and UNITA forces were responsible for widespread abuses
 of humanitarian standards during the course of the war. There were credible reports
 that the Government carried out indiscriminate bombing between March and May
 on the provincial capital of N'Dalatando. The Government never revealed the death
 toll, but a large percentage of the casualties was reportedly civilian. In June the
 Chief of Staff of the armed forces admitted government fighter aircraft mistakenly
 bombed a village school in Waku Kungo, Cuanza Sul, reportedly killing 89 children.
 Both the Government and UNITA used land mines indiscriminately, causing a
 large number of fatalities and injuries. There were also credible reports that govern-
 ment soldiers targeted displaced women, stealing their humanitarian food rations
 and raping them.
 The Government and UNITA both impeded provision of emergency relief supplies
 and assistance by the ICRC, other nongovernmental voluntary organizations, and
 United Nations agencies. The military was also responsible for the murder of an An-
 golan humanitarian relief worker in Malange; and provincial authorities often har-
 assed relief workers and refused to comply with regulations governing the distribu-
 tion of humanitarian assistance. In UNITA-held Huambo, soldiers forcibly removed
 relief food in July from CARE International warehouses. UNITA caused the mortal-
 ity rate to rise considerably by withholding clearance for the majority of the human-
 itarian flights from May to late August to the besieged provincial capitals of
 Malange and Kuito, and sometimes fired on aircraft. In response the Government
 denied humanitarian assistance flights to Huambo and Uige.
 Credible sources, including eyewitnesses, reported that both sides forcibly con-
 scripted children as young as 12 into military service throughout Angola.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the 1991 Constitution provides for
 freedom of expression, in reality free speech is muted in the National Assembly, and
 the Government tightly controls the media, including media access to controversial
 public figures. Luanda s commercial radio station (LAC) and the weekly newspaper
 Correio da Semana are privately owned but are not independent. The majority of
 LAC and Correio stockholders are MPLA leaders who hue closely to the party line.
 In mid-1994 even LAC was told to cancel a popular daily program somewhat critical
 of the Government. Media policy and censorship are controlled by a committee com-
 posed of the Minister of Information, the press spokesman for the Presidency, and
 the directors of the state-owned radio, television, and newspaper. Additionally, the
 Prime Minister has staff devoted exclusively to censoring the government-owned
 and controlled newspaper Jornal de Angola.
 Although national radio has separate stations in each provincial capital, broad-
 casters must clear all programs with national radio headquarters in Luanda. There
 are five private radio stations in Luanda which censor themselves. Transmissions
 of Vorgan, UNITA's radio station, are heard throughout Angola. UNITA's news-
 paper, Terra Angolana, cannot be found in Luanda.
 The Government resorted to even stricter censorship in response to enhanced pub-
 lic awareness of human rights, which has evolved despite the war. Journalists admit
 they are under self-censorship and that repeated "errors in judgment* result in dis-
 missal. The only source of news about the war acceptable to the Government is the
 siokesperson for the Chief of Staff of the armed forces. The Government is more
 liberal with foreign news agencies, such as the Voice of America and the British
 Broadcasting Corporation, in part because most people lack the equipment needed
 to receive international transmissions.
 Credible members of the independent Angolan Journalists Syndicate (SJA) alleged
 in 1994 that the Government continued to restrict press freedom, including access
 to controversial public figures. The cause of death of the journalist mentioned in
 Section L.a. was determined to be homicide by an unknown assailant. The SJA did
 not the challenge the determination. Regarding the death of two journalists in 1993,
 the SJA said that the Government has never published the results of their inves-
 tigation, and the SJA is powerless to do anything about it.
 Foreign journalists must register with the government press center to obtain ac-
 cess to officials and to travel within Angola. Both the Government and UNITA in-
 vited journalists to planned press events and to visit areas under their control.
 Academic life has been severely circumscribed by the war, and the university is
 barely functioning. There is academic freedom; academics do not practice self-cen-
 sorship.
 
 
 5
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly with 3-day notification and the right of association.
 However, in practice the Government carefully controls both assembly and associa-
 tion. For example, authorities in Luanda vetoed plans, properly submitted in ad-
 vance, for a commemoration on the first anniversary of Bakongos killed in a
 military- and police-inspired massacre in January 1993, warning of serious reper-
 cussions for anyone who congregated on the anniversary (see Section L.a.).
 Regulations allow the Government to deny required registration to private asso-
 ciations on security grounds. The Government uses its powers arbitrarily to limit
 association activities deemed inimical to its interests, such as in the case of the An-
 golan Human Rights Association (see Section 4).
 UNITA did not allow freedom of assembly and association in areas under its con-
 trol.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion, including separation of church and
 state is provided for in the Constitution and res d in practice
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The civil war greatly inhibited freedom of movement within the country
 and forced large numbers of persons to flee combat areas. According to U.N. statis-
 tics, since late 1992, 2 million people have fled to government-controlled territory
 from the interior just ahead of  A's advancing troops, where they remain. How-
 ever, wartime conditions prevented physical access to many areas of the country by
 humanitarian organizations, and the exact number of persons severely affected by
 the war remained unknown.
 While citizens have the legal right to change residence and workplace in govern-
 ment-controlled areas, the scarcity of habitable dwellings as well as massive unem-
 ployment and underemployment effectively impeded  most voluntary changes. The
 Government restricted travel of its citizens abroad, largely by linuting access to for-
 eign exchange or, in the case of UNITA leaders, denying permission outright. At the
 same time, MPLA deputies and high-level government officials had unlimited access
 to foreign exchange and the right t ravel abroad.
 There are substantiated reports that the Government impeded opposition party
 leaders from traveling from Luanda to their constituencies in the interior.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While the Angolan people for the first time exercised their constitutional right to
 change their government threugh peaceful means in the September 1992 presi-
 dential and legislative elections, the resumption of the war stalled the democratiza-
 tion process, and ahsecond round of presidential elections had to be postponed indefi-
 nitely. Consequently,, governmental power, includingl in the National Assembly, re-
 mained excluivey in the hands of a smal gup witi the MPA.
 The National Assembly consists of 220 deputies, 130 elected on a national basis
 and 90 elected to represent the provinces. Eteven of the 70 UNITA deputies elected
 in the 1992 election took their seats in 1994. There are several deputes represen-
 ing smaller parties. However, few opposition deputies participated~in National As-
 _sembly debate. MPLA deputies have admitted publicly that national Assembly de-
 bate was superfluous, and the Assembly simply rubberstamped the Presidency's ini-
 tiatives.
 The Minister of the Interior attempted to impeach an opposition deputy for having
 criticized the Government in the international media. The opposition deputy apolo-
 gized formally to the Government in order to retain his seat. Several months later,
 policemen reportedy attempted to kil th~at same depumty. The Government's inves-
 ti gation of the incident was not completed at year's end.
 The peace negotiations in Lusaka reached a successful conclusion on November
 20 when representatives of the Government UNiTA, and the United Nations signed
 the Lusaka Protocol. A Joint Commission of' delegations of the Government, UNITA,
 and the three observer nations, chaired by the U.N. Secretary General's Special
 Representative, began meeting in Luanda in December to implement the Lusaka
 Protocol. Limited progress hadven made at year's end.
 In 1993 the Government prepared guidelines for local government elections,
 scheduled to take place 2 years afitr the 1992 presidential anc legislative elections.
 However, at the end of 1994, the Council of Ministers had taken no action on the
 guidelines, effectively shelving local elections indfiitely.
 While ther are no legal barriers to the participation of indigenous people in the
 political process, they are underrepresented in the National Assembly and do not
 participate actively in politics (see Section 5). Women  occupied 32 of the 220 Na-
 tional Assemly seats. One of the nine Supreme Court judges is a woman, and there
 are three women in the Prime Minister's Cabinet.
 
 
 6
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Both the Government and UNITA impeded independent investigations of human
 rights abuses in their respective territory. There were no actively functioning Ango-
 Ian nongovernmental human rights associations or groups. The Angolan Huma
 Rights Association (ADHA) was inactive in 1994, because its leaders, both the presi-
 dent and the secretary general, were deeply embroiled in defending themselves
 against spurious law suits, reportedly instigated by the Government. ADHA _pub-
 lished a report on Angola's prisons in January that was the genesis of constant Inte-
 rior Ministry harassment and subsequent imprisonment of the Association's leaders.
 The National Assembly Human Rights Subcommittee, which got off to a promis-
 ing start in 1993, was ineffective in 1994 owing to MPLA opposition. It was unable
 to create mechanisms to enforce existing laws to protect the rights of Angolans, and
 human rights issues received very low priority in National Assembly debate.
 While frequently harassing and limiting relief operations, the Government and
 UNITA did allow a variety of international NGO's access to much of the territory
 under their respective control. They were much less willing, however, to allow
 human rights investigations. The Government granted the ICRC only limited access
 to prisons in 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Angola is a multiracial society, and the Constitution states that all citizens are
 equal regardless of race, ethnic origin, sex, religon, or social status.
 Women.-The deterioration of the social and economic situation, a consequence of
 the war and poor governance, has had a negative effect on the status of women. Al-
 though women held senior positions in the military (primarily in the medical field),
 civil service, and political parties, they held mainly low-level psitions in state-ran
 industries and in the small private economy. The law proclaims equal pay for equal
 work, but in practice women were not compensated equally. Adult women may open
 a bank account, accept emploent, and own property without interference from
 their spouse. Women are included in all levels of UNITA's ranks.
 While little information was available on the extent of domestic violence, a study
 published by a renowned journalist indicated that spousal violence is widespread
 and growing. The study indicated that one-third of all homicides were perpetrated
 against women, usually by their spouse. The study revealed that women are not
 treated as fairly as men in a court of law, even though the Constitution provides
 for equality. In many besieged cities, women swelled the ranks of the handicapped
 because, in foraging in the fields for food to feed their families, they often set off
 land mines. Due to dire economic circumstances increasing numbers of adult
 women and girls engage in prostitution, and the clergy report that marriages are
 breaking down at an alarming rate.
 Children.-The Government has given only marginal attention to children's rights
 and welfare. As noted, both the Government and UNITA have been responsible for
 conscripting teenagers into military service. A major problem in 1994 was the grow-
 ing presence of street children in Luanda and other cities, one indication of the
 structural breakdown in Angola's family institutions caused by the war and the de-
 teriorating economy. Young females are often accepted into private homes as domes-
 tics while young males roam the market places and streets. The living conditions
 in government youth hostels are deplorable, and the majority of the homeless chil-
 dren prefer to sleep on city streets.
 The government-sponsored National Institute for Children, viewed as an MPLA
 organ, has not seriously addressed the problems children face and has been indiffer-
 ent toward efforts by international NGO'sto assist dispossessed youth. However, the
 Government cooperated with international NGO's in establishing a camp for young
 Angolans on the outskirts of Luanda. The project was only partially successful in
 keeping children from returning to the city streets and crime. There were no active
 private children's rights advocacy groups.
 It cannot be verified whether female genital mutilation is practiced in Angola.
 However, medical authorities say that it may have occurred in limited fashion in
 remote areas of Moxico province, bordering Zaire and Zambia.
 Indigenous People.-Angola's population includes 1 to 2 percent of preliterate
 tribes. Mostly hunters and gatherers, these Khoisan and other linguistically distinct
 6rups are scattered throughout the southern provinces of Namibe, Cunene, and
 Cuando Cubango. There is no evidence that they suffer from official discrimination
 or harassment, but they do not participate actively in the political or economic life
 of the country and have a marginal ability to influence government decisions con-
 cerning their interests.
 
 
 7
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The long civil conflict has deep ethnic and
 urban versus rural roots. The MPIA is heavily supported by the M1bundu ethnic
 group, which makes up an estimated 25 percent of the population, and by many city
 dwellers, notably in Luanda. It also has strong backing among the small number
 of white and mixed-race Angolans who occupy technical and governmental positions.
 Election results indicated a high level of support among other ethnic groups apart
 from the Ovimbundu. UNITA has its principal backing among the country's largest
 single ethnic group, the Ovimbundu, who make up an estimated 37 percent of the
 population and are concentrated in the central and southern parts of Angola. The
 Government continued to claim that inflammatory UNITA rhetoric exacerbated eth-
 nic tensions by dwelling on the perceived colonial ties of white and mixed-race Ango-
 lans.
 The Government cracked down on Lebanese businessmen in 1994, allegedly for
 illegal business activities. The Government arbitrarily deported an Angolan/Por-
 tuguese businessman, born in Malange, during a sweep of mostly Lebanese busi-
 nessmen in Luanda in December 1993-January 1994. He has not been permitted to
 return, although in a recent press interview in Lisbon he expressed a desire to do
 SO.
 People With Disabilities.-There are many phyically disabled persons throughout
 Angola, the majority of whom are casualties of and mines and other civil war-relat-
 ed injuries. While there is no obvious discrimination against them, the Government
 has one little to ameliorate their physical, financial, or social distress and has not
 legislated accessibility to public buildings or any other benefit specifically for the
 disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution recognizes the right of Ango-
 lans to form trade unions and to bargain collectively. However, the implementing
 law governing unions has yet to be passed, and in practice the Government domi-
 nates the labor movement through the National Union of Angolan Workers (UNTA),
 the official labor union of the ruling MPLA, which remained the principal workers'
 organization. Two other groups without affiliation to a political party, the National
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Angola and the Democratic Confederation of
 Angolan Workers, waited yet another year for peace and a new labor union law. The
 war, the Government's long association with and preference for UNTA, and the lack
 of necessary legislation effectively stifled the development of these two organiza-
 tions.
 Organized labor is concentrated in the cities. There is no organized labor in agri-
 culture, traditionally the main source of income for the vast majority of Angolans.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and legislation passed in 1991
 provides the legal framework to strike. The law prohibits lockouts and worker occu-
 pation of places of employment and provides some protection for nonstriking work-
 ers. It prohibits strikes by military and police personnel, prison workers, and fire-
 men. It does not prohibit retribution against strikers.
 There were strikes against the Government in August by air traffic controllers
 and in September by Luanda province public school teachers. The Government nego-
 tiated the air traffic controllers' demands expeditiously, and it met with a 5-member
 teachers' commission, representing Luanda province's 11,000 teachers. The Govern-
 ment harassed commission members until they capitulated to the Government's de-
 mand that the strike be postponed until the end of the academic year in October
 in exchange for an extra month's salary. The Government did not provide a salary
 increase or pay the extra month's salary as promised, and consequently the teachers
 remained on strike at the end of 1994.
 By year's end, the Government and the MPLA-controlled National Assembly had
 still not enacted laws to allow labor organizations to affiliate with international
 labor bodies. UNTA, the MPLA labor union, is affiliated with the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity and the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions. The two planned Angolan trade union federations will not be able
 to a pply for membership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 until relevant domestic legislation is enacted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Angolan workers have the
 constitutional right to organize and bargain collectively. However, in practice there
 has been almost no collective bargaining, and the Government dominates the econ-
 omy through state-run enterprises. The Ministry of Public Administration, Labor,
 and Social Security continued to set wages and benefits on an annual basis. The
 Council of Ministers approved the Ministr/s proposal to increase salaries 100 per-
 cent for all public sector employees in 1994. The Council based salaries of employees
 of state-owned enterprises on profits of the previous year, the availability of loans
 
 
 from the national bank, and the percentage of government ownership. In Angola's
 small private sector, wages are based on multiples of the minimum salary set by
 the Government.
 The 1991 legislation prohibits discrimination against union members. Union mem-
 bers' complaints are adjudicated in the regular civil courts. Employers found guilty
 of antiumon discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activi-
 ties.
 Angola has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-In 1993 the Government indicated
 that in mid-1994 it would introduce legislation to prohibit forced labor, reversing
 laws and provisions which had been cited by the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) as a violation of ILO Convention 105 on Forced Labor. The outdated legisla-
 tion authorizes forced labor for breaches of worker discipline and participation in
 strikes. While new legislation was proposed in 1994, it Tad not been enacted by
 year's end or even debated by the National Assembly.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 14. The Inspector General of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for
 enforcing labor laws. The Labor Ministry maintains employment centers where pro-
 spective employees register. These centers screen out applicants under the age of
 14. However, children at a much younger age work on family farms and in the infor-
 mal economy; the survival of Angola s growing number of street children under-
 scores the role of child labor in the informal urban economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is set by the Government
 and was increased by 100 percent in 1994. However, the Government does not en-
 force the wage standard. In real terms, the minimum wage of just over $1 per
 month (1 million kwanzas) is insufficient to support a worker and family. As a re-
 sult, many wage-earning workers depended on the thriving informal sector (night
 jobs, subsistence farming, theft, corruption, or support from abroad) to maintain an
 acceptable standard of living.
 The normal workweek, established by a 1994 government decree, is 37 hours.
 There was no information available on the adequacy of work safety conditions or
 health standards, but they presumably were adversely affected by the weakness of
 the Angolan economy, the lack of enforcement mechanisms, and the war.
