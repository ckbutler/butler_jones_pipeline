 HUNGARY
 Hungary is a parliamentary democracy with a freely elected legislature. Prime
 Minister Jozsef Antall headed a coalition government formed after the 1990 national
 elections until his death in December 1993. He was succeeded as Prime Minister
 by Peter Boross.
 The state internal and external security services report directly to a minister
 without portfolio. The police are controlled by and are responsive to the Interior
 Minister.
 Transition to a market economy has proven harder than expected despite some
 successes. Hungary has attracted more than half the region's foreign investment;
 three-fourths of its trade turnover is with advanced industrial countries, and the
 grivate sector provides about half of the gross domestic product. But privatization
 as been slow; living standards have fallen for most of the population, a fourth of
 which lives at or below the poverty line. Hungary's per capita debt remains Europe's
 highest, and unemployment shows little prospect of falling below the 12- to 13-per-
 cent range.
 Human rights and civil liberties are provided for in the Constitution and gen-
 erally respected in practice. The print media continued to flourish, with a high de-
 gree of independence and variety of opinion. Parliament's continued failure to pass
 a broadcast bill during 1993 left the broadcast media still dominated by the state-
 owned Hungarian television and Hungarian radio, which were susceptible to in-
 creased pressure from the Government.
 "Skinheads" perpetrated physical attacks on Gypsies, Africans, and Arabs. Al-
 though the overall number of assaults dropped for the first time since 1991, this
 was probably due to the dramatic decrease in the number of foreign students in
 Hungary and some increased police attention to the problem. There were also re-
 ports of police abuses against Gypsies, reflecting significant prejudice against the
 Gysy population.
 Fhe Government has only marginally improved upon its initial lackadaisical re-
 sponse to the significant increase in racial incidents in post-Communist Hungary.
 In 1993 the Supreme Court decided that the section of the law that deals with ra-
 cially motivated crimes is not applicable to skinhead attacks on foreigners, Gypsies,
 
 
 911
 or other members of ethnic minorities. Instead, those few skinhead attacks that
 reach the courts are treated as simple hooliganism.
 Parliament passed a law in July granting special rights to certain ethnic minori-
 ties living in Hungary. The law outlines general goals, permitting collective rights
 and some local autonomy for specified ethnic groups, although the actual effects of
 the law remained unclear.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence that political
 or other extrajudicial killings occurred.
 Judicial proceedings continue in the case of a park ranger who killed two Gypsies,
 with the defense attorney attempting to demonstrate that the ranger is mentally
 handicapped. The two surviving Gypsies involved in the event were fined for steal-
 ing pears.
 b. Disappearance.-Ther were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 No known instances of torture occurred. Nongovernmental human rights groups and
 the press, however, regularly carried reports of police abuse against Gypsies and
 abusive treatment of conscripts within the armed services.
 Degrading treatment was reported in the case of an Ethiopian student accused
 of murdering his Ethiopian girlfriend. The student, who was eventually acquitted,
 spent more than a year in custody, during which time he claimed he was subject
 to abusive treatment. The student still walks with a limp from an infection which
 developed on his leg and which did not receive timely or adequate treatment while
 he was in custody.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Upon arrest, suspects must be informed
 of the charges against them and may be held for a maximum of 72 hours before
 charges must be filed. It is a requirement, followed in practice, that persons be al-
 lowed access to counsel from the moment they are suspects undergoing questioning
 and throughout all subsequent proceedings.
 The authorities must specifically provide counsel when a person is mentally
 handicapped, juvenile, or unable to afford counsel. There is no bail system; however,
 depending upon the nature of the crime, the accused may be released upon his or
 her own recognizance. Pretrial detention is based on a warrant issued by a judge
 and is limited to 1 year while criminal investigations are in progress, after which
 the accused must be brought to trial or released. There were no known instances
 of incommunicado detention.
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Under the Constitution the courts are responsible
 for the administration of justice, with the Supreme Court exercising policy control
 over the operations and judicature of all courts. There are three levels of courts in
 the current system. Original jurisdiction in most matters rests with the local courts.
 Appeals of their rulings may be made to county courts or to the Budapest municipal
 court, all of which also have original jurisdiction in some matters. The highest level
 of appeal is the Supreme Court, whose decisions on nonconstitutional issues are
 binding. There is no jury system; hence, judges are the final arbiters. In the case
 of military trials, appeals also may be addressed to the Supreme Court.
 The Constitutional Court is charged with rviewing the constitutionality of laws
 and statutes brought before it for review. The Court's 10 members are elected by
 Parliament to a 9-year term which may be renewed. (According to the law, the Con-
 stitutional Court is to be composed of 15 members; 10 have been elected to date,
 and the remaining 5 are scheduled to be seated by 1995.) No judge or member of
 the Supreme Court or the Constitutional Court may belong to a political party or
 engage in political activity.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and respected in practice.
 However, Gypsies and other minorities are reportedly not treated by the authorities
 in the same way as the majority of Hungarians. In some cases, judges may agree
 to a closed trial if it is for the protection of the accused or the crime victim, such
 as in some rape cases. This is also true for military trials, which follow civil law
 and may be closed if state, service, or moral grounds justify a closed trial. In all
 cases, sentencing must take place publicly. Defendants are entitled to counsel dur-
 ing all phases of criminal proceedings and are presumed innocent unless proven
 guilty. Judicial proceedings are generally investigative rather than adversarial in
 nature. The judicial system has been criticized for what human rights monitors and
 others have characterized as extraordinarily lenient sentences handed down to
 
 
 912
 skinheads convicted of violent assaults on members of minority groups (see Section
 5).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 current law, search warrants may be issued independently by the prosecutor's office
 when there is probable cause. House searches must be carried out in the presence
 of two witnesses. A written inventory of items removed from the premises must be
 prepared. These provisions are observed in practice.
 According to the law, only the Minister of Justice has the authority to approve
 wiretapping for national security reasons and for legitimate criminal investigations.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is provided for in the Con-
 stitution and is generally respected in practice. Although the Government exerts
 some control over at least three Budapest dailies, the print media enjoy considerable
 freedom. The electronic media, however, are subject to increasing political pressure.
 Parliament's continued failure to enact a broadcast bill meant that there were no
 institutional safeguards to protect the independence of radio and television, and
 Hungarian Radio (MR) and Hungarian Television (MTV) continued to enjoy near
 monopoly status. Despite the lack of media legislation, the Government plans to
 issue up to 103 local television and radio licenses beginning in 1994, ending the fre-
 quency moratorium in effect since 1989. Critics chare that the licenses will be is-
 sued by government bureaucrats susceptible to political manipulation rather than
 by an impartial commission or body.
 Besides MTV and MR, there is one private, commercial national radio; two pri-
 vate, commercial regional radios in Budapest; a national, commercial FM radio
 owned by MR; and a national AM commercial radio jointly owned by MR and a pri-
 vate concern. There are no private commercial television stations, though one pri-
 vate television production company places 2 hours of programming per day on MTV.
 One private television station was allowed to broadcast on the Budapest wireless
 cable channel for 3 days during the Christmas holidays, but the frequency has not
 yet been permanently allocated. It is estimated that over half of Hungarian house-
 holds now have access to satellite television, cable, or both.
 In January the presidents of MTV and MR  resigned their  sts, citing an edict
 that went into effect on January 1 moving budgetary contro of the state media
 from MTV and MR to the office of ie Prime Mimster. They were joined by human
 rights gups in pointing out that, without a broadcast bill, press freedom at MTV
 and MR depended on the good faith of the Government. Indeed, some MTV pro-
 grams were canceled in 1993 for political reasons. Personnel changes were made in
 senior positions, giving progovernment journalists more influence, and the program
 mix at both MTV and MR was changed to present a more progovernment profile.
 Following several unsuccessful attempts by the Prime Minister in 1992 to remove
 Elemer Hankiss, the then president of MTV, the Government initiated a lawsuit
 against Hankiss, charging him with mismanagement. Suspicions that the Govern-
 ment's action was politically motivated seemed to be confirmed when the lawsuit
 against Hankiss was dropped after he resigned. Criminal investigations into allega-
 tions that two of his advisors were guilty of financial malfeasance were dropped for
 lack of evidence.
 In another prominent case, MTV fired Andras Bano, editor in chief of 'Esti
 Egyenleg," an evening news program which maintained considerable independence
 from the Government, and which the Government often claimed favored the opposi-
 tion. Bano was accused by MTV Acting President Gabor Nahlik of doctoring a video-
 tape so that it appeared skinheads forced President of the Republic Arpad Goncz
 from the podium at a ceremony on October 23, 1992. Nahlik's assertion was that
 the skinheads were not present when the President began to speak. Bano main-
 tained that the tape was not doctored. A diplomatic officer who was present at the
 rally confirmed that a large number of skinheads were among the crowd loudly
 heckling the President.
 Bano was initially suspended for his alleged doctoring of the tape. Two of his asso-
 ciates were also suspended in relation to the case. "Esti Egyenleg" then went off the
 air when its staff protested Bano's suspension. Despite claims that he had "proof,"
 Nahlik never produced conclusive evidence that the tapes had been doctored. Never-
 theless in December a three-person MTV disciplinary panel-chaired by Nahlik
 himself -fired Bano. However, the chief investigator in the case also resigned, say-
 ing that it had become clear to him that the intent of the investigation was not to
 determine the facts of the case but only to build a case against Bano. "Esti
 Egyenleg" remains off the air as of the end of the year, leaving MTV with one news
 program, "Hirado," which is considered to be progovernment.
 
 
 In March, by majority vote, Parliament created a cultural foundation that as-
 sesses a 1-percent tax on newspaper revenue and up to a 20-percent tax on publica-
 tions the Ministry of Culture deems violent or pornographic. The foundation may
 distribute the money for cultural purposes to appropriate applicants. The print
 media objected to this, since the law gives the foundation (and hence, they say, the
 Government) the right to distribute the money to applicants who meet its political
 criteria.
 The 1991 case against the weekly Szent Korona for incitement of anti-Semitic
 feelings was concluded with a fine for inciting ethnic hatred.
 In May the President signed a law banning the wearing and dissemination of the
 swastika, SS badge, arrow-cross (the symbol of the Hungarian Fascists), the ham-
 mer and sickle, and the five-pointed red star. Official symbols of states are exempt-
 ed, as are the use of such symbols for educational, scientific, artistic, or historical
 purposes.
 In a case involving charges of insulting the Government brought by Prime Min-
 ister Antall against Laszlo Lengyel, a well-respected political commentator, an ap-
 peals court found Lengyel guilty and sentenced him to 1 year's probation with a
 750 fne suspended. Lengyel, who called the Hungarian Government corrupt in the
 course of an economics lecture in the town of Veszprem, plans to appeal the case
 to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, saying he should face no
 penalty whatsoever for his remarks.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Peaceful public gatherings are
 essentially unrestricted. In general, no permits are required for assembly, except in
 cases when a public gathering is planned near sensitive installations such as mili-
 tary facilities, embassies, and key government buildings.
 Police may sometimes alter or revoke permits, but there is no evidence that this
 freedom is abused. Several mass demonstrations reflecting diverse political views
 took place in 1993.
 Any 10 or more persons may form an association, provided that it does not com-
 mit criminal offenses or disturb the rights of others. Assoations with charters and
 elected officers must register with the courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Approximately 65 percent of Hungarians are Roman
 Catholic; members of other faiths practice their religion freely. Religious groups may
 and do maintain international contacts. There is no officially preferred religion, but
 only officially approved churches receive state subsidies. The Government distrib-
 uted nearly $33 million in state subsidies among 36 churches.
 Four small churches--the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Community of Krishna Believ-
 ers, the Unifying Church, and the Church of Sientology-branded as "socially de-
 structive" during parliamentary debate, were not included in the list of subsidized
 churches but are allowed to function.
 Legislation is being drafted however, that would seriously restrict religious free-
 dom. The draft proposal would give the courts the right to deny registration as a
 church for a group whose teachings the court determines would offend "generally
 accepted moral values." In order to be registered, churches would also be required
 to have 10,000 members (as opposed to the current 100), although churches that
 have existed in Hungary more than 100 years would be exempt.
 Religious orders and schools have regained property confiscated by the Com-
 munist regime. In some small towns where government schools were transferred to
 the Catholic Church, parents who do not want their children to receive a religious
 education had little alternative. Even among many Catholic parents, there is a
 strong preference for secular education, and parents in some cases were successful
 in blocking the transfer of schools to the Church. In towns where there is only a
 church school, the state provides subsidized bus transportation to the nearest secu-
 lar school.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on the movement of Hungarian nationals
 within or outside Hungary, including on the rights of emigration and repatriation.
 Emigration may be delayed, but not denied, for those who have significant court-
 assessed debts or who possess state secrets. Foreign students from countries not
 having a visa waiver agreement with Hungary must obtain exit visas every time
 they leave the country. Foreign minor children may not be allowed to travel to third
 countries without a parent or legal guardian or the permission of the country of the
 child's nationality.
 The fighting in the former Yugoslavia resulted in a continued flow of refugees into
 Hungary. While 8,500 refugees are registered within Hungary, the Government esti-
 mates that over 30,000 more are unregistered. Most of the refugees are in private
 housing, with only 3,200 housed in refugee camps.
 
 
 914
 
 Hungary is a si atory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 and to the 1967 rtool, with a caveat that it will grant refugee status only to Eu-
 ropean nationals. Prospective refugees who seek only to transit to Western Europe
 are encouraged to return to their countries of departure.
 Local and international human rights organizations have accused the Government
 of detaining aliens in unacceptable conditions for excessively lengthy periods at the
 detention center at Kerepestarmsa, which is operated by the police. Aliens who have
 entered illegally, mostly non-European, are kept at the center pending their depor-
 tation or their qualification for resettlement in a third country by the local office
 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). While the police
 seek the timely deportation of detainees who do not qualify for refugee status, a lack
 of funds and the detainees' lack of proper documentation, such as passports, often
 result in lengthy stays. UNHCR reports that conditions at the camp have improved
 moderately in the last year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Hungarians aged 18 and over have the right to change their government through
 national and local elections required to be held at least every 4 years. The Par-
 liament's 386 members are elected through a complex voting procedure for individ-
 uals and party lists.
 Currently, Hungary has a center-right coalition government formed by the Hun-
 garian Democratic Forum, the Christian Democratic People's Party, and a group of
 independent smallholders' parties. The Free Democrats, the Alliance of Young
 Democrats, the Hungarian Socialist Party, and various independent members of
 Parliament, sometimes joined by Istvan Csurka's breakaway Justice and Life Party,
 constitute an active opposition in Parliament. Several parties have been formed re-
 cently; however, only those that attract at least 5 percent in the 1994 elections may
 be represented in Parliament.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or the po-
 litical process but there is reluctance to break from the women's traditional role in
 the home and responsibility for the family; 27 of 386 parliamentary deputies are
 women, and there are few women in leadership positions in the Government or the
 political parties. Several minorities, including Germans, Gypsies, Croats, and Slo-
 yaks, are represented in Parliament as members of one party or another.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights organizations operate in Hungary without government re-
 striction or interference, including the Hunarian Helsinki Committee, the
 Wallenberg Association for Minority-Rights, the Hungarian Human Rights League
 and the Martin Luther King Organization, which was formed by the foreign and
 Hungarian student community in response to the growing incidence of racially moti-
 vated attacks. A new legal nongovernmental organization, the Bureau for Minori-
 ties, is being organized, and a 25-member parliamentary Committee for Human, Mi-
 nority, and Religious Rights also considers human rights issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Legally, women have the same rights as men, including identical inher-
 itance and property rights. While there is no overt discrimination against women,
 the number of women in middle or upper managerial positions is low. Women are
 heavily represented in the judiciary and in medicine and teaching, which are among
 the lower paid professions.
 Women's rights groups, still in their infancy, have not had a major impact on soci-
 etal attitudes. Groups, such as the Feminist Network, have become more active in
 lobbying with Parliament. While there are laws against rape, it is often unreported
 for cultural reasons. Similarly police attitudes towards victims of sexual abuse re-
 portedly are often unsympathetic. Abuse of partners is most prevalent in families
 living below the poverty line and among unmarried couples. Police reports are rare-
 ly made. Alcohol is often a factor in abusive relationships.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights. Education is man-
 datory through age 16, and employment is illegal below age 16.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-The new law on ethnic and minority rights,
 approved by Parliament in July, legally establishes the concept of the collective
 rights of minorities and states that minorities need special rights in order to pre-
 serve their ethnic identities. It explicitly permits organized forms of limited self-gov-
 ernment in areas where ethnic groups constitute a majority and states that the es-
 tablishment of self-governing bodies must be made possible in localities where an
 
 
 915
 
 ethnic group constitutes less than a majority of the population. Further, the new
 law permits associations, movements, and political parties based upon an ethnic or
 national character and mandates unrestricted use of ethnic languages. Only those
 ethnic groups that have lived within the present Hungarian borders for at least 100
 years and whose members are Hungarian citizens obtain recognized status under
 the new law. On this basis, the law specifically grants minority status to 13 ethnic
 or national groups. Other groups may petition the Chairman of Parliament for in-
 clusion if they comprise at least 1,000 Hungarian citizens and have their own lan-
 guage and culture.
 Significantly, the law granted the status of a minority to the Gypsies, or Romas,
 Hungary's largest minority. Previously, they were not regarded as a national minor-
 ity and thus were deprived of some of the special rights granted to minorities under
 the Constitution. Conversely, Jews are not 1 of the 13 minorities listed in the law
 because they are considered a reigious group. This was the subject of much debate
 during the drafting of the law, and, although there is no consensus in the Jewish
 community about whether Jews should be considered a minority, it is believed that
 the majority oppose the idea.
 The effectiveness of the law will depend on the mechanisms established to imple-
 ment it and guarantee its provisions. Many of its major provisions will not actually
 go into effect until 1994 or even later. Minority representatives in Hungary com-
 plained that the law failed to provide adequate legal and financial guarantees for
 expanding minority institutions. The chairman of Hungary's Roma parliament, an
 organization representing Gypsy interests that is not affiliated with the Hungarian
 Parliament although its chairman is also a member of the Hungarian Parliament,
 complained that the new law made no provisions for setting up specific institutions
 to guarantee minority rights and for providing minorities with electorl ballots in
 thi mohe tongue.                 o te    e
 Although the onstitution allows each minority group one parliamentary ombuds-
 man to speak for its collective rights, the Government has not yet implemented this
 provision.
 On the local level, minorities have the right to establish self-governing bodies, and
 minority candidates need only two-thirds of the minimum number of votes required
 of nonminority candidates for election to corresponding regional legislative bodies.
 A minority roundtable, at which all minorities are represented, negotiates with the
 Government over the content of prospective legislation on minorities and  as ac-
 tively involved in the drafting of the naw on minority rights. The Government estab-
 lished an Office for National and Ethnic Minorities in 1990 to address the needs
 of national and ethnic minorities.
 Gypsies constituti the largeat minority group, officiall estimated at between
 400,000 and 600,000 in a toal population of 10.5 million. he second larget group
 is the 210,000 Germans, followed by 105,000 Slovaks, 85,000 Crats, and 80,000
 Jews. There are also Romanian, Polish, Greek, Serbian, Slovene, Armenian, Ruthe-
 nian, and Bulgarian minorities.
 To varying degrees, education is  vailable in almost all minority languages. There
 are minority-language print media, and Hungarian Radio broadcasts 2-hour daily
 programs in the mother tongue of mator nationalities. Hungarian Television carries
 a 30-minute program for the larger minority eups and plans to introduce program-
 minG for the smaller ethnic groups in 1994. ebrew has been proposed as the 14th
 official minority language. Minority groups continued to be dissatisfied with the
 broadcastinghours allotted them, complaining especially about early afternoon time
 slots for such pro rms.
 Conditions of life within the Gypsy community are significantly poorer than
 among the general population, andthey suffer from discriminati n and racist at-
 tacks. Gypsies are considerably less educated, with lower than average incomes and
 life expectancy. The unemploymen rate is estimated to be 70 peren, more than
 five times the national average of 13 percent. With unemployment benefit ex-
 haused and inadequate social services, there are reports that Gypsy families, in-
 cluding young children, are forced to resort to stealing food to eat.
 The Government sponsors progrmams both to preserve Gypy l       aguaesand cul-
 tural heritage and to assist social and economic assimilation. After a Gypsy youth
 was beaten into a coma in the town of Eger, a skinhead stronghold and sie of 25
 assaults on Gypsies sirce 1991, Gypsies held a protest rally. Strong police prtection
 was provided. Fr the first time in Hungary, a member of a Gypsy organization,
 though not a Gypsy himself, was elected mayor in the town of Kunmadaras. None-
 thless, there is etill widespread popular prejudice against the Gypsies. Gypsies are
 generally assumed to be untrastworthy and treated as such, including by police,
 which might partly account for the higher crime rate. (See Section .c. or reported
 police abuse of Gypsies.)
 
 
 916
 The Jewish community in Hungary, although generally well assimilated was the
 target of occasional anti-Semitic expression, including the desecration in June of a
 Jewish cemetery in Eger, for which several youths were arrested and charged. Jews
 are well represented in politics, the media, culture, and business. Many Hungarians,
 however, are concerned that, while the Government does not actively condone anti-
 Semitic activities, its failure to disassociate itself quickly and clearly from the anti-
 Semitic statements of Istvan Csurka reflected a lack of sensitivity. A rightwing pop-
 ulist, Csurka was able to retain his position as vice president of the ruling party
 for several months after his statements were published. Before the MDF could expel
 him, Csurka went on to form his own new rightwing party and group in Parliament.
 Skinheads and neo-Nazi sympathizers continued physically to assault Jews and
 people of color. Sentences in skinhead attacks are relatively light, especially when
 the defendants are minors. In June three youths convicted of attacking and severely
 beating two Pakistani men in November 1990 were sentenced to 8 months in jail;
 the court then suspended the sentences and gave the youths 2 years' probation. Al-
 though investigations of reported crimes were usually conducted, convicted crimi-
 nals were rarely sent to prison. The resulting perception of the judicial system's de
 facto tolerance of racist crimes creates an atmosphere conducive to further acts of
 skinhead violence. The Martin Luther King Organization (MLKO), which documents
 assaults on foreigners of color (but not anti-Semitic incidents), recorded about 20
 separate attacks in 1993, down from 78 in 1992. MLKO sources commented, how-
 ever, that they believe many cases go unreported, that police do not seem inclined
 to intervene, and that the decline in the number of attacks is primarily due to the
 lower number of foreign students in Hungary. The greatest decline has been in the
 number of African students; while there were 600 Sudanese students in Hungary
 2 years ago, MLKO sources say there are now barely 60.
 Since 1955 the Penal Code has provided for stiffer sentences for crimes which are
 racially motivated. However, Hungary's Supreme Court has ruled that racially moti-
 vated crimes cannot be prosecuted under the section of the law dealing with crimes
 against humanity. In a case involving attacks on Gypsies and people of color by 48
 members of a skinhead gang, the court ruled that the defendants could only be
 charged with hooliganism, and it reduced the sentences which lower courts had im-
 posed. The Hungarian Supreme Court's failure to recognize a ualitative difference
 between premeditated attacks with a clear racial motivation and simple hooliganism
 is a significant judgment. In effect, the Court has declared that as far as Hungarian
 law is concerned, hate crimes do not exist.
 People of color continued to suffer consistent discrimination, including being re-
 fused service in some stores and restaurants.
 People with Disabilities.-Services to the disabled are still limited, and many
 buildings are not accessible to wheelchair. MTV does have close captioning on some
 programs, and there are programs that address issues of interest to the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right of unions
 to organize and bargain collectively and permits trade union pluralism. Workers
 have the right to associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, and
 openly promote members' interests and views. With the exception of military per-
 sonnel and the police, they also have the right to go on strike. In contrast to 1991,
 when the number of strikes could be counted on one hand, short "warning strikes,"
 often no more than 2 hours in duration, increased dramatically. A strike by the
 maintenance personnel of MALEV, the state airline, lasted several days before a
 settlement was reached.
 A separate law applicable to public sector workers was also passed in 1992. Under
 this law, public servants may negotiate working conditions, but the final decision
 on increasing salaries rests with Parliament.
 The two free trade unions, the Democratic League of Independent Unions (LIGA)
 and the Federation of Workers' Councils, have attracted a combined membership of
 400,000, while the successor to the former monolithic Communist union, MSzOSz,
 has up to 800,000 members.
 There are no restrictions on trade union contacts with international organizations,
 and unions have developed a wide range of ties with European and international
 trade union bodies. In December LIGA and MSzOSz were admitted to the Inter-
 national Confederation of Free Trade Unions, while the Federation of Workers'
 Councils is associated with the World Confederation of Labor.
 The conflict which characterized the trade union movement in 1992 subsided after
 the resolution of the issue of trade union assets formerly owned by Hungary's Com-
 munist-era trade union organization. Since the settlement agreement, labor organi-
 zations have shown a greater willingness to cooperate with one another. This is par-
 
 
 917
 ticularly evident in their relationships in forums such as the National Interest Rec-
 onciliation Council (NIRC), which discusses issues such as the setting of the mini-
 mum wage as well as wage increases. During 1993, six different union federations
 were able to reach a unified position on the minimum wage issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Code permits
 collective bargaining at the enterprise and industry level, and it is practiced in re-
 solving most major labor issues through the NIRC. Minimum wage levels are set
 by the NIRC, a forum for tripartite consultation among re presentatives from the
 employers, employees, and the Government, and highe       (ut not lower ones)
 may be negotiated at the plant level between individual trade unions and manage-
 ment. By agreement, the legal minimum wage is centrally negotiated at the NIRC
 in order to control inflation. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for drafting labor-
 related legislation, while special labor courts enforce labor laws. The decisions of
 these courts may be appealed to the civil court system. Under the new legislation,
 emnloyers are prohibited from discriminating against unions and their organizers.
 here are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, which is enforced by the Ministry of Labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The National Labor Center en-
 forces the minimum age of 16 years, with exceptions for apprentice programs, which
 may begin at 15. There does not appear to be any significant abuse of this statute.
 Education is compulsory through age 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage is established by the
 NLRC and subsequently implemented by Ministry of Labor decree. The National
 Labor Center enforces it. The monthly minimum wage at year's end was the equiva-
 lent of $90 and is insufficient to provide an adequate livin for workers and their
 families. The International Labor Organization (ILO) calculated in February that
 the minimum wage was 70 percent of the minimum necessary for subsistence. Many
 Hungarians, therefore, supplement their primary employment with second jobs. De-
 spite the adoption of new legislation, the ILO's Committee of Experts notes that
 there are many cases of employers, for economic reasons, paying wages that are
 lower than the prescribed rates in the water supply, forestry, and agricultural sec-
 tors.
 The 1992 Labor Code specifies various conditions of employment, including termi-
 nation procedures, severance pay, maternity leave, trade union consultation rights
 in some management decisions, annual and sick leave entitlements, and labor con-
 flict resolution procedures. Under the new Code, the official workday is set at 8
 hours; it may vary, however, depending upon the nature of the industry. A 24-hour
 rest period is required during the week. Labor courts and the Ministry of Labor en-
 force occupational safety standards set by the Government, but specific safety condi-
 tions are not always up to internationally accepted standards. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to con-
 tinued employment.
