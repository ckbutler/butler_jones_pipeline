 tice.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment

 These policies include full consideration for less
 privileged elements of the society. The labor
 movement, a dominant social and political force
 within the country, fully guarantees the rights of
 all workers, a policy backed up by advanced and
 comprehensive public welfare legislation.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Democratic processes exist at all levels, assuring the
 freedom to participate in the political process.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government is open-minded and certainly prepared
 to consider any allegations of human rights violations
 in Denmark by an independent investigative authority,,
 although this is an extremely unlikely eventuality in
 light of Denmark's exemplary human rights record.
 Denmark is party to the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on
 Economic, Social and Cultural Affairs.
