 BARBADOS
 Barbados, a member of the Com mnwealth of Nations, is a constitutional democ-
 cy with a multiparty, parliamentary farm of government. The Queen is Head of
 te and is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister Owen
 Arthur is the Head of Government and governs with an appointed Cabinet.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is chared with maintaining public order. The
 small volunteer Barbados Defence Forc (I3DF), responsible for national security,
 can be employed to maintain public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other spe-
 cific need. The BDF has assisted the police since 1993 by patrolling certain tourist
 areas in response to an increase of crime. On the whole, the police respected con-
 stitutional and legal provisions protecting human rights, but there continued to be
 infrequent reports of incidents of use of excessive force by poalice.
 The economy is based on tourism, services, light manufacturing, and agriculture,
 which makes it vulnerable to external economic developments. Per capita gross do-
 mestic product exceeds $6,000 per year. Barbados has experienced a moderate recov-
 ery after a recession in the ear y 1990's. In 1996 the economy was expected to grow
 at over 4 percent, based primarily on increases in tourism.
 oy a wide range a rights and freedoms, and the Government respects
 contitutiona provisions regarding human rights. Principal human rights problems
 continued to be societal violence against women and children and occasional in-
 stances of excessive use of force by police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, the Caribbean Human Rights Network and the
 local press reported numerous allegations of coerced confessions. There continued to
 be credible reports that law enforcement officials sometimes used force during de-
 tention to extract confessions from detainees.
 Policeprocedures provide that the police may question suspects and other persons
 they hol only at a police station, except when expressly permitted by a senior divi-
 sional officer. An officer must visit detainees at least once every 3 hours to inquire
 about the detainees' condition. After 24 hours, the detaining authority must submit
 a written report to the deputy commissioner. The authorities must approve and
 record all movements of detainees between stations. The Caribbean Human Rights
 Network is satisfied that the authorities generally adhere to these basic principles,
 although officials occasionally used excessive force.
 Barbados is in the forefront of an initiative to standardize police procedures
 throughout the English-speaking Caribbean region. The authorities issued firearms
 to special units and some foot patrols in high-crime areas in response to the 1993
 shooting death of a policeman and a rise in gun-and drug-related crime. Aside from
 this development, the police force is still mainly unarmed, in keeping with its Brit-
 ish traditions.
 The only prison is overcrowded, with over 800 inmates in a structure built for 350
 inmates, and has very antiquated equipment. The Caribbean Human Rights Net-
 work has publicly urged the establishment of a detention and rehabilitation center
 for students and first offenders. The Government reported that it investigated the
 1995 allegation of a gang rape of a young prisoner by other inmates and determined
 it to be without foundation.
 The Government allows private groups to visit prisons to ascertain conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and imprisonment and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. The Government generally respects these provisions in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and attorneys have ready
 access to their clients. The authorities do not use exile as a punishment or means
 of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary acts independently and is free of
 intervention by other branches of government. The Constitution provides that per-
 sons charged with criminal offenses be given a fair public hearing within a reason-
 able time by an independent and impartialcourt, and the Government respects this
 right in practice. The judicial system provides for the right of due process at each
 level. The law presumes defendants innocent until proven guilty. The Government
 
 
 350
 
 provides free legal aid to the indigent with the exception of a 1,000 pounds sterling
 cap on expenses incurred for appeals by death row prisoners to the Privy Council
 in London. Two inmates are suing the Government on the grounds that this limita-
 tion deprives them of their right to due process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires war-
 rants to be issued before privately owned property may be entered and searched.
 The- Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens.
 Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in response to increased
 drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches of homes in certain neighbor-
 hoods, sometimes without warrants. The Government does not censor mail. How-
 ever, the Government restricts the receipt of foreign publications deemed to be por-
 nographic. Other foreign publications of a non-prurient nature are allowed without
 restriction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities respect these rights in practice. There are two
 independent daily newspapers, both of which present opposition political views. The
 Government regularly comes under attack in the newspapers and on daily call-in
 radio programs. There are five radio stations, two of which are owned by the Gov-
 ernment. The Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) television service (the only
 television source, excluding direct satellite reception) is government owned. Though
 CBC is a state enterprise, it regularly reported views opposing government policies.
 Although critics allege that the Government sometimes uses its influence to discour-
 age media reporting on sensitive issues, the press remained vigorously critical of the
 Government on a broad span of issues. The Government prohibits the production
 of pornographic materials.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government observes the
 constitutional provisions for peaceful assembly and private association in practice.
 Political parties, trade unions, and private organizations function and hold meetings
 and rallies without hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados and leave and
 enter the country without restriction.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status. However,
 government practice remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right in law and exercise it in practice. Political parties freely
 compete in fair elections by secret ballot at least every 5 years. In the most recent
 election in September 1994, the Barbados Labour Party won a decisive victory, gain-
 ing a 19-to-8 majority over the Democratic Labour Party. The New Democratic
 Party won one seat, its first ever in Parliament. There are no impediments to par-
 ticipation in the political process, and all citizens over age 18 may vote. The Prime
 Minister exercises executive power along with the Cabinet of Ministers he appoints,
 balanced by the bicameral Parliament and the judicial system.
 Women are well represented at all levels of government and politics. After the
 September 1994 elections, Prime Minister Arthur appointed women to several cabi-
 net-level portfolios. The Deputy Prime Minister is a woman (she also serves concur-
 rently as Foreign Minister), and the Ministries of Health and Education are also
 headed by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local groups involved with human rights operate freely and without Government
 hindrance. The Caribbean Human Rights Network, a Caribbean-wide human rights
 organization which has its headquarters and a small staff in Barbados, investigates
 and reports on allegations of human rights violations throughout the region.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law, regardless of race,
 religion, or sex. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 Women.-Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and are well-
 represented at all levels of both the public and private sectors. They form a large
 percentage of heads of household and are not discriminated against in public hous-
 ing or other social welfare programs. However, violence ag ains women and children
 continued to be a significant social problem. Women's rights groups reported that
 the known incidence of sexual assaults, domestic violence, incest, and rape in-
 creased, despite the fact that there is still some reluctance on the ]part of victims
 to report such incidents. There are public and private counseling services for domes-
 tic violence, rape, suicide, and child abuse.
 The 1992 Domestic Violence Law specifies the appropriate police response to do-
 mestic violence, intended to protect all members of the family, including men and
 children. It applies equally to marriages and to common law relationships. Criminal
 penalties for violent crimes are the same, regardless of the sex of the offender or
 the victim. The courts heard a number of cases of domestic violence against women
 involving assault or wounding. Victims may request restraining orders, which the
 courts often issue. The courts can sentence an offender to jail for breaching such
 an order. Human rights monitors continued to criticize the inconsistency in sentenc-
 ing for rape incest and statutory rape, which is often left to the discretion of the
 judge. They noted that the lack of sentencing uidelines resulted in longer sentences
 for persons convicted of petty theft than for incest; and lesser sentences for incest
 than for rape or sexual assault of nonfamily members.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's human rights and welfare
 although violence against children remains a serious problem. The Child Care Board
 is the key agency responsible for monitoring and responding to the critical welfare
 needs, interests and rights of children.
 People With bisabilities.-The law does not prohibit discrimination against the
 physically disabled in employment, education, or the provision of other state serv-
 ices. The Labour Department, which is responsible for finding jobs for the disabled,
 unsuccessfully advocated the introduction of such legislation in the 1980's. Simi-
 larly, there is no legislation mandating provision of accessibility to public thorough-
 fares or public or private building. Interest groups have lobbied for this type of leg:
 islation from time to time, but without success.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers freely exercise their right to form and be-
 long to trade unions and to strike. There are two major unions and several smaller
 ones, representing various sectors of labor. The public service union, the National
 Union of Public Workers, is independent of any political party or the Government.
 The largest union, the Barbados Workers' Union (BWU), was historically closely as-
 sociated with the Barbados Labour Party prior to 1954. After 1954, officers of the
 BWU became personally associated with the Democratic Labour Party.
 The law accords full protection to trade unionists' personal and property rights.
 Another law prohibits strikes against public utilities. All private and public sector
 employees are permitted to strike, but essential workers may strike only under cer-
 tain circumstances and after following prescribed procedures. There were no major
 strikes or long-term work stoppages, except for a strike in July by junior doctors
 at the main hospital that disrupted clinical services for 1 week.
 Trade unions are free to form federations and are in fact affiliated with a variety
 of regional and international labor organizations. The Caribbean Congress of Labor
 has its headquarters in Barbados. A new Congress of Trade Unions and Staff Asso-
 ciations was inaugurated in August 1995. Most unions belong to this organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and authorities respected it in practice. Recent
 losses of jobs in the economy resulted in a reduction in union membership to about
 20 percent of the working population. Normally, wages and working conditions are
 negotiated through the collective bargaining process, but a tripartite prices and in-
 comes policy accord signed in the summer of 1993 established a 2-year wage freeze.
 The revised (second) protocol makes provision for negotiated increases in basic
 wages and increases based on productivity. The new accord covers 1995-1997, and
 was noted by Parliament on January 16.
 Employers have no legal obligation to recognize unions under the Trade Union Act
 of 1964, but most do so when a majority of their employees signify a desire to be
 represented by a registered union. While there is no specific law prohibiting
 antiunion discrimination, the courts provide a method of redress for employees al-
 
 
 leging unfair dismissal. The courts commonly award monetary compensation but
 rarely order reemployment.
 There are no manufacturing or spe ial areas where collective bargaining rights
 are legally or administratively impaired. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no reports of its use.
 d. Minimum Age or Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 of 16 is generally observed. Compulsory primary and secondary education policies,
 which require school attendance until age 16, reinforce minimum age requirements.
 The Labour Department has a small cadre of labor inspectors who conduct spot in-
 vestigations of enterprises and check records to verify compliance with the law.
 These inspectors may take legal action against an employer who is found to have
 underage workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets and the authorities establish min-
 imum wages for specified categories of workers. Only two categories of workers have
 a formally regulated minimum wage-household domestics and shop assistants
 (entry level commercial workers). Household domestics receive a minimum wage of
 about $32.50 (bds $65.00) per week, although in actual labor market conditions, the
 prevailing wage is almost double that amount. There are two age-related minimum
 wage categories for shop assistants. The adult minimum wage for shop assistants
 is $1.87 (bds $3.75) per hour, the juvenile minimum wage or shop assistants is
 $1.62 (bds $3.25) per hour. There is a minimum wage in place for workers (for ex-
 ample, sugar plantation workers) but the wage actually paid is a negotiated rate
 much higher than the legislated rate. This is a matter of practice but not of law.
 The minimum wage for shop assistants is marginally sufficient to meet minimum
 living standards; most employees earn more. In 1992 an International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) cited Barbados for not adhering to the
 ILO convention on equal remuneration in its wage differentials in the sugar indus-
 try. The COE admoms hed the Government to ensure the application of the principle
 of equal remuneration for work of equal value to male an   emale workers in the
 sugar industry or to provide further information on job descriptions which might
 justify such wage distinction. This case was not resolved by year's end.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and the law requires overtime
 payment for hours worked in excess. Barbados accepts ILO conventions, standards,
 and other sectoral conventions regarding maximum hours of work. However, there
 is no general legislation that covers all occupations. Employers must provide work-
 ers a minimum of 3 weeks' annual leave. Unemployment benefits and national in-
 surance (social security) cover all workers. A comprehensive, government-sponsored
 health program offers subsidized treatment and medication.
 The Factories Act of 1983 sets out the officially recognized occupational safety and
 health standards. The Labour Department enforces health and safety standards and
 follows up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by management. The Fac-
 tories Act requires that in certain sectors firms employing more than 50 workers
 set up a safety committee. This committee can challenge the decisions of manage-
 ment concerning the occupational safety and health environment. Trade unions
 have called on the Government to increase the number of factory inspectors in order
 to enforce existing and proposed safety and health legislation more effectively, and
 to follow up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by management. Govern-
 ment-operated corporations in particular were accused of doing a "poor job" in
 health and safety. The Government has promised to undertake inspections of gov-
 ernment-operated corporations and manufacturing plants as a priority. Workers
 have a limited right to remove themselves from dangerous or hazardous job situa-
 tions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
