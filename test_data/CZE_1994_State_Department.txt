 CZECH REPUBLIC
 The Czech Republic came into existence on January 1, 1993, when the Czech and
 Slovak Federal Republic dissolved and its constituent republics became independ-
 ent. It is aparliamentary democracy. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and his Civic
 Democratic Party lead the coalition Government. The Czech Republic has essentially
 completed the reform of political and economic structures initiated after the 1989
 revolution.
 The Ministry of the Interior oversees the police. The Internal Security Service
 (BIS) is independent of ministry control, but reports to Parliament and the Prime
 Ministers office. Foreign intelligence is under the authority of the Interior Ministry.
 Military intelligence agencies are integrated into the Ministry of Defense. Police and
 BIS authorities observe constitutional and legal protection of individual rights in
 carrying out their responsibilities.
 Pursuing a consistent policy of transforming the former centrally planned econ-
 omy, the Government had privatized some 80 percent of the economy by year's end.
 The nation experienced moderate economic growth in 1994, and macroeconomic indi-
 
 
 794
 cators (balanced budget, low inflation and unemployment, current account surplus)
 were favorable.
 The most important human rights roblem is opular prejudice against the Roma
 minority, and the inability (or unw     ess) o the Government to counteract it.
 The Citizenship Law, whose provisions limited the access of many Roma residents
 to Czech citizenship after midyear, is the most celebrated example of such discrimi-
 nation. Roma have also been victims of "skinhead" violence. Other human rights
 problems include the Law on Lustration (screening) which forbids certain Com-
 munist secret police collaborators from holding high public office, and the law crim-
 inalizing defamation of the State or the Presidency. Women's issues, including vio-
 lence against women, are still rarely raised in mainstream political debate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial lling.--There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Czech Republic assumed Czechoslo-
 vak laws governing arrest and related rights. Courts issue arrest warrants. The au-
 thorities ma hold persons without charge for 24 hours, during which time they
 have the right to counsel. There were no instances of incommunicado detention or
 preventive detention. A person charged with a crime has the right to appear before
 a judge for arraignment. At arraignment, if the prosecution files charges, the judge
 determines whether bail will be granted pending trial The law does not allow bail
 for certain serious crimes. Pretrial detention may not exceed 1 year, and in such
 cases monthiy appearances before a judge are required. Counsel and family visits
 ae permitted.
 There have been occasional reports of police shakedowns and anecdotal stories of
 physical abuse and malfeasance, often directed at foreigners. According to press re-
 ports, police killed five persons not in detention, including two separate cases in
 which they shot and killed German tourists in roadside altercations, but the courts
 have not yet judged these cases.
 The law prohibits forced exile, and the Government does not practice it.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system consists of district, regional, and
 high courts. The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal. In addition a Con-
 stitutional Court rules separately on the constitutionality of legislation. ilitary
 courts, which have ursdiction over poie, intelligence, and military matters, were
 abolished at the end of 1993, and civil courts took over their functions.
 The judiciary is impartial and independent. Judges are not fired or transferred
 for political reasons. Justice Ministry officials and press observers noted that the
 shortage of qualified judges (a problem under the Czechoslovak federation) is slowly
 being overcome.
 The law stipulates that persons charged with criminal offenses are entitled to fair
 and open public trials. They have the right to be informed of their legal rights, of
 the charges against them, to consult with counsel, and to present a defense. The
 State provides lawyers for indigent defendants. Defendants enjoy the presumption
 of innocence and have the right to refuse to testify against themselves. Defendants
 may appeal any judgments against them. These rights am observed in practice.
 Foreign and domestic human rights groups expressed concern about the continued
 existence of the 1991 Lustration Law, which bars former Communist officials, mem-
 bers of the People's Militia, secret police, and collaborators from holding a wide
 range of elected and appointed positions for a period of 5 years. The law is rarely
 enforced. Although the Czechoslovak Federal Constitutional Court in 1992 elimi-
 nated the largest category from the Law, those listed as collaborators but who may
 only have been intelligence targets, observers continued to criticize it in principle
 for embracing employment discrimination and the concept of collective guilt. In per-
 haps the most celebrated lustration case, the Government in September dropped
 lustration charges against former federal parliamentarian Jan Kavan. News reports
 indicated that nearly all those who challenged lustration judgments in court cleared
 their names.
 Although a 1993 law defining the pre-1989 Communist regime as criminal and
 lifting the statute of limitations for crimes committed by the Communist Party of
 Czechoslovakia during its 40-year rule remained on the books, the Government rare-
 ly invoked it. Human rights monitors criticized this law, too, for adopting the prin-
 
 
 795
 ciple of collective guilt. However, the Constitutional Court in December 1993 upheld
 the law.
 There were no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Conrespondence.-Elec-
 tronic surveillance, telephone tapping, and interception of mail require a court
 order, and the Government complies with this requirement. There were no known
 cases of electronic surveillance reported in 1994. There were no reports of arbitrary
 or unlawful interference with privacy.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Czech law provides for freedom of speech and
 the press, and the Government generally respects these rights. Individuals may, and
 do, speak out on political and other issues and freely criticize the Government and
 public figures. However, the Constitutional Court in December 1993 upheld a provi-
 sion in the Criminal Code forbidding "defamation" of the State and the Presidency.
 The law was not a p pied at any time in 1994, but represents a potential restriction
 of freedom of speech and press.
 A wide variety of newspapers, magazines, and journals publish without govern-
 ment restriction or interference. The Civic Democratic Party (ODS)-the leading
 party in the ruling coalition-became embroiled in controversy in September when
 the editor of the nominally independent Denni Telegraf was dismissed by the pa-
 per's board, which said it had lost confidence in him. Other newspapers claimed that
 the firing took place on the Prime Minister's orders, noting that the editor and sev-
 eral board members were ODS members. The Prime Minister denied any role in the
 dismissal.
 The electronic media are independent and free of censorship. Most television and
 radio stations are publicly funded and independently managed. The Television and
 Radio Council oversees these stations under parliamentary supervision. A leading
 television channel, Nova, is privately owned, partially by foreign investors.
 The law provides for academic freedom but also forbids activities by established
 political parties at universities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of persons to assemble peacefully. Some public demonstrations require permits, but
 the Government rarely refuses to issue them. Police generally do not interfere with
 spontaneous peaceful demonstrations for which organizers lack a permit.
 Nonetheless, domestic press editorials sometimes criticized police behavior. In a
 July  commemoration    held  at the former     concentration  camp   of Terezin
 (Theresienstadt), witnesses said that police stood by or even encouraged rightists
 who objected to the idea of reconciliation with Sudeten Germans transferred to Ger-
 many after the Second World War. The rightists disrupted the ceremony and de-
 stroyed wreaths and other property. The authorities fired five district police chiefs
 after this incident.
 The law provides for the right of persons to associate freely and to form political
 parties and movements, and this law is respected in practice. The Interior Ministry
 or local officials register organizations, associations, foundations, and political par-
 ties, but this procedure is routine. The Communist Party is represented in Par-
 liament and in local government and continues to own considerable assets through-
 out the Republic.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom ofMovement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict domestic or foreign travel, emigra-
 tion, or repatriation.
 Refugees and asylum seekers are treated according to international norms and
 are not forcibly repatriated. Most migrants use the Czech Republic as a transit
 route to the West. The law outlines lengthy procedures for granting refugee status
 and eventual citizenship, but very few of those who make applications remain in the
 country long enough to complete the procedure.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government by democratic means. Those
 over the age of 18 are eligible to vote by secret ballot in nationwide and local elec-
 tions. Opposition groups, including political parties, function openly and participate
 withouthindrance in the political process.
 The Constitution mandates parliamentary elections at least every 4 ears, based
 on proportional representation within eight large electoral districts. There is a 5-
 percent threshold for parties to enter Parliament. The President is elected by Par-
 
 
 796
 liament for a 5-year term. He has limited constitutional powers but may use a sus-
 pensive veto to return legislation to Parliament, which has the right to override the
 President's veto.
 The Constitution also calls for an upper house of Parliament, the Senate, which
 in 1994 had yet to be constituted; the first senatorial election may take place in
 1996, although legislation defining its procedures remains to be adopted. As long as
 no Senate is created, the Czech Republic's parliamentary system could be open to
 accusations of operating extraconstitutionally.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on women's participation in poli-
 tics. However, they appear to participate less in politics and government since the
 overthrow of the Commun      regime, which used quotas to include women in large
 governing bodies such as the Fed    Assembly.
 Relatively few women hold high public office in the Czech Republic, though 19 of
 200 parliamentary deputies are women. In the November local elections, voters
 elected a woman mayor of Brno, the Republic's second largest city, and women serve
 on both the Supreme and Constitutional courts. Women achieve the same edu-
 cational level as men and attend institutions of higher education in roughly equal
 numbers.
 The country's two significant minorities-Roma and Slovaks-are not represented
 in Czech politics. No minority leader holds significant elective office at the national
 level. The estimated 300,000 Slovaks are primarily "Czechoslovaks" who elected to
 live in the Czech Republic after the split, and who largely define their interests in
 the context of Czech politics rather than along ethnic lines. Many serve in high posi-
 tions in the civil service.
 Not all the estimated 200,000 Roma have integrated into Czech society, and the
 party that represented their interests immediately following the demise of com-
 munism, the Roma Civic Initiative, is in disarray. Other local Rema political
 groupings have not gained national prominence although they continue to strength-
 en their ties with international Rema groups. he political culture of the Czech Re-
 public generally defines Rema as outsiders, and the Rema themselves have been un-
 able to unite behind a program or set of principles that would allow them to rep-
 resent their interests within the country's democratic structures (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government encourages the activities of domestic and international human
 rights organizations. The presidency of former dissident and human rights monitor
 Vaclav Havel serves as an important symbol for these groups, which work without
 government restriction or interference. Government officials generally cooperate
 with official and unofficial visits by foreign human rights monitors.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for the equality of citizens and prohibits discrimination, and the
 Government respects this law. In practice, Roma face discrimination in such areas
 as education, housing, and job opportunity.
 Women.-The law provi      for equality for women, and they receive pay equal to
 that of male colleagues for the same job, although the median wages for women in
 1994 lagged significantly behind those of men. Women appear to be concentrated in
 professions in which the median salary is generally low: medicine, teaching, and
 white-collar clerical jobs.
 Violence against women does exist, but public debate about the problem is rare,
 despite the efforts of a handful of women's groups to bring this and other issues to
 the attention of the public. According to 1993-94 police statistics, 12 percent of
 Czech women over the age of 15 have experienced some sort of sexual assault, and
 only 3 of every 100 women raped report the crime. Gender studies experts say that
 women are ashamed to speak about rape and that the police are not equipped, ei-
 ther by attitude or training to help. Police and human rights groups sometimes link
 violence toward women wth economic hardship and excessive drinking but without
 concrete substantiation. Human rights groups acknowledge that the Government ef-
 fectively enforces laws against violence.
 A more public issue--and one that has gained considerable attention in the
 press-is the growth of prostitution, which has become increasingly visible. For the
 most part, prostitutes are in business for themselves, but police report that under-
 ground elements, often also involved in smuggling and petty crime, coerce some
 women into prostitution. The law does not explicitly protect prostitutes against traf-
 ficking and sexual exploitation.
 
 
 797
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through prorams
 for health care, compulsory education, and basic nutrition. However, some Roma
 children do not receive these benefits owing to the Government's inability to coun-
 teract cultural differences and instances of social prejudice. Child abuse as a social
 problem received growing attention in the press. According to the Ministry of Jus-
 tice, courts judged 164 cases of child abuse in the first 6 months of 1994. An inde-
 pendent organization claims that 50 Czech children die at the hands of their parents
 each year, but this number could not be confirmed.
 National Racial Ethni Minorities.-The Roma population, estimated at abut
 200,000, is the most significant minority. Roma live throughout the country but are
 concentrated in the industrial towns of Norer Bohemia, where many of them set-
 tled more than 40 years ago in the homes of Sudeten Germans transferred to the
 West. They suffer disproportionately from poverty, crime, and disease. Efforts by
 foundations and government education and health wore    s to improve their living
 conditions, especially the conditions of Roma children, have had only minimal im-
 pact. Efforts by local leaders to mobilize local Roma communities, especially in the
 north, generally have failed.
 Roma suffer from serious popular prejudice and from discrimination, particularly
 in employment, housing, and everyday life. The central authorities have intervened
 to eliminate overt discrimination by loca  dictions; for example, the Constitu-
 tional Court invalidated the anti-loma decrees adopted in 1992 by the Jirkov
 (northern Bohemia) town council.
 Local authorities have been unable (or, according to some Roma, unwilling) to
 curb skinhead intimidation and violence against Roma. In December perpetrators
 accused of anti-Roma violence were acquitted by a court in Pisek, and the next day
 skinhead assailants attacked Roma there. The Government has denounced such vio-
 lence, but has failed to prevent it. Human rights organizations and articles in the
 Czech press accuse the Government of serious neglect in this area.
 International legal and human rights organizations and Roma activists strongly
 criticized the discriminatory impact on Roma of the 1992 citizenship law, which re-
 quired Czechoslovaks living on the territory of the Czech Republic to apply for citi-
 zenship by June 30, 1994. Slovaks had to prove they had a clean criminal record
 over the previous 5 years and had lived in the territory of the Czech Republic for
 2 years. Czechs were automatically granted citizenship. Because the majority of
 Roma were considered Slovaks, based on a 1969 Communist law, the Czech citizen-
 ship requirements have had a disproportionate impact on them. No accurate esti.
 mates are available on the number of Roma who were unable to obtain Czech citi-
 zenship; Roma activists and human rights groups cite figures in the tens of thou-
 sands. No deportations or large-scale refugee migrations have been documented as
 a result of the law, and Czech authorities note that those who fail to obtain citizen-
 ship are granted permanent resident status and can receive state benefits. But they
 are also -denied the right to vote or serve in the government, the military, police,
 or the judiciary. The Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe has criti-
 cized this law as contrary to human rights norms, noting that it is inconsistent with
 Article 11(2) of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 Religious Minorities.-The Jewish community numbers only a few thousand.
 There were, however, isolated instances of public anti-Semitism. For example, in
 April, 24 graves in a Jewish cemetery in the Moravian town of Prerov were defied
 with Nazi markings  in June the far-right Republican Party called the new Culture
 Minister, who is of.Jewish background, the "Jewish destroyer of Czech culture," for
 which the media roundly condemned the Republicans.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not place a high priority on en-
 suring access for the disabled, nor has discrimination against the disabled been the
 subject of significant policy or public debate. The law does not mandate accessibility
 to public buildings and services for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to form and
 join unions of their own choosing without prior authorization, and the Government
 respects this right. For example, after trade union leaders prtested a law drafted
 by the Government that would have forbidden civil service workers from joining
 unions, claiming that such a law violated not only International Labor Organization
 statutes but the Czech Constitution as well, the Government withdrew the proposal.
 More than 50 percent of the work force is unionized, although the number of work-
 ers who are members of labor organizations continued to fall steadily.
 Most workers are members of unions afflited with the Czech-Moravian Chamber
 of Trade Unions (CMKOS). CMKOS is a democratically oriented, nationwide um-
 
 
 798
 brella organization for branch unions. It is not affiliated with any political party and
 carefully maintains its independence.
 The law provides workers with the right to strike, except for those in specific pro-
 fessions whose role in public order or public safety is deemed crucial e g judges,
 prosecutors, members of the armed forces and the police, air traffic controilers, nu-
 clear power station workers, workers with nuclear materials, and oil or gas pipeline
 workers. The law also places some limitation on the right to strike of firefighters,
 rescue workers, telecommunications workers, and health workers. The law requires
 that labor disputes be subject first to mediation and that strikes take place only
 after mediation efforts fail. There were no major strikes in 1994.
 Czech unions are free to form or join federations and confederations and affiliate
 with and participate in international bodies. This freedom is fully exercised.
 b. The Rght to Organize and Bargain Collecti ely.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargainng. The  sic colleve be bargaining instrument is the Law on Collective
 . It is carried out in a tripartite system, a voluntary arrangement in
 which representatives of unions, government, and employers set the guidelines for
 labor relations. Union leaders complained repeatedly tst the Government intended
 to sabotage the tripartite arrangement, and the Government stated repeatedy that
 the tripartite steering process had outlived its usefulness. Despite such com-
 plaints, wages were set in free negotiations, although the Government imposed an
 upper limit on wage growth (levying penalties on  gation  increases).
 Union leaders may file charges of antiunion discrimination in court. Union and
 Labor Ministry officials reported that no such charges were ified in 1994.
 The Czech Rpublic has one export processing zone. Its workers have and practice
 the same rigts to organize and bargain collectively as other workers in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Foreed or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohi~bits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d    e Minimum Age for Employmentof Children.-The Labor Code stipulates a mini-
 mum working age of 15 years, although children who complete courses at special
 schools (i.e., schools for the severely disabled) may work at the age of 14. There are
 no legal limits on the hours children may work, although they may not work at
 night.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage stand-
 ards at roughly one-fourth of the average monthly wage. The current minimum
 wage is about $75 per month. This provides an adequate, if sparse, standard of liv-
 ing for an individual worker and, when combined with allowances available to fami-
 lies with children, provides an adeqate standard of living for a worker and a fam-
 ily. Major efforts at worker retraining, carried out by district labor offices, seek to
 provide labor mobility for those at the lower end of the wage scale. The Ministry
 of Labor has the authority to enforce minimum wage standards and does so, as
 needed.
 The law mandates a standard workweek of 42  hours. It also requires paid rest
 of at least 30 minutes during the standard 8- to 8n-hour workday, as wei as an-
 nual leave of 3 to 4 weeks. Overtime may not exceed 150 hours per year or 8 hours
 per week as standard practice. The Labor Ministry enforces overtime regulations
 but reports that the rapid growth of the private sector, especially in small service
 enterprises, makes it very difficult to assess abuses and enforce the law.
 Health and safety conditions in some sectors of heavy industry remain sub-
 standard, especially in those sectors awaiting the process of privatization, but indus-
 trial accident rates are not unusually high. The Ofce of Labor Safety is responsible
 for enforcement of health and safety standards and carries out its responsibilities
 effectively.
