 BURKINA FASO
 Burkina Paso, one of the poorest countries in the world, is a
 victim of frequent drought and political instability. In
 August 1983, Captain Thomas Sankara took power as President of
 Burkina Faso and of the National Council of the Revolution
 (CNR), Burkina's main forum for political decisions, in the
 country's third military coup since 1980. No political party
 activities have been permitted since 1980, and there are no
 indications that the country will return to constitutional
 rule. Instead, the Government uses a network of Committees
 for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), organized at national,
 regional, and local levels, to mobilize the population and
 promote its revolutionary goals.
 Burkina Faso is overwhelmingly tied to subsistence agriculture,
 with 90 percent of the population living in rural areas. The
 economy is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall.
 Drought, lack of communications and other infrastructure, a
 low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding
 problems.
 There was improvement in the human rights situation in Burkina
 Faso in 1986, and the Government amnestied all prominent
 political detainees. The confrontation between the Government
 and labor eased.   However, arbitrary arrests and brief
 detentions without charges or trial of potential political
 opponents continued, albeit in diminished numbers. Trials of
 businessmen and civil servants continued, almost exclusively
 on fraud and corruption charges, outside the traditional
 judicial system in People's Revolutionary Courts where
 defendants had no recourse to legal counsel. Civil servants,
 military, and police accused of lack of enthusiasm for the
 revolution continued to be dismissed for reasons ranging from
 misconduct to laziness, although in lesser numbers than during
 1984 and 1985.
 Mali and Burkina Faso fought a 5-day border war in late
 December 1985 over the long disputed Agacher strip, potentially
 rich in mineral resources. Tensions between the two countries
 remain high, but a ruling from the International Court of
 Justice at the end of 1986 won praise from both countries,
 which have publicly vowed to abide by it. Prisoners from the
 December border war have been repatriated.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of torture in 1986, but there were
 several allegations of degrading treatment of detainees.
 Anonymous tracts alleged that certain students, trade union
 members, and teachers had been detained without charge and
 manhandled by security authorities.

 BURKINA FASO
 Prison conditions are poor, in part because of the material
 poverty of the country.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Reports of arbitrary arrest, followed by detention for several
 days without charge, continued in 1986. In many cases, these
 appear to have been initiated by poorly trained CDR security
 patrols. The law permits preventive detention without charge
 for a maximum of 72 hours, renewable for a single 72-hour
 period in criminal cases. This law is generally followed in
 practice but with frequent exceptions for both Burkinabe and
 foreign nationals, especially in political cases. In cases of
 emergency or national security the military code overrides the
 civil code. Military code procedures provide for continued
 detention beyond 72 hours. For example, at least two suspects
 in a June 1985 ammunition dump explosion case were imprisoned
 for over I year without trial.
 On August 4, Burkina Faso's national day, President Sankara
 amnestied all remaining suspects in the June 1985 incident
 plus a number of former ministers. Several prominent
 political personalities such as former President Colonel Saye
 Terbo, however, remained under a loose form of house arrest.
 Paul Rouamba, former ambassador to the U.S. and Ghana, remained
 imprisoned.
 Several prominent intellectuals, military officers, and former
 government officials remained in self-imposed exile. Several
 times during late 1985 and in 1986, President Sankara publicly
 appealed to all exiles to return home, promising a place for
 them in Burkina Faso's struggle for economic development.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the labor code and
 is not known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During 1986 the people's revolutionary courts, created in late
 1983 with jurisdiction over state security and political
 crimes, heard cases involving primarily public corruption.
 The court president is a magistrate appointed by the Government
 to head the tribunal which is composed of magistrates, military
 personnel, and members of the Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution. The court president asks questions directly of the
 defendant. There is no role for a public prosecutor, and the
 accused has no right to consult counsel during the session.
 Witnesses can be called by the court, or they can present
 themselves to give testimony. In 1986 these courts were used
 extensively but only in corruption and embezzlement cases.
 President Sankara has said these people's courts should be
 viewed as a permanent part of the country's judicial system,
 and the Government is considering an expansion of such courts.
 The Government has already organized a series of similar
 tribunals to hear minor cases at the village, department, and
 province levels. Most of the judges in these courts are
 popularly elected. The Government's oft-stated aim in
 establishing these "popular" courts is to ensure fair access
 to justice for an overwhelmingly illiterate, impoverished
 population.
 Meanwhile, the regular judiciary, patterned after the French
 system, has continued to function for criminal and civil cases.
 Defendants traditionally receive a fair trial and are
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 represented by counsel. However, the fact that some of those
 amnestied in 1986 were never tried, and most were sentenced on
 corruption charges by the people's revolutionary courts,
 illustrates the unlikelihood of a political detainee ever
 being brought to trial in the French-based legal system.
 Under the Government's reorganization program, the regular
 judiciary will likely be limited to responsibility for
 business and commercial law. The people's revolutionary
 courts will probably expand their competence in political and
 criminal cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government authorities are not known to interfere in the
 privacy, family, home, or correspondence of ordinary citizens.
 Homes may be searched only under authority of a warrant issued
 by the Attorney General, a procedure generally followed in
 practice. There is no regular monitoring of private
 correspondence or telephones. However, in national security
 cases a special law permits surveillance and search of homes
 and persons and monitoring of telephones and correspondence
 without a warrant. This law has been used against individuals
 suspected of participation in coup plots.
 The Government encourages participation in the Committees for
 the Defense of the Revolution (CDR). While there is little
 discrimination against those who choose not to become
 involved, vigorous participation in CDR activities helps in
 obtaining civil service appointments and promotions. The
 Government considers opposition to activities of the CDR's to
 be political opposition, which can lead in serious cases to
 such measures as discharge from the civil service.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While there is no formal government censorship, the high pitch
 of revolutionary rhetoric, with its frequent references to
 enemies of the state at home and abroad, inhibits both
 government-employed journalists and ordinary citizens from
 taking advantage of their theoretical right to express critical
 views. The same inhibition, further stimulated by some sudden
 dismissals from government service and by reports of arbitrary
 arrest, continued to dampen a lively tradition of debate on
 political topics. University professors and administrators
 have been criticized for "elitism" and dismissed for alleged
 counterrevolutionary tendencies, although others have expressed
 critical views without government retaliation. University
 students are now subject to political education.
 Under the control of the Minister of Information, the media,
 which consist of a daily and a weekly newspaper, two weekly
 magazines, and a government-operated radio/television station,
 are almost entirely government owned.  There is no serious
 criticism of the Government in the media, which are charged
 with carrying official news to the people while defending the
 revolution. There are occasional government-authorized
 criticisms made of the performance of individual officials.
 Something approaching political criticism is found in a new
 satirical weekly, run by the Government itself, which
 concentrates on relatively harmless foibles of political
 leaders, including the President. Foreign newspapers and
 magazines continue to enter the country freely. Foreign
 
 
 28
 BURKINA FASO
 journalists travel and file stories without censorship or
 hindrance and enjoy easy access to government officials.
 In the arts, movies are subject to censorship by a review
 board which includes religious authorities as well as
 government officials. During 1986 a wide variety of American,
 French and other foreign films were shown. In 1986 there were
 no instances of political censorship of movies. There is no
 interference with international radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned and administrative permission is
 generally required for assemblies of any kind. Nonpolitical
 associations for business, religious, cultural, sporting, and
 other purposes are allowed and experience no difficulty in
 obtaining permission to meet.
 Organized labor continues to be an important force in Burkina.
 There are four labor federations--of which the largest is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. There are also a number of autonomous unions. The
 federations take turns representing organized labor at the
 International Labor Organization meetings and participate in
 African regional labor meetings as well.
 Unions have the right to bargain for increased wages and other
 benefits within a specific bargaining unit such as a company
 or factory. They represent the interests of their members in
 the private and public sectors, as well as before the labor
 inspection service of the Government and before the courts.
 All unions jealously guard their independence from the
 Government. Organized labor has the formal right to strike,
 but the present Government has greatly restricted this right
 in practice.
 The 1985 confrontation between the Government and labor eased
 in 1986. There were no known suspensions from public
 employment of union leaders, as occurred in previous years.
 A prominent Marxist trade union leader, Soumane Toure, was
 released from detention on October 2, leaving no known trade
 union leaders in prison. There were no indications that
 existing labor organizations would be brought under government
 control or replaced by a national labor federation.
 Jurisdictional conflicts with the CDR's diminished. President
 Sankara indicated he wishes to maintain a dialog with all
 Burkinabe trade unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burkina Faso is a secular state, and there is no discrimination
 discrimination on religious grounds. Islam and Christianity
 exist side by side, with about 25 percent of the population
 being Muslim and 10 percent Christian. The remainder practices
 traditional religions. Both Muslim and Christian holidays are
 recognized as national holidays. Social mobility and access
 to modern sector jobs are neither linked to, nor restricted
 by, religious affiliations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travelers within Burkina Faso are often stopped at police,
 army, and internal customs checkpoints. Moreover, armed CDR
 units maintain checkpoints between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.,
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 though these checks diminished in frequency during 1986.
 Foreign travel for business and tourism is not restricted.
 Exit permits, once used to limit movements of workers to
 neighboring countries, particularly to the Cote d'Ivoire where
 1 million or more Burkinabe continue to reside and work, are
 no longer required. Refugees are accepted freely in Burkina
 Faso and attempts are made to provide for their care in
 cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees. The Government cooperated with the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in allowing ICRC visits to
 prisoners of war following the 5-day war with Mali and in
 facilitating emergency assistance to some 4,000 displaced
 persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Supported by the military, President Thomas Sankara rules in
 the name of the National Council of the Revolution (CNR), the
 composition of which has never been disclosed. There is
 neither a legislative body nor any recognized political
 opposition group. In consultation with the CNR, Sankara
 appoints his Cabinet, which currently consists of 23 posts, 4
 held by military personnel and the rest by civilians,
 including 5 women. The Government has not given any hint of
 plans for elections or for a return to constitutional
 government.
 In November 1985, the CNR created a hierarchy of commissions
 bringing together CDR officials, government ministry
 authorities, and provincial authorities culminating in a
 special commission chaired by the President himself that first
 met in September 1986. These commissions are apparently
 intended to ascertain what the population needs and to guide
 the administration in providing it. They are only beginning
 to function; their political role is not yet clear. The
 Government is the largest employer and uses its control over
 jobs to ensure political support. The number of dismissals on
 political grounds was significantly lower in 1986 than in 1985.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A government-supported organization lobbies against the South
 African apartheid system and other racial oppression, but it
 makes no effort to look into domestic human rights issues or
 foreign practices other than racial discrimination. The
 Government has made no attempt to hinder the activities of
 international human rights organizations. It denied reports
 by Amnesty International in its 1986 Report (covering 1985)
 which stated that several alleged political opponents of the
 Government had reportedly been severely tortured, including by
 electrical shocks, and that one person may have died as a
 result of this torture.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority ethnic groups are as likely to be represented in the
 inner circles of the Government as are the dominant Mossi, who
 comprise 50 percent of the population. Government decisions
 do not favor one ethnic group over another. One announced
 reason for the increase in administrative regions from
 
 
 30
 BURKINA FASO
 11 to 30 since the August 1983 coup was to improve access of
 minority groups to local administrative authorities.
 The role of women in Burkina Faso is still limited by the
 cultural orientation of a rural African society. For example,
 male children attending school outnumber female children by
 about two to one. The Government has emphasized its strong
 commitment to expanding opportunities for women, including
 educational opportunities. The Ministry of Family Progress
 plays a leading role in promoting greater participation by
 women in the nation's economic, social, and political life.
 In addition to the five women ministers in the current
 Cabinet, women have been appointed high commissioners in
 several provinces, and women have been named as magistrates in
 the judicial system.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The labor code sets the minimum age for employment at 14, the
 average age for completion of basic secondary school.
 However, the Government lacks the means to enforce this
 provision adequately, owing to the large number of small
 family subsistence farms, and the traditional apprenticeship
 system. A minimum monthly wage of about $75 and a maximum
 work week of 48 hours are stipulated by the labor code, as are
 safety and health provisions within the capabilities of the
 country's relatively small nonagricultural sector. A system
 of government inspections and labor courts ensures that these
 provisions are applied in the industrial and commercial
 sectors, but they have been impossible to enforce in the
 dominant subsistence agriculture sector.
