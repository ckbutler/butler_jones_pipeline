 ESTONIA*
 Estonia was an independent state between the two World Wars
 but was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as a constituent
 republic of the U.S.S.R. The United States does not recognize
 the forcible incorporation of Estonia into the U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Estonia is subjected to the same
 centralized rule, the same Constitution and judicial system,
 and the same restrictions on civil and political liberties as
 the republics of the Soviet Union. As implemented in other
 republics, Soviet policy stresses gradual Russification and a
 concomitant erosion of native Estonian culture and values.
 Because of a low birthrate and an official settlement policy
 that has resulted in an influx of Slavic, primarily Russian,
 settlers in the recent past, Estonians make up only 63 percent
 of the total population as compared to 92 percent in 1939.
 The standard of living in Estonia is higher than the Soviet
 average, but the margin is shrinking. Estonians maintain that
 too much of the national income they generate is transferred
 to other republics, and they complain of the declining
 quantity and quality of food supplies and consumer goods.
 Expressions of Estonian nationalist and religious sentiment
 are harshly repressed by the Soviet authorities. During 1986
 this repression led to serious human rights violations,
 including harassment of those who attempted to publicize those
 violations. All activists are under the threat of punishment
 by incarceration for their activities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although Estonian activists have on occasion died in Soviet
 custody, it is difficult to prove direct official
 responsibility for the deaths of persons involved in political
 dissent.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In Estonia, as throughout the Soviet Union, cruel and inhuman
 treatment of political prisoners occurs during both
 interrogations and confinement in labor camps, prisons, or
 psychiatric hospitals. Physical and psychological abuse of
 prisonerV is common, as is detention under extremely unhealthy
 conditions. Estonian religious activist Allan Alajaan was
 freed in 1985 after spending 2 1/2 years in a psychiatric
 hospital as punishment for attempting to flee the Soviet Union.
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Estonia,
 the systemic human rights abuses described in the report on
 the U.S.S.R. apply also to Estonia. This report discusses
 only instances of repression specific to Estonia.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted in so broad a manner
 that persons may be arrested and convicted for trying to
 exercise their basic human rights. On July 19, 1985, Estonian
 human rights activist Robert Vaitmaa was sentenced to 3 years
 in a labor camp on charges of "resisting the authorities."
 Vaitmaa had been arrested on May 7 after being forcibly
 removed from an airplane while on his way to visit exiled
 activist Tiit Madison.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite guarantees of judicial objectivity in both the
 Estonian and Soviet Constitutions, the State completely
 controls the judicial process and, in political cases,
 arbitrarily decides the outcome of all trials to suit its
 requirements. No rights of a defendant override the
 compelling "interests of the State."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in personal life is pervasive through
 the use of informers, mail censorship and confiscation,
 electronic monitoring of telephones, and other means.
 Contacts between Estonians and visitors from foreign countries
 are strongly discouraged, and those who indulge in such
 contacts are subject to harassment by the authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties provided that their exercise does not
 threaten the security of the Socialist system. In practice,
 the authorities do not tolerate dissident behavior of any
 kind. Lutheran pastor Harri Motsnik was arrested on April 13,
 1985, and convicted on charges of "anti-Soviet agitation and
 propaganda," apparently on the basis of his outspoken
 sermons. Motsnik was unexpectedly released on March 28, 1986,
 (Good Friday) after a "renunciation" of his "subversive views"
 was published in the Soviet press.
 During the Estonian Writers Union Congress in April, several
 novelists and poets complained about extensive literary
 censorship which made it difficult to write about "the crimes
 of the past" and "the era of repression." They called for
 more openness, less bureaucratic interference in literature,
 and less censo:ship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public
 organizations, but the authorities subject all organizations
 to their strict control. According to local sources, the
 traditional torchlight march that marks the beginning and end
 of the school year at the university in Tartu was canceled,
 effective June 1986, because authorities perceived the march
 as a potential forum for the expression of anti-Soviet
 sentiment.
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Estonia.
 Although the Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 
 
 906
 ESTONIA
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right, independently of state-controlled unions, are
 repressed brutally. Soviet authorities remain concerned that
 the ideas of the Polish Solidarity trade union movement might
 spread, and they apply particular scrutiny to the Baltic
 states. In Estonia the party leadership has denounced local
 efforts to call strikes at state enterprises.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Soviet Constitution guarantees the right to
 profess, or not to profess, any religion, both the party and
 Government promote atheism while at best barely tolerating
 organized religion. As part of an apparently official
 campaign to reduce the authority and activities of the
 Lutheran church, many Lutheran pastors have been called in for
 questioning. Some have had their professional licenses
 revoked.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor respected
 in practice. The right to leave the Soviet Union and to
 return is not respected, Over the past few years, several
 Estonians have been imprisoned for allegedly "attempting to
 leave the Soviet Union," including Enn Veerpalu in 1985. The
 right to emigrate is also severely restricted. Many Soviet
 Jews, for example, repeatedly have been denied permission to
 emigrate, and the vast majority of Estonians are not even
 allowed to apply. Nonetheless, in 1986 two Estonian families
 with relatives in the United States were allowed to emigrate
 after waiting many years, and on November 19, the Soviet press
 agency TASS announced that Kaisa Randpere, the 3-year old
 daughter of Estonian defectors Valdo Randpere and Leila
 Miller, and her mother's parents would be allowed to emigrate
 from the Soviet Union after a 2-year wait.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Soviet authorities strictly forbid all political activity
 outside the framework of the Communist Party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government rejects any foreign criticism of its
 human rights record, maintaining that all internationally
 recognized human rights are fully protected. The Government's
 attitude toward investigation of the human rights situation in
 Estonia is uncompromisingly negative and is reflected in the
 harassment, and occasional expulsion, of foreigners who try to
 cover human rights in the Soviet Union.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution.
 Tensions between ethnic. Estonians and ethnic Russians are
 always near the surface in Estonia, and they appear to be
 increasing as the proportion of the Russian-speaking
 
 
 907
 ESTONIA
 population grows. One manifestation of this is the reluctance
 of Estonians to learn or use the Russian language. In 1979
 only 24 percent of Estonians said they spoke Russian well, a
 decline of 5 percent from 1970. Furthermore, Russian speakers
 are often greeted with hostile glares. Both of these
 developments run counter to efforts by the authorities to
 promote the use of the Russian language. Many Estonians
 report that Russians, both living in and visiting Estonia,
 suffer frequent harassment, such as vandalism and physical and
 verbal abuse. Tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians
 in Tartu reportedly erupted into street fighting lasting
 several days in October 1985.
 The language problem was a significant topic at the Estonian
 Writers Union Congress in April. One writer, stating that the
 right to use one's mother tongue in one's homeland is "the
 inalienable right of every people," criticized organizations
 and institutions in which the Estonian language was avoided.
 Another writer noted that the teaching of Estonian in
 Russian-language schools was not regarded as important. A
 Russian writer stated that Russian-language schools have no
 textbook for Estonian literature.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men. An
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 enable women to obtain and retain employment outside the
 home. However, women generally hold less remunerative
 positions in the professions than men.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The statutory minimum age for the employment of children in
 1986 was 16, and the standard workweek was 40 hours. The
 minimum wage was set at $112 per month at the official rate of
 exchange. According to the latest official data, the average
 wage is about $272 per month. Soviet law requires, in general
 terms, healthy and safe working conditions, but they usually
 fall short of Western standards.
