 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a parliamentary democracy with political institu-
 tions modeled on those of the U.K. Two major and other
 relatively less important political parties compete freely and
 vigorously for the allegiance of voters without government
 interference. Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take
 place in 1982. Five dailies, one important weekly and several
 other newspapers operate in a highly partisan fashion subject
 only to the legal constraints of libel and slander. An
 independent judiciary administers a legal system based on that
 of Great Britain with the same scrupulous attention for the
 rights of the accused. Health and social services are free
 and are available to all as is most education.
 In the face of deteriorating terms of trade, cyclones, and
 World Bank and International Monetary Fund strictures, the
 government has been forced to cut back slightly on its efforts
 to continue providing for the entire population's population's
 basic human needs. Nevertheless, the Mauritian standard of
 living is equal to or slightly higher than that of the average
 middle income developing country.
 One matter of concern to outside observers has been the
 indefinite postponement of municipal elections originally
 scheduled for December 1979 or January 1980. Ostensibly, the
 elections were not held because the government could not
 afford them in the current tight economic situation. However,
 the opposition (and some less partisan groups) claim that the
 elections have never been held because the opposition might
 have taken over all five municipal administrations in
 Mauritius, administrations which are now governed by commis-
 sioners appointed by the government.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Any use of torture or inhuman punishment is prohibited.
 No allegations of torture are known to have been made.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 These have not been known to occur in Mauritius since the
 country became independent in 1968.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of the disappearance of individuals
 in Mauritius.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Mauritius. Although
 arbitrary arrests occurred in the early 1970s when the
 government jailed opposition political and trade union
 leaders whom it accused of creating chaos and anarchy,
 there have not been any recent incidences of misuse of
 law enforcement and penal institutions for political ends.

 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system is similar to that of Great
 Britain. Since the early 1970's its record of assuring
 fair public trials to all offenders has been excellent.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law, and respected
 in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly is protected.
 The Public Order Act requires police permission for demonstra-
 tions and mass meetings. Such permission is rarely refused.
 Recent indications that freedom of speech and assembly in
 Mauritius are protected occurred on September 6 and 7, 1981.
 On September 6, the leftist General Workers Federation (GWF),
 -in collaboration with the opposition Mauritius Militant
 Movement (NM), sponsored a rally commemorating the former's
 10th anniversary. This affair drew some 10,000 persons and
 took place with no untoward incidents or violence. The
 following day, the Social Democratic Party of Mauritius (PMSD)
 organized a day-long demonstration (including stops at
 government house and in front of the prime minister's resi-
 dence) of some 10-15,000 persons calling for the government to
 undertake a series of measures to improve the lot of the
 unemployed and poor. Although there was a serious possibility
 of violence, the police, while out in force, did not interfere
 in the demonstration. Only when small groups late in the day
 threw rocks and bottles at the police did the latter respond
 with some tear gas. There were no serious injuries and only
 one arrest.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel or Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mauritius is a parliamentary democracy governed by a prime
 minister chosen by a freely elected parliament. Political
 participation is open to all adult citizens. Women in
 Mauritius are free to participate in all types of political,
 business and social activities, and a few hold high positions.
 Conservative religious and ethnic attitudes do inhibit women's
 participation. In October 1980, however, the legislative
 assembly passed a bill abolishing most if not all Napoleonic
 stipulations discrinating against women.
 Labor unions are free to organize, bargain collectively
 and strike. In 1979, there were some 277 registered unions in
 Mauritius with a total of 76,600 members (it is believed that
 1981 figures are fairly similar). The labor strife and
 frequent strikes and go-slows that characterized 1979 were not
 repeated in 1981.

 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No outside organizations are known to have asked to investigate
 the human rights situation in Mauritius.
 4. Economic, Social and Cultural Environment
 Mauritius is a small and densely populated country whose
 economy has been dominated by the sugar industry, despite
 government attempts to diversify and expand. The economy,
 essentially an open one, had a per capita GNP of $1,040 in
 1979 and $928 in 1980. The decrease resulted primarily
 from a devaluation of the rupee in late 1979 and fluctua-
 tions in exchange rates which still plague the economy.
 Mauritius enjoys the standard of living (according to IMF
 standards) of a middle-income developing country, with nutri-
 tion, health care and education comparable to other countries
 with similar income levels, while the adult literacy (over 89
 percent) and life expectancy (67 years) rates are higher.
 Basic human needs are extensively covered through government
 programs. Nonetheless, approximately 12 percent of the
 population still lives below the absolute poverty level.
 Generally free medical care is available to all Mauritians in
 government-owned and operated hospitals and dispensaries. In
 an attempt to effect more efficient island-wide distribution
 of health facilities, the government is planning to build more
 health care centers to bring more advanced health care to
 those Mauritians living in the more densely populated rural
 areas. The government has also actively pursued a pragmatic
 and successful population control policy. The population
 growth rate has varied between 2.2 (1978), 1.3 (1979) and 1.8
 (1981). The standard of nutrition is generally higher than in
 most developing countries and starvation is virtually non-
 existent. Nevertheless, the level of nutrition is generally
 much lower amonq the rural poor than among city dwellers and
 the more affluent sectors of Mauritian society.
 Education in Mauritius up to the pre-university level has been
 free and available to all sectors of the population since
 1977, although the general public has perceived a drop in the
 quality of education since that time. University education
 was also free until 1980 when tuition fees were reimposed as a
 result of increased government deficits primarily due to the
 deteriorating economic situation in Mauritius;
 With free medical care and education as well as subsidies
 for basic foodstuffs such as rice and flour granted by the
 government, the basic needs of Mauritians are extensively
 provided for.. Problems remain, resulting from an essentially
 mono-economy, devastating cyclones, deteriorating terms of
 trade and a perhaps too heavy and sudden a level of social
 expenditure as a result of the sugar boom years of the mid-
 1970s. Unemployment is now at 12-15 percent with the result
 that although a portion of the population has access to
 free education this is not in and by itself a guarantee of
 upward mobility. The government has also been limited by
 financial difficulties in providing adequate shelter to
 those made homeless by recent cyclones, and the govern-
 ment housing estates, which still lack adequate water and
 electricity, still leave much to be desired. Finally, the
 government is finding itself increasingly squeezed on the one
 hand by the necessity of providing for basic human needs which
 has become more important as economic difficulties increase
 and on the other hand by the requirement for trimming social
 services in the name of sound fiscal planning and policy.
