 The President of Malawi, Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, has maintained
 nearly undisputed control over political life and government
 since he led the country to its independence in 1964. He was
 -proclaimed "Life President" in 1970. Political activity is
 limited to participation in the sole legal party, the Malawi
 Congress Party. Malawi inherited a parliamentary form of
 government from Great Britain. Parliamentary elections, which
 are required at least every 5 years, were held in 1987.
 Almost all constituencies were contested, although only
 candidates selected by the party and approved by the President
 were allowed to run. Nearly half of the incumbents were not
 reelected. Constitutional amendments and laws paased by the
 Parliament reflect decisions already taken by the President.
 Milicary, police, and party security organs suppress opposition
 to the Government and monitor a wide range of activities. The
 small Malawian military establishment (6,000 men) faced a major
 new problem in 1987: providing military protection to permit
 the reopening and operation of the Nacala railroad line in
 Mozambique, pursuant to a December i986 accord.
 Malawi is a small, densely populated, landlocked country whose
 principal assets are moderately fertile soils, good water
 resources,-and a climate favorable to crop production. It has
 a primarily market-oriented economy. Since 1981 the Government
 has been pursuing a structural adjustment program, with the
 assistance-6f the-International Monetary Fund and the World
 Bank. It has'made substantial progress in agricultural
 development and has be6n moving to reduce subsidies and divest
 itself of parastatals (public corporations). Despite this
 progress, -annual per capita gross national product in 1985
 measured only $210 per year. Malawi's pqpulation of 7.2
 million people-is growing at an estima~ed annual rate of 3.1
 percent." Possessing no significant mineral resources or
 industrial sector, Malawi is heavily dependent on agriculture
 for expft earnings and employment.
 In 1987J human rights continued to be widely circumscribed.
 Two cases again received international attention from human
 rights 4roups, as appeals and inquiries were made on behalf of
 a former 6pposition leader, Orton Chirwa, and his wife, Vera
 Chirwa, both serving life sentences for alleged treason
 (commuted from death sentences in 1984). In September the
 Government arrested a well-known professor and poet and
 continued to detain him without charge at the end of 1987.
 Over the past year, Malawi became host to one of the largest
 refugee populations in Africa. Since mid-1986, when it had
 almost'no refugees, Malawi has experienced a massive influx of
 Mozambicans fleeing anarchic conditions, famine, and fighting
 between Mozambican government forces and insurgents. By the
 end of 1987, there were approximately 400,000 refugees in
 Malawi. In some areas their numbers were equal to the
 Malawian population. The Government has accepted these
 refugees arid, with the help of international humanitarian
 organizations, worked to provide adequate relief assistance.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no allegations of politically motivated killings
 during 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known political disappearances in 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Beatings by the police at the time of detention or arrest, or
 during interrogation, are illegal but do occur. In its 1987
 Report, Amnesty International stated that severe beatings of
 political detainees and criminal suspects were reported to be
 common. It also noted that the organization investigated in
 1986 two reported deaths of detainees due to torture.
 Prison terms of hard labor are the norm for common criminals.
 Prison conditions are generally believed to be poor but are
 difficult to verify since access to prisons is tightly
 controlled. According to one report, some criminals were sent
 to remote prisons where insufficient food was provided.
 Several are believed to have died of malnutrition.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under the Preservation of Public Security Act, the President
 may order the arrest, search, and detention of any person the
 Government suspects may "undermine" the authority of the
 Government. A person arrested under this law can be detained
 indefinitely by the police without trial. The Act also
 authorizes certain officials to detain individuals for 25 days.
 Whether or not under the Public Security Act, Malawi residents
 may be picked up at the whim of the authorities, held without
 charge for varying and indeterminate lengths of time, and
 released. Persons may be detained for "political" offenses
 against the party or government. Suspicion of corruption also
 is a frequent cause for arrest. Those detained are rarely
 charged officially or brought before courts. It is impossible
 to estimate the number of arbitrary detentions and arrests
 made in Malawi in 1987. Persons charged with crimes are
 usually held in custody while awaiting trial, and delays of 3
 years or longer before a case is heard are common.
 In one such case, Aleke Banda, a former high-ranking member of
 the Government and party, has been detained for over 7 years
 although charges against him have not been made public. Jack
 Mapanje, the head of the English Department at Chancellor
 College, was arrested by police on September 25. The reasons
 for his detention have not been made public, but it may be
 related to his poetry, some of which was doubtless seen as
 critical of the Government.
 Forced labor is sometimes used as a form of criminal punishment
 but is not otherwise practiced.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Malawi has both a traditional court system, which deals with
 most criminal cases against Africans, including most capital
 offenses, and a modern court system which generally handles
 civil cases and criminal cases against Europeans and Asians.
 Those charged under the Military Code of Justice are tried'in
 military coarts. Lawyers are not permitted to assist
 defendants in traditional court cases, but legal counsel is
 permitted in the modern court system. The right of'appeal
 exists in both the modern and traditional court systems. Most
 political cases are tried in the traditional court system, as
 in the case of Orton and Vera Chirwa, who were sentenced to
 death in 1983 by the Southern Regional Traditional Court, but
 subsequently had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.
 In practice, the Government and party exert little control in
 cases tried in the modern court system consisting of the High
 Court and Magistrate Courts. The President appoints the Chief
 Justice of the High Court who, in turn, appoints other modern
 court justices. Magistrates may-be removed from their
 positions for incompetence, malfeasance, or in the public
 interest as determined by the executive branch. :This lack of
 job security acts as-a form of government pressure. These
 courts are open to the public, and defendants are charged
 publicly.
 The three traditional courts at the regional level deal with
 most capital offenses. Police officials handle the
 prosecution, and defendants handle their own defense. There
 is no presumption of innocence, and common law rules of
 evidence do not apply. Traditional court justices ire
 appointed directly by the*President. Of the five members of
 each regional traditional court, three are chiefs generally
 without formal legal training, one is a trained lawyer who
 advises the court, and the fifth, the chairman, has had a
 course in law. Traditional court proceedings and the records
 of those proceedings are not open'to the public, although
 summaries of some cases have occasionally been published in
 the newspapers. It is generally believed that there is little
 executive interference in traditional court cases dealing in
 matters\of customary law. A guilty verdict is reviewed by the
 National Traditional Court, and a ministerial committee
 considers clemency.
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the
 property rights of those suspected of economic crimes. These
 revocations sometimes have political overtones. When the
 Forfeiture .Act is invoked, the person loses all worldly
 possessions, including business and financial and-personal
 assets. Revocation of property rights is carried out-by
 executive fiat with no judicial review. Notice of forfeiture
 must be published in the official gazette. In 1987, for the
 first time in several years, the Forfeiture Act was invoked.
 About 26. forfeiture actions were undertaken against individuals
 and businesses, apparently because they were suspected of
 involvement in illegal foreign exchange transactions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police enter houses of suspects at will under special entry
 authority to conduct searches for people or incriminating
 evidence. The authorities monitor correspondence and often
 open domestic and international mail.

 MALAWI
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Criticism of the Government and its policies is not allowed,
 even by the Parliament. The Public Security Regulations make
 it an offense to publish anything likely "to undermine the
 authority of, or public confidence in the Government."
 Although the Life President is in his late 80's, discussion of
 Malawi's political future after his death also is not
 permitted. In a speech in September, the President himself
 addressed the issue, saying he would not name a successor.
 His remarks were widely reported, but it was clear that their
 intent was to limit speculation rather than encourage public
 debate.
 The media do not submit their news items and programs to the
 Government in advance for approval or censorship, but informal,
 strict self-censorship "guidelines" are understood by the
 media. The penalty for publishing material which meets with
 official displeasure can be severe. Journalists have been
 jailed for extended periods for overstepping these
 "guidelines." The two newspapers and sole government-owned
 radio station have, however, exhibited increasing candor in
 coverage of international issues. In addition, criticism of
 the efficiency of some government departments has appeared in
 the media and Parliament.
 Limited freedom of inquiry into the natural and social
 sciences exists at the university and may include some
 examination of radical political ideologies, provided this
 does not extend to explicit criticism of the Government. The
 arrest and detention of Professor Mapanje raised new concerns
 in the academic and intellectual community.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No political meetings are permitted, other than those of the
 Congress Party. Individuals may be imprisoned if they further
 the aims of an "unlawful society," that is, any group
 considered to be "dangerous to the good government of the
 Republic.* In the nonpolitical sphere, individuals and
 organizations generally are free to meet and associate.
 Professional, fraternal, and service organizations exist and
 are encouraged by the Government.
 In the small wage sector, labor unions exist, but their
 activities are highly circumscribed, and they are generally
 ineffective in achieving gains for workers. The principal
 explanation is as much economic as political: the economy of
 Malawi can sustain only a small number of wage earners, most
 of whom occupy positions as unskilled laborers on large estate
 farms.
 Collective bargaining theoretically is allowed, but its use is
 limited. The Government intervenes to influence wages and
 working conditions. Malawi law guarantees the right to
 strike, but in practice strikes do not occur. Labor unions
 come under the umbrella organization, the Malawi Trade Union
 Congress (MTUC). With government supervision, the MTUC
 associates with international organizations and is a member of
 the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

 MALAWI
 c. Freedom ofReligion
 There is no state or preferred religion, but religious groups
 are required to register with the Government. Except for
 Jehovah's Witnesses, religious groups may establish places of
 worship and train-clergy. Their publications, like all others,
 must not criticize the Government or the party. They are free
 to establish and maintain links with coreligionists in other
 countries, and members are free to travel abroad. Similarly,
 missionaries from abroad are permitted to enter Malawi and
 proselytize,. There is no tie between a particular religion
 and the Malawi Congress Party.
 Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religious convictions prevent them
 from joining party groupings, have been banned since 1967.
 The Government considers the sect's activities to be
 disruptive of "the prevailing calm, law, and order." There is
 no evidence-that Jehovah's Witnesses have been active in
 Malawi in recent years, except for a group of several hundred
 Mozambican refugees. The Government has treated this group in
 a nondiscriminatory manner.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are few restrictions, in practice, on movement within
 Malawi, though legal provisions exist for restricting the
 movement of those convicted of political or criminal
 offenses. Asian residents and citizens are free to travel
 within the country but must reside and work in one of four
 urban areas (Lilongwe, Zomba, Mzuzu, and Blantyre/Limbe).
 Denial of passports on political grounds frequently extends to
 family members of persons in political disfavor and to those
 persons the Government suspects may criticize it if allowed to
 travel abroad. Civil servants and employees of state-owned
 enterprises-must obtain written permission to travel abroad,
 even on vacation. Obtaining such clearance can take from a
 few days to several months. Formal emigration is neither
 restricted nor encouraged. With the exception of a small
 group of political dissidents, there is no outward flow of
 Malawian refugees from the country. Citizenship may be
 revoked but in practice this is not done.
 Malawi has acted in a responsible and responsive manner to the
 large influx of Mozambicans it hosts. The refugees, located
 in heavily populated areas with little available land, have
 placed a great strain on the economy and on the transportation
 and social services networks. The Government has devoted many
 of its own scarce resources to assisting the refugees and has
 permitted international and private voluntary organizations to
 operate relief efforts. These efforts are coordinated by a
 committee chaired by the Ministry of Health. The United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.(UNHCR) was allowed to
 open an office, and Malawi has also acceded to the Geneva
 Convention. Relating to the Status of Refugees. The U.N. and
 other infernational assistancegroups. are able to travel
 freely to assess relief needs-and to investigate allegations
 of protection problems. There were no substantiated reports
 of Mozambicans being forcibly repatriated from Malawi in 1987.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Malawi do not, in practice, have the ability to
 change their government. All political decisions are made
 
 
 174
 MALAWI
 either directly by the President or those few closely
 associated with him. No opposition political parties or
 movements are permitted. Membership in the Malawi Congress
 Party is not iandatory but is often coerced. Active
 membership is expected of those who aspire to government
 jositions (including the Civil Service) or professional
 success outside of government. Party membership is often
 required of school children and of those who seek access to
 government services or entrance to local markets. The annual
 renewal fee is only about 25 cents, but this can be nearly
 half a day's pay for a minimum wage earner. In addition, when
 the President visits an area, financial contributions from
 individuals and businesses are expected. Nearly half the
 population holds at least nominal party membership.
 The party's structure provides for some choice among
 candidates for party, parliamentary, or other offices. For
 example, in the parliamentary elections held in 1987, there
 were several candidates for election in a number of
 constituencies. Nearly one-half of the incumbent Members of
 Parliament were not reelected. All nominees, however, were
 selected by the party and submitted to the President for
 review. Active campaigning was not permitted. The National
 Assembly (Parliament), consisting of both elected and
 appointed members, is mainly concerned with ratifying
 government policy. Its powers are broadly based in law, but
 highly circumscribed in practice. Women may join the party
 and vote. Women hold 10 of the 112 elected seats in
 Parliament. No women hold ministerial level positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit organizations such as the
 International Committee of the Red Cross or Amnesty
 International to conduct human rights investigations in
 Malawi. Nongovernmental organizations devoted to the
 furtherance of human rights are not permitted to exist.
 Expressions of interest in alleged human rights problems by
 outside groups or persons are not welcomed and are usually
 ignored. Few government officials are even willing to discuss
 the subject of human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While Malawi remains one of the world's least developed
 countries, economic and social needs of ethnic Africans are
 generally met on a nondiscriminatory basis. Asian residents,
 however, have been discriminated against in recent years. For
 instance, Asians, whether Malawian citizens or not, have been
 compelled to transfer ownership of rural shops and trucking
 businesses to ethnic African Malawian citizens, and within
 some urban centers, strict rules governing where Asians may
 own property result in limitations on where they may reside.
 Prior to 1987, persons who held foreign passports could reside
 indefinitely in Malawi. Recent legislation, however, aimed
 primarily at persons of Asian origin, rescinded this
 permission. These changes in the citizenship law, together
 with the Forfeiture Act actions (which have been applied in
 large measure against Asians), have led many in the small
 
 
 MALAWI
 Asian community (about 5,000 persons) to question whether they
 have a long-term future in Malawi.
 Women are limited to the roles defined by a traditional
 African society and do not have opportunities equal to those
 of men. As mothers, women enjoy access to the traditional
 health services and to extension programs designed to improve
 women's homemaking abilities. Such programs, while
 beneficial, have failed to recognize the importance of women
 as agricultural producers in the rural sector (roughly 70
 percent of all smallholder farms and over 50 percent of
 subsistence holdings are headed by women) and the potential
 role women can have in the modern sectnr. Although males
 still have a comparative advantage in terms of educational and
 employment opportunities, the Government has initiated
 programs to begin to rectify existing discrimination. For
 example, a third of the positions in the pablic education
 system have been reserved for women. Although Malawi's
 traditional tribal leadership structures are primarily
 matrilineal, several small ethnic groups grant fewer rights
 and privileges to women and occasionally continue to practice
 female circumcision.
 Malawi enjoys a considerable degree of ethnolinguistic
 uniformity. The vast majority of the population speaks and/or
 understands Chichewa, which became the national language in
 1968. English is the official language for government and
 business. Malawi's indigenous groups are sufficiently alike
 in culture and social organization to permit relatively easy
 interaction, including intermarriage, social and residential
 intermixture in agricultural settlements, and political
 cooperation alliances.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum working age is 14, though this applies only to the
 relatively small urban-wage sector. Less -than 15 percent of
 the work f6rce is employed in the formal wage sector. For
 those fortunate enough to hold paid jobs, wages and working
 conditions are generally adequate, and paid holidays and
 safety standards in the workplace are required by law.
 However, enforcement of these standards is limited. Wage
 levels are low--the m nimum wage is about 50 cents per day in
 the urban areas--reflecting the abundance of unskilled labor
 and a government policy to limit the rural-urban income gap
 and hence the rate of migration to the towns. Government
 regulations limit the workweek to 45 hours in the construction
 industry, and 48 hours in other industries. In practice, most
 employees work between 37.5 and 42.5 hours per week over 5
 days.
