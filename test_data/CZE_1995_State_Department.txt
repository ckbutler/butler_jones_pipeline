 CZECH REPUBLIC
 The Czech Republic came into existence on January 1, 1993, when the Czech and
 Slovak Federal Republic dissolved, and its constituent republics became independ-
 ent. It is a parliamentary democracy. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and his Civic
 Democratic Party lead the coalition Government. The Czech Republic has essentially
 completed the reform of political and economic structures initiated after the 1989
 "velvet revolution." Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic, is an inter-
 nationally recognized advocate of human rights and social justice.
 The Ministry of the Interior oversees the police. The civilian Internal Security
 Service (BIS) is independent of Ministry control, but reports to Parliament and the
 Prime Minister's office. Police and BIS authorities generally observe constitutional
 and legal protection of individual rights in carrying out their responsibilities. How-
 ever, there were occasional reports of abuses by some members of the police.
 The market-based economy showed solid growth in 1995, with over two-thirds of
 the gross domestic product (GDP) produced by the private sector. Most macro-
 economic indicators (budget surplus, low inflation and unemployment, continued ex-
 port growth) were favorable. A significant trade deficit developed which was fi-
 nanced by strong capital inflows. The work force was employed primarily in indus-
 try, trade/retail, and construction. Leading exports were intermediate manufactured
 products, machinery and transport equipment, primarily to European Union coun-
 tries. GDP per capita reached about $4,400.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 popular prejudice and violence against Roma posed a continuing problem, despite
 incTeased government enga ement, as did the 1992 citizenship law. Other human
 rights problems include the law on lustration (screening), which forbids certain pre-
 1989 Communist officials and secret police collaborators from holding certain posi-
 tions, and the laws criminalizing defamation of the state and presidency. There is
 increasing public awareness about violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudcial Killing.-Frantisek Kahanek, the confessed
 rapist and murderer of a 10-year-old child, was found dead in his jail cell while
 awaiting trial in April. A government investigation failed to rule out the negligence
 or complicity of his prison guards in the death, and the national chief of prison
 guards was subsequently removed from his post. Four wardens have been charged
 with assault and abuse of public office and are currently being tried (see Section
 1.c.). There were no other reports of possible political or extrajudicial killings.
 In two separate instances from 1994, police caused the death of German tourists
 in roadside altercations; in 1995, one of the policemen received an 8-month sentence
 for accidental shooting. The other case is still under investigation.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of such practices. Torture is prohibited by the Constitution,
 
 
 839
 and in 1995 the Czech Government lifted a ban, in place since 1988, against visits
 by the U.N. Committee Against Torture. However, Frantisek Kahanek died while
 in official custody under unclear circumstances (see Section L.a.).
 In May police in Brno were accused of using excessive force in breaking up a late-
 night party outside a theater. The investigation is continuing. According to press re-
 ports, in October the same officers harassed and injured Radek Necas, who had
 given evidene against them in connection with the May event. The police allegedly
 sprayed tear gas in Neas' eyes, beat him with a truncheon, and tied him down in
 a jail cell for 3 hours before a doctor secured his release.
 The police force has undergone significant restructuring and have brought many
 new offiers onto the force. In 1995 they continued to have a poor reputation among
 the public, in part a heritage from the Communist era. There have been reports of
 police shakedowns and anecdotal stories of physical abuse and malfeasance, often
 irected at foreigners and Roma. An Interior Ministry initiative is attempting to
 bring more Roma into police work.
 Prisn conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors, although on occasion with significant bu-
 reaucratic delays. According to the Justice Ministry, prisons are at 107 percent of
 capacity, prison authority data show that a quarter of prisons are 25-50 percent
 over capacity. The elimination of forced labor has left many prisoners unemployed.
 In its 1995 annual human rights report, the Czech Helsinki Committee called atten-
 tion to overcrowding in some prisons. According to the prison service, the ratio of
 employees to prisoners is somewhat below the 2:1 ratio recommended under Euro-
 pean guidelines.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. Authorities may hold
 persons without charge for 24 hours, during which time they have the right to coun-
 sel. There was no evidence of incommunicado detention or protective detention. A
 person charged with a crime has the right to appear before a judge for arraignment.
 At arraignment, if the prosecution files charges, the judge determines whether cus-
 tody is necessary pending trial. The law does not allow bail for certain serious
 crimes. Pretrial custody may last as long as 4 years for criminal charges, and in
 such cases monthly appearances before a judge are required. Since 1989 the average
 length of pretrial detention has increased from 89 days to over 200 in 1995. Accord-
 ing to the prison service, the average time before a case goes to trial is 222 days
 and 42 percent of prisoners are currently awaiting trial. The lack of experienced
 judges and investigators, working in a still-evolving legal environment, has led to
 a backlog of court cases. Attorney and family visits are permitted. The authorities
 follow these guidelines in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is impartial and independent in practice. Judges are not fired or trans-
 ferred for political reasons. The court system consists of district, regional, and high
 courts. The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal. In addition, a Constitu-
 tional Court rules separately on the constitutionality of legislation. The shortage of
 qualified judges is being gradually overcome. Nonetheless, public opinion polls indi-
 cate that about half the population does not fully trust the courts and observers as-
 cribe this attitude in part to suspicions left over from 40 years of manipulation of
 the judical system by the Communist Government.
 The law stipulates that persons charged with criminal offenses are entitled to fair
 and open pub ic trials. They have the right to be informed of their legal rights, of
 the charges against them, to consult with counsel, and to present a defense. The
 state provides lawyers for indigent defendants in criminal and some civil cases
 through the bar association. However, the international Helsinki Committee re-
 ported to the implementation meeting in Warsaw in October of the Organization for
 Security and      ration in Europe (OSCE) that many eligible parties fail to com-
 plete the demanding process of applyg for such representation. Defendants enjoy
 a presumption of innocence and have the right to refuse to testify against them-
 selves. They may appeal any judgments against them. The authorities observe these
 rights in practice.
 Foreign and domestic human rights observers expressed concern about the exten-
 sion of the 1991 lustration law, which bars many former Communist Party officials,
 members of the people's militia, and secret police collaborators from holding a wide
 range of elective and appointive offices including appointive positions in state-
 owned companies, academia, and the media, for a period of 5 years; some other em-
 ployers have also required applicants to produce proof of noncollaboration.
 Late in 1992 the Czechoslovak federal Constitutional Court eliminated the largest
 category of offenders from the law (those listed as collaborators but who in fact may
 only have been intelligence targets). Some of those accused of collaboration have
 
 
 840
 submitted themselves to the lengthy appeals process; of approximately 500 appeals,
 over 75 percent have been won. In January 1996, Jan Kavan, a former member of
 the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly and longtime dissident publisher in London who
 had been accused of collaboration with the Czechoslovak secret police, was com-
 pletely exonerated by the court. Many of those unjustly accused of collaboration feel
 they have suffered diminished career pespects and damaged personal reputations.
 The screening process was criticized becase it was based on the records of the
 Communist secret police, records many suspected were incomplete or unreliable.
 International criticism of the screeninglaw was muted in 1995, as most organiza-
 tions who had criticized lustration in the past, such as the Conference on Security
 and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE, now the OSCE) and theoCouncil of Europe
 (OE), rarely if ever recived complaints from aggrieved parties. Still, the law con-
 tinued to be criticized as a violation of human rights principles prohibiting discrimi-
 naion in employment and condemning collective guilt. In 1995 Parliament voted to
 extend the law to the year 2000, overriding a veto by President Havel.
 Although a 1993 law defining the pre-1989 Communist regime as criminal and
 lifting the statute of limitations for crimes committed by the Communist Party of
 Czechoslovakia during its 40-year rule remained on the books, it was rarely invoked.
 Several charges filed by the office responsible for the law were criticized by human
 rights activists for adopting the principle of collective guilt. Many were also dis-
 missed by the state Prosecutor's Office for procedural errors or lack of evidence. The
 anti-Communist law was upheld by the Constitutional Court in December 1993.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Elec-
 tronic surveillance, the tapping of telephones, and interception of mail require a
 court order. The Government complied with this requirement.
 Allegations that the apartment of Green Party leader Jaroslav Vlcek was bugged,
 made after a meeting there in July between Civic Democratic Alliance President
 Jan Kalvoda and Social Democratic Party President Milos Zeman, led to an inves-
 tigation which found no evidence of surveillance. There were no other cases of pos-
 sible electronic surveillance reported in 1995.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, and the Government respects this right in practice. Individuals can and do
 speak out on political issues and freely criticize the Government and public figures.
 However, "defamation" of the state and presidency are forbidden under provisions
 of the Criminal Code upheld by the Constitutional Court in 1993. In 1995 Pavel
 Karhanek was given a 9-month suspended sentence under the law on defamation
 of the state for displaying posters in a local government office calling the President
 a former alcoholic, a swindler, and a Communist coll.borator. After he pulled down
 pictures of the President from the walls of the same office, he was again charged
 and may face a prison sentence of up to 2 years. Also in 1995, two persons were
 charged under a separate law on the defamation of the President. One was given
 a suspended sentence of 18 months, and the other a suspended sentence of 4
 months.
 A wide variety of newspapers, magazines, and journals publish without govern-
 ment interference. The capital, Prague, is home to at least a dozen daily newspapers
 with national distribution, as well as a variety of entertainment and special interest
 newspapers and magazines. These publications are owned by a variety of Czech and
 foreign investors. Some newspapers are still associated with the interests of a politi-
 cal party; others are independent.
 The electronic media are independent. There are 4 television stations, 2 public
 and 2 private, and more than -30 private radio stations in addition to Czech Public
 Radio. The leading television channel, Nova, is privately owned, partially by foreign
 investors.
 A parliamentary commission has broad oversight and power to approve or reject
 candidates for the Television and Radio Council. The Council has limited regulatory
 responsibility for policymaking and answers to the parliamentary media committee.
 The Council can issue and revoke radio and television licenses, and monitors pro-
 gramming.
 At year's end, Parliament was wrestling with two proposed media laws: one for
 print and one for broadcast media. New laws are needed because the print law on
 the books dates from 1966 and the current broadcast law, dating from 1991, did not
 envision private media. The print media law has gone through several drafts in the
 process of working its way through various parliamentary committees. Czech jour-
 nalists criticize the draft law for not affirming the right of a journalist not to reveal
 
 
 841
 sources and for not requiring government officials to supply information to the
 media.
 The law provides for academic freedom but also forbids activities by established
 political parties at universities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of persons to assemble peacefully. Permits for some public demonstrations are re-
 quired by law but are rarely refused. However, the law forbids political party activ-
 ity at universities (see Section 2.a.). Police generally do not interfere with sponta-
 neous peaceful demonstrations for which organizers lack a permit.
 Police behavior at assemblies occasionally came under fire for being too re-
 strained, specifically at gatherings of extremists. At an October congregation of
 skinheads m Ceske Budejovice, youths making the heil Hitler salute-a punishable
 offense under the law-met with no interference from police, according to press re-
 ports.
 The right of persons to associate freely and to form political parties and move-
 ments is also provided for by law, and the Government respected this right in prac-
 tice. Organizations, associations, foundations, and political parties are required to
 register with local officials or at the Interior Ministry, but there is no evidence that
 this registration is coercive. The Government moved in 1995 to disband approxi-
 mately 30 smaller political parties and movements that failed to meet the legal re-
 quirements for continued registration, chiefly an annual financial disclosure state-
 ment. The Communist Party, although fragmented, is represented in Parliament
 and in local government. Following the May murder of the Rom Tibor Berki (see
 Section 5), the Interior Ministry reviewed the registrations of organizations that
 could be called extremist. Two such groups were publicly identified; their registra-
 tions were examined but not revoked.
 The leaking of internal security service lists of extremist organizations by Par-
 liament in the summer led to a protracted public discussion of the definitions used
 by the Ministry of Interior. Much controversy centered on the inclusion of environ-
 mnental groups on this list.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for religious freedom, and the govern-
 ment respects this right in practice. The State provides support to all religions that
 are registered with the Ministry of Culture. There are currently 21 registered
 churches. A church must have at least 10,000 adult members to register. Two Chris-
 tian political parties, the Christian Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic
 Union-Czech Peoples Party, are junior members of the governing coalition.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on domestic or foreign travel, emigration, and
 repatriation. Passports are readily available to all wishing to travel abroad. Czechs
 who emigrated during the period of Communist rule frequently return to visit, or
 even to settle, and are able to regain Czech citizenship if they wish, though to do
 so they must relinquish claim to any foreign citizenship. Citizenship is not revoked
 for political reasons. Nonetheless, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has ex-
 pressed concern to the Government that its 1992 citizenship law has created a state-
 less problem which may lead to irregular movements (see Section 5).
 Refugees and asylum seekers were treated according to international norms. Most
 migrants used the Czech Republic as a transit route toward the West; however, the
 country is becoming the final destination for increasing numbers of migrants. Ac-
 cording to the Ministry of Interior, acceptance rates for asylum applications have
 decreased from over 35 percent in 1991 to just over 3 percent in 1995. This trend
 reflects the country's increasingly restrictive attitude toward accepting economic mi-
 grants. There are 4 refugee camps and 10 integration centers. In addition, there are
 officially 1,330 refugees from the former Yugoslavia in country. Refugee status is
 granted for 5 years, after which refugees may apply for residency. A lengthy proce-
 dure for naturalization is also open to them. Nongovernmental organizations work
 closely with the Interior Ministry to ease refugees' transition into society. In prac-
 tice, however, most potential refugees choose to apply for permanent settlement
 elsewhere.
 In 1995 the Government devoted increased attention to illegal migration into the
 country and took steps with its neighbors to control the movement of people across
 its borders. The Government has signed repatriation agreements with Romania,
 Hungary, and Germany.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment.
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government by
 peaceful democratic means, and citizens exercise this right in practice. Citizens over
 the age of 18 are eligible to vote in republic-wide and local elections. Voting is car-
 
 
 842
 tied out by secret ballot. Opposition groups, including political parties, function
 openly and participate without hindrance in the political process. No republic-wide
 elections were held in 1995, but free and fair municipal elections took place in No-
 vember 1994 throughout the country. However, international observers have noted
 that former Czechoslovaks who elected representatives to the Czech National As-
 sembly in 1992 and whose current citizenship is unclear continue to lack voting
 rights (see Section 5).
 The ruling four-party, center-right coalition was formed in June 1992 following
 Czechoslovakia's final nation-wide elections. There are also a number of left-of-cen-
 ter opposition parties and one party of the radical right. The Czech Constitution
 mandates elections to Parliament at least every 4 years, based on proportional rep-
 resentation in eight large electoral districts. There is a 5-percent threshold for par-
 ties to enter Parliament. The Constitution also calls for a Senate to be established.
 The first senatorial election is scheduled for 1996. Until the Senate is established,
 the   parliamentary  system   could   be  open   to   accusations  of  operating
 extraconstitutionally. The President, who is elected by Parliament, serves a 5-year
 term. The President has limited constitutional powers but may use a suspense veto
 to return legislation to Parliament, which can override the President's veto by a
 simple majority.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on women's participation in poli-
 tics. Relatively few women nevertheless hold high public office. The state attorney
 and the mayor of Brno are women, and there are 19 women parliamentary deputies
 in the 200-member Parliament.
 The government-sponsored Council on National Minorities has representatives
 from all minority groups. Slovaks, of whom there are an estimated 300,000, are al-
 most all "Czechoslovaks" who elected to live in the Czech Republic after the split,
 and who for the most part define their interests in the context of Czech politics, not
 along ethnic lines. Many serve in high positions in the civil service.
 Many of the estimated 200,000 Roma have not been fully integrated into society,
 and the party that represented their interests immediately following the demise of
 communism, the Romani Civic Initiative, is no longer in the Government and is in
 disarray. The political culture of the Czech Republic generally defines Roma as out-
 siders, and the Rema themselves have been unable to unite behind a program or
 set of ideals that would allow them to represent their interests in the democratic
 structures of the country (see Section 5). In 1995, however, the Roma became in-
 creasingly galvanized on the issue of interethnic violence against them. There is one
 Romani deputy in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction, and government of-
 ficials are generally cooperative and somewhat responsive to their views. The presi-
 dency of former dissident and human rights monitor Vaclav Havel serves as an im-
 portant symbol for these groups. While the Government has demonstrated a willing-
 ness to examine and redress individual cases of human rights abuse, it has been
 less flexible when considering larger systemic changes. Moreover, ministries occa-
 sionally exhibited some reticence to release statistics and other information poten-
 tially embarrassing to the Government. Several speakers at the May seminar on tol-
 erance sponsored -by the OSCE and the COE in Bucharest, and at the October
 OSCE Human Dimensional Meeting in Warsaw, criticized the 1992 citizenship law
 for its disproportionate impact on Rema (see Section 5).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status.
 The law provides for the equality of citizens and prohibits discrimination. Health
 care, education, retirement, and other social services generally are provided without
 regard to race, sex, religion, disability, social status, or sexual orientation. In prac-
 tice, Roma face discrimination in such areas as education, housing, and job oppor-
 tunity.
 Women.-The true extent of violence against women is unknown, and public de-
 bate about it is rare, despite the efforts of a handful of women's groups to bring
 this issue to the attention of the public. The existence of any public discussion at
 all is a marked change since before 1989. Official police statistics show a decline
 in violence against women since 1990, yet these statistics' reliability is uncertain.
 Recent studies by the Sexology Institute have found that 12 percent of women over
 the age of 15 have experienced some form of sexual assault in their lifetime and
 that only 3 percent of rape victims report the crime. Gender studies experts say that
 women are ashamed. to speak about rape and that the police are not equipped, ei-
 
 
 843
 ther by attitude or training, to help. There are state-supported shelters that accept
 women in most major cities and towns. According to nongovernmental organiza-
 tions, the situation has improved in recent years, but there are still not enough
 spaces to meet demand.
 While prostitution is illegal, it is much in evidence, and the law does not explicitly
 protect women against trafficking and sexual exploitation. In 1995 police found evi-
 dence of trafficking in women in clubs in several cities and closed several "erotic
 salons".
 Women are equal under the law and in principle receive the same pay for the
 same job. Women's median wages lagged significantly behind those of men in 1995,
 although the gap is narrowing. Women are concentrated in professions in which the
 median salary is low: medicine, teaching, and white-collar clerical jobs. At the same
 time women have made deep inroads into the private sector since 1989, and the
 number of women in agricultural work has fallen by 50 percent over the last decade.
 Women have steadily represented roughly half of the labor force over the same pe-
 riod. Unemployment among women is ow at around 4 percent (2.5 percent for men).
 They enjoy equal property, inheritance, and other legal rights with men.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through programs
 for health care, compulsory education, and basic nutrition. Some Romani children
 do not receive these benefits for a variety of reasons, and the Government's largely
 bureaucratic and administrative approach has been inadequate to the task of elimi-
 nating continued social prejudice against Roma in many municipalities. In addition,
 some segments of the Romani community want as little to do as possible with
 "wWte" society.
 C  ild abuse as a social problem received increased attention in the press in 1995.
 A children's crisis center was founded and is 70 percent state-supported. According
 to its director, around 1 percent of children are neglected, maltreated, or sexually
 abused, and police register about one-tenth of all cases. An increase in the number
 of reported cases of child abuse appears to be the result of an increased awareness
 of the problem. There is no evidence of a societal pattern of abuse.
 Girls and boys enjoy equal access to health care and education at all levels. Ac-
 cording to the Ministry of Education, Romani children comprise roughly 60 percent
 of pupils in special schools for those who suffer from mental and social disabilities.
 People With Disabilities.-A heretofore generous government policy of support for
 the disabled is being reduced for financial reasons. The disabled suffer dispropor-
 tionately from unemployment (13 percent vs. the national average of 3 percent), and
 the physically disabed have unequal access to education, especially in rural areas.
 This is less the result of government policy than of a lack of barrier-free access to
 public schools. Numerous nongovernmental organizations are actively working to di-
 minish these disadvantages. The Government has not placed a high priority on the
 issue of ensuring access for the disabled, nor has discrimination against the disabled
 been the subject of significant policy or public debate. The law encourages but does
 not require architects to take the needs of the handicapped into consideration. There
 is one disabled member of Parliament.
 Religious Minorities.-The Jewish community numbers a few thousand. There
 were isolated incidents of vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, but many, including Jew-
 ish leaders, remained unconvinced that this was necessarily a manifestation of anti-
 Semitism. In October two 17-year-old skinheads threw a Molotov cocktail through
 the window of a synagogue in Prague; there was no further damage. The suspects
 have been apprehended and are awaiting trial. A new history of the Catholic church
 was quickly removed from the Ministry of Education's recommended reading list for
 elementary schools after public outcry over allegedly anti-Semitic statements it con-
 tained. The police confirmed the existence of over 20 underground magazines with
 small circulations propagating Fascism, racism, and anti-Semitism.
 NationallRacioliEthnic Minorities.-After ethnic Slovaks, the most significant
 minority is by far the Romani population, officially estimated at about 200,000.
 Roma live throughout the country but are concentrated in the industrial towns of
 northern Bohemia, where many of them were settled more than 40 years ago in the
 homes of Sudeten Germans transferred to the West. They suffer disproportionately
 from poverty, interethnic violence illiteracy, and disease. Efforts by foundations and
 individuals in the education and health fields to improve their living conditions, es-
 pecially the conditions of Romani children, have had only minimal impact. There is
 a Czech-language program for Roma on state television, although it is consistently
 broadcast at hours when most people are asleep. Romani leaders have met with lit-
 tle success thus far in organizing their local communities, which are often riven by
 conflicting loyalties.
 Roma suffer from serious popular prejudice, as is repeatedly affirmed by public
 opinion polls. According to the state Attorney General and a 1995 COE report, ra-
 
 
 844
 cially motivated violence against Roma, usually by skinheads, has risen steadily
 over the last three years. Local authorities have been unable (or, according to some
 observers including Roma, unwilling) to curb this violence. In May four skinheads
 in Zd'ar Nad Sazavou forced their way into the home where Tibor Berki, a Rom,
 lived with his family. Berki was attacked with truncheons in front of his wife and
 children and died shortly thereafter from his injuries. The central Government re-
 sponded with unprecedented speed, forcefully condemning the attack. The state at-
 torney instructed prosecutors to pursue the strongest penalties available by law for
 racially motivated crime, and Parliament passed legislation to stiffen those pen-
 alties. In December the regional court in Brno sentenced one of the four Berki as-
 sailants to 12 years in prison for murder, but failed to identify his act as racially
 motivated. Police, state attorneys, and Romani groups criticized the ruling, as did
 the Prime Minister, and the State Prosecutor lodged an appeal. A second assailant
 received an 18-month sentence; the other two received suspended sentences of 2 and
 6 months.
 Two further incidents of violence against Roma in October led the Romani leader-
 ship to stage a peaceful demonstration outside the Prime Minister's office, the first
 protest of its kind by Roma. By year's end, this demonstration had been followed
 by several other peaceful protests in cities and towns throughout the country.
 The court system approached racially motivated crime with more vigor in 1995.
 In March the district court in Ceske Budejovice overturned the acquittal of 16
 skinheads who drove Tibor Danihel, an 18-year-old Rom, into the river in Pisek in
 September 1993 and caused him to drown. However, in November the state inves-
 tigator in Pisek decided to drop the charges, citing a lack of conclusive evidence
 against the accused. In August the Liberec regional court sentenced four skinheads
 to 18 to 28 months in prison for firebombing two Romani homes in the summer of
 1994. Two women suffered burns in the attacks; one of them, a 12-year-old girl, was
 left permanently scarred. In September the Prague municipal court gave the six
 members of the musical group Branik, which was disbanded in 1991, an 8-month
 suspended sentence for propagating racial hatred in their lyrics. The lyrics were
 saturated with racist epithets referring to Roma. The court has also charged the
 group's music publisher with inciting racial hatred. The trial is scheduled to begin
 in early 1996. In October nine skinheads attacked a group of young Roma in
 Karvina, threw three of the girls to the ground and beat and kicked them severely.
 One of the victims was hospitalized with a concussion and a fractured skull. Seven
 of the nine skinheads have een apprehended and charged. Beginning in June 1995,
 the number of those charged with racially motivated crimes rose sharply, and state
 prosecutors sought stiffer sentences for them.
 Central government officials became more engaged in problems affecting the
 Romani community in 1995. The Government accepted visits by a COE delegation
 which had come to investigate the citizenship law. Prime Minister Klaus met with
 Romani representatives in October to discuss their concerns. President Havel and
 three cabinet ministers attended a memorial service at the former concentration
 camp site of Lety to pay tribute to the Czech Roma who perished during World War
 II. In October, when Roma Josef and Jarmila Polak were attacked by skinheads in
 Breclav-causing each to suffer a concussion and Josef Polak to lose an eye-the
 cabinet issued a swift denunciation of the attack. Four suspects were charged in the
 Polak case and are awaiting trial.
 Roma face discrimination in employment, housing, schools, and the rest of every-
 day life. Unemployment among Roma is universally acknowledged to be high; non-
 governmental organizations estimate credibly that it is as high as 70 percent in
 some areas. In 1995, some restaurants and other venues throughout the country
 routinely refused service to Roma and posted signs prohibiting their entry. In many
 cases, local authorities intervened to have the offen ing signs removed.
 International legal and human rights organizations and Roma activists continued
 to criticize the discriminatory impact on Roma of the 1992 citizenship law. This law,
 created at the time of the Czech-Slovak split, gave Czechoslovaks living in the Czech
 Republic until the end of December 1993, later extended to June 1994, to apply for
 Czech citizenship under more favorable conditions than non-Czechoslovaks faced.
 Unlike its Slovak counterpart, which awarded Slovak citizenship to all former
 Czechoslovak citizens living within its borders regardless of their previous national-
 ity (after 1970, Czechoslovaks were required to choose whether they were "Czechs"
 or "Slovaks," a choice with virtually no significance at the time), the Czech law
 posed conditions: "Slovak" applicants were required to prove they had a clean crimi-
 nal record over the previous 5 years and were resident in the Czech Republic for
 2 years. Romani leaders protest that these provisions of the citizenship law were
 designed to discriminate against Roma. In a broader sense, the very fact that condi-
 tions were set whereby former "Czech" or "Slovak" nationality became the basis by
 
 
 845
 which one qualified for post-1992 Czech citizenship quickly became the issue in
 international fora. The practical result of the citizenship law was that an unknown
 number of former Czechoslovaks of Slovak nationality resident in the Czech Repub-
 lic at the time of the split-nearly all of them Roma-found themselves without
 Czech citizenship. Government sources estimate that there are about 10,000 "unre-
 solved" cases of citizenship, and nongovernmental organizations estimate as many
 as 24,000 or more. The actual number is unknown.
 In 1994 an official of the Karvina district office was found to have accepted im-
 proper payments to expedite citizenship applications, primarily from Roma. Non-
 governmental organizations assert that many applicants were unaware that this
 was an irregular procedure, but authorities believe otherwise. A police investigation
 is schedule to begin in early 1996. Karvina officials subsequently revoked all citi-
 zenship papers signed by this individual. As a result, upwards of 300 people, accord-
 ing to the Ministrpy of Interior, had to begin the lengthy and expensive process of
 appication for citizenship anew. The Tolerane Foundation, a Czech nongovern-
 mental organization, estim~ates the number of applicants adversely affected y this
 decision to be over 600. The official and her immediate superior no longer work at
 the district offie, yet many of those whose citizenship was revoked face dire eco-
 nomic hardship until their cases are resolved. Without citizenship or residency they
 do not have thle right to work, health insurane, or any of the other social benefits
 enjoyed by nearly all citizens and residents. Moreover, those with uncertain citizen-
 ship may not vote and could not participate in the coupon privatization program.
 Application for both citizenship and residency are demanding processes, and social
 workers report that many formerly Czechoslovak Roma have difimculty obtaining the
 necessary documentation. Workers at district offices where these applications are
 processed are not always well-informed of the requirements or well-disposed toward
 Romani applicants. The clean criminal record requirement is interpreted inconsist-
 ently. Even applicants who have never visited Slovakia must produce proof of re-
 lease from Slovak citizenship and that they owe no debts there. Nongovernmental
 organizations report that this ereuirement is also applied to school-aged children.
 Fe  that the situation would lead to mass deportations of Roma have thus far
 proven exaggerated, yet the Justice Ministry reported that 460 persons had been de-
 ported to Slovakia since the passage of the citizenship law by year's end, generally
 following an arrest. The rate of exulsion is growing. Police who come across for-
 merly Czechoslovak individuals without proper citizenship or resideny papers have
 been known to expel them to Slovakia, and this is within their authority. While the
 criticism that persons had been deprived of the right to citizenship in the Czechoslo-
 vak successor state of their choice persiste in 1995 Parliament passed an amend-
 ment to the Citizenship Law to expedit   te citizenship applications from ethnic
 Czechs from the Voihyma region of Ukraine.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers the right to form and join
 unions of their own choosing without prior authorization, and the Government re-
 spects this right. The work force was 45 to 50 percent unionized in 1995, although
 the number ol workers belonging to unions continued to fall steadily. Most workers
 are members of unions afliated with the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade
 Unions (CMKOS). CMKOS is a democratically oriented, republic-wide umbrella or-
 ganization for branch unions. It is not affiliated with any political party and care-
 fully maintains its independence.
 Workers have the right to strike, except for those whose role in public order or
 public safety is deemed ecrucial The law requires that labor disputes be subject first
 to mediation and that strikes take place only after mediation efforts fail. There were
 no major strikes in 1995, although an estimated 50,000 union members took to the
 streets of Prague in March to prtest proposed government social policies. The Gov-
 ernment narrowly averted a major railway workers' strike in June. Some doctors
 and health workers staged an administrative strike in November.
 Unions are free to form or join federations and confederations and affiliate with
 and participate in international bodies. This freedom was fully exercised.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining. The  aw on Collective Bargaining is carried out in the tripartite
 system, a voluntary arrangement in which representatives of unions, government,
 and employers set the parameters of labor relations. Wage regulation was abolished
 in 1995.
 There are 11 free trade zones. Their workers have and practice the same right
 to organize and bargain collectively as other workers in the country.
 c. Prohibition oT  rced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, andwit is not practiced.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code stipulates a mini-
 mum working age of 15 years, although children who have completed courses at spe-
 cial schools (schools for the severely disabled) may work at age 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage stand-
 ards. The current minimum wage is about $95 (2,500 crowns) per month. The mini-
 mum wage provides an adequate, if sparse, standard of living for an individual
 worker and, when combined with allowances available to families with children, pro-
 vides an adequate standard of living for a worker and a family. Major efforts at re-
 training, carried out by district labor offices, seek to provide labor mobility for those
 at the lower end of the wage scale. Because of a continuing tight job market, the
 enforcement of minimum wage standards was rarely an issue.
 The law mandates a standard workweek of 42  hours. It also requires paid rest
 of at least 30 minutes during the standard 8- to 8 /s-hour workday, as well as an-
 nual leave of 3 to 4 weeks. Overtime ordered by the employer may not exceed 150
 hours per year or 8 hours per week as a standard practice. Overtime above this
 limit may be permitted by the local employment office. The Labor Ministry enforces
 standards for working hours, rest periods, and annual leave.
 Government, unions, and employers have agreed to promote worker safety and
 health, but conditions in some sectors of heavy industry are problematical, espe-
 cially those awaiting privatization. Industrial accident rates are not unusually high.
 The Office of Labor Safety is responsible for enforcement of health and safety stand-
 ards. Workers have the right to refuse work endangering their life or health without
 risk of loss of employment.
