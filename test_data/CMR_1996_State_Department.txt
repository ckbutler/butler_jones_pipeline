 CAMEROON
 Cameroon is a multiparty republic which continues to be dominated by President
 Paul Biya and a circle of advisers drawn largely from his own ethnic group and from
 his party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM). The CPDM's
 power was last challenged in 1992 in relatively free National Assembly elections
 and highly flawed presidential elections in which Biya was elected to a 5-year term.
 The CPDM successfully dominates the National Assembly through its controlling
 share of a ruling coalition. In December 1995, the National Assembly passed amend-
 ments to the 1972 Constitution which were promulgated in January by President
 Biya. The amendments for the first time provide for presidential term limits and
 certain new legislative institutions, including an independent judiciary, which re-
 mains subject to political influence, a partially elected senate, and elected regional
 councils. However, the amendments have not yet been implemented and have done
 little to strengthen the independence of the judiciary or to moderate the President's
 power to dominate legislation, or rule by decree. In January the country held its
 first nationwide municipal elections.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the national police, the National
 Intelligence Service (DGRE), the gendarmerie, the Ministry of Territorial Adminis-
 tration, military intelligence, the army, and to a lesser extent, the Presidential Se-
 curity Service. The police and the gendarmerie have dominant roles in enforcing in-
 ternal security laws. The security forces, including the military forces, remain under
 the effective control of the President, the civilian Minister of Defense, and the civil-
 ian head of police. The police and gendarmes continued to commit numerous human
 rights abuses.
 Following nearly a decade of economic decline and widening financial imbalance,
 the 1994 c Fa franc devaluation substantially restored external competitiveness. Eco-
 nomic growth recovered, averaging more than 3 percent annually over the last 3
 years. The majority of the population is rural. The Government has begun imple-
 menting a program of structural reforms. Agriculture accounts for one-third of gross
 domestic product, while industry and the services sector account, for 26 and 33 per-
 cent, respectively. The petroleum sector has declined sharply as a share of public
 revenues. Principal exports include timber, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, and rub-
 ber.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor, although there was
 some improvement in certain areas. The Government continued to commit numer-
 ous serious human rights abuses. Citizens' ability to change their government re-
 mained limited. Security forces committed several extrajudicial killings and often
 beat and otherwise abused detainees and prisoners, generally with impunity. Condi-
 tions remained life threatening in almost all prisons. Security forces continued to
 arrest and detain citizens arbitrarily, often holding them for prolonged periods and,
 at times, incommunicado. The judiciary is corrupt, inefficient, and subject to politi-
 cal influence. Security forces conducted illegal searches, harassed citizens, infringed
 on their privacy, and monitored some opposition activists. A January law revoked
 formal press censorship and moved supervision of the press from the administrative
 authorities to the courts. However, the Government continued to impose some limits
 on press freedom. The authorities retain the power to seize publications deemed to
 put public order in jeopardy and used this power on at least two occasions. Although
 independent newspapers enjoyed considerable latitude to publish their views, jour-
 nalists were subject to harassment, trial, and conviction under criminal libel laws.
 Authorities prosecuted and obtained convictions against several editors and journal-
 ists under these laws, and some received stiff fines and prison sentences. The Gov-
 ernment sometimes restricted freedom of assembly and association. At times, secu-
 rity forces were used to inhibit political parties from holding public meetings. The
 Government restricts freedom of movement. Discrimination and violence against
 women remain serious problems.
 
 
 Discrimination against ethnic minorities and Pygmies persists. The Government
 infringes on workers' rights, and slavery persists in an isolated northern region.
 Mob violence and intertribal disputes resulted in dozens of deaths. Nationwide
 multiparty municipal elections were relatively free and fair, although in some areas
 the Government restricted opposition candidate lists. After the election, the Govern-
 ment used legal but undemocratic means to ensure its control of municipal councils
 won by the opposition, provoking widespread protest and an attempt to conduct gen-
 eral strikes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political killings. However, the security forces continued to use excessive, lethal
 force and committed several extrajudicial killings.
 In February an unarmed, unresisting taxi driver was shot and killed by a police-
 man near Bafut, Northwest province, in view of' witnesses. The reasons for the
 shooting are unclear. The authorities took no action against the policeman, but an
 investigation into the case is underway.
 On March 1, a pregnant woman was shot and killed by a soldier in the Limbe,
 Southwest province, market during a political demonstration by the Social Demo-
 cratic Front (SDF) party. In the incident, the killer himself was immediately ihot
 and killed by a fellow soldier. Security forces killed three other persons in an ensu-
 ingriot.
 On March 15, Andre Tchieutcho, a suspected thief, was shot and killed inside the
 Mboppi gendarme headquarters.
 On April 14, police outside Yaounde fired on a stolen vehicle, killing, in addition
 to the suspectd perpetrators, two apparently innocent young men who had been
 given a ride by the alleged thieves.
 On May 24, a Douala taxi driver, Joseph Desire Tuete Kuipo, was shot and killed
 by a policeman when he allegedly refused to pay a bribe at one of the ubiquitous
 and illegal police roadblocks. An outraged crowd attacked the policeman, seriously
 injuring him. At year's end, an investigation into the killing was underway. The po-
 lice officer was suspended pending the results of the investigation.
 In January Haman Daouda, a member of the National Union for Democracy and
 Progress (UNDP) party and a member of the National Assembly and members of
 his staff were assaulted while campaigning in the municipal elections in the terri-
 tory of the Lamido (chief) of Mayo Rey, North province. The Lamido, an important
 supporter of the ruling CPDM party, reportedly directed his palace guard to injure
 or kill the parliamentarians. Haman Daouda died in February as a result of his in-
 juries. UNDP demands for a government investigation were unsuccessful. A continu-
 ing series of intertribal land disputes in Northwest province resulted in several
 deaths and injuries.
 In March residents of the villages of Babanki and Bambili, Northwest province,
 battled over the ownership of a section of land adjoining both villages. Seven per-
 sons died. This clash was but one of several that occurred during the year in North-
 west province, resulting in an unknown number of deaths and injuries. In response,
 the Government sought to resolve the dispute with the assistance of traditional rul-
 ers. Several persons were arrested for their participation in the violence.
 Mob violence directed at persons suspected of criminal activity or witchcraft re-
 suited in a number of deaths and injuries.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, in June a prominent Bafoussam, West province, barrister and SDF activ-
 ist, Joseph Lavoisier Tsapy, claimed that he had been seized by armed plainclothes
 policemen, blindfolded, and held for 4 days in an unknown location before being re-
 leased unharmed. The period of his disappearance coincided with a planned SDF
 general strike in Bafoussam, for which Tsapy, President of the Town Council, was
 a leading organizer. While government authorities denied any involvement in
 Tsapy's disappearance, and the charges were never proved, many independent ob-
 servers considered Tsapy's claim credible.
 In September Nicolas Tejoumessie, editor of the newspaper Challenge Nouveau,
 was arbitrarily detained and beaten by four persons who claimed to be members of
 the secret police (see Section 1.c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code proscribes torture, renders inadmissible in court evidence obtained
 thereby, and prohibits public servants from using undue force against any person.
 In spite of this, there were credible reports that security forces inflicted beatings
 and other cruel and degrading treatment on prisoners and detainees. The beatings
 
 
 occurred not in prison facilities but in temporary detention areas in a police or gen-
 darme facility.
 Security forces subject prisoners and detainees to degrading mistreatment, includ-
 ing stripping, confinement in severely overcrowded cells, and denial of access to toi-
 lets or other sanitation facilities. Police and gendarmes often beat detainees to ex-
 tract confessions and the names and whereabouts of alleged criminals. Sanctions
 against those responsible are rare.
 Prison conditions are life threatening, especially outside major urban areas. Seri-
 ous deficiencies in food, health care, and sanitation owing to the lack of resources
 occur in almost all prisons, including those run by traditional rulers in the north.
 Families are permitted to provide food and medicine. Beatings are common. Pris-
 oners are reported to be chained at times in their cells and often denied adequate
 medical care. Juveniles and nonviolent prisoners are often incarcerated with violent
 adults. There are credible reports of sexual abuse of juvenile prisoners by adult in-
 mates. Corruption among prison personnel is widespread. Some high profile pris-
 oners are able to avoid some of the abuse that is routinely meted out to many com-
 mon criminals. Some are held in elite wings of certain prisons where they enjoy rel-
 atively lenient treatment.
 Following a March SDF demonstration in Limbe, security forces arrested 32 SDF
 members and held them under administrative detention in Buea Prison for more
 than 1 month pending investigation. There were credible reports that the prisoners
 suffered from excessive crowding and were denied adequate nutrition and medical
 care.
 In the north, the Government permits traditional Lamibe (chiefs) to operate pri-
 vate prisons outside the government penitentiary system. Private prisons in the
 chiefdoms of Rey Bouba, Bibemi, and Tcheboa have the worst reputations. Members
 of the UNDP party alleged that their members have been detained in them and that
 some have died from mistreatment.
 Because of the Government's refusal to guarantee the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) access to all detention centers, official as well as unofficial,
 the ICRC has declined to visit any prisons since 1992, although both the
 Cameroonian Red Cross and the National Human Rights Commission make fre-
 quent visits.
 In a May and June student strike at the University of Yaounde, a number of stu-
 dents were beaten both by police and by local thugs on university property, and as
 many as 30 were taken to prison and beaten there. Credible reports indicate that
 the troublemakers were encouraged by university authorities to help suppress the
 strike. Some of the students were held in prison for up to 40 days before teing re-
 leased pending court proceedings.
 On September 8, Nicolas Tejoumessie, the editor of Challenge Nouveau, a promi-
 nent opposition newspaper, was seized at the doorway of his home in Douala by 4
 men dressed in civilian clothing and taken to a location 30 kilometers outside the
 city, where he was severely beaten. His assailants allegedly claimed they were from
 the DGRE. During the beating, Tejoumessie's assailants reportedly interrogated him
 about his journalistic sources and warned him to cease his criticism of the Govern-
 ment. The identity of his assailants remains unknown.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code requires that detainees
 be brought promptly before a magistrate; however, security forces continued to arbi-
 trarily arrest and detain citizens, although less frequently than in the past. Arbi-
 trary, prolonged detention remained a serious problem as security forces often failed
 to bring detainees promptly before a magistrate and held them incommunicado.
 Police may detain a person in custody in connection with a common crime for up
 to 24 hours, renewable 3 times, before bringing charges. However, the law only pro-
 vides for the right to a judicial review of the legality of detention in the few majority
 Angophone areas of the country. Elsewhere, the Francophone legal tradition ap-
 plies, preciuding judicial authorities from acting on a case until the administrative
 authority that ordered the detention turns the case over to the prosecutor. After a
 magistrate has issued a warrant to bring the case to trial, he may hold the detainee
 in pretrial detention" indefinitely, pending court action. Furthermore, a 1990 law
 permits detention without charge for renewable periods of 15 days in order to com-
 at banditry and maintain public order. Persons taken into detention are frequently
 denied access to both legal counsel and family members. The law permits release
 on bail only in the Anglophone provinces, where the legal system includes features
 of British common law. Even there, bail is granted infrequently.
 In March, 32 SDF militants arrested following a demonstration in Limbe were ar-
 bitrarily detained for more than 1 month despite a court finding that there were
 no grounds for holding them (see Section 1.c.). Prison authorities cited the detention
 provisions of a 1990 law. The prisoners were finally released in mid-April without
 
 
 charges being filed. The Buea court, however, found the local government prefect
 in contempt and fined him for not respecting the court's earlier order to release the
 prisoners.
 The courts punished some instances of arbitrary detention. A Yaounde court in
 March convicted six policemen (four of them in absentia) on charges of having arbi-
 trarily arrested, beaten, and detained a deputy magistrate in October 1994. The
 court sentenced all the policemen to long prison terms and heavy fines.
 In July a Bamenda, Northwest province, court ordered a police officer to pay a
 heavy fine to a woman whom he beat and wrongfully detained.
 The Government does not practice political exile. Some opposition members who
 considered themselves threatened by the Government have voluntarily left the coun-
 try and declared themselves to be in political exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Constitutional amendments ratified in January
 provide for an independent judiciary. However, the judiciary remains subject to po-
 litical influence, and the Government took no concrete steps to implement the
 amendments. The courts did demonstrate a notable degree of independence in deal-
 ingwith complaints in the aftermath of the January municipal elections.
 The court system remains technically part of the executive branch, subordinate
 to the Ministry of Justice. The legal system is strongly influenced by the French
 legal system, although in the Anglophone provinces certain aspects of the Anglo-
 Saxon tradition apply. The court system includes the Supreme Court, a court of ap-
 peals in each of the 10 provinces, and courts of first instance in each of the country's
 56 divisions. Some politically sensitive cases are never heard.
 Traditional courts are important in rural areas. Their authority varies by region
 and ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters of property and domestic disputes
 and may serve a probate function as well. Most traditional courts permit appeal of
 their decisions to traditional authorities of higher rank.
 Corruption and inefficiency in the courts remain serious problems. Justice is fre-
 quently denied or delayed. Powerful political or business interests appear to enjoy
 virtual immunity from prosecution, while critics of the Government are sometimes
 jailed under libel statutes considered by observers as unduly restrictive of press
 freedom. Prisoners may be detained indefinitely during pretrial proceedings.
 Because appointed attorneys receive little compensation, the quality of legal rep-
 resentation for indigent persons is often poor. The bar association and some vol-
 untary organizations, such as the Cameroonian Association of Female Jurists, offer
 free assistance in some cases. Trials are public.
 In a highly charged case with political overtones that began in July 1994, 8 of
 28 UNDP party militants were convicted in March and sentenced to lengthy prison
 terms for having participated in or abetted a riot to protest the visit to Maroua, Far
 North province, of a government official. One person was killed when rioters at-
 tacked the official's motorcade with stones. Court proceedings were characterized by
 repeated delays and irregularities that, at least in part, appear to have been politi-
 cally motivated. Some of the defendants convicted were shown never to have been
 present at the demonstration but were sentenced on the presumption that they had
 encouraged the rioters. At year's end, the sentences were still under appeal. Credi-
 ble observers disagree as to whether these convictions were based on political or
 criminal grounds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Both
 invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are illegal in most cir-
 cumstances, but there were a number of credible reports that police and gendarmes
 harassed citizens, conducted searches without warrants, and seized mail. Security
 forces frequently used roadblocks to extract bribes.
 In April Conscience Africaine, a human rights organization, reported repeated
 tampering with its mail. The organization's headquarters was also burglarized; fies
 as well as valuable equipment were taken. Police failed to conduct a serious inves-
 tigation, in the view of Conscience Africaine.
 In June the Governor of West province ordered gendarmes to seal off the house
 of barrister Joseph Lavoisier Tsapy for several days to prevent entry or egress. Ac-
 cording to authorities, the measure was taken because Tsapy was engaged in en-
 couraging violent civil disorder during an SDF-inspired general strike (see Section
 1.b.). Authorities termed their action a legal measure intended to preserve public
 order.
 Prior to the summit of the Organization of African Unity held in Yaounde in July,
 police conducted widespread preemptive searches in some neighborhoods for sus-
 pected criminals. These were aimed at providing security for the meeting. The
 searches included entry into private homes without warrants, an act permitted by
 the law. The law permits a police officer to enter a private home during daylight
 hours without a warrant if he is pursuing an inquiry and has reason to suspect that
 
 
 36
 a crime has been committed. He must have a warrant to make such a search after
 dark. However, a police officer may enter a private home at any time in pursuit of
 a criminal observed committing a crime. An administrative authority may authorize
 police to conduct neighborhood sweeps in search of suspected criminals or stolen or
 illegal goods without individual warrants. Such sweeps are conducted frequently.
 There were numerous credible reports that the Government kept some opposition
 activists and dissidents under surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and the press; however, the Government continued to impose some limits on
 these rights. In contrast with past years, the press enjoyed considerable liberty to
 publish due to the repeal of a law that had authorized press censorship by the Gov-
 ernment. Nevertheless, the Government prosecuted nine editors and journalists on
 criminal libel charges, and courts imposed stiff fines and jail terms. In only one case
 did a journalist actually serve time in prison, however, and he was provisionally re-
 leased after only 2 days. Some of these charges appeared to have been politically
 motivated. In addition, there were at least two instances in which the Government
 demanded that newspapers be seized under court orders, citing laws authorizing
 preservation of public order.
 The Government publishes an official newspaper, the Cameroon Tribune, and op-
 erates all radio and television broadcasting. The law has provided since 1990 for the
 licensing of private radio and television stations, but the Government has not ap-
 proved implementing regulations. Government reporters rarely criticize the ruling
 party or portray government programs in an unfavorable light, but sometimes do
 so implicitly. The government-controlled broadcast media provide broad coverage of
 CPDM functions, while giving relatively little attention to opposition events.
 While 40 to 50 private newspapers are published sporadically, only about 10 were
 published on a regular basis during the year. These newspapers are often outspoken
 in their criticism of theiPresident, the Government, corruption, and economic poli-
 cies. Because of the high cost of a newspaper to an average citizen, as well as dis-
 tribution problems, newspapers are not read widely outside the major cities.
 Television and radio programming includes a weeklyprogram that allows an op-
 portunity for political parties represented in the National Assembly to present their
 views. In contrast with past years, the program faced no arbitrary suspensions al-
 though in September one UNDP program was censored. None of the country's non-
 parliamentary parties, including those that are known to have significant popular
 support, had access to the electronic media.
 On February 27, Pis Njawe and Eyoum Ngangue, the publisher and editor, re-
 spectively, of Le Messager Popoi, were onvited in Douala of having libeled the
 President. The article in question was a satirical piece in which the President was
 referred to by an insulting name. Eyoum Ngangue was sentenced to 1 year in prison
 and a $600 fine; Pius Njawe was sentenced to 1 year in prison and a $200 fine. The
 two journalists appealed their sentences to an appeals court, which confirmed the
 sentences. Pius Njawe was subsequently arreste on October 29 and jailed in a
 Douala prison. Following widespread domestic and international criticism, he was
 released on November 15 on provisional liberty at the order of the Supreme Court,
 which agreed to review his request that the decision of the appeals court be invali-
 dated. At year's end, Pius Njawe and Eyoum Ngangue remained at liberty and con-
 tinued their journalistic activities.
 In March two issues of the newspaper Dikalo were seized in Douala on orders of
 the governor of Littoral province on grounds that articles in the newspaper dis-
 turbed the public order. One of the offending articles charged that President Biya
 had placed government delegates as administrators of certain towns to counter the
 results of municipal elections in which opposition mayors were freely elected. A sec-
 ond article reported opposition party plans to stage a series of general strikes.
 In April Pius Njawe and journalist Tietcheu Kameni were fined and sentenced to
 prison terms on charges of having libeled the Deputy Prime Minister in Charge of
 Territorial Administration. Their article accused the deputy Prime Minister of de-
 frauding voters by interfering with the electoral registration process. While the two
 were found guilty of defamation of character, they were found not guilty of proPa-
 gating false news. At year's end, the case was being reviewed on appeal, and neither
 Njawe or Kameni have yet served time in prison on these charges.
 In May Vianney Ombey Ndzana, publisher of the newspaper Generation, was sen-
 tenced to a 5-month prison term and a heavy fine for having defamed the character
 of the director general of an important state-owned petroleum firm. An article in
 Ndzana's newspaper accused the Director General of financial improprieties. The
 court also suspended publication of his newspaper for 6 months. At year's end, both
 
 
 the prison term and the suspension remain under appeal, and neither had been im-
 plemented.
 In June Njawe and journalist Paul Nyemb were ordered to pay a large sum to
 the former mayor of the town of Sangmelima on grounds that they had libeled him.
 At year's end, the court's decision remained under appeal.
 In June Patrice Ndedi Penda, publisher of Galaxie, was sentenced to 2 years in
 prison and a large fine for having libeled the Minister of State in charge of agri-
 culture. At year's end, Ndedi Penda had not been jailed, and his case remained
 under appeal.
 In August Samuel Eleme, publisher of the newspaper La Detente and journalist
 Gaston Ekwalla were sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment and a heavy fine on
 charges that they libeled a CPDM (ruling party) member of the National Assembly.
 In addition, the newspaper was suspended from publication for 6 months. At year's
 end, the newspaper remained under suspension, but Eleme and Ekwalla had not
 been jailed. Their case remained under appeal.
 On December 12, publisher William Mandio and reporter Daniel Atangana of the
 newspaper Le Front Independent were arrested by the presidential guard and held
 in the Center Province gendarmerie legion building in Yaounde. The motives for
 their arrest appeared to have been presidential guard's dissatisfaction with an arti-
 cle that the two had published that was critical of the unit. Mandio was released
 on December 15 and Atangana was released approximately 2 weeks later. At year's
 end, there were no charges pendingagainst the two men.
 In August Pierre Essama Essomba, the managing editor of the government Cam-
 eroon Tribune, was arrested and briefly detained on orders of the then-Minister of
 Justice on grounds that the editor had allowed a libelous letter about the Justice
 Minister to be published. Essama Essomba was released within hours of his arrest
 on orders of the Minister of State in charge of communication, who cited the editr's
 right to publish the letter.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on academic freedom, state security in-
 formants operate on university campuses. Many professors believe that adherence
 to opposition political parties can have an adverse effect on their professional oppor-
 tunities and advancement. Free political discussion at the University of Yaounde is
 dampened by the presence of armed security forces, as well as sometimes strident
 pro-oppsition groups. Other universities and educational institutions appeared to
 be relatively free of the coercive presence of armed security forces or strident stu-
 dent groups. During a May-June strike at the University, university authorities
 used the police and vigilante gangs to suppress student activists. Several students
 were beaten and arfested during campus clashes (see Section 1.c. Four alle ed
 leaders of the strike have been banned from any Cameroonian universities and isce
 trial on charges of assault. While the accused student leaders deny that they insti-
 gated violence, a number of university teachers and administrators claim that they
 were targets of death threats and intimidation by students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly is pro-
 vided for in the law, but the Government sometimes restricts this right in practice.
 The Penal Code prohibits public meetings, demonstrations, or processions without
 prior government approval.
 In May the Governor of Southwest province issued an order banning all political
 activities within the province, including meetings and rallies. He took this step in
 response to efforts by the SDF and UNDP to organize general strikes to protest the
 Government's decision to impose government delegates on several municipalities
 won by the opposition in the January elections.
 In March, Yaounde police used tear gas to break up a demonstration by aged re-
 tirees who had gathered in front of the National Social Security Office to demand
 payment of their back pensions. Several of the elderly victims were injured by the
 tear gas.
 Freedom of association is provided for in the law, but the Government sometimes
 restricts this right in practice. Some 120 political parties operated legally together
 with a growing number of civic associations. In contrast with 1995, when many po-
 litical parties faced government-imposed restrictions on their ability to assemble and
 operate, there were few such restrictions in 1996.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally does not restrict it in practice. Religious groups must be ap-
 p roved and registered with the Ministry of Territorial Administration in order to
 function legally.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law does not restrict freedom of movement within the country, but
 the Government does in fact impede domestic travel. Police frequently stop travelers
 to check identification documents, vehicle registrations, and tax receipts as security
 
 
 and immigration control measures. Police commonly demand illegal payments from
 citizens whom they stop at roadblocks or other points.
 The Government occasionally uses its passport control powers against those whom
 it considers potential threats. Victorin Hameni Bieleu, the President of the Union
 of Cameroonian Democratic Forces (UFDC) party, had his passport withdrawn 5
 years ago. He has since been unable to obtain a new one. Some student activists
 implicated in the May-June Yaounde clashes have also been unable to obtain pass-
 ports.
 In Bamenda, Northwest province, in May, antigovernment strikers prevented
 some citizens from traveling to work, using physical intimidation and smashing car
 windshields.
 Cameroon has long served as a safe haven for displaced persons and refugees
 from nearby countries. Although the Government occasionally returns illegal immi-
 grants, there were no reports of forced repatriation of recognized refugees. Some ille-
 gal immigrants have been subjected to harsh treatment including imprisonment.
 The Government cooperates with the offie of the U-N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government provides first asylum to persons who arrive at the border without docu-
 mentation and can show a valid claim to refugee status. There are currently 46,000
 refugees in Cameroon for whom the country is a country of first asylum. The major-
 ity of these persons-nearly 42,000-are Chadian. The remainder are principally
 from Liberia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi, and Zaire. There were 1,400 refu-
 gees who arrived in Cameroon as a country of first asylum in 1996. The Government
 accepts for resettlement refugees who are granted refugee status by the UNHCR.
 In 1996 Cameroon accepted approximately 30 Rwandan refugees from Tanzania for
 resettlement. There were no reports of fo2-ced expulsion of persons having a valid
 claim to refugee status during the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the Constitutional right to change their government, but dominance
 of the political process by the President and his party limit the ability of citizens
 to exercise this right. While the 1992 legislative elections were relatively free and
 fair, the 1992 presidential elections were highly criticized by international observers
 and widely viewed as fraudulent.
 The January nationwide multiparty municipal elections were judged to be gen-
 erally free and fair by domestic and international observers, including members of
 the diplomatic community. Opposition parties won victories in 104 of 336 elections
 contested. In most, but not all, locations, elections appeared to be conducted largely
 in accordance with the rules and to respect the will of the voters. Diplomatic observ-
 ers watching the elections at booths around the country on voting day reported few
 signs of deliberate malfeasance on that particular day. Opposition parties, in par-
 ticular, have complained that the vote in many places was skewed in favor of the
 Government by preelectoral manipulation of voter registration lists. These allega-
 tions have been very difficult to prove. Several parties complained that their lists
 of candidates in specific locations were arbitrarily and illegally rejected by govern-
 ment-controlled administrative authorities shortly before election day. Such claims
 form the basis of many of the challenges that were filed with the Supreme Court.
 The Court ruled itself incompetent to judge in many of these cases. Government au-
 thorities claim that they did not arbitrarily reject lists of opposition candidates.
 Rather, they say, the lists contained some error of format or procedure that ren-
 dered them inadmissible under the law.
 While opposition parties scored major gains in the municipal elections in most
 urban areas and in the north and west, the center and south voted solidly for the
 President's CPDM party. Opposition parties charged that the Government illegit-
 imately excluded them from contesting many localities, particularly in the center
 and south, in order to preserve the region as a CPDM stronghold. A total of 96 cases
 were filed with the Supreme Court. In the opinion of observers, the Supreme Court
 demonstrated a considerable degree of independence and respect for the law in its
 handling of these cases. By year's end, the Supreme Court had disposed of all 96
 cases. A though the Court declared itself, on technical and legal grounds, unable to
 rule in a majority of the cases brought before it, in 18 cases it declared elections
 null and void. In annulling these elections, the Court demonstrated no bias for or
 against the ruling party. Contrary to the law, however, the Government has to date
 failed to organize new elections in those councils in which the elections were an-
 nulled, allowing councils with no legal authority to continue functioning.
 A second aspect to the municipal election controversy involves the Government's
 appointment of delegates to head the administrations of several municipalities won
 
 
 by opposition parties. Under a 1993 decree the President has the authority to name
 a government delegate to head municipal councils in urban centers. Opposition par-
 ties viewed these appointments as a deliberate attempt by the Government to frus-
 trate the will of the voters. To protest these appointments, the two major opposition
 parties, the SDF and the UNDP, sought to stage a series of rotating general strikes.
 These, however, failed to draw widespread support from the economically and politi-
 cally dispirited population and were called off in June.
 The Government's ontrol over the countys administrative apparatus is broad
 and deep. The President appoints by decree the chief operating official (the govern-
 ment delegate) of Yaounde, 1ouala, Bamenda, and several other large cities. These
 delegates easily dominate the elected municipal councils, most of whose members
 belong to opposition parties. The governors of each of the provinces are also ap-
 pointed directly by the President . Important lower level members of the provincial
 administrative structures, including the senior divisional officers, the divisional offi-
 cers, and the district chiefs are all career civil servants appointed by the Prime
 Minister. The governors and senior divisional officers wield considerable authority
 within the areas under their jurisdiction, including, significantly, the authority to
 ban political meetings that they deem likely to threaten public order. A majority of
 important government jobs are held by close confidants of the President, many of
 them drawn from his own ethnic group.
 In December 1995, the National Assembly passed a set of government-introduced
 amendments to the 1972 Constitution, which established strongly centralized power.
 All debate was held behind closed doors. The amendments included term limits for
 the President, the creation of a partially elected (70 percent) and partially appointed
 (30 percent) Senate, and the creation of a set of regional councils with limited pow-
 ers over local affairs. The amendments did not weaken presidential powers, and the
 independence of the judiciary remained questionable. The amendments were pro-
 mulgated by the President in January, but have not yet been implemented.
 There are no laws that specifically prohibit women or minorities from participat-
 ing in government, in the political process, or in other areas of public life. Women
 are underrepresented in the President's Cabinet (2 of the 44 members), in the Na-
 tional Assembly (22 of the 180 members), and in the CPDM. Many of the key mem-
 bers of the Government are drawn from the President's own ethnic group; members
 of other ethnic groups and regions hold 32 seats in the Cabinet (compared with 12
 held by members of the President's ethnic group), and 142 seats in the National As-
 sembly (compared with 32 held by members of the President's ethnic group).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic and international human rights monitoring groups have considerable
 latitude to operate. A large number of independent human rights monitoring groups
 exist, although the activities of virtually all are limited by a shortage of funds and
 trained personnel. The Government did not generally prevent human rights mon-
 itors from operating, but on occasion harassed and obstructed them. The Govern-
 ment sometimes impedes the effectiveness of human rights NGO's by limiting access
 to Vrisoners and refusing to share information.
 The most active human rights NGO's include the National League for Human
 Rights, the Organization for Human Rights and Freedoms, the Association of
 Women Against Violence, the Cameronian Association of Female Jurists, the
 Cameroonian Association for Children's Rights, Conscience Africaine, the Movement
 for the Defense of Human Rights and Liberties, the Human Rights Defense Group,
 and the Human Rights Clinic and Education Center. A number of these groups is-
 sued press releases or reports detailing specific human rights violations. Many held
 seminars and workshops on various aspects of human rights.
 The governmental National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, al-
 thoughhampered by a shortage of funds, conducted a number of investigations into
 human rights abuses and organized several human rights seminars aimed at judi-
 cial officials, security personnel, and other government officers. The Commission has
 never, however, published any results of its investigations. Its reports have been
 submitted to the Prime Minister and President but never released.
 In February Cameroon hosted the first general conference of African National
 Human Rights Institutions in Yaounde. The conference, organized by the National
 Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, sought to facilitate the exchange of
 information and strengthen cooperation among Africa's national human rights orga-
 nizations and encourage states without human rights monitoring bodies to create
 them. In September the Government hosted a visit by the U.N. Nations Human
 Rights Commission. It requested that the Commission establish a regional human
 ights office in Yaounde. In mid-November, the Government cooperated with the
 
 
 ICRC in holding a workshop attended by 23 African nations that addressed the rela-
 tionship between international human rights and military operations. Military per-
 sonnel participated in the workshop.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and mandates that "every-
 one has equal rights and obligations." It does not explicitly forbid discrimination
 based on race, language, religion, or social status. The Government does not effec-
 tively enforce these constitutional provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women remains at high levels. Women's rights advo-
 cates report that the law does not impose effective penalties against persons who
 commit acts of domestic violence against women. Spouse abuse is not a legal ground
 for divorce. In cases of sexual assault, a victim's family or village often imposes di-
 rect, summary punishment upon the suspected perpetrator through means ranging
 from destruction of property to beating. While there are no reliable statistics on vio-
 lence against women, the number of newspaper reports indicates that the frequency
 is high.
 Despite constitutional provisions recognizing women's rights, women do not, in
 fact, enjoy the same rights and privileges as men. Polygyny is permitted by law and
 tradition, but polyandry is not. The extent to which a woman may inherit from her
 husband is normally governed by traditional law in the absence of a will, and cus-
 toms vary from group to group. In many traditional societies, custom grants greater
 authority and benefits to male than to female heirs. In cases of divorce, the hus-
 band's wishes determine custody of children over the age of 6. While a man may
 be convicted of adultery only if the sexual act takes place in his home, a female may
 be convicted without respect to venue. In the northern provinces, some Lamibe re-
 portedly prevent their numerous wives from ever leaving the palaces.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for a child's right to education, and school-
 ing is mandatory through the age of 14. Nevertheless, rising school fees and costs
 for books have forced many families to forego sending their children to school. Ba-
 bies and small children are sometimes held in prison if their mothers are incarcer-
 ated. The degree of familial child abuse is not known but is one of several targeted
 issues of children's rights organizations.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which has been condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not widely
 practiced, but is practiced in some areas of Far North and Southwest provinces. It
 includes the most severe form of the abuse, infibulation, and is usually practiced
 on preadolescent girls. The Government does not recognize FGM as a problem and
 has not allocated resources to educate the public on the problem.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1983 law and subsequent implementing legislation
 provide certain rights for persons with disabilities. These include access to public
 institutions, medical treatment, and education. The Government is obliged to bear
 part of a disabled person's educational expenses, to employ disabled persons where
 possible, and, as necessary, to provide them with public assistance. However, these
 rights are in fact rarely respected. There are few facilities for disabled persons and
 little public assistance of any kind. Lack of facilities and care for the mentally dis-
 abled is particularly acute. Society tends to treat the disabled as tainted, leaving
 churches or foreign NGO's responsible for providing assistance. The law does not
 mandate special accessprovisions for people with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.--Cameron's population of indigenous Baka Pygmies (a term
 which in fact encompasses several different ethnic groups) primarily resides in the
 forested areas of the south and southeast. While no legal discrimination exists,
 other groups often treat them as inferis oand sometimes subject them to virtual
 slave labor.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are frequent and credible allegations
 of discrimination among Cameroon's more than 200 ethnic groups. President Biya's
 Beti ethnic group holds key positions in government, the security forcde, and the
 military services. In other sectors, discrimination by other ethnic groups is common.
 Virtually all ethnic groups provide preferential treatment to fellow members where
 they are able to do so.
 An important ethnic, political division falls along linguistic lines rooted in the co-
 lonial period. The Anglophone minority (20 percent) often charges that the
 Francophone majority does not share real power and that the Government provides
 fewer economic benefits to English-speaking regions.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assodation.-A 1992 Labor Code allows workers to form and join
 trade unions of their choosing. The Labor Code permits groups of at least 20 work-
 ers to organize a union but also requires registration with the Ministry of Labor.
 In practice, independent unions have found it extremely difficult to obtain registra-
 tion. Registered unions are invariably subject to government domination and inter-
 ference.
 Provisions of the Labor Code do not apply to civil servants, employees of the peni-
 tentiary system, or workers responsible or national security. In lieu of strikes, civil
 servants are required to negotiate grievances directly with the minister of the con-
 cerned department and with the Minister of Labor. Some sections of the Labor Code
 have never taken effect, as not all of the implementing decrees have been issued.
 No new implementing decrees were issued during the year.
 There are two trade union confederations. In March 1995, the Government en-
 couraged the creation of a new labor confederation, the Union of Free Trade Unions
 of Cameroon (USLC), with which it maintains close ties. Previously, the sole labor
 confederation had been the Confederation of Cameroonian Trade Unions (CCTU),
 formerly affiliated with the ruling CPDM party under the name Organization of
 Cameroonian Trade Unions. While both organizations appear to be dominated or at
 least thoroughly intimidated by the Government, the creation of the USLC was
 widely interpreted as an effort by the Government to create a rival trade union con-
 federation more firmly under its control.
 The Labor Code explicitly recognizes workers' right to strike but only after man-
 datory arbitration. Arbitration proceedings are not legally enforceable and can be
 overturned by the Government. The Labor Code provides for the protection of legal
 strikes and prohibits retribution against them.
 There were several strikes during the year. In January workers from the dis-
 banded Urban Transport Company demonstrated in front of the Prime Minister's of-
 fice to demand social services and other assistance. Police broke up this peaceful
 demonstration.
 In March employees of the national airline, Cameroon Airlines, staged a 1-day
 strike to protest staff retrenchment, nonpayment of retirement benefits, and plans
 to privatize the airline.
 Throughout much of the year teachers in many parts of the country joined a rotat-
 ing 2-days-per-week strike to protest nonpayment of back salaries and difficult
 working conditions.
 In Bafoussam, West province, teachers' strikes severely disrupted the academic
 year. In some cases, striking teachers tried to prevent some of their colleagues from
 carrying out their duties. In an incident in Bafoussam, striking teachers tried to dis-
 rupt student examinations, leading to fights and 12 arrests. The arrested teachers
 were released after brief detentions.
 The CCTU is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 (OATUU) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The
 USLC filed applications for membership with these organizations in 1995. At year's
 end, the USL   was still awaiting a response to its bid to join the OATUU and
 ICFTU.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining between workers and management in work places, as well as
 between labor federations and business associations in each sector of the economy.
 Nevertheless, no sectoral collective bargaining negotiations had been undertaken by
 year's end.
 In May some shop owners in West province and in Douala were reportedly pun-
 ished by government authorities with tmes and temporary closure for having heeded
 a call by SDF leaders to support a general strike.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employers guilty of such
 discrimination are subject to fines of up to $2,000. However, employers found guilty
 are not required to reinstate the workers against whom they discriminated. The
 Ministry of Labor reprted no complaints of such discrimination during the year.
 The International    r 0ranizationnoted that the Government has failed since
 1991 to recognize the NationaUnion of Teachers of Higher Education.
 There is an industrial free zone regime, but the Government did not grant ap-
 proval to any firms to operate under it during the year. Free zone employers are
 exempt from some provisions of the Labor Code but must respect all internationally
 recognized worker rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Labor Code. However, the authorities continued to allow prison in-
 mates to be contracted out to private employers or used as communal labor for mu-
 nicipal public works.
 
 
 There are credible reports that slavery continues to be practiced in the Lamidat
 of Rey Bouba, an isolated traditional kingdom in the North province.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code forbids the em-
 ployment of children under the age of 14. However, Ministry of Labor inspectors re-
 sponsible for enforcing the law lack resources for an effective inspection program.
 In rural areas, many children begin work at an early age on family farms. Often,
 rural youth, especially girls, are employed by relatives as domestic helpers, while
 many urban street vendors are under 14 years of age. There are no special provi-
 sions limiting working hours for children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Under the Labor Code, the Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for setting a single minimum wage applicable nationwide in all sec-
 tors. The present wage is approximately $47 (23,500 cfa francs) per month. The min-
 imum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for an average worker and
 family.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard workweek of 40 hours in public and pri-
 vate nonagricultural firms, and 48 hours in agricultural and related activities. The
 Code makes compulsory at least 24 consecutive hours of weekly rest. The Govern-
 ment sets health and safety standards, and Ministry of Labor inspectors and occu-
 pational health doctors are responsible for monitoring these standards. However,
 they lack the resources for a comprehensive inspection program. There is no specific
 legislation permitting workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situa-
 tions without jeopardy to continued employment.
