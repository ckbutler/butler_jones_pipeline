 LIBERIA
 The Liberian Constitution provides for an American-style
 democratic system of government and guaranteed rights and
 freedoms for the individual. However, in practice, Liberia is
 tuled by Samuel K. Doe, who-came to power in a coup d'etat in
 1980 and-transformed his military regime to a civilian
 government after being elected President in 1986 in elections
 widely believed to have been rigged in his favor. He and his
 ruling party, the National Democratic Party of Liberia (NDPL),
 with strong backing from the military, increasingly dominate
 Liberian political life. Three opposition parties are legally
 recognized and permitted to function, but they continue to
 protest the Government's conduct of the 1985 elections and
 decided not to participate in the 1989 by-elections.
 The army continues to be a bulwark of the current
 3dministration and has major responsibility for internal
 security functions. Military indiscipline continues to result
 in harassment of civilians. A small police force is used for
 maintaining domestic order. At the end of the year, a small
 group of regime-opponents crossed the Liberian/Cote d'Ivoire
 border into Nimba county, assassinating local officials and
 killing unarmed civilians. In responding to these attacks,
 elements within the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) are credibly
 reported to have ignored orders to avoid attacks on innocent
 civilians, an unknown number of whom were killed. Both
 dissidents and AFL troops have largely concentrated their
 actions against civilian members of ethnic groups not their
 own. This conflict also resulted in tens of thousands of
 Nimba County residents seeking refuge in the Cote d'Ivoire.
 Liberia's mixed economy is based primarily on traditional
 agriculture and exports of iron ore, rubber, and timber. It
 continues to suffer from foreign exchange shortages,
 widespread corruption, a heavy debt burden, and governmental
 mismanagement. Nonetheless, in 1989 the private sector
 rebounded after a long decline that finally bottomed out in
 1988. The modest recovery was due in large part to higher
 world prices for Liberia's two main exports, iron ore and
 rubber. Prospects for the future of the economy remain
 clouded by the Government's failure to implement a meaningful
 structural reform program and uncertainty about export prices.
 Despite constitutional guarantees, there were extensive human
 rights violations in 1989. In addition to the year-end
 violence-in Nimba county, major concerns included the use of
 arbitrary arrest and detention, military and police abuse and
 harassment of citizens, and tight restrictions on freedom of
 speech and press, association and assembly, the right of
 citizens to change their government, and women's rights. Of
 particular concern was the slow, steady erosion in press
 freedom. In June the Government closed another independent
 media outlet, the Catholic Radio Station, ELCM, which, alone
 among the independents, had sometimes criticized the
 Government. Despite the success of a joint government-private
 accreditation agreement for journalists, the possibility of
 further government interference with the press was raised by
 the creation of a government-dominated Communications
 Commission with the power to revoke media operating licenses.
 The combination of government/NDPL pressures, which brought
 opposition defections to the NDPL, and opposition boycotts in
 both the legislature and in 1989 by-elections moved Liberia
 closer to a de facto one-party system. In these
 circumstances, the Elections Commission (made up of former
 
 
 183
 LIBERIA
 NDPL members).has made little effort to engage in substantive
 dialog with opposition parties to meet their legitimate
 concerns. The leader and legal counsel of the banned Liberian
 Unification Party, William Kpoleh'and Ceasar-Mabande, jailed
 after a controversial trial in 1988, remained-in prison at the
 end of 1989; at the beginning of the year, the Supreme Court
 granted them a new trial.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and'Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings in
 1989 but both dissidents and government forces killed innocent
 civilians in the year-end violence in Nimba County.
 Additionally at least one person died after a beating
 administered by.soldiers, and two persons died in official
 custody in suspicibus circumstances (see Section 1.c.). The
 Government did not undertake any form of official inquiry into
 .the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Major General
 Podier, a former -vice head of state,-and several others
 killed, allegedly in combat, by security forces in 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically-motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or. Punishment
 Criminal suspects are treated harshly and often receive severe
 beatings from the police. The constitutional rights of the
 accused are often ignored. In August several dozen people in
 Nimba County were reported to have been beaten and robbed by a
 group of soldiers under the direction of an official of the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs. At least one person, a woman,
 died from the mistreabment and several-others needed medical
 attention. The beatings were allegedly carried out at the
 behest of a local clan chief as part of an investigation into
 alleged occult activities in the area. Although an
 investigation found the chief to be culpable, President Doe
 released him at the-end of 1989 .as a result of the incursion
 into Nimba County which allegedly lent credibility to his
 claims of subversion in the area.
 Prison conditions, which have long been dangerous to life and
 health, did not improve in 1989. Cells are often small and
 without windows or ventilation. Food, exercise opportunities,
 and sanitary facilities are grossly inadequate. The maximum
 security prison at Belle Yella in remote Lofa County is
 notorious for its harsh regimen, including incommunicado
 detention. There have been credible reports, including in
 Amnesty International's (AI) 1989 Report, that a number of
 .prisoners have died at Belle Yella in past years under
 unexplained circumstances. AI reports indicate that at the
 Post Stockade, a military detention center in Monrovia,
 civilian detainees have been held illegally for months and
 forced to sleep on the floor, without bedding, often covered
 in excrement. In some circumstances, detainees have had to go
 without water and food for several days. Although the
 Constitution states that civilians may not be confined in any
 military facility, this provision is frequently ignored.
 
 
 184
 LIBERIA
 Two defendants in the General Allison trial (see Section
 I.e.), Augustine Fanga and Henry Walker, died in custody under
 unexplained circumstances. Officials attributed their deaths
 to their "poor health" on arrival at the prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although police are supposed to have a warrant for arrest, and
 persons should be charged or released within 48 hours, these
 constitutional provisions are frequently ignored in practice,
 particularly in cases involving alleged security threats or
 violations. Three students were detained without charge for 2
 weeks for attempting to revive a student organization (see
 Section 2.a.). A county superintendent was held without being
 charged for over a month before being released and
 reinstated. Members of a jury were jailed for a few days by a
 judge in a Bong County Criminal Court for bringing in the
 "wrong" verdict.
 In many cases, prolonged detention of persons without charge
 occurs as a result of judicial inefficiency and administrative
 neglect. Reports appear from time to time that many of those
 in Liberian prisons have been "forgotten" by the judicial
 system and continue to remain in prison although they have
 never been tried. In May a local lawyer succeeded in gaining
 freedom for over 30 people so detained in Monrovia Central
 Prison. A writ of habeas corpus was filed on behalf of a list
 of 205 persons alleged to have been held without charge, some
 for as long as 2 years, although some were later found to have
 been released previously or properly charged. In a series of
 hearings before a judge, more than 30 prisoners were ordered
 released unconditionally after it was determined that they had
 never been properly charged in accordance with their
 constitutional rights. Reliable sources indicate that at the
 same time, and possibly because of this case, as many as 50
 inmates of Monrovia Central Prison were released by prison
 authorities, because they too had never been charged.
 A number of well-known Liberians, such as Professor Amos
 Sawyer, who chaired the National Constitutional Commission and
 headed the now banned Liberian People's Party, remained in
 exile in 1989, many of them in the United States. Human
 rights organizations have pointed to the case of Nathaniel
 Nimley Cholopy, who, after returning to Liberia in December
 1987, was immediately arrested and held in incommunicado
 detention for almost a year in both the Post Stockade and
 Belle Yella. He was released uncharged in November 1988.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Liberia's civilian court system is based on Anglo-American
 jurisprudence and features similar judicial bodies, with the
 Supreme Court at its apex. The Constitution provides for
 public trials and states that there shall be no interference
 with the lawyer-client relationship. Nonetheless, the
 judicial system is often subject to manipulation, and reports
 of financial or political pressure on the courts are common.
 Corruption in the judiciary has become almost
 institutionalized: bribes are often paid to delay cases
 indefinitely, thousands of which are currently "pending"
 before the courts. Like government agencies, the judiciary
 suffers from a severe shortage of the basic tools it needs to
 
 
 185
 LIBERIA
 do its work, such as office supplies, stenographers, and
 records of precedent cases.
 Despite constitutional provision for separation of powers, the
 judiciary has a history of succumbing to the wishes of the
 executive, as in 1987 when President Doe insisted on, and
 received, the resignation of the entire Supreme Court.
 Moreover, court orders are not always implemented by executive
 agencies including the military. In 1988, when a leading
 political figure and nine other conspirators came to trial
 before the Criminal Court in August, the military authorities
 continued to deny them access to legal counsel, in defiance of
 a court ruling. In cases of persons alleged to have been
 improperly jailed, prison authorities refused to transport
 them t6 the courthouse. In many instances executive
 authorities often demand fees for performance of judicial
 duties such as serving subpoenas, collecting witnesses, and
 executing warrants.
 Persons have the right to legal counsel and to bail in
 noncapital offenses. Where the accused is unable to secure
 his own lawyer, the court is required to provide legal
 services, although a lack of resources limits this practice to
 those accused of "serious" offenses. Litigants have the right
 to appeal. Traditional courts, presided over by-tribal
 chiefs, are bound neither by common law nor by conventional
 judicial principles; they apply customary and unwritten law to
 domestic and land disputes as well as petty crimes. These
 decisions may be reviewed in the statutory court system or
 appealed to a hierarchy of chiefs. Administrative review by
 the Ministry of Internal Affairs and, in some cases, a final
 review by the President may follow. Allegations of corruption
 and incompetence in the traditional courts are common.
 Several prominent political figures convicted of statutory
 crimes remained in prison at the end of 1989. ,The leader and
 legal counsel of the banned Liberia Unification Party, William
 Gabriel Kpoleh and Ceasar.Mabande, convicted of treason in
 1988 after a controversial trial, appealed their sentences to
 the Supreme Court and remained in prison at year's end pending
 the Court's decision;-they have been granted, however, a new
 trial.
 In the major trial of 1989, a military court sentenced Defense
 Minister Gray D. Allison to death for ritual murder, although
 at year's end the sentence had not been carried out. Two of
 the 10 defendants died in prison as a result of lack of
 medical attention. They had been delivered to the prison
 after having been severely beaten by unknown assailants.
 Allegedly Allison and nine others attempted to obtain human
 blood for a witchcraft ritual that would enable them to
 overthrow President Doe. Allison claimed that the accusations
 were politically motivated. The trial did not meet
 internationally accepted standards of fairness, even though
 Allison was allowed defense counsel of his own choosing, and
 both he and his counsel were allowed to make lengthy
 statements to the court-martial board. The trial was closed
 to the public and press, only edited transcripts and
 television footage of court proceedings were released to the
 public, and questions were raised about possible coercion of
 witnesses.

 LIBERIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In 1989 the political and military leadership took action
 against at least 30 soldiers accused of harassing or
 mistreating civilians. These included a private who was
 discharged for striking an American citizen at a checkpoint in
 April, and Major John Solonteh, the Deputy Provost for the
 AFL, who was sentenced to a year at hard labor for extorting
 bribes from local businessmen. The number of disciplinary
 cases increased from 1988 to 1989. Nevertheless, military
 harassment and intimidation of civilians at checkpoints
 remained a continuing problem in 1989. There were random
 shakedowns of civilians, including outside checkpoints, and
 occasional episodes of violence. During a municipal clean-up
 campaign in March, soldiers were observed commandeering
 vehicles, forcing people to work at gunpoint, and occasionally
 beating those who resisted. In these instances, no action was
 taken against the soldiers.
 Interference by-civil and military authorities in the lives of
 ordinary citizens occurs on a wider scale in rural areas,
 where local officials wield considerable power over the
 day-to-day activities of citizens and proper police and
 judicial procedures are even less likely to be followed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the Constitution includes provisions for freedom of
 expression, including freedom of speech and of the press these
 freedoms were substantially set back in 1989. The Government
 closed the major private radio station; and two newspapers
 closed in 1988 (Footprints Today and The Sun Times) remained
 closed in 1989. The Constitution also stipulates that persons
 be held "fully responsible for the abuse* of these rights.
 Decree 88a, passed by the Military Government in 1984,
 declares the spread of "rumors, lies, and disinformation" to
 be a felony. This Decree has not been revoked or challenged
 in court and is therefore still in force. Government
 authorities have not invoked the decree in the past 5 years,
 and no one has ever been convicted of violating it. However,
 human rights activists point out that this Decree has a
 chilling effect on freedom of expression and of the press and
 that the Government has not needed to use it to achieve its
 objectives.
 The Liberian press practices self-censorship. All media
 refrain from direct attacks on the President and certain other
 senior government officials. As many as five independent
 newspapers appeared in Monrovia in 1989, though seldom did
 more than four publish on any given day. The one
 government-owned newspaper appears twice weekly. The
 government-controlled radio and television outlets dominate
 the news and provide almost no coverage of opposition views,
 despite constitutional guarantees of access.
 In 1989, as in the past, government harassment of journalists,
 ranging from scuffles with police and confiscation of
 reporter's film to the overnight detention of one newspaper
 editor, continues to be a constant theme. In a major
 development, in June the Ministry of Information, Culture, and
 Tourism (MICAT) shut down Catholic Radio Station ELCM (one of
 three independent radio stations in Liberia) for reporting
 
 
 LIBERIA
 that several people had died in a crowd stampede at a local
 soccer stadium. MICAT originally demanded a transcript of the
 report and, when none was forthcoming, closed the station.
 After some public comments by Catholic Archbishop Michael
 Francis, President Doe made a speech castigating politically
 active clerics and decreeing that the station would remain
 "forever closed," a decision the Church declined to contest.
 Since the closing of ELCM, there has been a marked decline in
 the airing of opposition views in either the independent or
 government broadcast media. The banning of ELCM has left two
 religiously affiliated, largely apolitical, radio stations:
 the Sudan Interior Mission-sponsored ELWA and Radio Baha'i.
 In practice, sessions of the Liberian legislature remain
 closed'to the public, a restriction of the constitutional
 right of citizens to be informed about their government. In
 the waning days of the 1989 legislative session, a bill was
 passed creating a national "Communications Commission" to
 "monitor and coptrol" the Liberian media. Although the
 Commission willhave a few members representing private
 entities, and all of the Board's decisions may be appealed to
 the courts,. the independent press believes the Commission
 could be used as a censorship tool. The Board will have the
 power to impose fines and revoke operating licenses; its
 members will be presidentially, appointed, mostly from the
 ranks of government officials, and its head will be the
 Minister of Posts and Telecommunications (PTT). One of the
 organizations to .be represented on the board, the Press Union
 of Liberia (PUL), has already declared-that it will not,
 participate due to what it considers to be the
 unconstitutional mandate of the Commission.
 The PUL has been outspoken on a number of media-related issues
 but also has cooperated with the Government. An agreement
 between the PUL and MICAT for the joint accreditation of
 journalists has been in place since May, and at the end of the
 year there had been no reported problems with attempts to
 revoke or deny credentials. In May the PUL sponsored a
 seminar on "The Rule of Law in a Democratic Society" in which
 speakers discussed frankly the need for strict adherence to
 the rule of law and specifically criticized the Government for
 various failures to do so.
 Academic freedom is limited. The firing last year of a
 University of Liberia professor for political statements has
 inhibited some other academics. All student politics were
 banned in 1988 by Executive Order Number Two of that year, and
 the ban on student politics has been incorporated into the
 University of Liberia's handbook of rules, and regulations.
 Although technically that executive decree has expired, two
 students were suspended from the University of Liberia in
 October, and three students were detained without charge for 2
 weeks for attempting to revive a student organization. There
 are no functioning student political organizations, and there
 has been virtually no open political activity on the
 Universitk.of. Liberia campus. The Government initiated an
 investigation~when-an NDPL official alleged that opposition
 United Peoples Party (UPP)-teachers had "infiltrated" the
 schools in rural Rivercess County for political purposes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitutional right to peaceful assembly and association
 is observed more often in urban areas than in rural areas.
 Permits must be acquired for public marches and
 
 
 188
 LIHBIA
 demonstrations; however, no political party or other group
 attempted to organize any significant demonstrations in 1989.
 In 1989 legal opposition groups did conduct public and private
 meetings and other organizational activities in the Monrovia
 area without interference from the Government. Freedom of the
 opposition to organize and operate in the rural areas is
 largely dependent on the tolerance of local officials who have
 considerable discretion in dealing with strictly local
 issues. The opposition UPP party held several rallies in
 rural areas in July, with no immediate interference from the
 Government, although some participants later reported
 harassment. According to Human Rights Watch, the Government
 employs intermittent surveillance of opposition figures and
 the harassment, including arbitrary detention, of many
 political party members to limit the effectiveness of
 opposition activity. The U.S. Embassy has no record of party
 activists being detained in 1989.
 A 1986 Supreme Court ruling banned the "Grand Coalition," an
 ad hoc coalition of the three opposition political parties,
 claiming it was not organized in accordance with the Election
 Commission's (ECOM) rules. In July 1989, the heads of the
 three major opposition parties announced plans to hold a joint
 meeting, and the elections commission declared that any such
 meeting would constitute an illegal revival of the banned
 "Grand Coalition." President Doe, however, reversed the ECOM
 decision, and the meeting went ahead with no further
 government interference. Leaders of the various political
 groupings meet on an informal basis without overt government
 interference. Opposition activists complain of government
 harassment, including dismissal from employment, but some
 prominent opposition members hold government jobs. Civil
 servants are not forced to join the NDPL, but it is highly
 advantageous for career advancement.
 The Government initiated in 1988 a check-off system for party
 dues to be deducted from civil servants' paychecks, but
 participation has thus far been voluntary and erratically
 conducted. Opposition politicians complain that the
 Government's ability to award jobs and other patronage gives
 the NDPL an unfair and unconstitutional advantage. The
 opposition UPP has demanded that NDPL organizers desist from
 solicitation of funds from local businessmen, an activity
 prohibited by the Constitution. ECOM has supported the UPP
 position, although solicitation may still occur under other
 guises.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution states that freedom of religion is a
 fundamental right of all Liberian citizens, and in practice
 there are no restrictions on this right. No religion has
 preference over others, and there is no established state
 religion. Christianity, brought by 19th-century settlers and
 spread through the interior by missionaries, has long been the
 religion of the political and economic elite, and many public
 figures refer to the "Christian principles" on which Liberia
 was founded. The majority of the rural population continues
 to practice traditional religions. Approximately 25 percent
 of the population is Muslim. The Liberian Council of
 Churches, an organization composed of most of the Christian
 
 
 189
 LIBERIA
 denominations in Liberia, occasionally plays a prominent role
 in national affairs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides every person the right to move
 freely throughout Liberia and to leave or enter the country at
 any-time., Domestic movement, however, is still impeded by a
 network of-internal checkpoints. The number of such
 checkpoints decreased sharply in late 1987 but rose again in
 reaction to alleged coup plots in 1988 and large-scale rice
 smuggling-in 1989. Police and military personnel at these
 checkpoints routinely search vehicles and often solicit bribes
 from passengers.
 Exit visas are required for all Liberians and most
 non-Liberians leaving the country. These are routinely
 issued. A prominent Liberian dissident living in the United
 States asserted:.in 1989 that the Government had denied her a
 passport. There were no reported restrictions on the foreign
 travel of Liberians in 1989. Despite allegations by human
 rights groups that the Government maintains a "black list" of
 persons who may be denied permission to travel or who may be
 arrested upon their return, there is no evidence of the
 existence of such a practice.
 There are 247 refugees in Liberia. Refugees are not forced to
 return to the countries-from which they have fled. In a few
 cases in past years, however, the Government sought to deport
 refugees who became involved locally in political activities.
 As a result of year-end violence in Nimba County, tens of
 thousands of residents fled to neighboring countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite universal suffrage and constitutional guarantees of
 free and fair elections, there is serious doubt that Liberian
 citizens are free in practice to change their government
 democratically. The only national election since the 1980
 coup perpetuated the rule of President Doe and was widely
 believed to have been fraudulent. The Liberian Goyernment is
 structured along the lines of the American model, with three
 separate but theoretically equal branches of government,
 including a bicameral legislature. In practice, the executive
 branch, and the President in particular, has a preponderant
 share of power. In recent years the number of military men in
 government has declined, but the military remains a major
 force in support of the Doe Government.
 The legislature (26 senate seats, 62 house seats) is subject
 to inordinate executive influence, and lacks the
 assertiveness, resources, and political will to play its
 constitutionally mandated role of coequal in governance. In
 1989. it passed a number of executive-sponsored bills with
 little or no debate, confirmed virtually all presidential
 appointments sent before it, and failed to promote any
 significant legislative initiatives of its own. The
 executive, moreover, regularly took budgetary and other
 actions which the Constitution gives exclusively to the
 legislature. Opposition parties formally continue to boycott
 the legislature. A small number of legislators, elected in
 1985 on opposition tickets, but taking seats as independents,
 functions as an informal opposition grouping. Its
 
 
 190
 LIBEIA
 effectiveness was undercut in 1989 due to the death of its
 most prominent member and numerous defections to the NDPL.
 The Constitution provides for an Elections Commission to
 monitor all political activities in the country. The
 elections law empowers the Commission to certify parties,
 conduct all elections, and count election ballots. The five
 commission members are appointed by the executive for life and
 currently are all former members of the ruling NDPL. Citing
 the widespread fraud that occurred during the 1985 elections,
 the opposition has in the past called for an independent
 vote-counting mechanism. When the deaths of two legislators
 necessitated by-elections in two counties in October 1989, the
 opposition UPP asked ECOM to amend elections procedures as a
 de facto condition for participation in the by-elections.
 ECOM denied any need for changes, and all opposition parties
 boycotted the by-elections where two NDPL candidates ran
 virtually unopposed.
 The Constitutioh prohibits creation of a one-party state.
 Four political parties are officially recognized by the
 Elections Commission--the ruling NDPL, the United Peoples
 Party (UPP), the Liberia Action Party (LAP), and the Unity
 Party (UP). The level of activity of the three opposition
 parties varies, but in the last 2 years each held conventions
 or other large party gatherings and expressed ita views freely
 in the press and at public forums. A lack of financial
 resources crippled their activities, however, and prevented
 the publication of newsletters on a regular basis. Although
 the UPP expressed willingness to participate in electoral
 politics for a few years after the disputed election of 1985,
 and did participate in one by-election, it abandoned its
 policy of seeking cooperation in late 1988 and joined with the
 other two opposition parties in 1989 to boycott the 1989
 by-elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In recent years the Government has permitted representatives
 of various organizations, including Amnesty International (AI)
 and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to
 visit Liberia and investigate alleged human rights
 violations. While it did not respond directly to inquiries
 from AI about the conduct of General Allison's trial, it
 permitted a visit by representatives of the Lawyer's Committee
 for Human Rights at the end of the year.
 Although no Liberian organizations currently exist for the
 express purpose of monitoring human rights developments, the
 Press Union of Liberia, the Liberian Bar Association, and the
 Liberian Council of Churches have spoken out on human rights
 issues in recent years. The Liberian Red Cross routinely
 visits prison facilities, mostly in the Monrovia area, and in
 1988 was permitted for the first time in recent memory to
 carry medical and sanitary supplies to the isolated maximum
 security prison at Belle Yella.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex; Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution states that "only persons who are Negroes or
 of Negro descent" shall qualify by-birth or naturalization to
 be citizens of Liberia. The Constitution further states that
 
 
 191
 LIBERIA
 only Liberian citizens can own real property. These
 .prov-isions discriminate against many nonblack residents who
 were-born 4n Liberia and consider it their home. Otherwise,
 there is no officially sanctioned'discrimination on the basis
 of race, religion, language, or social status. However,
 members of President Doe's Krahn ethnic group hold a
 disproportionate share of high posts in the Government and
 military and.are widely believed to receive preference in
 competing for lower level jobs.
 The status ofwomen varies by region, but sexual
 discrimination is widespread. In urban areas and along the
 ifcoast, women can inherit land and property. In interior
 areas, where traditional ties are'stronger, a woman is
 normally considered the property of her husband and his clan
 and is not usually entitled to inherit from her husband. In
 newly urbanized areas, many women are subject to both
 customary and-statutory legal systems.
 Violence agains  women, including wife beating, occurs, but as
 there are no statistics available, the extent of the problem
 is not known. Police do not normally intervene in domestic
 disputes, and cases rarely come before the courts. Female
 circumcision is widely practiced by the majority of Liberians
 who follow traditional religions and is tolerated by
 government authorities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The.Constitution states that workers have the right to
 associate in trade unions. Over 20 labor unions are
 registered with the Ministry of Labor, representing roughly 15
 percent of the monetary sector work force. Ten national
 unions are members of the Liberian Federation of Labor Unions
 (LFLU), an affiliate of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. The Government does not recognize the
 right of civil servants or employees of public corporations to
 -unionize orto strike. Many such employees, including
 teachers, and port morkers, are represented by employee
 associations. -The American Federation of Labor and Congress
 of Industrial Organizations maintains that the invalidation of
 the teachers',-nion charter constituted government
 interference with-members-rights to-establish organizations of
 their own choosing.
 Although organized labor-historically has not had great
 influence in national politics, in recent years it has begun
 to assert itself on issues affecting workers' interests.
 During 1989 the LFLU was again active in lobbying the
 legislature to pass the new labor code. The code, drafted in
 1986 with-the cooperation of Liberian unions and the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), would repeal PRC
 (military) Decvee 12 outlawing -strikes. It had been awaiting
 legislatve avtkon for 3 years. The House passed the bill in
 the last week of -the 1989 session, and the Senate was
 scheduled to take it up early in 1990. Labor unions are
 constitutionally prohibited from participation in party
 politics.
 In July the Supreme Court put an end to a dispute over the
 LFLU's May 1988 elections that had been running for more than
 a year. The losing candidates in those elections had appealed
 to a civil magistrate and then to the Supreme Court in an
 
 
 192
 LIBEEIA
 attempt to have the election overruled. The Supreme Court
 eventually rejected the appeal on technical grounds, leaving
 in place the magistrate's decision that the matter was an
 internal union affair that the Government had no reason to
 judge.
 Promulgated in 1980, PRC Decree 12 outlawing strikes and any
 other type of labor unrest is technically still in effect,
 although there were no significant strikes in 1989 to test the
 Government's December 1988 assertion that unions are free to
 strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 With the important exception of civil servants and employees
 of public corporations, workers have the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. In contrast to 1988, there were no
 reports of government interference in union organizing
 activities in 1989. The Government promotes union/management
 negotiations and sometimes provides mediation for disputes
 arising out of such negotiations. Associations represent
 worker interests with government and management.
 The ILO Committee of Experts (COE) has noted that current
 labor legislation provides insufficient guarantees against
 antiunion discrimination and supports the passage of the new
 labor code as a partial remedy.
 Labor laws and practices are applied uniformly throughout the
 country, including in the unique export processing zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor, and the practice is
 firmly condemned by the Government. The COE, among others,
 has raised questions about the degree of enforcement of that
 prohibition, especially on rural community development
 projects. In a broader context, the Government has indicated
 that the draft labor code will provide for penal sanctions in
 cases of illegal use of forced or community labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Government prohibits employment of children under the age
 of 16 during school hours. Enforcement, which is limited, is
 primarily aimed at the wage sector. There is no enforcement
 for the many children engaged in the large subsistence farming
 sector. Only a minority of children regularly attend school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law provides for a minimum wage, paid leave,
 severance benefits, and safety standards. The minimum wage
 for agricultural workers is approximately $0.90 cents per day
 at the unofficial exchange rate. Industrial workers generally
 receive three or four times this amount. The minimum wage
 would not, by itself, be sufficient to insure an adequate
 standard of living for a worker and his family, but many
 families have other sources of income or receive support
 through an extended family system. The maximum hours of work
 which an employer can require are 8 hours per day or 48 hours
 per week. Safety standards are not rigorously enforced. A
 new national pension scheme was implemented in 1988 in which
 most workers and employers are required to participate.
