 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is and has been for decades a functioning
 constitutional democracy. The Government consists of three
 independent branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.
 Elections were last held in February 1982; nearly 80 percent
 of eligible voters participated. The tradition of alternating
 political parties in every election since 1948 except one was
 maintained, and President Luis Alberto Monge of the National
 Liberation Party (PLN) defeated the candidate of the incumbent
 Unidad coalition. The President is constitutionally
 prohibited from succeeding himself as are members of the
 Legislative Assembly. The 57 deputies in the Assembly are
 elected at the same time as the President and, like his, their
 terms of office are four years. The two major political
 parties now preparing for elections in February 1986 are the
 National Liberation Party and the United Social Christian
 Party, recently consolidated from the Unidad coalition. A
 leftist coalition presently holds--Fur seats in the
 Legislative Assembly. Included in the coalition is the
 Communist Party, which freely participates in the political
 process.
 In Costa Rica's mixed economic system, the right to hold
 private property is legally protected, and approximately 80
 percent of the gross national product is produced by the
 private sector. There are a number of government-owned
 autonomous agencies which provide both goods and services.
 The public sector is the nation's largest employer with around
 20 percent of the work force. While inflation has been
 largely brought under control, both unemployment and
 underemployment continue to be problems, especially among the
 young.
 Both police and national defense functions are performed by
 the Ministry of Public Security's Civil Guard and the Ministry
 of Government's constabulary force in the countryside, the
 Rural Guard. The Judicial Police (OIJ) is an entity of the
 judicial branch directly responsible to the Supreme Court.
 The OIJ is charged with investigating crimes. In theory, the
 primary mission of the security forces of the executive branch
 is to prevent crimes. In practice there is considerable
 overlapping in the function between OIJ and the Civil/Rural
 Guards. Costa Rica abolished its standing army in 1949. The
 country's security forces, which are subject to civilian
 control, are few in number and inadequately trained and
 equipped. With the continuing threat of internal subversion
 and persistence of troubled relations with Nicaragua, there
 is widespread popular support for upgrading and making more
 professional the Civil and Rural Guards. There is no
 significant public support for creating a professional armed
 force.
 Although there is some concern that Costa Ricans, afflicted
 with economic problems, especially a high unemployment rate,
 will eventually react against the increasing numbers of
 displaced persons and refugees entering the country, they have
 over the past year preserved their traditional policy of
 welcoming such persons.
 Costa Rica has maintained its excellent human rights record
 over the past year. The Monge Administration has been
 particulary sensitive to the need to protect basic human
 rights.

 COSTA RICA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the Government nor any other political organization
 has used killing as a political weapon.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no known incidents of abductions, secret
 arrests, or persons held clandestinely by any agency of the
 Costa Rican Government.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Costa Rican Constitution states that 'No one shall be
 submitted to cruel or degrading treatment nor to life
 imprisonment. A statement obtained through violence shall
 have no value.' These injunctions are respected in practice.
 Prisoners are treated humanely in Costa Rican prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Warrants are required for both searches and arrests; the
 Constitution requires that an arraignment take place within 24
 hours of arrest. These requirements are strictly enforced.
 While convicted foreign terrorists and other non-Costa Ricans
 have been refused entry or expelled, it is unconstitutional to
 exile a citizen, and none has been.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Costa Rican judiciary is widely recognized as fair and
 independent. Accused persons may select their own attorneys.
 Access to counsel is guaranteed with free public counsel
 provided for defendants without means. According to a study
 published in 1983 by the UN-affiliated Latin American
 Institute for the Prevention of crime and the Treatment of
 Offenders, Costa Rica has the lowest percentage of detainees
 awaiting trial of 18 Latin American countries surveyed. The
 right to bail is provided for in law and is observed in
 practice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no reported instances of extra-legal invasions
 of privacy conducted by, or with the knowledge of, agencies of
 the Costa Rican Government over the past year.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically guarantees freedom of speech and
 press, and these freedoms are fully respected in practice.
 Both communist parties publish weekly newspapers, and the
 media report news and information spanning the political
 spectrum. There are three privately-owned television stations
 
 
 480
 COSTA RICA
 and numerous radio stations which pursue independent editorial
 policies. The media freely air differences with and criticism
 of the Government. There is no evidence of either collusion
 or repression. Terrorist activities are fully covered.
 Foreign journalists have protested the Costa Rican courts'
 refusal to recognize their credentials and allow them to
 practice their profession in Costa Rica. This issue,
 involving the Costa Rican National Journalists Association's
 right to accredit reporters, has been raised before the
 Inter-American Commission of Human Rights which decided in
 favor of the Costa Rican authorities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly and
 association are respected in practice. About 14 percent of
 the work force is organized into unions, primarily in the
 public sector and on banana plantations. Communist influence
 in organized labor remains strong. Procedures for collective
 bargaining and arbitration of labor disputes are prescribed in
 law and followed in practice. Unions can and do strike. In
 1984, there were two major strikes in Costa Rica including a
 72 day banana workers strike which proved to be the longest
 and costliest in Costa Rican history. The strike resulted in
 two workers' deaths by shooting and numerous injuries in two
 separate clashes between strikers and the Civil Guard. While
 accounts conflict, there is strong evidence that the
 authorities were provoked into firing. No criminal charges
 have been made. The other major strike involved the powerful
 teachers' association which, in addition to demanding salary
 increases for its own sector, called for a broad range of
 reforms, such as price freezes on basic products and
 utilities, affecting the more disadvantaged segments of Costa
 Rican society. Professional groups and associations also have
 the right to unionize and bargain collectively and have had a
 major role in representing middle income workers' interests in
 the political arena. The fastest growing labor movement in
 the private sector, however, known as Solidarismo, believes
 that labor/management relations should be non-confrontational
 and that strikes are counterproductive.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and
 observed in practice. Roman Catholicism is the official state
 religion, but other religious groups have significant numbers
 of adherents, who participate without prejudice in all aspects
 of the social and political life of the nation. Foreign
 missionaries and clergy freely enter Costa Rica, and there are
 no restrictions on religious proselytization.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on traveling within the
 country or abroad. Costa Ricans and foreigners are free to
 live anywhere within the national boundaries. Costa Rica has
 supported multinational refugee programs and has accepted many
 thousands of displaced persons and refugees from other Central
 American countries as well as many Cubans and South Americans.
 The continuing large influx of Nicaraguan refugees has
 seriously strained national resources. Citizenship through
 birth or naturalization cannot be lost except by abandonment.
 
 
 481
 COSTA RICA
 The Government accepts responsibility for repatriating its own
 citizens. The Constitution specifically prohibits the
 Government from repatriating any non-Costa Rican who may be
 subject to political persecution in his own country. Costa
 Rica has traditionally afforded political asylum to dissident
 groups of various political orientations. The only recent
 challenge to Costa Rica's record in this regard occurred in
 the case of Ecuadoran citizen Rose Mireya Cardenas, whose
 return to Ecuador was protested by some Ecuadoran dissidents.
 However, extraordinary measures were taken by Costa Rican
 authorities to document that her return was voluntary.
 Indicative of the Costa Rican legal system's sensitivity on
 the right of asylum was its recent denial of a request from
 the Spanish Government for the extradition of an accused
 Basque terrorist. The latter was arrested in Costa Rica last
 year for his alleged involvement in an assassination attempt
 against anti-Sandinista leader Eden Pastora. The court
 refused to extradite on grounds that the charges pending
 against him in Spain were of a political nature.
 Sectiun 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Tne Constitution provides for a free, open, and competitive
 electoral system. The integrity of elections is overseen by
 the independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal. No political
 party is outlawed or excluded from the electoral process; no
 party has dominated the affairs of the nation, nor is any
 eligible voter deterred from participating in elections.
 Virtually all segments of the population view with hostility
 any effort by any group, internal or external, to interfere
 with the free electoral process. Individual citizens can and
 do regularly petition their elected representatives for
 legislative redress and assistance with government
 bureaucracies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A strong supporter of international and private human rights
 organizations, Costa Rica has extended a permanent invitation
 to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit
 whenever it wishes. Costa Rica was one of the earliest
 countries to ratify the American Convention of Human Rights
 and has accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-American
 Institute of Human Rights Court, which is based in San Jose.
 It hosts the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights (IIHR).
 Costa Rican government officials at the highest level
 participate in and actively support the human rights
 activities of both the Institute and the Court. In 1984,
 several major international human rights conferences sponsored
 by the Institute were held in San Jose. Overall, Costa Rica
 has been in the vanguard in the promotion of human rights
 institutions. President Monge laid out the rationale for this
 policy in his opening address at a IIHR human rights course:
 "The complexity of human relations in modern societies compels
 us to give more attention to the practical operation of
 instruments for the protection of human rights, than to public
 declarations.'
 In its 1983-1984 report, Freedom House rated Costa Rica
 'Free.' Amnesty International Report 1984, covering the year
 1983, expressed concern about the cases, since closed, of
 persons held for periods exceeding those permitted by law
 prior to being tried.

 COSTA RICA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Economic problems facing Costa Rica stem from the nation's
 vulnerability to changes in the prices of its major
 exports--coffee, bananas, and sugar -- as well as the nation's
 heavy importation of oil, raw materials, consumer durables,
 and foodstuffs, and its high level of external borrowing (both
 from public and private lenders). A government austerity
 program imposed in conjunction with a standby agreement with
 the International Monetary Fund (now being renegotiated) has
 succeeded in lowering the inflation rate, but at the cost of
 temporarily increasing hardships on large sectors of the
 population. Unemployment, officially calculated at 9.5
 percent and unofficially at 15 percent, has been growing.
 Underemployment, affecting as much as 20 percent of the
 population, is particularly acute among recent university
 graduates who have grown increasingly frustrated over their
 inability to find employment in their fields of study. The
 steadily increasing number of refugees from Nicaragua has
 further aggravated the employment situation. In addition to
 the 12,000 refugees in Costa Rica receiving financial
 assistance from refugee relief organizations, the Government
 estimates there are 250,000 illegal aliens seeking to blend
 into the already overburdened economy. Despite its myriad
 problems, Costa Rica's per capita GNP of $1,279 was the
 highest in Central America in 1982. Economic progress,
 however, is not uniformly distributed; severe poverty exists
 in some outlying areas, while development has been most
 noticeable in the central plateau surrounding the capital of
 San Jose.
 Increased population pressures and economic decline have
 greatly influenced peasant demands for agricultural land.
 Groups have been organized, in some cases with communist
 support, to invade both private and public lands. Squatting,
 although illegal, continues to be a major problem given the
 Government's inability to prevent the land invasions and
 implement an effective and equitable land reform system.
 The population of some 2.6 million was growing at a rate of
 2.5 percent in 1984, and life expectancy at birth is 73.7
 years. The infant mortality rate is now 15.2 per 1000 live
 births. The country enjoys an adult literacy rate of over 95
 percent in urban locales and 83 percent in rural areas; the
 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio in 1981 was over 105
 for males and almost 103 for females. The 1977 figure for
 calorie supply as a percentage of requirements was 112.68
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is not
 limited in Costa Rica. Women are represented in all
 professions, in the highest ranks of organized labor, in the
 private sector, and in the Government (occupying prominent
 positions in the legislature, as well as in the executive
 branch and the judiciary). Women and minority groups
 participate freely Costa Rica's elections.
