 SOUTH AFRICA
 Under the leadership of State President F. W. de Klerk, 1990
 was an important year of transition in South Africa. While
 the country's black majority remained disenfranchised and
 continued to suffer from pervasive discrimination under the
 apartheid system, the Government committed itself to genuine
 constitutional negotiations aimed at dismantling this system.
 President de Klerk suspended the ban on political activities
 of the African National Congress (ANC) and other organizations
 and released a number of political prisoners from long-term
 confinement, including Nelson Mandela, the country's most
 renowned prisoner. Formal meetings between the ANC and the
 Government resulted in agreement that the ANC would suspend
 its armed struggle in the context of the release of political
 prisoners and the return of opposition exiles. Thereafter,
 the Government and ANC announced that the way had been cleared
 for multiparty negotiation of a new constitution, with
 exploratory talks to begin in the near future. The ruling
 National Party publicly endorsed majority rule, one man one
 vote on a common voters' roll, and equal economic, political,
 and social rights for all South Africans. It also opened its
 membership to all races. The 4-year-old State of Emergency
 (SOE) was lifted. While the Government repealed the Separate
 Amenities Act, some of the key legislative pillars of
 apartheid remained in place.
 Forming a bloody backdrop to this reform process was
 escalating violence, in particular the spread of black
 factional violence from Natal Province to Transvaal townships
 near Johannesburg. The violence appeared to stem from a
 variety of factors, including political and ethnic rivalries.
 There also appeared to be an element of randomness which
 suggested to many the involvement of a "third force" (i.e.,
 rightwing extremist elements of the security forces). It
 prompted the imposition of special security measures,
 including curfews and confiscation of dangerous weapons, which
 contributed to some lessening of the violence. Violent
 incidents attributable to other causes also increased, such as
 the police shooting of demonstrators at Sebokeng and
 unprecedented rioting in mixed race areas of Port Elizabeth,
 both of which produced large death tolls. Rightwing terrorism
 also increased significantly.
 The doctrine of apartheid prescribes the basic rights and
 obligations of people according to their racial or ethnic
 origin. The country's black majority (numbering 27 million,
 or 74.7 percent of the population) suffers from legally
 sanctioned discrimination based on race in political,
 economic, and social aspects of life. Individuals classified
 by the Government as "colored" (mixed-race) or Asian (8.7
 percent and 2.6 percent of the population, respectively) also
 suffer from extensive racial discrimination, although to a
 somewhat lesser degree than South Africa's black population.
 While the Government claims that South Africa is a
 parliamentary democracy, whites (14 percent of the population)
 still retain a monopoly of political power. Blacks continue
 to be denied the right to vote in national elections and to be
 represented in Parliament. A new'Constitution in 1984
 replaced the previously all-white parliament with a tricameral
 one with separate chambers for whites, "coloreds", and
 Asians. However, whites retain parliamentary control over key
 affairs, and the executive branch (headed by the State
 President with extraordinarily strong powers) remains under
 white control

 SOUTH AFRICA
 The ANC, generally considered the strongest opposition
 political force, has been the chief interlocutor of the
 Government in talks to remove obstacles to constitutional
 negotiations, but it accepts that future negotiations must
 involve all significant political parties. It has a
 particularly strong constituency among urban blacks and is
 backed by such key antiapartheid groups as the United
 Democratic Front (UDF), which is composed of a number of
 organizations, the largest trade union federation, the
 Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), which has a
 predominantly black membership and leadership, and the South
 African Communist Party (SACP).
 In addition to the ANC, the chief organizations representing
 black South Africans include, among others, the Pan African
 Congress (PAC) and the Azanian People's Organization (AZAPO),
 which represent the radical left, and Inkatha. Inkatha,
 headed by the Chief Minister of the KwaZulu homeland,
 Mangosuthu Buthelezi, claims a membership of 1.7 million, the
 majority of whom are Zulu. In 1990 it took steps toward
 becoming a political party open to all races. Beginning in
 1979, relations soured between the ANC and Buthelezi's
 movement over strategy and tactics-in the antiapartheid
 effort, particularly over. the question of "armed struggle."
 Ongoing conflict between the two organizations has been cited
 as a principal cause of the increased violence in South Africa.
 White control of the Government is backed by a powerful
 defense and police establishment, the largest components of
 which are the South African Defense Force (SADF) with more
 than 100,000 active-duty personnel and nearly 300,000
 reservists, and the multiracial South African Police (SAP)
 with 56,000 members. The SADF, perceived by the black
 population as far more impartial than the SAP, plays a major
 role in assisting the police in patrolling black townships,
 and continued to be active in 1990 in response to the violence
 in Natal and the Transvaal. -Under President de Klerk, the
 role in domestic and foreign policymaking of the security
 establishment, including the military, police, and the
 intelligence services, has decreased. In particular, de Klerk
 ended the National Security Management System (NSMS) which,
 with its intricate intelligence networks, had become,
 according to human rights activists, a powerful "parallel
 government." The report of the Harms Commission, which was
 appointed by President de Klerk to investigate alleged
 government "hit squads" (see Section l.a.), singled out the
 Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB), a clandestine SADF special
 force unit, for a number of past human rights abuses,
 including political murder. Under the new system, implemented
 in 1990, the Government replaced the Joint Management Centers
 in the townships with security bodies which play a more
 limited coordinating role and have ultimate accountability to
 the Cabinet, and which are in most cases headed by civilians
 rather than military or police officers. South African
 security forces are active in the "independent" homelands, and
 human rights observers believe elements of the SAP continue to
 give at least tacit support to conservative black vigilante
 groups in both the homelands and the townships, although
 conclusive proof of this is lacking.
 South Africa's economy features a highly developed industrial
 sector and extensive agricultural and mineral resources. The
 economy is experiencing a recession, with no real growth
 expected in 1990 and poor prospects for the coming year. Lack
 of confidence in South Africa's situation on the part of
 
 
 357
 SOUTH AFRICA
 foreign investors and various trade restrictions limit the
 potential for economic growth. Local economists estimate that
 an annual real growth rate above 5 percent is necessary for
 the economy to absorb the roughly 350,000 black entrants to
 the labor market each year. An even higher rate of growth
 would be necessary to reduce present black unemployment, which
 many private observers estimate at 25 to 30 percent overall
 and as high as 50 percent in the homelands. Despite the high
 level of black unemployment, some 200,000 migrant workers from
 the neighboring southern African states were employed in South
 African mines in 1983. Apartheid laws discriminate against
 blacks in housing, employment, and education, serving to
 perpetuate a gross income disparity between whites and
 blacks. The current debate on the structure of a
 postapartheid economy focuses on appropriate policies to
 reduce this income disparity while preserving a viable private
 sector able to act as the engine of growth South Africa will
 require to meet black aspirations for a better life.
 Dramatic improvements in human rights, particularly with
 regard to political expression (i.e., freedom of association,
 assembly, press, and speech), coincided with an equally
 dramatic increase in deaths and injuries due to politically
 related violence. The possibility of genuine negotiations
 leading to establishment of truly democratic institutions was
 all the more compelling against the backdrop of the laws which
 continued to enforce the system of apartheid and otherwise
 restrict individual freedoms and due process rights. Powers
 of detention, in particular under the Internal Security Act
 (ISA), continued to be widely exercised. There were some
 positive developments in the area of worker rights, but legal
 inequities, wage disparities, and societal attitudes continued
 to disadvantage South African women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political violence escalated throughout South Africa in 1990
 (see Section l.g.). At least 12 persons died under suspicious
 circumstances while in police custody. Among these persons
 was Clayton Sizwe Sithole, who died January 30 at John Vorster
 Square police station in Johannesburg while in detention under
 Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, which permits
 preventive detention. The first, and only, judicial
 commission of inquiry into a security detainee's death, headed
 by Justice Goldstone, concluded Sithole had committed
 suicide. Jappie Andres Matabogo was allegedly beaten to death
 on July 23 while in custody for allegedly having urinated in a
 public place; a policeman was suspended pending an
 investigation. According to press reports, police denied
 responsibility for the deaths of six detainees in quick
 succession between January and February, but they promised to
 investigate the incidents. Results of these investigations
 had not been made public at year's end. October saw the
 conviction of three white policemen accused in 1989 of
 murdering and dumping the body of an Alexandra township man
 suspected by them to be in possession of stolen goods.
 Police and South African Defense Force "hit squads" came under
 public scrutiny for the first time during hearings by a
 
 
 358
 SOUTH AFRICA
 judicial commission of inquiry ordered by President de Klerk
 and headed by Justice Louis Harms. Testimony before the Harms
 Commission, which started on February 15, revealed a shady
 world of dirty tricks, kidnapings, bombings, assassinations,
 and other covert activities dating back to the mid-1980's.
 The Harms Commission report was transmitted to the State
 President in early September and released publicly in
 November. Although the Commission found that there was no
 state-sanctioned "hit' squad" as such, it singled out the CCB
 for actions which "contaminated the whole security arm of the
 State." It concluded that evidence pointed directly to CCB
 participation in two murders, those of Dr. and Mrs. Fabian
 Ribeiro; attempts to kill "Weekly Mail journalist Gavin Evans;
 Cape Town antiapartheid advocate Abdullah Omar; Durban
 attorney Kwenza Mihaba; and assorted other incidents of
 violence and wrongdoing. The South African Police were
 exonerated of any similar actions. At least 12 persons are
 likely to face criminal charges as a result of the
 Commission's findings. According to the report, the CCB could
 not be definitively linked to the Webster or several other
 murders. The Commission admitted that it had been unable to
 achieve one of its main purposes, namely, "to restore public
 confidence in a part of state administration." Antiapartheid
 groups sharply criticized the report, particularly its
 exoneration of the SADF leadership and the absence of findings
 against the police. They also reiterated their criticism of
 the Commission's narrow terms of reference as well as its
 inability to gain access to key witnesses, its reliance on
 government investigators, and the disappearance of pertinent
 records.
 During 1990, no cross-border attacks were conclusively linked
 to the Government. Some observers, however, accused the South
 African Government, or rogue elements of the police or defense
 force, of responsibility for the April 23 murder of senior PAC
 member Sam Chand and his family in their home in Botswana.
 Alleged attacks by the Black-Consciousness Movement of Azania
 (BCMA) and the PAC in Bophuthatswana in June reportedly left
 over five Bophuthatswana security force members dead.
 At the end of the year, Botswana held 11 persons, members of
 the BCMA, in connection with the death of two men whose bodies
 were found October 7. Botswana authorities believed the group
 kidnaped young South Africans attending a Gaborone rock
 concert and tried to coerce them into doing military training
 at a BCMA camp near Lobatse. The two are believed to have
 died after torture.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1990 there were no reports of antiapartheid activists
 disappearing while in police custody.
 South African law, including the ISA, does not require
 notification of a person's family, lawyer, or any other person
 in the event of a person's detention. This has often led
 family and associates to fear security forces may assault,
 torture, or even kill detainees. The June 1988 disappearance
 case of Maisha "Stanza" Bopape, a Community Research and
 Information Center (CRIC) staff member and township activist,
 remains unsolved. Police claim that Bopape escaped from
 custody, but his colleagues fear that he may have been
 killed. Numerous disappearances from previous years remain
 unresolved.
 
 
 359
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Following the June 1986 State of Emergency (SOE) declaration
 and in the wake of subsequent crackdowns on various opposition
 organizations, many black activists left the country
 surreptitiously or went into hiding to avoid detention. Some
 activists continued to seek refuge in this manner during 1990
 despite the dramatic political changes and the lifting of the
 SOE. These circumstances further complicated the task of
 accurately accounting for the persons who have reportedly
 disappeared.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 During 1990, as in years past, court testimony and sworn
 affidavits continued to support claims of lawyers and human
 rights activists that beatings and torture are still used
 against security detainees. Commonly used methods of torture
 include severe beatings, prolonged periods of solitary
 confinement, suffocation, sleep deprivation, and forcing
 detainees to remain standing for lengthy periods of time.
 Sick and wounded detainees are sometimes handcuffed to their
 beds. Denial of medical attention has been reported in some
 cases.
 According to a human rights monitoring group, the Supreme
 Court of the "independent" homeland of Bophuthatswana granted
 a temporary order restraining police from assaulting Aaron
 Mokeng and Chere Kukama after they were detained in June.
 Mokeng reportedly was beaten so severely by police that he
 suffered.hearing problems, sustained lacerations on his
 abdomen, and bruises over his upper body. The restraining
 order apparently did not allow for independent medical or
 legal access.
 Sathyandrana "Mac" Maharaj, a member of the Central Committee
 of the SACP and an ANC national executive committee member,
 was admitted under guard to St. Aidan's hospital in Natal on
 September 13 after having been detained under Section 29 of
 the ISA on July 25. He filed formal charges of assault
 against the police, but specifics regarding his case were
 unavailable due to the conditions of his detention. Maharaj
 was granted bail on November 8 and at year's end had an
 application before the Government for indemnity from
 prosecution. According to his attorney, senior ANC member
 Billy Nair was released from Section 29 detention on September
 12 after having suffered a heart attack while under
 interrogation. Police were reportedly made fully aware of
 Nair's weak heart and delicate medical condition at the time
 of his detention on July 23 but allegedly deprived him of
 sleep for over 36 hours and made him stand for a lengthy
 period of time during questioning. In September three
 released ISA Section 29 detainees (Matome Malatji, Rose
 Mahlale, and Magdeline Makhurupetsi) filed charges of torture,
 including severe beatings, against security police offices in
 the northern Transvaal for assaults that occurred during their
 3-month detention. One of the released detainees withdrew his
 charges, allegedly under pressure from police. In September
 there were also charges of police torture by rightwing Section
 29 detainees, alleging mistreatment while in custody at the
 Potchefstroom police station. The detainees claimed that the
 police used electric shock and placed canvas bags filled with
 insecticide spray over the detainees' heads.
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 As part of its August 6 agreement with the ANC, the Government
 committed itself to a review of the ISA and other security
 legislation "in order to ensure free political activity and
 with the view to introducing amending legislation at the next
 session of Parliament." In the meantime, 1990 continued to
 see extensive police use of the wide powers of detention
 granted them under the ISA, SOE (until its termination), and
 the August declaration of "unrest areas" under the Public
 Safety Act (PSA).
 The ISA authorizes detention without trial for varying--in
 some instances unlimited--periods of time. Under Section 29
 of the ISk, the Minister of Law and Order may issue preventive
 detention orders allowing for detention for up to 180 days in
 'unrest situations." Access to ISA detainees is severely
 restricted. Under Section 29, senior police officials have
 broad powers to detain people for interrogation when offenses
 such as terrorism, sabotage, or inciting a revolution are
 suspected. Many people in detention under Section 29 were
 held for long periods of time without any questioning taking
 place. Opposition elements charged that Section 29, in
 particular, was being used to thwart political activity. For
 example, three members of the Natal Indian Congress were
 detained in Durban on July 13 prior to the uncovering of a
 so-called red plot; the ANC charged publicly that Section 29
 action was taken against them .simply because they were
 actively involved in recruiting Indian members for the ANC.
 Human rights monitors also claimed that rightwing Section 29
 detainees tended to be charged or released more quickly and
 had better access privileges, strongly indicating preferential
 treatment of rightwing detainees by the authorities.
 The 4-year-old SOE was permitted to expire in June except in
 Natal, where it was terminated in October. SADF members and
 police officers down to the rank of constable were empowered
 to detain persons for up to 30 days. Police station cells
 could be used as the place of detention for the first 14 days,
 after which detainees were required to be transferred to cells
 in prisons unless the commissioner of police granted an
 exception. After 30 days the Minister of Law and Order could
 extend the detention, with the total period of detention
 limited to 6 months pursuant to SOE revisions announced by
 President de Klerk on February 6. Emergency detainees had no
 right to a hearing before the Minister extended the
 detention. Other SOE revisions permitted access of legal
 representatives and medical practitioners chosen by detainees
 themselves. Powers of detention invoked under the PSA were
 similar to those under the SOE but were confined to specified
 areas and required review after 3 months.
 As of November 30, South Africa's Human Rights Commission
 (HRC) reported that 92 persons were then detained in South
 Africa, excluding the "independent" homelands (all pursuant to
 the ISA). The year-to-date totals were 216 under the ISA, 434
 under the SOE (comprising mostly of those held under the
 national SOE which expired in June), and 190 under the PSA.
 The HRC also listed 23 persons as then currently detained
 under security legislation in Transkei (21) and Ciskei (2),
 and reported the following year-to-date totals for the
 Homelands: Transkei (62), Bophuthatswana (608), Venda (94),
 and Ciskei (13).
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 By the end of the year a number of long-term South African
 exiles had returned to the country with either complete,
 temporary, or limited indemnity. Included among them were ANC
 President Oliver Tambo and ANC military wing chief Chris Hani,
 SACP leader Joe Slovo, and at least four leaders of the PAC
 who were allowed to return for the organization's December
 national congress. On two separate occasions, however, upon
 arrival in South Africa, exiles have been denied entry and
 held at the airport for up to 24 hours before being allowed
 into the country.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The South African judiciary is headed by the appellate
 division (Court of Appeals) of the Supreme Court in
 Bloemfontein and six regional Supreme Courts. All judges of
 South Africa's higher courts are white, as are the vast
 majority of its magistrates. They are appointed to the bench
 by the State President. They serve until age 70, and they may
 not be removed from office except through impeachment by
 Parliament. By tradition, judges of the appellate division
 and the Supreme Courts are appointed to the bench from the
 ranks of the elite corps of South African Supreme Court
 Practitioners ("advocates").
 South Africa has an adversarial system of criminal justice
 drawn from a mixed heritage of Roman-Dutch and English
 jurisprudence. Trials of lesser offenses are heard by
 magistrates, who are career employees of the civil service in
 the executive branch. More serious offenses, including
 capital crimes, are tried in the Supreme Courts. The
 presiding judge or magistrate determines quilt or innocence.
 Juries were abolished in 1969. Judges in capital and other
 serious cases are empowered to appoint two assessors who serve
 as fact finders and who have the power to overrule the
 presiding judge on questions of fact but not on questions of
 law.
 Defendants in criminal cases, including political cases, may
 retain legal counsel, but a recent study showed that 85
 percent of those convicted in ordinary criminal cases had no
 representation. In July 1988, the Natal Supreme Court,
 overturning a lower court decision in the Khanyile case, held
 that legal representation was not vital to the fairness of a
 trial and that accused persons did not have the right to
 representation if they could not afford it. The Khanyile
 case, scheduled to be heard on appeal in early 1991, has
 attracted wide attention in legal circles and has been central
 to discussion of the possible introduction of a public
 defender system. Justice Minister Coetsee has expressed
 interest in such a system. In 1990 Lawyers for Human Rights
 continued a major pro bono project begun in 1988 which aims to
 have 2,000 participating lawyers donating 5 days a year each,
 the first large-scale effort of its kind to be undertaken in
 South Africa. The Legal Resources Center, a nationwide public
 interest law firm, engaged in a similar effort. As a matter
 of practice, courts usually appoint counsel in capital cases
 when the defendant cannot afford a lawyer.
 Persons charged with common crimes are presumed innocent until
 proven guilty, although Parliament has modified the general
 presumption of innocence for many security offenses. The ISA
 effectively places the burden of proof of innocence on an
 accused for a number of offenses enumerated in the Act. Both
 security-related and common criminal cases are tried in
 
 
 362
 SOUTH AFRICA
 civilian courts, although security trials are sometimes held
 in remote locations. Because of case backlogs, postponements,
 and the practice of hearing cases concurrently, criminal
 trials, and particularly security cases, can sometimes take
 months, even years, to complete.
 A new Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals, Michael Corbett,
 was appointed in November 1988. Under Corbett and certain
 other appointees, concerns of opposition elements and human
 rights lawyers about the Court's politicization have
 decreased, and a heightened concern for individual liberties
 has been evidenced in the decisions of both appellate and
 provincial courts. At the Supreme Court's provincial level,
 there were several such judgments in 1989 and 1990. After
 considering the political and socioeconomic realities of the
 black townships, provincial court judges acquitted five men
 accused of treason (Mayekiso case) and found extenuating
 circumstances in the murder cases of ANC military cadres (Obed
 Masino case). In the Queenstown Five case, the "common
 purpose" doctrine, by which each individual is held
 responsible for the actions of a crowd (regardless of guilt),
 was discredited. Finally, in the Waks case, the Court
 reasoned that, despite the clear intent of the Separate
 Amenities Act, a town council's decision to segregate its
 parks violated its common-law responsibility to advance the
 public interest as a whole.
 Similarly, at the appellate level, bold steps were taken by
 the Corbett Court. The most politically significant of its
 1989-90 decisions was its judgment in the Delmas Treason Trial
 in which the C6urt set aside the conviction of 11 men on
 strictly technical procedural grounds, ending South Africa's
 longest treason trial. The Ivan Toms case was another example
 of judicial activism. The appellate division, despite the
 apparent clear wording of the statute, ruled that mandatory
 sentencing for conscientious objectors did not conform to the
 principle of a "just society."
 These and other cases indicate the judiciary's willingness in
 many instances to discover ambiguities in parliamentary
 decrees and apply common law principles in support of
 fundamental rights. The courts have been the focal point for
 much action against human rights abuses. By increasingly
 letting stand judicially created loopholes, the Government has
 demonstrated a willingness to accept more aggressive rulings.
 In some instances, the Government has also shown an increased
 readiness to reach out-of-court settlements.
 Nevertheless, the power of the South African judiciary at all
 levels continues to be circumscribed by stringent security
 legislation and by the principle of parliamentary sovereignty,
 under which judges possess no authority to alter, strike down,
 or refuse to enforce properly drafted and enacted laws of
 Parliament. Prominent opposition lawyers have called for a
 complete overhaul of the country's white-dominated court
 system as a necessary part of the creation of a multiracial
 democracy. Nelson Mandela, honorary president of the National
 Association of Democratic Lawyers, repeatedly expressed harsh
 criticism of the South African judiciary and legal system,
 while stating his expectation that the existing system,
 stripped of its racist elements, would survive basically
 intact under a new constitutional dispensation. In March
 1989, the government-appointed South African Law Commission
 issued a draft report on the protection of individual rights
 which called, inter alia, for the creation of an independent
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 judiciary and a justiciable bill of rights. These principles
 have been endorsed by the SAG, ANC, and several other
 potential parties to negotiations for a new South African
 constitution.
 With regard to political prisoners, the Government-ANC
 agreement of August 6 included an arrangement for the release
 of political prisoners and the granting of indemnity for
 persons suspected of political offenses. Under the
 arrangement, prisoner releases and indemnity grants were to
 begin on September 1 and October 1 respectively, and be
 completed by April 30, 1991. As of the end of 1990, there had
 been 231 releases of prisoners since February 2 (95 since
 August 6), and some 1,079 persons who had left the country
 illegally had been granted indemnity for that offense. There
 is no clear figure on the number of such prisoners. A Human
 Rights Commission special report on political imprisonment
 (May 1990), which adopted a broad definition of the term
 similar to that eventually accepted by the Government/ANC
 working group, listed 1,522 political prisoners still in
 prison as of April 30, while estimating that the actual figure
 was between 2,500 and 3,000. The number of affected exiles is
 also unclear, although it is certain that several thousand
 persons will be involved.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Steps toward the dismantlement of the legal system of
 apartheid, which previously intruded into virtually every area
 of private life, have been taken or are planned. In June
 Parliament voted to repeal the Separate Amenities Act CSAA),
 which interfered with free association by allowing public
 premises to be reserved for the exclusive use of persons of a
 particular race. The repeal went into effect on October 15.
 Prior to this legislative action, the Government and the
 governing National Party had taken numerous administrative
 actions to discourage petty apartheid in municipal services.
 As a result, even before the SAA repeal the trend had
 continued toward desegregation of public facilities, with
 Pretoria this year joining the list of cities to open its
 transportation and other services to all races. Conservatives
 have tried to circumvent or roll back these measures by such
 devices as levying usage fees for libraries, pools, or
 beaches. In November, in the conservative northern Transvaal
 city of Louis Trichardt, a group of 25 to 30 white& reportedly
 attacked and beat a group of black children on a Sunday school
 sightseeing trip to a local park. The minister accompanying
 the children stated that nearby police did nothing to stop the
 attack. At least five children were treated for injuries at
 the hospital. A district police officer stated that the
 incident would be investigated. At year's end, 13 whites had
 been arrested, and the investigation continued. The National
 Party has been advising its political supporters that efforts
 to circumvent desegregation are out of keeping with the spirit
 of the times. Statements by top government officials made it
 clear that continued racial segregation of this nature would
 be dealt with through the courts and, if necessary,
 legislative changes.
 The Group Areas Act (GAA) of 1950 has been slated for
 abolition in the 1991 session of Parliament, and the
 Government is currently working on plans to promote creation
 of nonracial local government structures to replace the
 present racially segregated structures. The GAA still
 
 
 M4
 SOUTH AFRICA
 requires residential areas to be segregated by race.
 Notwithstanding these requirements, a number of so-called gray
 areas exist in major cities, where blacks, "coloreds," and
 Asians reside in technically white areas, often without
 government interference. The only legal exceptions to the
 policy of segregated residential areas are a limited number of
 neighborhoods which in the last year have been set aside as
 "free settlement areas," open to all races. Although the
 policy of identifying and declaring free settlement areas is
 still proceeding, the concept is likely to become moot if the
 GAA is scrapped in 1991 as planned and all areas become open
 to all races.
 By law, black South Africans who are deemed to be citizens of
 one of the so-called independent homelands are required to
 obtain work permits in order to reside in urban areas outside
 their homelands and, if they succeed in this, may not be
 accompanied to these areas by their spouses and children. In
 practice, these laws are no longer being enforced. However,
 available housing is inadequate to accommodate the continuing
 influx of workers and their families from "independent"
 homelands, and those caught squatting illegally on vacant land
 are still subject to deportation to these homelands.
 Also scheduled for abolition by the 1991 Parliament are the
 Land Acts of 1913 and 1936, which limits land ownership in
 nonhomeland rural areas to whites. Blacks are currently
 allowed to live in these areas only with the permission of
 white landowners; nearly all are farm laborers whose numbers
 and freedom of movement are regulated by numerous other
 statutes. For three decades, the Government engaged in a
 policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans from land
 reserved for whites, often to areas in the homelands with
 hopelessly inadequate infrastructure and insufficient land and
 water for profitable (or even subsistence) agriculture. The
 Government has now announced that it will not carry out any
 more such forced removals; however, a few actions of this kind
 still appear to be going on, mainly through the agency of the
 "independent" homeland governments. Forced evictions to
 resettlement camps took place in several areas of Natal,
 although some infrastructure and conservation-related removals
 were amicably resolved.
 One major "pillar of apartheid" not yet slated for repeal is
 the Population Registration Act (PRA), which requires every
 child born in South Africa to be registered and classified
 according to race. Some government officials have suggested
 that repeal of the PRA would be problematic because the
 current Parliament is constituted according to racial
 criteria, and the elimination of these criteria would
 therefore remove the legal basis for the current voters'
 rolls. But even if no action is taken during the 1991
 parliamentary session, the Government has expressed its
 understanding that the PRA will fall away when a new
 constitution is negotiated.
 Under the State of Emergency, while still in effect, as well
 as in a number of designated "unrest areas" in the Transvaal,
 various laws and regulations gave police the authority in
 specific circumstances to enter homes without a warrant.
 Included were situations where an officer had reason to
 believe a warrant would be issued but that the delay caused by
 first obtaining the warrant would defeat the purpose of the
 search. Also, regardless of technical legal constraints,
 
 
 365
 SOUTH AFRICA
 police in practice often enter and search homes of black
 activists as a means of intimidation, frequently in the early
 morning hours.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Civil conflict increased in 1990. Accurate statistics on the
 number of deaths related to political violence remained
 difficult to obtain, but in September the police stated that
 violence between black South Africans had claimed the lives of
 792 people in the Pretoria-Witswatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV)
 area, which includes Johannesburg, between January I and
 September 15. As of November 22, the nationwide totals of the
 police were 2,067 killed and 2,236 injured. The South African
 Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) claimed that 3,038 people
 had died in political violence in the first 10 months of the
 year, a figure that rose to 3,609 by the end of the year. The
 SAIRR also reported that black town councilors and policemen
 had been a major focus of violent attack in 1990, with at
 least 22 off-duty black policemen and 6 councilors dying in
 the first 7 months of the year. The police also reported that
 during the January 1 to November 22 period, police nationwide
 had killed 197 persons and wounded 1,168 during unrest-related
 police actions, while 59 police officers had been killed and
 600 injured. In contrast, the Human Rights Commission
 recorded 263 people killed and 2,877 injured from February 2
 to November 30 in what they termed "police actions against
 political actions." All these figures exclude the
 "independent" homelands. (See also Section 2.b. on excessive
 use of force by security forces.)
 Political violence in Natal continued. Human rights monitors
 reported that in factional fighting between ANC/UDF/COSATU
 supporters and Inkatha members approximately 1,500 people were
 killed between January and September of 1990, compared to the
 SAP figure of 808 deaths. Some 11,000 displaced persons
 flocked to emergency camps in the Pietermaritzburg midlands
 area, and camps were set up in areas north of Durban as well.
 Sporadic peace negotiations between the two groups continued
 but produced no lasting significant breakthroughs. The causes
 of this violence are many, including the power struggle
 between Inkatha and the ANC/UDF/COSATU; desires for personal
 revenge; attempts to save family and possessions from harm;
 frustration over inferior schools and other facilities for
 blacks; and resentment of police, both black and white.
 An unprecedented expansion of Natal-style internecine violence
 to the Transvaal shook townships surrounding Johannesburg
 beginning in July. Several hundred people died as warring
 sides claiming affiliation to Inkatha or the ANC battled each
 other with knives, spears, and guns, including some automatic
 weapons such as AK-47's. On July 27, at least 19 people were
 killed and 45 injured as Inkatha members leaving a rally
 fought non-Inkatha residents in Sebokeng Township. At the
 height of the warfare, over 150 people died in Thokoza between
 August 14-15 in clashes between Inkatha supporters and
 residents of a nearby squatter camp. There were also clashes
 involving other organizations; a 2-year-old struggle between
 ANC and AZAPO supporters in the township of Bekkersdal claimed
 scores of lives. The violence abated in September, and then
 started again at a lower level late in the year. The
 Transvaal violence led many human rights observers to believe,
 as ANC leaders contended, that it may have been aided and
 abetted by a so-called third force or "hidden hand," involving
 
 
 366
 SOUTH AFRICA
 rightwing extremist elements of the security forces, although
 evidence of this was lacking.
 Numerous attempts by the Government and other parties to
 arrange a Mandela/Buthelezi meeting on the violence proved
 unsuccessful in 1990. Although the two sides agreed in
 principle to hold such a meeting, their repeated failures to
 agree on a date led observers to question the good faith of
 both organizations. Buthelezi was accused of using the
 violence to further his own political ambitions, while Mandela
 was accused of yielding to pressure from ANC young militants
 who opposed a meeting with Buthelezi.
 On June 7, President de Klerk announced the end of the
 4-year-old State of Emergency (SOE) except in Natal. The SOE
 had been identified as a key obstacle to negotiations by the
 ANC. On August 24, the Government responded to the Transvaal
 violence by declaring 19 magisterial districts encompassing 27
 affected townships "unrest areas," restoring substantial
 extraordinary powers to the police, eventually including the
 ability to impose curfews and confiscate dangerous weapons.
 This action was at least partly responsible for restoring
 relative calm-to the Transvaal. The Government has continued
 to declare new "unrest areas" during outbreaks of violence in
 the townships and has generally been quick to repeal curfews
 once the violence has subsided. On October 18, the SOE was
 lifted in Natal.
 Political violence flared in other areas of the country
 throughout 1990. Heavy rioting in "colored" areas of Port
 Elizabeth in early August, apparently sparked by problems
 connected with the "colored" Labor Party and local education
 complaints, left at least 46 people dead and over 200
 injured.. From late May through mid-July in the Boland areas
 near Cape Town, demonstrations protesting remaining municipal
 apartheid measures resulted in approximately 120 clashes with
 police, with 3 deaths and scores of injuries. In several
 areas in the Eastern Cape, there were reports of clashes
 between ANC and PAC supporters. There was also widesspread
 and prolonged violence in the Cape Town township of
 Khayelitsha.
 The Government has been criticized by human rights observers
 for its inability to control the violence, especially the
 longstanding strife plaguing Natal. These groups point to,
 inter alia, the handful of criminal prosecutions in relation
 to the thousands of deaths as evidence of the State's
 insufficient determination to stem the killings. Other
 observers, including a widely respected judge on the Natal
 bench, point to the serious problem of the unwillingness of
 witnesses to give evidence because of fear. Opposition
 groups, such as the ANC and the PAC, accuse the Government of
 collusion with more conservative vigilante forces in the
 Transvaal and Natal, but solid proof of this has never been
 presented.
 Necklace murders, where gasoline-filled tires are placed over
 a victim's head and set alight, made a gruesome reappearance
 in 1990. Over 52 people, mostly in Natal and the PWV area,
 were killed in this way between January and August. The
 necklace is a method of summary execution favored by gangs of
 ANC-affiliated youths known as "comrades."
 On July 6, a bomb at a crowded black taxi stand in
 Johannesburg wounded 27 people. On September 13, a group of
 
 
 367
 SOUTH AFRICA
 apparently well-trained men boarded a commuter train and
 indiscriminately hacked and shot 26 people to death, injuring
 over 100 others. Police later arrested five hostel dwellers.
 On October 9 in Natal, gunmen strafed a public bus with
 automatic weapons, killing 6 people and wounding 27 others.
 Three members of a white extremist group were subsequently
 arrested.
 These and many other incidents further fueled speculation
 concerning a "third force," and the specter of rightwing
 terrorism by whites opposed to the dismantling of apartheid
 grew dramatically in 1990. In this connection, there were
 also a large number of bombings throughout the year which
 killed or wounded many people, such as one in Pretoria on
 August 11 which left 16 wounded, and another in Soweto on
 September 14 which left 3 dead. In these many bombing
 incidents, police often suspected white extremists, including
 members of the Afrikaner Liberation Movement (AWB), Boerestaat
 Party, and White Liberation Party. Bombing targets included
 black union offices, newspaper premises, and offices of the
 National Party and the opposition Democratic Party. A
 previously unknown organization, the Orde Boerevolk, claimed
 credit for a bomb explosion at the U.S. Ambassador's residence
 in early October, and several members of that group were
 subsequently arrested. Rightwing groups, particularly the
 AWB, held frequent mass meetings preaching racial intolerance
 and open resistance to the Government's reform measures. They
 made open threats, disrupted meetings and marches by groups of
 other political persuasions, and even raided military arsenals.
 There were also a number of political assassinations
 throughout the year; victims included activists of the ANC,
 the PAC, and other antiapartheid organization, as well as
 police informants. The varying political affiliations of
 those killed suggest that assassinations are conducted by
 groups ranging from rightwing to opposition elements. In
 1990, as in years past, no political assassinations were
 successfully investigated by the authorities.
 Mrs. Winnie Mandela appeared in a Soweto magistrate court on
 September 24 to face multiple charges of kidnaping and assault
 with intent to commit grievous bodily harm in connection with
 the abduction of four youths by her informal bodyguard. One
 of the bodyguards, Jerry Richardson, was convicted of the
 murder of one of the four youths, 14-year-old Stompie Moeketsi
 Seipei. Her trial is scheduled for early 1991.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Particularly in the wake of President de Klerk's February 2
 speech, South Africans speak freely on most issues, and
 segments of the country's almost totally white-owned press
 continue to engage in vigorous criticism of the Government and
 its policies. Included in the February 2 actions was the
 abolition of most of the media regulations that had been
 promulgated under the SOE. Countrywide prohibitions against
 publishing photographs of unrest continued until June when
 they were renewed, along with the SOE, only for troubled Natal
 province. These prohibitions fell in Natal as well with the
 October lifting of the SOE there.
 Soon after February 2, Minister of Home Affairs Gene Louw
 began to review the country's entire system of news collection
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 and dissemination. On March 20, he announced in Parliament
 the formation of a task force to review regulations on
 broadcasting in the country. On March 26, the media council,
 an industry self-regulatory tribunal, announced that Louw had
 asked it to undertake an extensive review of all legal
 impediments to news reporting.
 These welcome developments in the normalization of political
 life, and the discussions between the ANC and the Government
 which followed, led to the perception by many South Africans
 of greatly broadened freedom of expression. For the first
 time, the media were free to explore the views of all
 opposition parties and politicians and to join academics in
 reviewing important previously banned historical documents.
 Newspapers and human rights activists were quick to point out
 the large number of restrictive laws remaining on the books
 for use at the authorities' discretion. Clauses in these
 laws--including the ISA, the Protection of Information Act,
 the Publications Act, the Police Act, the Prisons Act, and the
 Defense Act--continue to restrict freedom of speech and of the
 press in South Africa. For example, the Afrikaans-language
 Vrye Weekblad's expose on the involvement of the National
 Intelligence Service with the Stellenbosch University
 Institute for Soviet Studies resulted in the conviction of the
 paper's editor on criminal charges under the Protection of
 Information Act. Although enforcement has been sporadic, the
 existence of the laws, together with experiences during the
 recent emergency restrictions, has resulted in a situation in
 which self-censorship has been common, and opposition
 newspaper editors have often surrendered substantial editing
 responsibility to their lawyers.
 Publications that continue to test their rights find
 themselves paying expensive legal fees for advice prior to
 publication and for the defense of their actions in court.
 Major continuing legal battles involve the opposition
 weeklies, the Afrikaans-language Vrye Weekblad and the
 English-language Weekly Mail, relatively small publications
 whose economic viability is threatened by costly legal
 battles. Rather than banning or seizing publications, state
 pressure has been brought to bear on them through civil or
 criminal action. Vrye Weekblad, known for its investigative
 reporting, exposed the existence of "hit squads" operating
 within the South African police late last year, provoking a
 national uproar and a special investigative commission. Since
 then, its criticism of public officials has been met with
 personal defamation suits, largely funded at taxpayer expense,
 and the Protection of Information Act prosecution referenced
 above.
 Other concerns have arisen as a result of the Public Safety
 Act regulations promulgated in August in response to the
 Transvaal violence. Critics charge these measures have grave
 implications for press coverage of domestic unrest. Under the
 regulations, 19 magisterial districts, including 27 townships,
 were declared "unrest areas" for a period of 3 months,
 empowering security forces to remove or arrest persons at the
 scene of unrest if "it is necessary for the combating or
 prevention of public disturbance, disorder, riot or public
 violence or the maintenance or restoration of public order."
 
 
 369
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Shortly thereafter, some journalists began to complain that
 they were being detained or asked to leave these areas.
 Notable in its growth during 1990 was violence committed by
 unknown figures, alleged to be rightwing political activists,
 against the press. Throughout the year, several journalists
 charged that members of the rightwing Afrikaner
 Weerstandsbeweging had assaulted them. In April and May,
 reporters covering the Heimstra Commission of Inquiry, which
 focused 6n allegations of spying under the aegis of the
 Johannesburg City Council, reported harassment, threats, and
 assaults. On July 4, a bomb fabricated from commercial
 explosives was detonated at Vrye Weekblad. On September 9,
 two bombs, both made from commercial explosives, exploded
 outside the Johannesburg offices of the Afrikaans-language
 newspaper Beeld.
 The Government exercises a near monopoly on television and
 radio broadcasting through the state-owned South African
 Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), although access to the
 airwaves is also available to radio and television stations
 broadcasting from the so-called independent homelands and to
 M-Net, which is owned by four major newspaper publishing
 groups. Late in the year M-Net was for the first time given
 authorization to carry news programs, subject to restrictions
 on air times.
 While the Government professes that SABC is-politically
 independent, a wide range of the political spectrum, including
 the ANC, the liberal-leaning Democratic Party and the
 rightwing Conservative Party, characterizes SABC as an
 editorial arm of the ruling National Party. However, SABC has
 made substantial efforts to broaden the scope of political
 opinion broadcast to South Africans since the State
 President's watershed speech on February 2. On March 5,
 Director General Christo Viljoen announced that SABC would
 drop its daily editorial comment--which had been a reflection
 of current government thinking--from. the radio news as "no
 longer suitable." In the months that followed, television
 news programs featured interviews with political leaders
 across much of the political spectrum, including Mandela and
 other ANC leaders.
 Under the Publications Act (applicable to most periodicals
 with the exception of newspapers), the importation, possession
 and publication of politically or morally "undesirable" works
 is prohibited. Materials subject to censorship include those
 found to be "indecent or obscene," "blasphemous," or which
 constitute a "threat to the security of the state, the general
 welfare and the peace and good order." Determinations are
 made by the governmental Directorate of Publications and
 routinely appealed to the Publications Appeal Board--decisions
 that are not subject to judicial review except in rare
 instances.
 In the weeks following President de Klerk's February 2 speech,
 a number of political books were unbanned, including Nelson
 Mandela's collection of speeches "No Easy Walk to Freedom,"
 banned for 25 years; Donald Wood's "Biko"; Albie Sachs'
 "Justice in South Africa"; and Kwame Nkrumah's "I Speak of
 Freedom." Frantz Fanon's "The Wretched of the Earth" was
 permitted under restrictive conditions. "Sechaba," the
 publication of the ANC, was unbanned. The films "A Dry White
 Season" and "Cry Freedom" were also unbanned, the latter
 showing to packed movie houses in black townships around the
 
 
 370
 SOUTH AFRICA
 country. The pace of unbannings for political books and films
 continued in the months that followed, with censorship
 focusing most heavily on materials alleged to be pornographic
 or blasphemous.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association in South Africa was given
 a considerable boost in 1990 with the scrapping of the SOE and
 the unbanning of the ANC, PAC, AZAPO, and other antiapartheid
 organizations. Nearly all of these organizations, joined by
 internal opposition groups (such as the UDF) previously-under
 pressure from repressive legislation, took advantage of the
 changed-political climate to participate openly in the debate
 on a new political dispensation in South Africa.
 Continuing the trend begun in late 1989, numerous mass
 meetings and marches were permitted. However, the ISA gives
 magistrates the power to ban or impose conditions on the
 holding of public meetings and to close off areas to the
 public to prevent prohibited gatherings. On March 30, the
 Government extended a blanket ban under the ISA on all outdoor
 political gatherings unless permission was obtained (except
 for funerals and sports events), and on indoor gatherings that
 encouraged educational boycotts and stay-aways. However,
 there have generally been few known instances since February
 of magistrates refusing to grant permission for gatherings or
 demonstrations, regardless of size or purpose.
 On some occasions, the police and army forcibly broke up
 demonstrations and protest marches when no permission was
 sought or granted. On March 26, police killed 12 people and
 wounded at least 281 when they opened fire on protestors who
 were presenting a petition to the Sebokeng police station. A
 commission of inquiry into the shootings, headed by Justice
 Goldstone, blamed the police for excessive use of force, lack
 of discipline, and failure to follow proper procedures, and
 recommended that the Attorney-General investigate the actions
 of certain policemen. As of the end of the year, the
 Government still had the commission's report under advisement,
 while scores of lawsuits had been filed on behalf of the
 Sebokeng victims. On July 8, at least 256 people were injured
 when fleeing tear gas which was fired by police around and
 into an exit-blocked stadium in Mamelodi Township near
 Pretoria. Organizers of the stadium meeting claimed they had
 secured proper authorization (disputed by the police) and
 pursued legal remedies.
 From late May through mid-July in the Boland areas near Cape
 Town, demonstrations protesting the remaining municipal
 apartheid measures resulted in approximately 120 clashes with
 3 deaths and scores of injuries. The ANC Western Cape
 coordinator, maintaining that elements of the SAP had failed
 to grasp that the country was entering a new era, alleged
 "shockingly inhuman police violence" towards demonstrators and
 called for the cessation of abusive police action and the end
 of the standard use of lethal ammunition, including bird shot
 and rubber bullets.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are numerous religious denominations as well as an
 estimated 3,000 independent black churches in South Africa.
 The Government respects religious freedom. Religious groups
 have been allowed to worship and engage in political
 
 
 371
 SOUTH AFRICA
 activities without government interference. In 1990 there
 were no detentions of clergy members resulting from their
 engaging in political activities. This is a departure from
 1989 when politically active clergy were detained, harassed
 and imprisoned because of their antiapartheid activities.
 Despite the changes that have occurred over the past year,
 many churches, like other aspects of life in South Africa,
 continue to be organized along racial lines.
 The Defense Act provides alternative service options for
 pacifist religious objectors, although there are some persons
 in this category who serve prison terms. (Only white males
 are obliged to perform military service.) There are no
 religious objectors presently in prison. Conscientious
 objectors on nonreligious grounds had been subject to a 6-year
 prison sentence. On January 29, President de Klerk announced
 a 50-percent reduction in the length of sentences for both
 nonreligious and religious objectors (the latter's alternative
 service period is one-half of the total length of the period
 of military service).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Since the repeal of the Pass Laws in 1986, black South
 Africans have not had to carry government-issued passes
 proving their right to be in an urban area. "Independent"
 homeland "citizens" still require work permits for employment
 outside their homelands, but South African authorities no
 longer rigorously enforce this regulation.
 Blacks are still assigned ethnicity--and thus a homeland to
 which they belong--at birth. If a homeland is granted
 "independence" by the Government, blacks assigned to that
 homeland lose their South African citizenship and receive the
 "citizenship" of the homeland. An estimated 8 million blacks
 lost South African citizenship with the "independence" of
 Transkei (1976), Bophuthatswana (1977), Venda (1979), and
 Ciskei (1981). A 1986 law provided for restoration of South
 African citizenship to an estimated 1.75 million people with
 "permanent residence" rights in South Africa. During 1990,
 the Government clearly altered course, ruling out
 "independence" for additional homelands and announcing that
 "reincorporation" of "independent" homelands is open to
 negotiation.
 The Government has denied passports to some white and many
 black antiapartheid activists in the past, but the rate of
 refusal was down markedly in 1990 for those regarded as
 radically critical of the Government's policies. Blacks
 assigned to an "independent" homeland usually cannot obtain
 South African passports. This sometimes deters international
 travel as some blacks refuse to accept a homeland passport,
 insisting that the Gogernment recognize them as citizens of
 South Africa. In 1982 the Rand Supreme Court ruled that the
 Minister of Home Affairs has the absolute discretion to revoke
 or refuse to issue a passport without giving any reasons for
 his action.
 South Africa is not a party to international conventions on
 refugees and does not recognize any form of refugee status, or
 the international legal protection afforded to those with
 refugee status   Estimates of Mozambicans in South Africa
 range from 300 to 500. While the South African Government
 considers the majority of these to be illegal economic
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 migrants, monitoring groups estimate that up to 250,000 may
 have legitimate claims to refugee status as victims of civil
 strife in Mozambique. Approximately 210,000 of these refugees
 live in the homelands of Kangwane and Gazankulu or work as
 farm laborers in the eastern Transvaal where they are allowed
 to live with temporary 3- and 6-month government residence
 permits. Mozambicans apprehended outside these areas without
 permission are forcibly repatriated to Mozambique without an
 interview to determine whether they can safely be returned.
 South African private and voluntary organizations as well as
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provide
 relief assistance in the homelands. The Government permits
 access by international observers to areas where these
 refugees are found.
 The Government has taken harsh measures to prevent the entry
 of more Mozambicans. It maintains an electrified fence along
 the South African border with Mozambique (apparently with that
 Government's acquiescence), but credible reports indicate the
 voltage was reduced to nonlethal levels in September. In
 1990, as in 1989, the Government turned the power off to allow
 refugees to cross safely into South Africa during clashes
 along the border between guerrillas and Mozambique government
 forces. However, it promptly repatriated the refugees once
 the immediate danger was considered to have passed. There
 were no known fatalities caused by the electrified fence in
 1990. International observers and refugee assistance workers
 credibly report instances of the use of live ammunition
 against Mozambicans attempting to enter South Africa.
 The ANC and the Government reached agreement on procedures for
 the indemnification and repatriation of political exiles by
 April 30, 1991. The National Coordination Committee, which
 includes representatives from the churches, black nationalist
 groups, and service organizations, is overseeing
 implementation of the repatriation plan; participation of the
 U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in the effort is
 also a possibility. UNHCR's preliminary estimate was that
 some 30,000 persons were in need of repatriation assistance.
 Most of these refugees are affiliated in some way with one of
 the antiapartheid organizations in exile.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The extent to which South African citizens have the right to
 change their government democratically depends on race. The
 majority of them, the blacks, have no such right. The 1983
 Constitution created a tricameral parliament with separate
 chambers for whites, "coloreds," and Asians. The respective
 groups are represented in the tricameral Parliament in a
 racial ratio of 4 white/2 "colored"/l Asian, thus ensuring
 white dominance. Members of each house are elected from
 separate, racially based voter rolls. Each house has primary
 responsibility for its "own affairs," i.e., legislation
 affecting its own racial constituency. The State President
 has complete discretion to decide which issues are of general
 concern and are therefore to be treated by all three
 chambers. Matters that are usually considered general affairs
 include foreign policy, defense, national security, and black
 affairs. Education (except black education) is normally dealt
 with as an "own affair" subject to general laws prescribing
 norms and standards for salaries, curriculum, and examinations.
 
 
 373
 SOUTH AFRICA
 The terms of the 1983 Constitution and the existence of a
 white majority in Parliament ensure control by the white House
 of Assembly over general affairs. While there is opposition
 in the House of Assembly, the majority National Party has
 controlled South African political power and legislative
 affairs since 1948. Internal differences are in theory
 resolved in party caucuses, but in practice the State
 President, who is also the National Party leader, resolves
 disputes in close coordination with senior party leaders.
 Since F. W. de Klerk succeeded P. W. Botha as National Party
 leader, however, there has been a greater degree of intraparty
 democracy and freedom to debate controversial issues.
 In the September 1989 general election, the National Party won
 48 percent of the popular vote and 94 of 166 popularly elected
 seats. The Conservative Party won 32 percent of the popular
 vote and increased its elected representation to 39 seats.
 The liberal-leaning Democratic Party won 20 percent of the
 vote and 33 seats. President de Klerk interpreted the
 election results as a "mandate for reform." But, after
 February 2, Conservative Party leaders began demanding a new
 election, maintaining that de Klerk's comprehensive reform
 policies substantially exceeded the National Party's election
 platform. In the several by-elections that have been held
 since February 2, the Democratic Party has suffered a
 substantial decline in support and the National Party, while
 gaining support from former DP voters, has suffered numerous
 defections to the Conservative Party.
 In September President de Klerk in his role as party leader
 proposed that the National Party open its membership rolls to
 persons of all races. While this was seen as dramatic
 evidence of the change of thinking in the ruling National
 Party, blacks' rights to vote and hold office remained limited
 to their respective homelands or, in the case of urban blacks,
 to their townships. Faced with strong resistance, the
 Government is no longer seriously pursuing independence for
 the remaining six "self-governing" homelands. Rampant
 corruption and other factors have so far inspired military
 coups in three of the "independent" homelands (Transkei,
 Ciskei, and Venda). Sentiment is building within the
 "independent" homelands for reintegration with South Africa in
 the context of negotiations for a new South African
 constitution.
 More than la million blacks live in townships near white urban
 areas. The only voting rights they are able to exercise are
 those granted under the Community Councils Act of 1977 and the
 Black Local Authorities Act of 1982. The latter Act elevated
 the formal status of black municipal authorities to that
 enjoyed by white municipal governments. However, black local
 governments still face critical problems of limited powers,
 inadequate financial resources, and lack of political
 credibility.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are indications of an improved governmental attitude
 since the beginning of 1990 toward nongovernmental
 organizations monitoring human rights issues. Representatives
 of various local human rights organizations noted a general
 easing in government harassment. Lawyers for Human Rights,
 the Black Sash, the Human Rights Commission, the Legal
 
 
 374
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Resources Center, the South African Council of Churches, the
 University of the Witwatersrand Center for Applied Legal
 Studies, the Human Rights Trust in Port Elizabeth, the
 National Antirepression Forum, the Independent Board of
 Inquiry Into Informal Repression and other groups are involved
 in a wide range of human rights issues and assistance to
 persons who are aggrieved by the apartheid system. In the
 past, active members of such groups have been subjected to
 personal harassment, including office break-ins, sabotage of
 automobiles, threatening phone calls, opened mail, and loss of
 jobs. It is unclear to what extent these acts were carried
 out by rightwing groups outside of the Government. A number
 of human rights monitors and lawyers were also detained. Such
 incidents of harassment appear to have declined markedly over
 the last year, although they have not ceased altogether.
 In contrast to its previous record of noncooperation with
 United Nations bodies, in June the Government permitted a U.N.
 delegation led by Under Secretary General Abdulrahim Farah to
 tour the country for 10 days, holding over 50 meetings with
 representatives of various parties and groups. Foreign
 Minister Pik Botha also received the delegation at the
 government guest house in Pretoria. Farah described his talks
 during the trip as "informative and constructive," and his
 findings became part of the Secretary General's report on
 apartheid released on July 16.
 After a 1986 vote by an ICRC conference in Geneva to expel a
 South African delegation, the Government reduced the ICRC
 staff in South Africa to eight persons. In 1990 the
 Government and the ICRC began negotiations to increase this
 number again. Negotiations also continue regarding ICRC
 access to prisoners and detainees. While permission had not
 yet been received at year's end to visit prisoners in
 detention (as opposed to convicted criminals), an ICRC
 spokesperson voiced the impression that the Government has
 generally become more flexible in its approach.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 South Africa's black majority, and to a lesser degree Asian
 and "colored" communities, suffer widespread and legally
 sanctioned discrimination based on race in many aspects of
 life. The Separate Amenities Act was repealed on October 15.
 Despite announcements that the Group Areas Act and other
 apartheid laws would be abolished in the near future, there
 continued to be strict enforcement of such laws, for example,
 in the denial of applications of nonwhite persons for housing
 in white areas. Other kinds of discrimination continued as
 well, such as the great disparity in per capita outlays for
 white and black students. While reservation of certain jobs
 for whites is no longer legally mandated, employment
 opportunities for blacks remain limited. Government-paid
 ,pensions are set according to race, but some steps have been
 taken to narrow the gap.
 Women of all races in South Africa suffer varying degrees of
 legal, cultural, and economic discrimination, most of which is
 based on tradition rather than codified in law. In addition
 to the racism and disenfranchisement that most South African
 women face, they are victims of sexism and of a legal system
 and traditional rules which relegate them to positions of
 inferiority. Female workers, especially black females,
 continued to earn less than male workers. Employment
 
 
 375
 SOUTH AFRICA
 opportunities for women remained principally in the domestic,
 farm, and factory sectors. Labor law does not sanction trade
 union representation for domestic workers, and salaries are
 left virtually to the whim of employers. The Government did
 announce in 1990 that the wage disparity between male and
 female teachers would be eliminated in two stages, beginning
 in the 1991-92 fiscal year and completed by 1992-93.
 Legal discrimination based on sex continues to exist with
 respect to property and maternity issues, e.g., pregnancy
 remains a legal basis for dismissal from a job. In the area
 of social welfare rights, women are at the mercy of
 administrative discretion in areas such as unemployment
 benefits, insurance pensions, and legal aid.
 Violence against women continued to be a major problem. Rape
 within marriage is not a crime in South African law, but a
 husband may be charged for assault accompanying rape.
 According to women's groups, which are growing in strength,
 victims of rape face insensitive investigations and medical
 procedures, and there is often a lack of official
 followthrough. An amendment to the law was secured to
 prohibit the disclosure of the victim's identity. Another
 serious problem faced by women in sexual offense cases is the
 requirement in South African law that the victim's evidence
 must be corroborated. Courts will not convict upon the
 evidence of the woman alone. Wife beating and abuse is also a
 major problem in South Africa, occurring to a high degree in
 all racial groups. Family violence is not viewed as a
 community concern but as a domestic matter. A common
 complaint is that police do not intervene even after receiving
 complaints from female victims. At present, crimes of
 domestic violence are dealt with in the courts only as
 criminal assault cases. Magistrate's courts may respond by
 issuing peace orders binding the culprit to hold the peace,
 and Supreme Courts, on the application of the select few who
 have funds for the expensive procedure involved, may issue
 orders interdicting the perpetrator from assaulting,
 harassing, or endangering the victim. Courts are reluctant to
 order the removal of the abuser from the home. There is
 selected media coverage of abuse cases, which often tends
 toward the sensational.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 South Africa's Labor Relations Act entitles all workers in the
 private sector freely to join labor unions of their choosing.
 Legislation a decade ago granted blacks full status as
 employees with the right to form free and independent trade
 unions. Black union membership has increased some tenfold
 since then. Although reliable statistics are unavailable, it
 is likely that more than 2 million workers were members of
 trade unions in 1990, and probably more than 1 million of
 those members were black. Broad estimates of the percent of
 the work force organized range between 25 and 35 percent of
 nonagricultural workers.
 South Africa's unions are independent of direct government
 control. The system of apartheid, however, impinges on all
 nonwhite workers and unionists, limiting their political
 rights, access to legal process, and freedom of expression.
 As unions increasingly assumed the role of voicing black
 workers demands for political rights, the Government in the
 
 
 376
 SOUTH AFRICA
 past imposed specific restrictions on their activities. It
 sometimes banned trade union gatherings or restricted their
 agendas to "nonpolitical" issues. In 1988 the Government
 prohibited the country's largest trade union federation, the
 Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), from engaging
 in political action; on February 2 it removed this
 restriction. The COSATU's leadership protested during the
 year that the police continued to harass them, but there were
 no reports in 1990 of the Government directly interfering with
 union activities.
 South Africa extended the right to strike, long enjoyed by
 white workers, to all private sector workers regardless of
 race in 1979. Since then work stoppages triggered by
 collective bargaining disputes, and occasionally political
 issues, have been commonplace. The number of strikes
 increased dramatically in 1990. A survey of 136 strikes in
 the first 6 months of 1990 revealed that most disputes (65
 percent) were over wages.
 The most prominent strikes in 1990 occurred in South Africa's
 commercial sector. In June and July some 22,000 members of
 the South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union
 were striking at the same time against the country's largest
 hotel chain, its largest grocery chain, and its largest retail
 chain. In each case union and management negotiators resolved
 the dispute.
 South African law prohibits public employees from striking.
 Each minister, in consultation with appropriate offices and
 advisory bodies, determines annual wage increases for his
 ministry, and legislation governing each public service sector
 establishes machinery for collective bargaining with staff
 associations and dispute resolution. In most public service
 sectors, disputes are referred to the appropriate minister and
 then to arbitration or mediation if necessary. Increased
 efforts to unionize public workers in 1990 resulted in illegal
 public sector strikes becoming commonplace. They constituted
 over 45 percent of all strikes in the first half of 1990,
 compared to less that 0.5 percent in the first half of 1989.
 Public employers and workers in most cases settled their
 disputes through negotiations and occasionally through
 mediation.
 South Africa does not restrict union affiliation with regional
 or international labor organizations. Government restrictions
 on foreign funding have not affected these affiliations. The
 country's two largest federations, the COSATU and the National
 Council of Trade Unions, have chosen not to seek such
 affiliations. In contrast, many of their affiliates, as well
 as independent unions, are members of international trade
 secretariats and have developed contacts with their
 counterparts in North America and Western Europe.
 The Government dramatically lessened impediments to the travel
 of trade unionists in 1990. South African trade unionists now
 seldom have difficulty obtaining passports for foreign travel,
 and Western trade unionists now seemingly receive visas for
 travel to South Africa without great difficulty, considerably
 facilitating international trade union contact.
 A member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) from
 its inception in 1919, South Africa withdrew from the
 organization in 1964, but remains bound by the 12 ILO
 conventions it has ratified. In 1988 COSATU lodged a
 
 
 377
 SOUTH AFRICA
 complaint through ECOSOC with the ILO against the Government,
 claiming that amendments made that year to South Africa's
 Labor Relations Act give preference to racially constituted
 unions and abridge the right to strike. The Government has
 thus far declined to accept ILO jurisdiction over the
 complaint. Nevertheless, contact between the Government and
 the ILO increased significantly in 1990. The Government,
 along with business and labor, sent representatives to an
 ILO-sponsored conference in Harare in May to discuss proposed
 changes to South Africa's labor legislation, and the Minister
 for Manpower visited the ILO's headquarters in Geneva in
 September.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Excluded from the statutory system of industrial councils for
 years, black unions developed a collective bargaining
 tradition of their own. Unassisted by statute, collective
 bargaining relations were established by agreement at the
 enterprise level on the basis of majority representation. The
 Government does not interfere directly with union organizing
 in the private sector and has generally not intervened in the
 collective bargaining process. South African law prohibits
 discrimination by employers against union members and
 organizers, and disputes over recognition and other antiunion
 activities are relatively few. Amendments to the Labor
 Relations Act in 198a are broadly agreed to be antiunion.
 Government, business, and trade unions engaged in
 unprecedented talks in 1990 on the legislation and agreed on
 changes which appear likely to be implemented legislatively in
 early 1991.
 Collective bargaining is freely practiced throughout the
 country, with the major exceptions being public servants, farm
 workers, and domestic servants, who are not covered by the
 Labor Relations Act. In addition, South Africa's labor law
 does not apply to the so-called homelands, whose own labor
 legislation has generally not matched South Africa's. There
 have been clear signs that many homelands have discouraged
 trade union organizing. A series of strikes in the last 2
 years has prompted some homelands, such as Transkei and
 Ciskei, to bring their labor legislation closer to
 international standards. As a result, trade union organizing
 and activity is on the increase there and in other homelands.
 South Africa has no export processing zones.
 Private mediation services are available and have been
 voluntarily resorted to by management and black trade unions
 to resolve industrial disputes. The Labor Relations Act
 establishes an Industrial Court to rule in labor-management
 disputes, and its decisions appear to be balanced. The most
 common complaints filed with the Court concern dismissals,
 followed by unfair labor practices. Many observers believe,
 however, that amendments made to the Labor Relations Act in
 1988 skewed the Act, and therefore the Industrial Court, to
 favor employers. A new labor Court of Appealsnow oversees
 the Industrial Court and can overturn its decisions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 South Africa does not constitutionally or statutorily prohibit
 forced labor; however, the country's system of Roman-Dutch
 common law does not permit it, and it is not practiced.
 Reports appeared late in the year of Mozambican refugees being
 used as slave labor on South African farms. The extent of any
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 problem and the accuracy of the reports concerning
 exploitation of these often desperate people are unclear.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The basic conditions of Employment Act prohibit the employment
 of minors under age 15 in most industries, shops, and
 offices. The Mines and Works Act prohibits minors under 16
 from working underground. There is no restriction, however,
 on the age at which a person may work in agriculture.
 Legislation is only partially enforced by the responsible
 authorities at the Ministry of Manpower and the Mineral and
 Energy Affairs Ministry. One of the best known and documented
 instances of underage employment is young boys employed in
 black township coalyards.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legal minimum wage in South Africa. The Labor
 Relations Act instead provides a mechanism for negotiations
 between labor and management to set minimum wage standards
 industry by industry. At present over 100 industries covering
 most nonagricultural workers come under the provisions of the
 Act. A recent survey by the Labour Research Service found the
 average minimum wage for laborers in negotiated industrial
 agreements with unions in the first 6 months of 1990 to be
 approximately $275 per month. The same survey indicated that
 union-negotiated wage increases are running ahead of
 inflation. Wages paid unskilled and agricultural workers may
 be significantly less.
 In comparison, COSATU cites South Africa's minimum living
 level as approximately $210 per month and the household
 subsistence level as $220. It should be noted that the
 current exchange rate understates the domestic purchasing
 power of the rand.
 Attention to health and safety issues has increased in recent
 years. The state-funded National Occupational and Safety
 Association claims that the Ministry of Manpower effectively
 enforces minimum standards for workplace evironment. While
 its figures are disputed by some, the Association also claims
 that the number of workers suffering disabling injuries
 annually has dropped significantly over the last decade. Most
 industries have a standard workweek of 46 hours (which is also
 the legal maximum) as well as vacation and sick leave.
 Overtime is voluntary and limited to 10 hours per week. Work
 conditions in the homelands appear to be less advanced than
 the rest of South Africa.
