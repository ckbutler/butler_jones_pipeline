 JORDAN
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy with a constitution granting
 the King broad powers. The King forms and dissolves
 governments and is the ultimate arbiter of policy. The Prime
 Minister and the Council of Ministers (Cabinet), however,
 exercise considerable responsibility over many issues. The
 Constitution also provides for a bicameral parliament and an
 independent judiciary.
 Martial law has been in effect since the 1967 war which ended
 with Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Under martial law,
 some persons have been detained with little opportunity to
 communicate with acquaintances for varying periods, usually not
 exceeding several months. Generally, however, martial law has
 not much affected the civil rights of Jordanians.
 Jordan has a mixed economy with government participation in
 certain sectors, largely in basic industries. The Government
 of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai, formed in April 1985, has
 promoted free enterprise by canceling Jordanization of foreign
 banks, eliminating taxes on real property transactions, and
 vowing to encourage private investment and public sector
 discipline in a new development plan  Owing to declining
 foreign assistance and a weak world economy, Jordan's healthy
 economic growth of the past decade has leveled off in recent
 years.
 There were no significant changes in Jordan's human rights
 situation in 1985. The absence of political parties, martial
 law, and broad powers exercised by the police are areas of
 concern but recent trends have been favorable. The increased
 opportunities for women in all areas of life, the continued
 importance given to the rule of law and an independent
 judiciary, the gradual maturation of the Parliament, and recent
 fair and open elections have contributed to an improving human
 rights picture.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Jordanian Government does not sanction political killings.
 None has occurred since a prominent Palestinian leader, Fahd
 Kawasmeh, was assassinated by terrorists in December 1984.
 Summary executions do not occur in Jordan. Some Arabs have
 been sentenced to death based on a Jordanian law permitting
 trials in absentia for selling West Bank land to Israelis but
 these sentences have never been carried out.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances reported in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence that the Government condones or practices
 torture. There have been a few reports of ill-treatment by
 police. Judicial authorities take such allegations seriously
 
 
 1280
 JORDAN
 and have been known to dismiss cases based on apparent
 mistreatment. In May 1985, the Director of Public Security
 established a special office to handle any public complaints of
 abuse by security officers and promised to punish offenders.
 Jordanian law provides for the decent treatment of prisoners.
 Prison conditions are Spartan but not intentionally degrading.
 They are inspected by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross. Crowded conditions in some prisons were much relieved
 by a June 1985 Royal Amnesty releasing over 1,000 inmates. A
 modern central prison planned for Amman remains under
 construction.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Jordan has been under martial law since 1967, most
 persons are placed in custody by Jordanian authorities in
 accordance with the criminal code requiring imposition of
 charges within 48 hours. Persons may then be detained pending
 trial for 15 days, or longer if a court approves the
 prosecution's request for an extension. The criminal code is
 generally applied for persons arrested for designated martial
 law crimes, which include espionage, bribery of public
 officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons, black
 marketeering, and security offenses. Security forces have
 apparently detained incommunicado (or with limited outside
 access) some persons, possibly 50-75 in 1985, suspected of
 cross-border infiltration and security crimes. These persons
 are usually released or brought to trial after detention
 periods ranging from a few days to several months. A habeas
 corpus petition for any detained person may be brought before
 the High Court of Justice, but is unlikely to be granted for
 those accused of security offenses. Compulsory labor is
 forbidden by the Constitution and is not practiced. There are
 no instances of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All criminal cases, except martial law crimes and crimes
 committed by military personnel, are tried in civilian courts.
 The legal code and the independent selection of judges help to
 assure a fair trial. Trials are held in open court, except in
 a few cases such as those involving sexual offenses.
 Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty and have
 the right to be represented by counsel, to prepare a defense,
 to cross-examine witnesses, and to refrain from giving
 self-incriminatory testimony. The court appoints a lawyer for
 those who cannot afford one if the potential sentence is
 execution or life imprisonment. An effective appeals process
 may be utilized by either the defendant or the prosecution.
 Death sentences are seldom imposed. Three persons were
 reportedly executed in 1985, all for serious crimes involving
 murder and after lengthy judicial hearings.
 Civilian judges must demonstrate legal competence in written
 and oral examinations before selection by a board composed of
 three judges, the Chief Attorney General, and the
 Undersecretary of the Justice Ministry. Judges may be removed
 from office only after serious transgressions of the law and
 after a disciplinary board hearing.
 Martial law crimes are adjudicated in military court before a
 panel of three military officers trained in the law. The
 military court observes the law of criminal procedure and, in
 practice, defendants are given the same rights as in civilian
 
 
 1281
 JORDAN
 court except the right of appeal. Sentences of the court for
 martial law offenses must, however, be ratified by the Prime
 Minister in his capacity as Military Governor. The Prime
 Minister is authorized to increase, reduce, or annul the
 sentences. These cases are always reviewed for fairness by a
 legal advisor or the Justice Minister before the Prime Minister
 makes a decision. The military court also adjudicates all
 crimes committed by military personnel. In these cases, the
 Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces must ratify the
 sentences.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over most family matters,
 such as marriage, divorce, child custody, or guardianship. The
 Shari'a (Muslim religious law) applies to Muslims in these
 areas and a Shari'a court system handles disputes.
 Ecclesiastical courts handle similar matters for members of the
 main Christian sects. The civil courts administer the cases of
 other religious groups. Shari'a, however, must be applied to
 questions of inheritance for all communities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is respected. Police searches of
 homes require warrants except in rare cases involving security
 or the hot pursuit of fleeing suspects. It is believed that
 security personnel sometimes monitor telephones and
 correspondence but the practice is evidently not widespread.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution safeguards freedoms of speech and of the press
 but permits limited media constraints under martial law.
 Jordanians freely express wide-ranging opinions, including
 criticism of the Government, in informal settings. Public
 debate is less pronounced in the state-owned radio and
 television networks and in the privately-owned but
 government-influenced press where a form of self-censorship
 persists. The Government provides editors with guidance from
 time to time on key foreign policy and security matters. On
 most other issues, government interference is minimal and
 critical commentary is tolerated.
 Journalists must register with the Information Ministry and
 join the Journalists Association. One editor was placed under
 house arrest for two months in 1985 following a controversial
 story. A part-time political columnist was also reportedly
 arrested in May 1985 and charged with membership in an illegal
 organization.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available, though
 they are subject to infrequent censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public demonstrations require a permit, rarely granted, from
 the Interior Minister. Except for a brief sit-in by United
 Nations Relief and Works Agency workers protesting potential
 reductions in services, no significant demonstrations occurred
 in 1985. All organizations require government approval and may
 not have political objectives. Government surveillance of
 public meetings, university activities, and organization
 gatherings is routine.
 
 
 1282
 JORDAN
 Jordanians are free to join labor unions and professional
 associations. These organizations require government licenses,
 which are usually granted without difficulty. Unions and
 associations defend the interests of their members and their
 officers are elected by the membership. Unions engage in
 collective bargaining. Strikes are legal except for government
 workers and have occurred in the past, although not in 1985.
 The law requires that an employer be given advance notice
 (usually 14 days) before a strike. The Ministry of Labor and
 Social Development may arbitrate labor disputes.
 Professional associations among doctors, engineers, lawyers,
 pharmacists, and similar professional groups operate freely.
 They maintain influence with the Government in their respective
 areas of interest.
 About 20 percent of the Jordanian work force is unionized.
 Seventeen unions comprise the Jordan Federation of Trade Union
 (JFTU). Several other unions do not belong to the JFTU.
 Unions have virtually no political role and confine themselves
 to representing their membership in such areas as wages,
 working conditions, and termination of workers. Their
 effectiveness varies widely. The JFTU actively participates in
 international organizations such as the International Labor
 Organization and the International Confederation of Arab Trade
 Unions.
 c. Freedom-of Religion
 Islam, the state religion, is observed by well over 90 percent
 of Jordanians. However, the constitutional guarantee of
 freedom of worship is adhered to by the Government. There
 appears to be little discrimination against religious
 minorities, who are represented at all levels in the
 Government, military, and the business community. Laws making
 harassment of religious minorities a crime are enforced. A
 variety of Christian groups, including Catholic, Orthodox,
 Protestant, and Seventh-Day Adventist, maintain churches,
 schools, hospitals, and other institutions. A small Baha'i
 community also exists. A few foreign clergymen reside in
 Jordan. Although proselytizing among Muslims is forbidden,
 conversion by Muslims is not a crime.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within Jordan is unrestricted except in certain
 military zones. With a few exceptions (primarily military
 personnel and reservists who need permission for foreign
 travel), the Government does not restrict emigration or foreign
 travel. A woman must present the written consent of her
 husband, father, or male guardian to obtain an initial passport
 but thereafter may travel alone without restraint. Citizens
 who have left Jordan have the right to return. There are no
 reported cases of revocation of citizenship for political
 reasons. A court recently held that assuming a foreign
 nationality does not deprive a person of his Jordanian
 citizenship. Some citizens returning to Jordan, particularly
 those who have traveled to Communist countries, are questioned
 by the General Intelligence Directorate regarding security
 matters.
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem from the influxes
 of Palestinians made homeless by the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli
 
 
 1283
 JORDAN
 wars. According to the most recent statistics, Palestinian
 refugees and their descendants on the East Bank total about 1
 million, including approximately 203,000 living in refugee
 camps. The total does not include a large but undetermined
 number of other persons from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and
 Israel who have settled in the East Bank since 1948. Except
 for some refugees from Gaza, all have been granted Jordanian
 citizenship and have the unrestricted right to live, work, and
 own property. The Interior Minister routinely grants permits
 for travel between the East Bank and Israeli-occupied
 territories.
 Jordan has granted asylum even in cases which have strained
 relations with the neighboring states.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Executive and legislative powers are constitutionally vested in
 the King, who rules with the assistance of an appointed Council
 of Ministers. A Parliament, with an appointed Senate and an
 elected House of Deputies, was reinstated by the King in
 January 1984 after having become moribund in the wake of the
 1967 war with Israel and suspended in 1976. Although
 overshadowed by the executive branch, the Parliament, which
 must ratify royal decrees and laws proposed by the Council of
 Ministers, has been gaining stature. A controversial education
 reform law, for example, was shelved in 1985 after considerable
 public and parliamentary opposition.
 Parliament is still composed largely of members elected in the
 last national election of 1967. Since that time, general
 elections have been impossible because of continued Israeli
 occupation of the West Bank. Vacant East Bank seats have been
 filled through elections which are widely considered to have
 been fair and open. The country is still seeking a formula
 which will provide adequate parliamentary representation for
 the West Bank in lieu of Jordanian-sponsored elections there.
 Vacant West Bank seats are currently filled by vote of the
 other members of Parliament.
 Most municipal and town councils are elected by popular vote.
 Suffrage is universal. Women were enfranchised in 1973 and may
 also run for office. King Hussein has encouraged the
 participation of women in the political process and appointed
 Jordan's first female cabinet minister in 1979.
 Organized political parties are not permitted, although several
 informal political groups operate openly. The Communist Party
 is banned. All persons seek elected office as independents.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Jordan has attracted little attention from either private or
 international human rights organizations. The Jordanian
 lawyers' professional association has a human rights committee,
 but it is not active. Other organizations and ad hoc groups
 occasionally issue statements and petitions on such human
 rights concerns as Palestinian rights and the ban on political
 parties. The International Committee of the Red Cross
 maintains an office in Amman and its representative regularly
 visits all prisons and detention facilities. He is allowed to
 
 
 1284
 JORDAN
 meet in confidence with all incarcerated persons and the
 Government is responsive to his recommendations. In its 1985
 report, Amnesty International expressed concern about the
 imprisonment of possible prisoners of conscience, the prolonged
 detention without trial of political prisoners, allegations of
 ill-treatment of prisoners, and the death penalty. Freedom
 House rates Jordan "partly free."
 Several members of the royal family are actively interested in
 such issues as prison reform and women's rights. Crown Prince
 Hassan cofounded the Independent Commission on International
 Humanitarian Issues. The Government has also played an active
 role in the International Labor Organization and the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Jordan's population is 2,794,000 with an annual growth rate of
 4.1 percent. Despite limited natural resources, Jordan has
 continued to provide its citizens with a rising standard of
 living and improved social services in recent years. World
 Bank figures show per capita gross national product at $1,640
 in 1983.
 Nevertheless, adverse conditions in the oil economies of Saudi
 Arabia and the Gulf states, which provide employment for most
 of Jordan's skilled expatriate work force, have affected
 Jordan's economy. The growth in remittances has slowed
 considerably and direct aid from Arab countries declined from
 $1.2 billion in 1981 to less than $600 million in 1984. Other
 factors contributing to Jordan's slower economic growth have
 included depressed prices for phosphates, Jordan's primary
 export product, a continuing slump in construction, and
 increased debt repayments. A heavy trade deficit (imports
 exceeded exports by a factor of four to one in 1984) continues
 to plague the economy. Central Bank statistics record a 1984
 gross domestic product growth rate of 3.8 percent compared to
 5.4 percent in 1983.
 Jordan is a highly urbanized society with about 80 percent of
 its people residing in a city, suburb, or semiurban area.
 About 10 percent of the population is composed of Palestinian
 refugees living in shelters supervised by the United Nations
 Relief and Works Agency. The domestic Jordanian labor force of
 430,000 has, until recently, been at close to full employment.
 An additional 320,000 Jordanians work abroad primarily in
 technical and professional positions in Saudi Arabia and the
 Gulf states. About 150,000 mostly unskilled foreign workers
 (primarily from Egypt) reside in Jordan.
 Jordan has placed great emphasis on social service projects.
 In the last decade, numerous schools and health centers have
 been built and sewage, water, and electrification projects
 undertaken. Welfare assistance is principally family-based,
 although the Government and charitable organizations provide
 some help.
 Health facilities in Jordan are widely distributed, but uneven
 in quality. Facilities range from Amman's modern King Hussein
 Medical Center, which performed the Arab world's first heart
 transplant in 1985, to simple rural clinics. The ratio of 1
 doctor for 960 East Bank Jordanians in the early 1980's is
 expected to improve to 1 doctor for 368 residents in 1986.
 Life expectancy at birth is currently 64.48 years. The 1984
 
 
 1285
 JORDAN
 World Bank estimate of infant mortality is 53 per 1,000 live
 births. The World Bank estimated in 1982 that 80 percent of
 the population had access to safe water.
 Education is highly valued in Jordan and its educated citizens,
 who work in many countries, are Jordan's most important
 resource. World Bank figures for 1982 indicate Jordan's
 primary school (grades 1-6) enrollment ratio was 81.30 pecent
 (81.36 percent for males and 81.25 percent for females). These
 rates drop slightly for preparatory school (7-9). Although
 attendance at secondary schools (10-12) is not compulsory,
 about 74 percent of the age group enrolls. Competition to
 attend Jordan's two major universities is fierce. A third
 university for military and security personnel was opened in
 1984. Students who are not accepted in domestic universities
 frequently attend one of many community colleges or attend
 university abroad. The Education Ministry estimates that about
 50,000 Jordanians are currently attending institutions of
 higher learning abroad. Adult literacy has increased
 dramatically from about 20 percent in 1958 to 72 percent in
 1983, with males at 82 percent and females at 60 percent.
 Jordan's workers are protected by a comprehensive labor code
 enforced by inspectors of the Ministry of Labor. Children
 under 13 are not permitted to work. Children aged 13 to 15 are
 allowed to work a maximum of 6 hours a day, but are forbidden
 to work at night (except with special permission) and in
 certain occupations regarded as dangerous. The Government
 prepares and adjusts periodically a minimum wage schedule for
 various trades based on recommendations of an advisory panel
 composed of representatives of workers, employers, and the
 Government. Maximum working hours are 48 hours per week, with
 the exception of hotel, bar, restaurant, and movie theater
 employees who can work up to 54 hours. Workers are entitled to
 a weekly day of rest, rest intervals during the workday, 2
 weeks annual paid leave, 2 weeks annual sick leave, and
 severance pay. The law specifies a number of health and safety
 requirements including bathrooms, drinking water, safety
 equipment, and first aid equipment for workers. Jordan also
 has a worker's compensation law. The Government appears to
 administer and enforce its labor laws fairly.
 Women in Jordan have traditionally devoted themselves to family
 responsibilities, thereby disfavoring them economically and, to
 a lesser extent, educationally. Women's role in society has
 been changing in recent years, however. Women now account for
 half the student body at the elite University of Jordan. At
 another educational level, a newly-opened vocational training
 center in Amman has begun to teach women to repair radios,
 television sets, and office machinery. Such changes in
 educational patterns are similarly reflected in the work
 force. Women today comprise about 20 percent of the labor
 force, compared to 4 percent in 1975. Although women
 participate generally in subordinate positions and most heavily
 in clerical, teaching, and administrative jobs, there has been
 a significant increase in the number of women in such
 professions as medicine, engineering, and architecture. Women
 are now officers in the police, two female Jordanian pilots now
 fly for Royal Jordanian Airlines, and women increasingly
 operate businesses. The Government encourages women workers by
 requiring maternity leave and child care centers at large
 establishments.
 Equality between men and women is the legal norm. In practice,
 certain traditions can constrain women's freedoms. In matters
 
 
 1286
 JORDAN
 of inheritance and divorce, women are also treated
 differently. Under Islamic law, sons inherit twice as much as
 daughters. Although a man may obtain a divorce more easily
 than a woman, he may be required to pay considerable
 compensation based on the marriage contract. A recent divorce
 reform law increased compensation for women suffering from an
 arbitrary divorce. Women may also gain custody of young
 children.
