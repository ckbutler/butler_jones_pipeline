 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a well-established, stable constitutional democracy with a unicam-
 eral Legislative Assembly that is directly elected in elections that have been free
 and fair. Jose Maria Figueres won the February presidential election, in which ap-
 proximately 80 percent of eligible voters participated.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished Costa Rica's military. The Ministry of Public Se-
 curity, the Ministry of Government, and the Ministry of the Presidency share re-
 sponsibilities for law enforcement and national security. The Judicial Police, under
 the Supreme Court, is an inves atitve force, while the San Jose Metropolitan Police
 and the Transit Police within the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation also
 have limited polic functions. Public security forces generally observe procedural
 safeguards established by law and the Constitution.
 The economy is based on agriculture and ight industry as well as tourism. Eco-
 nomic growth in 1993 was a  lut 6.1ret per but le     pcent in 1994, and
 the Government faced a growing fiscal deficit. The rght to own private property is
 protected by te Constitutn; however, foreign and Costa Rican property owners
 who have had land expropriated for national parks, Indian reserves, or squatters
 have had sgnificnt diffilties receiving adequate and timely compensation.
 Costa Ricans enjoy a wide range of individual rights and freedoms, although there
 have been well-founded complaints concerning the occasional use of excessive force
 by  oie and lengthy pretrial detentions. Discrimination aainst blacks, Indians,
 and women has also been reported. and many women are victims of domestic vio-
 lence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-Thery wee no reports of political
 killings and one credible report of an extrajudicial killing.

 In August the authorities arrested four officers of the Judicial Police for the mur-
 der and mutilation of suspected drug dealer Ciro Monge. The police dismissed all
 four and the investigation continued. Although the police initialy jailed all four,
 they were free on bil at the end of the year. In 1993 the authorities dismissed
 seven Judicial Police officers in the beating death in custody of suspected gang
 member William Lee Malcom. Their trial was scheduled but had not begun by years
 end. The Monge and Lee Malcom cases, plus alleged instances of corruption, led
 many sectors of society to call for a reorganization of the Judicial Police.
 The trial of the 2 commanding officers of a 13-member Rural Guard unit (the
 "Cobra Command) for the 1992 murder of 2 drug suspects and the rape and abuse
 of indigenous people, although scheduled in the Talad not begun by the end of
 the year. The authorities have charged 12 ex-members of the Cobra Command with
 murder, rape, and deprivation of liberty.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions or
 secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and holds invalid any state-
 ment obtained through violence. The authorities generally respected these prohibi-
 tions in practice, although a study by the National Ombudsman's office found that
 reports of isolated instances of beatings and other physical abuse by police agents
 were credible. The Ombudsman's office is limited to responding to complaints that
 are filed with it. The Ombudsman's office can and does investigate and file suit
 against the officials involved.
 There were also limited instances of police using excessive force in controlling
 crowds, including squatter evictions in Pavas and an April labor conflict in
 Sarapiqui. The ress and labor groups severely criticized the plice for failing to ne-
 gotiate a peaceal end to the con  tations and for their ready resort to force. In
 particular, the media and unions strongly condemned the police for using firearms
 to clear the strikers' blockade of the main road in Sarapiqui.
 In the face of escalating crime, there was considerable debate over the competence
 and adequacy of the law enforcement system. In an effort to professionalize and
 depoliticize the police farce, the Assmbly enacted a bill intended, over a period of
 years, to reduce patronage in the appointment of police officers and increase the
 level of taoiing.
 Prisoners generally receive humane treatment in Costa Rica. Physical abuse by
 prison guards is uncommon. Other forms of abuse by, guards, such as extortion, d
 occur with some frequency. However, the Prison Rights Ombudsman investigates
 cases and refers serious cases of abuse to the public prosecutor. Authorities have
 dismissed uards who have been found to have co     mittd physia and other
 abuses. While public concern exists about crowded penitentiaries, the availability of
 weapons in priso ns, occasional rioting, and assault within the prisons, the Govern-
 ment has achieved limited progress in the repair and improvement of the more run-
 down prison facilities.
 d Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exil.-The law requires judicial warrants for ar-
 rests and that an officer of the court arraign a detainee within 24 hours of arrest.
 The Constitution entities a detainee to a judicial determination of the legality of the
 detention. The authorities generally respected these rights, although persons
 charged with serious offenses often remain in pretrial custody for long periods due
 to judicial backlogs. The past several years brought some improvement in this re-
 gard. The average number of prisoners awaiting trial fell from 20.9 percent of all
 prisoners in 1991 to 18.0 percent in 1994. As of the end of March 1992, 134 pris-
 oners had spent more than 9 months in detention without being sentenced Esti-
 mates from the Ministry of Justice for 1994 were similar.
 The law provides for the rht to bail, and the authorities observed it in practice.
 Gnerally, the authorities  not hold detainees incommunicado.
 With judicial authorization, the authorities may hold suspects for 48 hours after
 arrest or, under special circumstances, for up to 10 days. The judiciary has proven
 effective at ensuring the observance of legal and constitutional safeguards.
 The authorities arrested four Venezuelans in June in connection with a series of
 violent bank robberies and assaults, and summaril deported them to Venezuela
 without resort to the courts. The executive branch defended th expulsions on the
 grounds that continued detention of the suspects invited retaliation and represented
 a threat to Costa Rican lives. Many members of the judiciary criticized the action
 as arbitrary and outside established legal procedure. The Venezuelans ffied suit,
 which resulted in a judgment tha three government ministers may be financially
 liable for the expulsions and may also lead to formal charges against them. Any fur-
 ther civil or c  nal charges against the ministers will depend on the removal of
 the immunity inherent in their office.
 
 
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and assures a fair
 public trial.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts, known as tribunals.
 The Legislative Assembly elects the 24 Supreme Court magistrates to 8-year terms,
 which are automatically renewed unless the Assembly votes against a renewal by
 a two-thirds majority. Accused persons may select an attorney of their choice, and
 the law provides for access to legal counsel at state expense for the indigent.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of extralegal invasions of privacy conducted by, or with the knowl-
 edge of, the Government. The law requires judicial warrants to search private
 homes, and police seldom fail to comply. In August the Legislative Assembly ap-
 proved legislation permitting government-authorized wiretaps in certain restricted
 circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution specifically provides for free-
 dom of speech and press, and these freedoms are generally respected in practice.
 However, courts sometimes construe libel and defamation laws so broadly as poten-
 tially to inhibit free expression. A judge sentenced journalist Bosco Valverde to 1
 year in prison for "disrespect" displayed in an editorial he wrote about the judges
 presiding in an important fraud trial. Although a court later reduced the sentence
 to probation and a fine, the case raised concerns that journalists would be less likely
 to criticize public figures in the course of covering public events.
 A 1969 law requires that journalists must have a degree in journalism from a
 Costa Rican university and a license from the government-sponsored journalists'
 guild. Journalists have attempted to challenge the law in court several times, but
 without success.
 Nine major privately owned newspapers, several periodicals, 6 privately owned
 television stations, and over 70 privately owned radio stations pursue independent
 editorial policies. The media freely criticize the Government, and there has been lit-
 tle evidence of self-censorship or governmental intimidation.
 An office of censorship rates films and has the authority to restrict or prohibit
 their showing;, it has similar powers over television shows and stage plays. A censor-
 ship tribunal reviews appeals of the office's actions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-he Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government fully respected these
 rights. The law requires permits for parades or similar large-scale gatherings, which
 the authorities routinely grant.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution protects freedom of religion, and the au-
 thorities generally observed it in practice. Foreign missionaries and clergy of all de-
 nominations work and proselytize freely. Roman Catholicism is the official state re-
 ligion, and the Catholic Church benefits from certain privileges which non-Catholic
 persons and institutions are denied. For example, non-Catholic churches are re-
 quired by law to comply with building codes from which Catholic churches are ex-
 empt, and Catholic priests may perform marriages, whereas non-Catholic religious
 marriages are not valid without an additional civil marriage. The law on career edu-
 cators stipulates that all teachers of religion, including non-Catholic teachers, must
 be approved by the Catholic Church's Episcopal Conference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the   o       oreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel within the ountry, and emigration
 and the right of return are not restricted. Costa Rica supports multinational refugee
 programs and has accepted many refugees from Central and South America. The
 Constitution specifically prohibits repatriation of anyone subject to political persecu-
 tion. The Government considers large numbers of undocumented Nicaraguans to be
 economic migrants and frequently expels them summarily.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right through free, secret ballot elections every 4 years. The
 independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal insures the integrity of elections, and the
 authorities and the citizens respect the election results. The Constitution bars the
 President from reelection; Assembly members may seek reelection after at least one
 term out of office. National Liberation Party (PLN) candidate Jose Maria Figueres
 won the February elections, in which the PLN gained a plurality in the 57-member
 Legislative Assembly with 28 seats. 'The opposition Social Christian Unity Party
 
 
 363
 won 25 seats. A leftist coalition party holds two seats, and two independent provin-
 cial parties hold one each.
 There are no legal impediments to participation by women or minorities in poli-
 tics. Although women are underrepresented in leadership positions in government
 and politics, this has begun to change. Two Cabinet ministers, seven vice ministers
 and nine members of the Legislative Assembly are women. In addition, one of the
 two vice presidents is a woman.
 Costa Rica's 30,000 blacks, who reside largely on the Caribbean coast, eijoy full
 fights of citizenship, including the protection of laws against racial discrimination.
 The Legislative Assembly includes one black member, one member of the Cabinet
 is black.
 Indigenous people are free to participate in politics and government. However,
 they have not had a significant presence in either except on issues directly imping-
 ing on indigenous rights. This lack of political role and influence stems from histori-
 ca neglect, discrimination, physical isolation, and the very small number of indige-
 nous people relative to the total population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 At least three nongovernmental groups monitor and report on human rights free
 of government restriction: the Costa Rican Commission for Human Rights; the Com-
 mission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America; and the Family and
 Friends of Political Prisoners of Costa Rica. The Ministry of Justice houses an offi-
 cial Ombudsman, empowered to hear individual complaints concerning human
 rights abuses.
 The Government is open and responsive to concerns expressed by international
 human rights groups and has invited the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights to visit the country whenever it wishes.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution pronounces all persons equal before the law.
 Women.-While there is no legal discrimination, and in fact a number of laws
 seek to protect women from sex discrimination in such areas as property ownership,
 employment, and inviolability of person, in practice women face a number of in-
 equalities. Official statistics indicated that 30 percent of working-age women earn
 wages, as opposed to 79 percent of working-age men. The law requires that women
 and men receive equalpay for equal work, but due in part to limited resources the
 Government has not effectively enforced it. On average, women's salaries are 20 per-
 cent below men's.
 The National Ombudsman's office in June reported that women and children were
 the targets of physical, sexual, or psychological abuse in a significant proportion of
 all households. The Government regularly prosecutes physical abuse of women, in-
 cluding domestic violence, which is increasingly recognized as a serious problem,
 and often imposes stringent punishment.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, spend-
 ing more than 4 percent of gross domestic product on education and over 5 percent
 on medical care. This has contributed to a high rate of literacy and a low rate of
 infant mortality.
 Public awareness of crimes against children has grown. The National Institute for
 Infancy reported that in the first 3 months of 1994, there were 376 cases of physical
 mistreatment of minors, 314 cases of sexual abuse, and 47 of psychological abuse;
 compared to a total of 625 new cases of mistreatment or sexual abuse for the first
 3 months of 1993. Traditional family attitudes and the fact that such crimes are
 treated as misdemeanors hampered legal proceedings against those who committed
 crimes against children.
 Indigenous People.-Costa Rica's population of 3.2 million includes some 24,000
 indigenous people. Most live in traditional communities on 21 reserves which, in
 part because of their remote location, often lack access to schools, health care, elec-
 tricity, and potable water. The Government established the National Indigenous
 Commission (CONAI) to address onerns of indigenous people, but many indige-
 nous people have complained CONAI is paternalistic and does not adequately rep-
 resent their views. The Ombudsman has also established an office to investigate vio-
 lations of indigenous rights and to strengthen its oversight of these rights.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws prohibiting discrimination against
 those with disabilities, nor mandating access for such persons, although certain pub-
 lic and private institutions have made individual efforts to improve access.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law specifies the right of workers to join unions
 of their choosing without prior authorization, although barriers exist in practice. Ap-
 proximately 15 percent of the work force is unionized, almost entirely m the publc
 sector. Unions are independent of government control and are generally free to form
 federations and confederations and to afliliate internationally.
 Certain trade unions contend that the "solidarismo" (solidarity) movement has
 hurt unions' right of association. The movement espouses employer-worker coopera-
 tion and offers the latter such benefits as credit unions and savings plans in return
 for their renunciation of the right to strike and bargain collectively (although, in
 practice, solidarity associations have in the past acted as collective bargaining
 ants). Employers partly finance solidarity associations; the law allows them to
 offer a range of services and engage in profit-making activities, which unions are
 not permitted to do.
 "Permanent workers' committees" made up of members of solidarity associations
 have entered into direct agreements with their employers, sometimes in order to
 stop attempts by an established union to negotiate a collective bargaining pact. The
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association con-
 cluded a 2-year investigation in June 1991 and ruled that management's use of soli-
 darity and the associations' involvement in trade union activities such as collective
 bargaining were violations of freedom of association. In June the ILO's Committee
 of Experts ruled that, with the changes to the Labor Code enacted in 1993 and the
 promises of further reforms, Costa Rican workers have made progress towards
 greater freedom of association.
 There are no restrictions on the rights of private workers to strike, but very few
 private sector workers are union members, and strikes in the private sector are
 rare. In April a labor dispute between Geest Caribbean Company and the workers
 at Geest's banana plantation in Sarapiqui escalated into violence. There were nu-
 merous injuries, and the police arrested several strikers for inciting violence.
 The law restricts the right of public sector workers to strike. In April the Govern-
 ment introduced a bill that would guarantee collective bargaining rights to all public
 sector workers and afford the right to strike to public workers who are not in "es-
 sential services" as defined by the ILO, but the Assembly had not passed it by year's
 end. Public sector labor disputes produced a scattering of demonstrations and brief
 work stop a s.
 b. The.E  ito Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right to organize. Specific provisions of the 1993 labor code reforms provide protec-
 tion from dismissal for union organizers and members during the period of union
 formation. The revised provisions of the Labor Code require employers found guilty
 of antiunion discrimination to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 Public sector workers cannot engage in collective bargaining because the Public
 Administration Act of 1978 makes labor law inapplicable in relations between the
 Government and its employees. Private sector unions have the legal right to engage
 in collective bargaining but, owing to the dearth of unions, it is not a widespread
 practice.
 All labor regulations apply fully to the country's nine export processing zones
 (EPEs). The Labor Ministry oversees labor regulations within the EPZ's, but ac-
 knowledged that it has only one inspector for every 30,000 workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no nown instances of either.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution provides special
 employment protection for women and minors and establishes the minimum work-
 rig age at 12 years, with special regulations in force for workers under 15. Children
 older than 15 but under 18 can work a maximum of 7 hours a day and 42 hours
 weekly. For children between the ages of 12 and 15, the limit is 5 hours a day and
 30 hours weekly. The National Children's Agency, an autonomous government insti-
 tution, in cooperation with the Labor Ministry, is reasonably effective in enforcing
 these regulations in the formal sector. In response to the deaths of two adolescents
 by chemical poisoning while working on banana plantations, the authorities prohib-
 ited further employ   nt of youths under the age of 18 in the banana industry.
 Nonetheless, child labor continues to be an integral part of the large informal econ-
 omy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides for a minimum
 wage. A National Wage Board, composed of three members each from government,
 business, and labor, sets minimum wage and salary levels for all sectors. The
 monthly minimum wage, which was last set in July for the private sector, ranges
 from $115 (18,176 colones) for domestic servants to $557 (88,023 colones) for certain
 professionals. Public sector negotiations, based on the private sector minimum wage,
 
 
 normally follow the settlement of private sector negotiations. The Ministry of Labor
 enforces minimum wages. It has been reasonably effective, more so in the San Jose
 metropolitan area than in rural areas. Workers at the low end of the wage scale
 often find it difficult to maintain an acceptable standard of living, whether they
 have a family to support or not, and must spend an inordinate proportion of their
 pa on basic human needs.
 The Constitution sets the workday hours, remuneration for overtime, days of rest,
 and annual vacation rights. It requires compensation for discharge without due
 cause, although this provision is often circumvented in practice. Maximum work
 hours are 8 during the day and 6 at night, up to weekly totals of 48 and 36 hours,
 respectively. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime premium of 50 percent of
 regular wages for work in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural workers are
 not paid overtime, however, if they work beyond their normal hours voluntarily.
 There is little evidence that employers coerce such overtime from employees.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety in the workplace. This law requires indus-
 trial, agricultural, and commercial firms with 10 or more workers to establish a
 management-labor committee and allows the Government to inspect workplaces and
 to fine employers for violations. Most firms required to set up such committees have
 followed the letter of the law, but often made little effort to utilize the committees
 or turn them into effective instruments for improving the workplace. Workers have
 the right to leave work if conditions are dangerous. In practice, however, workers
 who leave the workplace may find their jobs in jeopardy unless they file a written
 complaint with the Labor Ministry. Due in part to budgetary constraints, the Gov-
 ernment has not fielded enough labor inspectors, especially outside the capital, to
 ensure that minimum conditions of safety and sanitation are always maintained.
