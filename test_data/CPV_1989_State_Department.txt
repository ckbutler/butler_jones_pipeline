 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is ruled by the African Party for the Independence
 -of Cape Verde'(PAICV), the sole legal political party, under
 the leadership of-President Aristides Pereira. Most
 government ministers are also senior members of the party, and
 many of them were leaders of the revolutionary movement to
 free Cape Verde from Portuguese rule. The Constitution
 adopted in 1980-declares the party "the supreme expression of
 the interests'of the popular masses." Members of the Popular
 National Assembly, which is formally the supreme organ of the
 State, are elected from a slate of candidates proposed to the
 electorate by the party. The Assembly selects the President,
 who, as Head of State, proposes the Prime Minister to the
 Assembly. The Assembly is subordinate to the executive; it
 has hever reversed government/party decisions, although
 deputies increasingly debate issues openly, and critical views
 are often reported in the media.
 Security responsibilities, formerly divided between the
 military, the security, and police forces, were consolidated
 under a single government department in February 1986. The
 reorganized Ministry of Defense and Security operates under -
 guidelines and leadership approved by the party. A largely
 voluntary party paramilitary unit, the "Popular Militias,"
 supports the security forces and has been accused of making
 arbitrary arrests.
 Cape.Verde has few natural resources, and for years Cape
 Verdeans have emigrated to improve their economic condition--
 over 500,000 live abroad. A 20-year drought has also hindered
 Cape Verde's development efforts for its population of
 400,000. However, heavy summer rains in 1987 and 1988 may
 have signaled the end of the drought and promised improvements
 in the agricultural sector. The Government is the largest
 nonagricultural employer. It controls banking, the import of
 most basic commodities, airlines, the press, and schools. It
 depends impo-rtantly on generous-foreign assistance and
 remittances ftom Cape Verdean emigrants.
 The Constitution bans opposing political parties,.and in
 -practice the Government uses its authority, e.g., detention
 powers, to limit opposing views. Freedom of speech, press,
 and assembly and associatiow are -not technically limited by
 .law-but have been in practice. Discrimination and violence
 against women are common. There were no known political
 prisoners held at the end of 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HtAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.. PDlitical and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There wereno reported instances.of politically motivated
 deaths,'but one jnan died while in official custody (see
 Section l.c.).
 b, Disappearance
 There were no reported instances of officially inspired
 disappearances.
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Periodic police brutality occurs In August on Maio Island, a
 man died in police custody, allegedly of a severe beating;
 although local medical authorities determined that the cause
 of death was strangulation, a government-appointed special
 commission found that the deceased, a former mental patient,
 killed himself. There was no evidence of torture or other
 cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners and detainees in
 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Cape Verdean law requires that an accused person, unless
 caught in the act of committing a crime, be brought before a
 judge to be charged within 48 hours of arrest. In exceptional
 cases, with the concurrence of a court official, the formal
 charge process may be delayed, but it still must take place
 within 5 days of arrest. For crimes against state security,
 however, persons may be detained for up to 5 months without
 trial upon a judge's ruling. This loophole is occasionally
 abused, and cases of arbitrary arrest by members of the
 "Popular Militia," a voluntary paramilitary party
 organization, occur periodically. There is a functioning
 system of bail, and everyone is entitled to representation by
 an attorney in civil or criminal cases. Those unable to
 afford legal counsel are represented by lawyers named by the
 state-run Lawyers' Association.
 There were no known instances of forced exile for political or
 other reasons. With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see
 Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is composed of a Supreme Court, whose
 members are appointed by the Government, regional courts, and
 local popular courts. Trials are conducted by one judge
 without a jury. The autonomous Institute for Judicial
 Support, to which most private lawyers belong, provides
 counsel for indigent defendants. Trials appear to be handled
 expeditiously, and evidence suggests that the courts protect
 individual rights in criminal cases. Verdicts can be appealed.
 Appeals to the Supreme Court are common. For example, in June
 the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision in favor of
 Teofilo Santos Silva, allegedly fired from the Bank of Cape
 Verde for statements vilifying bank leadership. The bank was
 ordered to restore Santos to his former position or to
 compensate him for damages.
 The popular tribunals adjudicate minor disputes on a local
 level in rural areas. The "judges," who are appointees of the
 Ministry of Justice, are usually prominent local citizens
 without legal training. Their-decisions can be appealed
 within the regular court system.
 Political/security cases of a nonmilitary nature are tried
 before the criminal courts. There have been no cases tried in
 recent years,- and there were no known political prisoners at
 the end of 1989.
 
 
 CARE VERDE
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 . Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the
 inviolqbility of-domicile, correspondence, and other means of
 communication. The law requires warrants issued by a judge
 before searches of homes may be conducted. In practice, these
 rights are observed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution proclaims freedom of speech and intellectual
 creativity, including the rights of authorship, but it also
 stipulates that none of these rights and freedoms may be
 exercised "contrary to national unity." While freedom of the
 press is not specifically guaranteed by the Constitution, a
 law ad6pted in December 1985 assures citizens the right to
 express their thoughts in the press, but at the same time the
 party underlined that this right should be exercised
 responsibly. People rarely criticize the Government
 publicly. Debate in Parliament is lively, but within the
 accepted one-party system.
 The newspaper Voz di Povo, radio, and television are
 government 9wned, Occasional articles critical of some
 aspectsof governrment policy are printed or broadcast, but
 this is-probably done with prior authorization from the
 Goverhment. Local radio broadcasts carry items from Western
 news agencies as well as from Communist countries, generally
 balancing 4coverage and identifying sources on controversial
 international issues. In 1989 the PAICV Third Congress
 granted limited autonomy to the National Press, a publishing
 house formerly controlled entirely by the party leadership.
 A Catholic monthly'newspaperi which has carried criticism of
 some aspects of life in Cape Verde, is tolerated without
 interference as long as its articles are not viewed as a
 threat to the Government. On occasion, the editor and
 contributois have been called before popular tribunals to
 explain their articles., There is also a monthly newspaper,
 Nqticias, published in Mindelo which, since its inception in
 1588, has followed an independent editorial policy.
 Foreign periodicals generally circulate freely in Cape Verde
 even when they contain articles critical of or unflattering to
 the Government, as is sometimes the case with Portuguese
 newspapers. International radio broadcasts are received
 clearly without interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to meet, to associate freely, and to demonstrate
 is provided for in the Constitution, but as a practical matter
 no organizations opposed to the Government or its policies are
 permitted. Party-sponsored "mass organizations" of women and
 youth are prominent. For a discussion of freedom of
 association as it applies to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution requires separation of church and state.
 Freedom of worship is respected by the Government, and members
 of all faiths practice their religion'without harassment. At
 
 
 least two-thirds of the population, probably including most of
 the government and party leadership, are nominally Catholic,
 but the predominance of Catholicism does not appear to affect
 adversely other faiths. Evangelical Protestants and
 Seventh-Day Adventist are the two other principal religious
 communities.
 At least two faiths, the Baha'i and Christian Science, which
 were formally banned or suppressed under the Portuguese, have
 been permitted to reestablish themselves and operate freely
 since independence. There are no restrictions on religious
 practices, teaching, or contacts with coreligionists outside
 Cape Verde. The Catholic Church, for example, openly opposes
 birth control methods which are advocated and supported by the
 Government. A few foreign missionaries are active in Cape
 Verde, and more than half the Catholic cleigy are non-Cape
 Verdeans. Cape Verdean consular law requires, however, that
 missionaries applying for residency belong to a denomination
 with a recognized membership in Cape Verde. In this context,
 , two American Mormon missionaries were asked to leave Cape
 Verde in September after their visitor's visas expired.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative
 restrictions on either travel or residence within the
 country. All resident Cape Verdeans wishing to leave the
 country, either temporarily or permanently, must obtain exit
 permission from the Government. Such permission has not been
 denied for political reasons. Emigration has long been an
 important and recognized alternative for those wishing to
 escape the prevailing harsh economic conditions.
 The Government goes to considerable effort to maintain close
 contact with emigre communities and provides every opportunity
 for Cape Verdeans living abroad to maintain their ties with
 the homeland, including making provision to vote in
 elections. Repatriation is a constitutional right, and the
 Government does not discourage intending repatriates.
 The law allows for revocation of citizenship on several
 grounds, including activities contrary to the interest of the
 country. However, there are n6 known cases of the Government
 instituting proceedings to deprive persons of citizenship for
 political reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The party's monopoly of power in Cape Verde is specified in
 the Constitution. Opposition parties are illegal and do not
 exist. Therefore, citizens are unable to change the one-party
 political system through a democratic process.
 At the national level, government officials are selected by
 the party, and senior leaders are selected from among the
 small group of men who actually led the struggle for
 independence. The Secretary General of the party is President
 of the Republic, the Deputy Secretary General is Prime
 Minister, and the third-ranking party official is President of
 the National Assembly. Five other members of the party's
 political commission are also ministers. Not all ministers or
 secretaries Qf state are party members, but all clearly serve
 at the pleasure of the party.

 CAPE VERDE
 Current party membership is about 6,000, which is about 4
 percent of the'total adult population and represents a
 doubling in sizd since indepeidence in 1975. Within this
 elitist party, there exists a modest scope for meaningful
 political activity. The delegates to the Third Party Congress
 in 1989 were elected by secret ballot, and the party announced
 plans to allow free elections of certain local officials,
 whether candidates are party members or not.
 Twice-yearly National Assembly sessions serve to ratify--
 never reverse--earlier party/government decisions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 gNngoverhmenfal Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government'in the past has permitted visits by private
 organizations to investigate conditions of persons convicted
 for political ox related offenses. There are no known
 official or nonqove~rnmental human rights organizations in the
 country; none critical of the Government would be permitted.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religioh,
 Language, or Social Status
 Racial 1 iscriminatlon is not, a serious problem in Cape Verde,
 whete t p vast majority of the population shares various
 proportonsbf Portugueqe and African ancestry. Sex
 discriminatig  exists, although it is prohibited by the
 Constitution. .1Many traditional, male-oriented values of the
 Portuguese and Africbn ancestors'of today's Cape Verdeans are
 still part of the country's culture.
 The Code of the Family, enacted in October 1981, prescribes
 the full equality of men and women in law, including equal pay
 for equal work, but in practice women customarily have been
 excluded from certain types~of employment and are often paid
 less than men. Both the Government and the party are making
 efforts to bring women into various economic and social
 activities whete t'tey have been traditionally absent,
 including in the lab6r-intensive economic development
 proects. The>Organization of Cape Verdean Women was founded
 in 1980, with.party-encouragemeht, to sensitize Cape Verdeans
 to issues affecting women.
 Domestic violence against women remains extremely common.
 Crimes such as rape and wife beatings are largely ignored by
 police and are rarely brought ta trial. Even then, penalties
 for first offenders are usually suspended, and physical and. ,
 psychological retaliation against a woman who wins such a
 trial is the qorm. 'Governmentefforts are occasionally made
 to increase women's awareness of-their legal rights, such as
 in special periodic television or radio programs addressing
 these issues, but these programs-.xaely reach the rural women
 most strongly affected by' such crimes.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association is limited. Workers in several
 sectors are organized into unions within the Central Sindical
 (UNTC-CS). The trade union central is affiliated with the
 PAICV and headed by a high-ranking party member. About
 one-third of the active work force are nominal members of the
 
 
 60
 CAPE VERDE
 UNTC-CS. Individual unions perform some traditional trade
 union functions and act also as party affiliates.
 There is no reference to the right to strike in the
 Constitution or in any legislation. In the absence of any
 legal prohibition against strikes, the NUC believes that the
 right to strike exists, but it has never exercised this
 theoretical right. Union leadership has taken positions on
 specific issues in opposition to government policies in state-
 owned enterprises.
 The UNTC-CS is affiliated with the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity, in whose councils it has never taken
 positions independent of those officially sanctioned by the
 Government. It maintains contact with and receives assistance
 from both Communist and non-Communist national unions abroad.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions are by law the designated means by which workers are
 represented. The right of unions to function without
 hindrance is mandated. However, there is no true collective
 bargaining. Wages for government employees are set by the
 Ministerial Council. Wages for state enterprises are proposed
 by the ministry controlling the state enterprise and approved
 by the Ministerial Council. Labor laws require that private
 companies pay the prevailing wage, which usually implies the
 wage that is paid in the Government and state enterprises.
 The UNTC-CS and the unions have influence in the process.
 There are no export processing zones in Cape Verde.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is constitutionally prohibited and
 is not practiced in Cape Verde.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14, and children under 16
 are prohibited from working at night, more than 7 hours per
 day, or in establishments where toxic products are used. All
 enterprises submit a yearly report to the Director General of
 Labor with information on the salary and ages of each
 employee. There is no inspection mechanism.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wage rates are established by the Government for both
 civil servants and private enterprises. As of January 1,
 1987, the minimum wage for civil servants was approximately
 $84 per month. Wages for unskilled workers are considerably
 lower, and in rural areas the daily minimum for the least
 skilled types of labor is about $1.62 per day. In most
 circumstances, a family cannot survive on a single minimum
 wage. Multiple incomes, shared housing, and extended families
 help bridge the gap for many minimum wage earners.
 There does not appear to be an overall safety and health
 code. The normal workweek for adults is 44 hours over 5 1/2
 days. A worker is entitled to at least 1 free day per week.
 These regulations seem to be respected in practice, but there
 is no enforcement mechanism.
