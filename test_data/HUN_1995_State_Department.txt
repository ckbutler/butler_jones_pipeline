 HUNGARY
 Hungary is a parliamentary democracy with a freely elected legislative assembly.
 Prime Minister Gyula Horn, the leader of the Hungarian Socialist (formerly Com-
 munist) Party, heads a coalition government formed after the 1994 national elec-
 tions.
 The state internal and external security services report directly to a minister
 without portfolio and the police report to the Interior Minister. There continued to
 ecredibereportsof police abuses.
 The Government has demonstrated through its macroeconomic policies and exten-
 sive privatization its commitment to the transition to a market economy. About
 three-fourths of foreign trade is with advanced industrial countries. The private sec-
 tor generates about 70 percent of the gross domestic product; the Government's goal
 is 80 percent by the end of 1997. After a fitful start, the Government privatized over
 $3.5 billion in energy, telecommunications, and banking sector assets during the
 year. Living standards continued to fal for much of the population; real wages fell
 10-11 percent in 1995. Official unemployment is approximately 11 percent, but close
 to 70 percent for the Romani community. Services, trade, and government employ
 about 45 percent of the labor force, and industry nearly 30 percent. Major exports
 include raw materials, semi-finished goods, and chemicals (40 percent); consumer
 
 
 888
 goods (22 percent); and food and agricultural products (20 percent). An estimated
 25 percent of the population live in poverty, with elderly pensioners, dependent
 housewives and children, and Roma being at greatest risk.
 Although the Government generally respects constitutional human rights and civil
 liberties, the law does not ensure due process in all cases. Prosecutors may request
 what amounts to unlimited pretrial detention. Police may enter private residences
 to check foreigners' identification without warrants. Although senior levels of the In-
 terior Ministry and the National Police were more willing to address problems, po-
 lice continued to use excessive force against suspects.
 Despite the print media's relatively high degree of independence, television and
 most radio stations are government controlled. This allowed the possibility of politi-
 cally motivated interference in editorial content until a broadcast media law was
 passed in December. The new law insulates state-owned as well as private media
 from government interference. Social discrimination against Roma remains a serious
 problem, and police commonly harass and abuse the Romani population in particu-
 lar. The number of anti-Semitic and racist attacks continued to fall. Spousal abuse
 of women is a serious problem, while discrimination affects women in most aspects
 of daily life.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence of any politi-
 cally motivated killings. Police in Paszto reportedly beat a suspect to death in July.
 One of the officers was dismissed, three were suspended, and the police commander
 resigned. A criminal investigation is underway.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 No known incidents of torture occurred. However, a police officer severely beat a sol-
 dier who told a joke about police officers. Police also continued to harass and phys-
 ically abuse Roma. In one incident in Marcali in January, police beat an 18-year-
 old and then severely beat his father when he came to complain.
 Police continued to use excessive force against suspects. In one incident in July,
 a person was pulled from his car and slammed repeatedly against it after being
 stopped for a traffic infraction. In another July incident, a person was beaten after
 complaining when stopped by the police.
 The National Police have stiffened internal controls over the past several years.
 Of some 36,000 officers, 158 were found guilty of misconduct and removed from the
 force in 1994. Of those, 38 were found guilty of physically abusing suspects. In the
 first half of 1995, 48 officers were removed from the force, of whom 8 were found
 guilty of physically abusing suspects. According to a report by the Hungarian Hel-
 sinki Committee regarding police misconduct, ... (it) takes place every day,
 though the public is only informed by chance, only in conspicuous cases. Guilty po-
 lice officers are very rarely condemned, and the majority of the officers suspected
 of such crimes remain on duty."
 Though prisons are overcrowded, conditions meet minimum international stand-
 ards and the government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Police must inform suspects upon arrest
 of the charges against them and may hold them for a maximum of 72 hours before
 filing charges. The law requires that all suspects be allowed access to counsel prior
 to questioning and throughout all subsequent proceedings. The authorities must
 provide counsel for juveniles, the indigent, and the mentally disabled. There are
 credible reports that police do not always allow access to counsel, particularly for
 minor crimes. There is no bail system; however, depending upon the nature of the
 crime, courts may release detainees upon their own recognizance.
 Pretrial detention, based on a warrant issued by a judge, is initially limited to
 1 year while criminal investigations are in progress; it may be extended indefinitely
 on the prosecutor's motion (provided the judge concurs). The lack of a bail system
 gives tremendous leeway to the judge. In addition, foreigners are considered likely
 to flee Hungary, which means that they are usually held until the trial. One Amer-
 ican citizen was released in 1995 after having been held in pretrial detention for
 over 18 months. Charges were ultimately dropped for lack of evidence. In such
 cases, the law provides for compensation where the accused is released for lack of
 evidence, but the procedure is rarely exercised as victims must file a complaint be-
 fore a court and undergo a complicated legal procedure.
 The penal code does not provide for exile, and it is not employed.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair, though sometimes slow, process.
 Under the Constitution, the courts are responsible for the administration of jus-
 tice, with the Supreme Court exercising control over the operations and judicature
 of all the courts. There are three levels of courts. Original jurisdiction in most mat-
 ters rests- with the local courts. Appeals of their rulings may be made to county
 courts or to the Budapest municipal court, all of which also have original jurisdic-
 tion in some matters. The highest level of appeal is the Supreme Court, whose deci-
 sions on nonconstitutional issues are binding. In the case of military trials, appeals
 may also be addressed to the Supreme Court.
 The Constitutional Court i3 charged with reviewing the constitutionality of laws
 and statutes brought before it. Citizens may appeal directly to the Constitutional
 Court if they believe that thir constitutional rights have been violated. Parliament
 ele-ts the Court's members to 9-year terms, which may be renewed. No judge or
 member of the Supreme or Constitutional Courts may belong to a political party or
 engage in political activity. Although the Government has alleged that judges' politi-
 cal attitudes have affected decisions, these charges are undercut by unanimous deci-
 sions in the most controversial cases, with judges appointed by the current Govern-
 ment siding with those appointed by the current opposition.
 The law provides for the right to a fair public trial, and the authorities respect
 this right in practice. In selected cases, however, judges may agree to a closed trial
 to protect the accused or the crime victim, such as in some rape cases. There is no
 jury system; hence judges are the final arbiters.
 Military trials folow civil law and may be closed if national security or moral
 grounds so justify. In all cases, sentencing must take place publicly. Defendants are
 entitled to counsel during all phases of criminal proceedings and are presumed inno-
 cent until proven guilty. Judicial prceedings are generally investigative rather than
 adversarial in nature.
 Many human rights and R.imani organizations claim that Roma receive less than
 equal treatment in the judicial process. Specifically, they allege that floma are kept
 in pretrial detention more often and for longer periods of time than non-Roma.
 While this allegation is credible in light of general discrimination against Roma,
 there is no statistical evidence because official records do not contain the ethnic
 identity of offenders.
 In the absence of a law against hate crimes, skinhead assaults against minorities
 continue to be treated as hooliganism (a misdemeanor), and sentences are light.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides that the prosecutoe's office may issue search warrants independently. Po-
 lice must carry out house searches in the presence of two witnesses and must pre-
 pare a written inventory of items removed from the premises. Wiretapping, which
 may be done for national security reasons and for legitimate criminal investigations,
 requires a court's permission. These provisions appear to be observed in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. One
 Budapest daily is still partially state owned (the Government is trying to sell it and
 is not thought to interfere in its editorial content). The print media enjoy consider-
 able freedom.
 Parliament passed a media law in December creating institutions to foster a free
 and independent electronic media. The law provides for privatization of major tele-
 vision and radio stations and removal of remaining public televison and radio from
 the direct control of the government. At present, there is one private national radio
 station and one national radio station in which the Government maintains a minor-
 ty share. There are no private national television stations. In 1995 state-owned
 Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television continued to enjoy a near monopoly of
 nationwide broadcasting, and the Prime Minister controlled their budgets.
 While some limited-range local television licenses were issued, partisan political
 wrangling and, less importantly, pressures from television and radio unions and em-
 ployee associations continued to block the availability of national broadcast fre-
 quencies and the privatization of existing state channels. (However, over half of the
 countrys households have access to satellite television, cable, or both.)
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assciation.-There are essentially no re-
 strictions on peaceful public gatherings. In general, the Government does not re-
 quire permits for assembly except in instances when a public gathering is to take
 place near sensitive installations, such as military facilities, embassies, and key gov-
 
 
 890
 ernment buildings. Police may sometimes alter or revoke permits, but there is no
 evidence that they abuse this right.
 Any 10 or more persons may form an association, provided that it does not com-
 mit criminal offenses or disturb the rights of others. Asociations with charters and
 elected officers must register with the courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 members of all faiths are allowed to practice their religion freely. There is no offi-
 cially preferred religion, but only officially a pproved religions receive state subsides.
 The Government distributed over $28 million in state subsidies among approxi-
 mately three dozen religious groups. Religious orders and schools have regained
 some property confiscated by the Communist regime.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on the movement of citizens within or outside
 Hungary, including on the rights of emigration and repatriation. The Government
 may delay but not deny emigration for those who have significant court-assessed
 debts or who possess state secrets. It requires that foreigners from countries that
 do not have a visa waiver agreement with Hungary obtain exit visas each time they
 leave the country, although blanket permission is sometimes available.
 The fighting in the former Yugoslavia resulted in a continued flow of refugees into
 Hungary. While approximately 8,500 refugees from the former Yugoslavia are reg-
 istered in Hungary, the Government estimates that over 20,000 more are present
 in unregistered status. Most of the refugees are in private housing, with only 2,830
 (as of September) housed in 4 refugee camps.
 Hungary is a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 and to the 1967 Protocol, with a caveat that it will grant refugee status only to Eu-
 ropean nationals. Prospective refugees who seek only to transit to Western Europe
 are encouraged to return to their countries of departure.
 For most of 1995, illegal aliens, mostly non-European, were housed at the deten-
 tion center at Kerepestarcsa pendin either deportation or qualification for resettle-
 ment in a third country. The determination is made by the local office of the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). While police seek the timely de-
 portation of detainees who do not qualify for refugee status, a shortage of funds and
 the detainees' lack of proper documentation, such as passports, often result in
 lengthy stays. As a result of extensive criticism from domestic and international
 human rights gups as well as the UNHCR, the Kerepestarcsa camp was closed
 in September. Foreigners denied refugee status, or who are simply in Hungary ille-
 gally, are either returned to their country of origin or held at border guard facilities
 throughout Hungary.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens age 18 and over have the right to change their government through na-
 tional elections held at least every 4 years. The Parliament's members are elected
 through a complex voting procedure for individuals and party lists. In the 1994 na-
 tional elections, Prime Minister Gyula Horn's Hungarian Socialist Party won an ab-
 solute majority and formed a coalition Government with the Liberal Alliance of Free
 Democrats. Four parties, ranging from moderate to conservative, constitute an ac-
 tive opposition in Parliament.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or the po-
 liticalprocess; 43 of 386 parliamentary deputies are women. There are few women
 in leadership positions in the Government or the political parties. Several minorities
 are represented in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights organizations operate without government restriction or
 interference. Many nongovernmental organizations report that the Government is
 generally responsive to their requests for information. However, individual police
 units are reportedly uncooperative at times, particularly in cases involving =oma.
 There is also a 25-member parliamentary Committee for Human, Minority, and Re-
 ligious Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, equality, and protection against
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particularly against Roma.
 Women.-Spousal abuse is believed to be common but the vast majority of such
 abuse is not reported, and victims who step forward often receive little help from
 authorities. While there are laws against rape, it is often unreported for cultural
 
 
 891
 reasons. Police attitudes towards victims of sexual abuse reportedly are often un-
 sympathetic, particularly if the victim was acquainted with her aggressor. According
 to women's organizations, the vast majority of rape and abuse cases go unreported.
 Rape within marriage is illegal, but proving it is extremely difficult in practice. Ac-
 cording to the National Alliance of Hungarian Women, there were 414 reported
 rapes in 1995 and 271 reported cases of assaults on women (the latter is a 1994
 statistic).
 Legally, women have the same rights as men, including identical inheritance and
 property rights. While there is no overt discrimination against women, the number
 of women in middle or upper managerial positions in business and government is
 low. Women are heavily represented in the judiciary and in the medical and teach-
 ing professions. The law does not prohibit sexual harassment in the work place.
 A report prepared under the auspices of the U.N. in evaluating Hungarian compli-
 ance with the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women
 termed sexual harassment in the workplace as "virtually epidemic." Women's groups
 report that making women aware of their rights is a major problem and specifically
 criticized state-owned television's only partial reinstatement of a program about
 women's issues.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights. Education is man-
 datory through age 16, and employment is illegal below age 16. There is no societal
 pattern of child abuse. According to the National Alliance of Hungarian Women,
 there were 528 reported cases of violence against children in 1994 (latest available),
 190 of which took place within the family.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Services for the dis-
 abled are limited, and most buildings are not wheelchair accessible.
 Religious Minorities.-There were few anti-Semitic incidents (almost all graffiti).
 There were no attacks by skinheads or neo-Nazi sympathizers against the Jewish
 community. In December, police arrested a man carrying a Molotov cocktail outside
 the main Budapest synagogue.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The 1993 law on ethnic and minority rights
 establishes the concept of collective rights of minorities and states that minorl.ties
 need special rights in order to preserve their ethnic identities. It explicitly permits
 organized forms of limited self-government in areas where ethnic groups constitute
 a majority and states that the establishment of self-governing bodies must be made
 possible in localities where an ethnic group constitutes less than a majority of the
 opulation. Further, this law permits associations, movements and political parties
 based upon an ethnic or national character and mandates unrestricted use of ethnic
 languages. Only those ethnic groups which have lived within the country's present
 borders for at least 100 years and whose members are citizens may obtain recog-
 nized status under this law.
 On this basis, the law specifically grants minority status to 13 ethnic or national
 groups. Other groups may petition the Chairman of Parliament for inclusion if they
 comprise at least 1,000 citizens and have their own language and culture.
 In December 1994 Hungary held its first elections for minority local self-govern-
 ments, which resulted in the formation of over 600 minority local bodies. With fund-
 ing from the central budget and logistical support from local governments, these
 bodies have as their primary responsibility influencing and overseeing local matters
 affecting the minorities. In 1995 these groups elected national minority self-govern-
 ments, whose effectiveness has varied. Some have been aggressive and effective,
 while some have been without purpose and moribund. The non-Roma minorities ap-
 pear to be the most satisfied, while Romani leaders express frustration with the
 self-governments' lack of clear authority, responsibility, or resources. The greatest
 value is that it gives a platform for minorities to address local and national govern-
 ment organizations. The greatest weakness is that the Government is compelled to
 listen, but not to act.
 In 1995 Parliament appointed an Ombudsman--currently an ethnic German-
 specifically charged with defending minority rights. The office, however, does not in-
 clude any Roma, the largest minority group.
 Roma constitute at least 4 percent of the population, and Germans, the second
 largest minority group, about 2 percent. There are smaller communities of Slovaksa
 Croats, Romanians, Poles, Greeks, Serbs, Slovenes, Armenians, Ruthenians, and
 Bulgarians, all of which are also recognized as minorities.
 Education is available to varying degrees in almost all minority languages. There
 are minority-language print media, and the state-run radio broadcasts 2-hour daily
 programs in the mother tongue of major nationalities, i.e., Slovak, Romanian, Ger-
 man, Croatian, and Serbian. State-run television carries a 30-minute program for
 the larger minority groups, complemented by 5-minute weekly news bulletins.
 
 
 892
 Conditions of life within the Romani community are significantly poorer than
 among the general population. Roma suffer from discrimination and racist attacks
 and are considerably less educated, with lower than average incomes and life ex-
 pectancy. The Romani unemployment rate is estimated to be 70 percent, more than
 six times the national average of 11 percent. With unemployment benefits ex-
 hausted and inadequate social services, there are reports that Romani families, in-
 cluding young children, are forced to resort to stealing food. Roma also constitute
 a majority of the prison population.
 The Government sponsors programs both to preserve Romani languages and cul-
 tural heritage and to assist social and economic assimilation. Nonetheless, wide-
 spread popular prejudice continues. Police commonly abuse Roma.
 The Martin Luther King Organization (MLKO), which documents assaults on for-
 eigners of color, recorded 7 such incidents in 1995, down from 16 in 1994, 20 in 1993
 and 78 in 1992. MLKO sources commented, however, that they believe many cases
 go unreported and that the decline in attacks is primarily due to the lower number
 of foreign students in Hungary.
 Section 6. Workers Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right of unions
 to organize and bargain collectively and permits trade union pluralism. Workers
 have the right to associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, and
 openly promote members' interests and views. With the exception of military per-
 sonnel and the police, they also have the right to strike. Under a separate 1992 law,
 public servants may negotiate working conditions, but the final decision on increas-
 ing salaries rests with Parliament.
 There are no restrictions on trade union contacts with international organizations,
 and unions have developed a wide range of ties with European and international
 trade union bodies.
 The largest labor union organization is the National Confederation of Hungarian
 Trade Unions, the successor to the former monolithic Communist union, with over
 800,000 members. The Democratic League of Independent Unions and the Federa-
 tion of Workers' Councils have around 250,000 and 150,000 members respectively.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code permits col-
 lective bargaining at the enterprise and industry level, although the practice is not
 widespread and is actively discouraged in the growing private sector. There is a
 willingness among labor organizations to cooperate with one another, and this is
 particularly evident in their relationship in forums such as the National Interest
 Renciiation Council (ET), which provides a forum   for tripartite consultation
 among representatives from management, employees, and the Government. The ET
 discusses issues such as wage hikes and the setting of the minimum wage, which
 is centrally negotiated within the ET in order to control inflation. Individual trade
 unions and management may negotiate higher levels (but not a lower one) at the
 plant level. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for drafting labor-related legisla-
 tion, while special labor courts enforce labor laws. The decisions of these courts may
 be appealed to the civil court system. Employers are prohibited from discriminating
 against unions and their organizers. The Ministry of Labor enforces this provision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and the Ministry of Labor enforces this prohibition.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The National Labor Center en-
 forces the minimum age of 16 years, with exceptions for apprentice programs, which
 may begin at 15. There does not appear to be any significant abuse of this statute.
 Education is compulsory through age 16. Roma are far more likely than non-Roma
 to stop attending school before age 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The ET establishes the legal minimum wage,
 which is subsequently implemented by Ministry of Labor decree. The current mii-
 mum wage, $95 a month (12,200 forints), is insufficient to provide an adequate
 standard of living for workers and their families. Many workers, therefore, supple-
 ment their primary employment with second jobs.
 The Labor Code specifies various conditions of employment, including termination
 procedures, severance pay, maternity leave, trade union consultation rights in some
 management decisions, annual and sick leave entitlement, and labor conflict resolu-
 tion procedures. Under the Code, the official workday is set at 8 hours; it may vary,
 however, depending upon the nature of the industry. A 24-hour rest period is re-
 quired during any 7-day period.
 Labor courts and the Ministry of Labor enforce occupational safety standards set
 by the Government, but specific safety conditions are not generally up to inter-
 nationally accepted standards. Enforcement of occupational safety standards is not
 
 
 893
 always effective in part due to the limited resources the Ministry of Labor is able
 to commit to enforcement. In theory, workers have the right to remove themselves
 from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
