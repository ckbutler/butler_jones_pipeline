 YUGOSLAVIA
 Yugoslavs enjoy broad freedom of movement and access to
 many foreign publications and to radio broadcasts.
 Yugoslavia has a very good record on freedom of
 emigration, and the government emphasizes the fulfillment
 of economic needs.
 At the same time, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia
 (LCY) maintains a monopoly of political power and the
 government imposes significant restrictions on freedom of
 political expression. The government does not tolerate
 public criticism of the late President Tito, the LCY, the
 theory (as opposed to the practice) of socialist
 self-management, Yugoslavia's nonaligned orientation, or
 statements undermining the unity of Yugoslavia's diverse
 peoples.
 Yugoslavia, a multi-national, nonaligned state with a
 stormy and troubled past, has a serious concern about the
 continued terrorism employed by some emigre political
 organizations. Other problems include the persistence of
 historic ethnic and national tensions within the country,
 economic difficulties exacerbated by regional economic
 disparities, and continued ideological and political
 differences with surrounding states. These concerns have
 led the LCY and the Yugoslav government to adopt a number
 of creative reforms, including decentralization of
 political and economic institutions, and encouragement of
 certain forms of cultural pluralism, e.g., use of local
 languages in'schools and media. However, in meeting these
 problems Yugoslavia's leaders have also imposed
 restrictions with regard to many aspects of individual
 political behavior.
 In the face of challenges in recent years both inside and
 outside the LCY from various elements, the Yugoslav
 leadership has become noticeably more critical of breaches
 in political discipline. There are several hundred
 political prisoners. Simultaneously, however, the overall
 question of individual rights appears to be gaining more
 attention from government authorities and is increasingly
 becoming a legitimate subject of discussion.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 176 of the Yugoslav constitution guarantees the
 "inviolability of the integrity of the human personality"
 and states that any extortion of a confession or statement
 shall be forbidden and punishable. Numerous references in
 the Yugoslav Code of Criminal Procedure speak to this same
 point.
 The use of torture is not condoned and can become a legal
 issue. For example, in December 1978 and January 1979, a
 retrial took place in Zagreb of a number of persons
 -previously convicted of an attempt on President Tito's
 life in 1975. According to Amnesty International's 1979
 Report as well as other available information on this
 
 
 921
 case, the court reaffirmed the convictions of three of the
 accused, but conceded that "physical and psychological
 pressure" may have been used to obtain confessions. As a
 result, some of the sentences in this case were reduced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Conditions within Yugoslav prisons appear to be strict,
 but not inhumane. There have been reports of particularly
 harsh conditions in some Yugoslav prisons including
 allegations that some prisoners have been held in solitary
 confinement for extended periods. The Yugoslav press has
 also reported and editorialized against abuses of
 authority by the police and against excessive use of
 force. In July 1980, the Serbian authorities took
 vigorous legal and disciplinary action against three
 police officers and four of their superiors because of the
 beating death of a young man in their custody. While
 medical care is generally available to prisoners, there
 are persistent reports alleging denial of proper medical
 treatment to prisoners with special medical problems. In
 at least one such case the authorities did transfer the
 individual from prison to house arrest for a period of
 time and later to a military hospital for treatment. The
 government allowed him to leave the country for emergency
 heart surgery in Switzerland; following this person's
 return to Yugoslavia, he was amnestied.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no indication of the permanent or prolonged
 disappearance of persons in Yugoslavia. However, Amnesty
 International and the Western press have reported
 allegations in the past involving the kidnapping of
 Yugoslav emigres by the Yugoslav intelligence services for
 involuntary return to Yugoslavia for trial. Cases also
 occur in~which no public notice is made of an arrest or
 trial until sentence iscpronounced. In June 1980, eight
 personsof Albanian origin were sentenced.to prison terms
 for "criminal acts and hostile propaganda and activity."
 These were part of & larger group, possibly numbering
 fifty persons, who had been arrested and under
 investigation since October 1979.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Yugoslavs are generally free from arbitrary arrest,
 although large numbers of suspects reportedly have been
 detained for questioning after suspected acts of
 terrorism. The requirement to bring a defendant before a
 judge within 24 hours of arrest is designed to bring about
 "judicial awareness" of the reason for detention.
 Normally arraignment quickly follows arrest. Indictment
 must be brought within three months, except that the
 investigating judge can request from the court an
 extension of three months or even longer if justification
 for a deferral is presented. The accused has the right to
 counsel from the time he or she is brought before a
 judge. However, until an indictment is handed down,
 consultations between the accused and his attorney must
 take place in the presence of a court official. Prisoners
 may receive .visits from family members, but this right is
 restricted sometimes on the grounds that it would
 
 
 922
 prejudice the investigation. Generally, consular access
 is permitted to prisoners of foreign nationality, although
 in such cases notification of arrests is frequently tardy,
 and this and other problems often arise in cases where
 dual nationality is involved.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally open to the public except in cases
 involving military or national security questions when the
 judge has the authority to hold proceedings in camera. In
 cases of crimes relating to national defense and security
 and to matters concerning service in the Yugoslav
 military, civilians may be tried in military courts. The
 court may also, in cases involving classified materials,
 appoint a military officer as counsel for the defense
 rather than civilian counsel. The trial record does not
 necessarily provide a full transcript and all testimony is
 recorded in the words of the presiding judge. Government
 controls on the media also affect the degree and nature of
 publicity accorded the proceedings. The accused has the
 right to counsel, and Yugoslav lawyers have often
 vigorously defended their clients. The government,
 however, has not always remained impartial in judicial
 proceedings, particularly in cases of political interest.
 Amnesty International has reported the reluctance of some
 lawyers to take political cases for fear of reprisal. In
 ordinary criminal and civil proceedings, the courts act
 according to the law and constitution and the defendants'
 civil rights are generally respected.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Yugoslav Code of Criminal Procedure contains elaborate
 provisions for conducting searches, including the
 requirement for a court order except under certain limited
 circumstances. Article 184 of the Yugoslav constitution
 provides that entry may be made without warrant if this is
 indispensable for the immediate arrest of the perpetrator
 of a criminal offense, to protect the safety of life or
 property or if it appears obvious that the evidence in
 criminal proceedings could not be secured otherwise. The
 same article concludes with the provision that illegal
 entry is "prohibited and punishable." There are no
 indications of widespread violations of these provisions.
 Many dissidents, however, believe that the authorities
 eavesdrop on their conversations and read their mail.
 2. Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The government has promoted vigorously programs for the
 fulfillment of basic needs for food, shelter, health care,
 and education. There is an extensive system of social
 security and other benefits for those who are old,
 disabled or without employment. The government pays a
 children's allowance and provides a system of day care
 nurseries for working mother-s. The primary constraint on
 these programs is the limited amount of national income
 which Yugoslavia, as a developing country, can devote to
 them
 
 
 923
 In 1980, the Yugoslav economy was characterized by
 .moderate growth (3-4 percent) as the government attempted
 to deal with serious balance of payments and inflation
 problems carried over from 1979. --A stabilization program
 implemented in June has resulted in improvement in the
 balance of payments but inflation, due in part to costly
 energy imports, has not been brought under control. The
 average Yugoslav probably has experienced some decline in
 his living standards, although even lower paid working
 families generally enjoy a decent standard of living.
 Personal income is fairly evenly distributed with 65
 percent of the population falling into the middle income
 range. According to the Federal Institute for Statistics,
 the national per capita income for 1979 was $3,145 (this
 figure does not reflect the 30 percent devaluation of June
 1980, which reduced the dinar-dollar exchange rate from 19
 to 27 to the dollar).-, While there are significant
 differences in per capita income levels between the
 various republics, they stem from historical reasons.
 Government policy seeks.to reduce such differences by
 diverting resources from the most to the least developed
 regions. Moreover, wealth within individual republics is
 fairly evenly distributed. The poor are largely victims
 of structural features of the economy, and the government
 seeks to improve their lot.
 City-country differences also remain, although the
 different styles of life in urban and rural environments
 make statistical comparisons somewhat misleading. While
 the growth rate of the population is only .86 percent,
 there is a movement-of the population to the cities with a
 resultant strain on housing and other requirements of
 life. By.1979, the number of square meters of living
 space per capita was 14.4 with an average of 52.2 square
 meters per apartment. Housing construction is given high
 priority.
 The Yugoslav economy is decentralized with a high degree
 of autonomy at the republic, and even local, level.
 Yugoslavia, as a socialist state, limits the individual's
 right to own real property to one primary dwelling and one
 secondary (vacation) home. Individuals are otherwise
 generally.free to accumulate personal property for private
 use., Farmers may own up to ten hectares (approximately 25
 acres) of tillable land plus ten hectares of mountainous
 terrain as pasturage. There is considerable discussion
 now under way about moderately increasing these limits.
 The 1974 constitution spells out the complicated system of
 the organization of business enterprises. In theory, the
 means of production are owned by the nation as a whole and
 entrusted to the workers, organized in enterprise level
 workers' councils. In practice, it appears that the
 workers' councils exert a considerable influence over the
 choice of management of enterprises, their broad policies,
 and distribution of enterprise income. There are no
 business enterprises owned and operated directly by the
 state with the possible exception of some defense related
 establishments and agricultural research stations.
 Working conditions, labor-safety, and rates of pay are
 loosely regulated by legislation. Each enterprise has
 
 
 924
 wide latitude, through the system of workers' councils set
 forth in the constitution, to influence these factors.
 The trade unions are organized not by industry but by
 republics and provinces and on the federal level. Their
 influence, insofar as it has been exerted, has been in the
 decision-making process leading to the passage of general
 guideline legislation. There is much talk in Yugoslavia
 of giving the unions a greater role in the enterprise, and
 of increasing their relevance to worker's direct concerns.
 Strikes are neither permitted nor prohibited by law. When
 they do occur, they are called wFork stoppages. Such
 strikes are still limited to individual enterprises, and
 have almost always been caused by local grievances. They
 are also invariably short in duration. Around 200 work
 stoppages may occur each year. Unless the perpetrators of
 a strike commit acts of violence against persons or
 property, they are not punished, although their political
 reputation with the local party organization may suffer.
 The degree of application of political criteria for
 employment purposes, which was virtually absolute for many
 years after the war, has now diminished considerably
 although individual dissidents have encountered
 discrimination from the authorities. The existence of
 such criteria perhaps is represented most sharply in the
 application of the criterion of "moral and social
 fitness," which measures loyalty to the state and LCY, to
 white collar employment opportunities. This criteria
 weighs heavily upon those who are unwilling to become
 members of the LCY or who, as LCY members, have
 difficulties with the LCY.
 The constitution guarantees the right to education to all
 Yugoslav citizens, regardless of nationality, and to
 education in the languages of the various Yugoslav
 peoples. The state meets this obligation. An
 "educational reform" is currently under way which is
 designed to adjust the traditional secondary
 education/university system to the needs of a modern
 technocratic society. This is a controversial move,
 bitterly resented in many quarters. While there is a
 certain ideological content to educational reform, it is
 also a serious attempt to deal with a real problem also
 felt in many western countries. It appears that
 objections to educational reform are not centered in any
 one social or political group. Many in the elite see the
 reform as threatening their privileged positions. On the
 other hand, equally bitter complaints have been heard from
 the less well-off who fear the reform simply will allow
 the elite to engineer further privileges for itself.
 There is no longer much discrimination in the Yugoslav
 educational system based on family or political
 background, although this was the case at least until the
 mid-1960's. While it probably still occurs, it is far
 more a random occurrence than the result of state policy.
 Women are represented in most walks of life, including
 government positions, and receive equal pay for equal
 work. Women are, however, underrepresented in high-level
 government and management positions.
 
 
 925
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Public expression of political dissent is frequently
 suppressed. In particular, the government does not
 tolerate criticism of the League of Communists of
 Yugoslavia and its leadership, of basic domestic and
 foreign policies, or of the self-management system (the
 theory is sacrosanct, criticism of the practice is not) or
 the unity of the country's diverse ethnic groups. When
 the government does take action against such criticism, it
 resorts to arrest, trial, fines, warnings, imprisonment,
 or a mix of these. Periodically during 1980 -- especially
 following the death of President Tito -- several Yugoslav
 political leaders publicly criticized opposition groups
 and certain dissidents. This criticism was echoed in the
 Yugoslav media.
 Under Yugoslav law, dissidents can be charged with a
 variety of vaguely defined political crimes (e.g., hostile
 propaganda, counter-revolution, association against the
 state, and making statements prejudicial to brotherhood
 TV   and unity) and sentenced to prison terms of up to ten
 years. In its issue of June 19, 1980, the Belgrade
 newsmagazine NIN quoted a Yugoslav official to the effect
 that nine-tenths of "political crimes" in Yugoslavia were
 verbal and that, of these, only one in six was of a
 serious nature. Additionally, Yugoslavia takes the view
 that its authority over its citizens extends beyond its
 borders, and the Yugoslav government continues to arrest
 and imprison persons for political offenses committed
 abroad, even if the acts in question are not crimes in the
 country in which they took place.
 Various private organizations have reported on the human
 rights situation in Yugoslavia and have criticized
 restrictions on political expression and the arrest of
 persons espousing dissident political views. On the basis
 of official and unofficial reports, the number of persons
 currently imprisoned in Yugoslavia on political charges
 appears to be-within the range of 500 to 700 persons.
 Amnesties, while not routine, have been granted from time
 to time, usually on the occasion of Yugoslav National Day,
 November 29. The National Day Amnesty for 1979 included
 51 persons: 19 were set free.and 32 had their sentences
 reduced. Of the latter number two were identified as
 possibly being political prisoners. An additional amnesty
 was announced in February 1980, but the names of those
 amnestied have never been published. The 1980 National
 Day Amnesty included 82 persons: 42 were set free and 40
 had their sentences reduced.
 Yugoslav media are responsive to Party direction, although
 a degree of objectivity and even of selective criticism is
 permitted. Publication and circulation of written
 materials are subject to regulations involving
 registration and post-publication censorship. Published
 material, films, and recorded material from other
 countries including Western European countries and the
 United States are readily available although there is
 censorship of individual items, for example, specific
 issues of magazines or newspapers which contain articles
 offensive to the government. Recently, a group of Slovene
 intellectuals, who petitioned to publish a new journal of
 
 
 926
 literary and cultural criticisms was criticized, but the
 petition has not yet been rejected. Amnesty International
 reports several instances where Yugoslavs have been
 imprisoned for possessing or circulating certain "emigre"
 journals critical of the government.
 Freedom of religious practice and assembly is guaranteed
 by the constitution and is generally honored so long as
 religious organizations do not engage in activities
 considered political. At the same time, constraints are
 imposed on proselytizing activities and religious
 education for children. Seminaries exist for training
 adults as priests, but they are taxed and seminary
 students do not get military deferments. The Jewish
 community is quite small in Yugoslavia and there are no
 rabbinical seminaries. Public political gatherings are
 permitted only on.the authority of official bodies. In
 practice, the right to political assembly is exercised
 exclusively by groups supporting government policy.
 While some LCY members do attend religious services, such
 behavior is discouraged. Demonstrative religious belief
 would not be considered compatible with the dedication to  '
 the principles of Marxism-Leninism necessary to advance to
 the highest levels in some careers.
 Historic prejudices and tensions continue to exert their
 influence, and the nationalities question remains one of
 the key issues facing Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government
 has done a great deal to insure the legal and social
 rights of the many different nationalities and ethnic
 groups making up the Yugoslav State. The use of the major
 local language is required in official communication
 between Belgrade and the various republics, and local
 languages are also used in the schools, courts, and in the
 local media. Some social discrimination continues to be
 expressed, particularly against ethnic Albanians and
 Gypsies, but government policy is one of strict legal
 equality.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation0
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed in
 the constitution and is not significantly infringed upon
 in practice. The vast majority of Yugoslavs travel abroad
 at will. In 1979, the law on travel documents extended
 the validity of passports and exit visas from two to five
 years, and on some passports the validity is ten years.
 In November 1979, the Federal Executive Council of
 Yugoslavia ruled that Yugoslavs would no longer need exit
 permits to travel to those countries with which Yugoslavia
 had diplomatic or consular relations. In September 1980,
 the Yugoslav Supreme Court ruled that the authorities must
 inform citizens, except in national security cases, of the
 reasons for denial of a passport. A small number of
 dissidents have been denied passports on national security
 grounds.
 The law on the entrance of foreigners to Yugoslavia
 mentions the right of asylum and provides for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. In cooperation
 with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees, Yugoslavia provides temporary assistance to
 political refugees seeking resettlement in third countries.
 
 
 927
 Hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav workers are currently
 employed in Western Europe. There are no restrictions on
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The constitution has provisions guaranteeing participation
 in the political process, and the "self-management" system
 encourages wide participation in the decision-making
 process on economic issues. There is evidence that major
 economic policy decisions are subject to broad
 discussions. Nevertheless, the LCY's control of political
 power and restrictions against unauthorized political
 expression set close limits on such participation.
 The 1974 constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex. The government is committed to
 improving the status of women. Media and government
 attention to the status and role of women in society has
 increased during the United Nation's International Year
 for Women. The main problems of equal treatment of the
 sexes occur in those areas of the country where economic
 development has lagged or where traditional eastern or
 rural attitudes about female roles prevail.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although the Yugoslav gvernment has shown a willingness
 to discuss and raise general questions of human rights in
 international forums including meetings of the nonaligned
 countries and the Conference on Security and Cooperation
 in Europe review meetings, it remains sensitive to any
 charges of human rights violations within Yugoslavia. On
 grounds of national sovereignty, the government generally
 views the adjudication of political cases as an internal
 matter and not subject to outside investigation. In 1976,
 however, Yugoslav officials met with representatives of
 Amnesty International to discuss charges of political
 repression and individual cases of arrest and
 imprisonment. In early 1980, two members of Amnesty
 International who arrived in Yugoslavia on an unannounced
 visit, were able to discuss the cases of several persons
 imprisoned in Kosovo with officials of that province.
 However, in August 1980, two representatives of the
 International Human Rights Law Group visiting Yugoslavia
 became the subject of obvious surveillance in Croatia
 following visits to the apartments of dissidents in
 Zagreb. Yugoslavia has allowed foreign observers from the
 International League for Human Rights and from Amnesty
 International to observe political trials.
