 BOLIVIA
 The October 10, 1982 inauguration of Hernan Siles Zuazo marked
 the return to constitutionally elected government in Boltyia
 after 18 years of practically uninterrupted military rule.
 The Siles administration has survived a difficult two years of
 social tension, labor unrest, and frequent coup threats, and
 still faces overwhelming political and economic problems. The
 ideological, regional, and racial cleavages which have
 historically divided Bolivia have been sharpened by the worst
 economic crisis in half a century. In addition, Bolivia's
 fragile democratic institutions were threatened by a
 Presidential kidnapping and aborted coup effort on June 30,
 1984. The President was apprehended by a small group of
 military and police officers, and released unharmed 12 hours
 later when the action failed to attract broader military and
 civilian support. The Government has undergone seven cabinet
 crises in two years with an ever narrowing base of popular
 support, while the opposition forces, which now control the
 Congress, have mounted intense political pressure. The
 departure of the Christian Democratic Party from the ruling
 political coalition in October 1984 further weakened the
 Government. In an effort to diffuse mounting political
 pressures for his resignation, President Siles offered in
 November 1984 to advance presidential elections one year to
 June 1985. Shortly thereafter, the Communist Party departed
 the ruling political coalition in protest against the
 President's refusal to extend state control to key sectors of
 the economy.
 In spite of rich natural resources and sparse population,
 Bolivia remains one of the poorest countries in South
 America. The state enterprises which dominate the export
 sector have stagnated for years; many are now nearly
 bankrupt. The staggering economic problems which the Siles
 Government inherited worsened with the world economic
 recession and the 'El Nino* floods and droughts that affected
 the Andean Region in 1982-83. The continuing failure to enact
 a coherent economic recovery policy has caused a continual
 decline in the standard of living and increasing political
 discontent and desperation.
 Bolivia's most notable progress since the end of military
 government in 1982 has been in the area of human rights.
 Political parties are now free to organize and criticize the
 Government. Both Congress and the court system function
 independently and fulfill an active monitoring function.
 After several delays, municipal elections are now scheduled
 for June, 1985. The excesses of the former security police
 apparatus are a thing of the past. No political prisoners are
 being held, and many of the persons arrested in connection
 with the June 30 coup conspiracy have been released.
 The press continues to operate without government restriction,
 although pressures by extremist political groups on the
 Bolivian media have grown over the past six months. The
 Government has dealt with an increasing wave of general
 strikes, road blockades, and labor protests with restraint.
 It has been less effective in protecting property rights and
 providing guarantees for private sector activities.
 In August 1984 the Government sent military and police forces
 into the Chapare, the major cocaine-producing region, in
 orderto regain control of an area that had been almost
 
 
 430
 BOLIVIA
 completely taken over by narcotics traffickers. Although
 campesino organizations threatened violent resistance and
 claimed systematic human rights abuses by the police, so far
 no such pattern has been documented.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not condone political killing. The
 shooting to death of a prominent agro-industrialist in August
 1984 set off a general strike by the Confederation of Private
 Entrepreneurs (CEPB) which maintains that the killing was
 politically motivated since it followed months of harassment
 and death threats by campesino union activists, and claims
 that appeals to the Government for protection had been
 ignored. Although police say they have identified the
 murderer, the CEPB raised doubts about the hasty and
 incomplete investigation. Two months later the farm owner's
 widow appealed to the Senate for assistance, saying that the
 violent threats and interventions by campesinos designed to
 drive the family off their property had not ended.
 The Government has left to private organizations such as the
 Association of the Families of Missing Persons, ASOFAM, the
 task of prosecuting the 15 "paramilitaries" who were arrested
 in February 1983 and charged with the murders of prominent
 political figures under the Garcia Meza regime. The process
 has become stalled in the courts, and little outside pressure
 has been brought to bear to push it to completion.
 In May 1984 a bomb exploded outside the Military Supreme Court
 Building killing a corporal who was standing guard. While
 those responsible were not discovered, the Commander of the
 Armed Forces issued a statement indicating that the terrorist
 attack was meant to intimidate the members of the court who
 were prosecuting the Luribay Seven' defendants for guerrilla
 activities.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically inspired disappearances
 in Bolivia in 1984.
 To investigate the disappearance of political opponents under
 previous regimes, the Siles administration in 1982 created the
 National Missing Persons Commission, with representatives from
 the Executive Branch, the Congress, the Permanent Assembly of
 Human Rights, the armed forces, the Catholic Church, the
 Bolivian Red Cross, and ASOFAM. In December, the Commission
 presented to the UN Commission on Human Rights a report on
 207cases of disappearance during the last 18 years. According
 to the report, 52 of these cases have been solved while the
 remaining cases are still being investigated.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Siles Goverment has stated that it does not and will not
 employ torture. Shortly after coming to power it abolished
 all state security agencies which had been used by previous
 
 
 431
 BOLIVIA
 military governments to intimidate opponents. Human rights
 groups have argued, however, that torture, even though
 notauthorized by the Government, may still take place in the
 early stages of detention due to the fact that many of the
 lower-level military personnel responsible for abuses by
 preceeding military regimes are still in place.
 The seven persons detained by the Bolivian army for guerrilla
 activities near Luribay in Loayza Province in October 1983
 complained that they were tortured by the military. According
 to the representatives of the Permanent Assembly of Human
 Rights who met twice with the detainees, the methods used on
 them included beatings, immersion in water, electric shocks,
 and threats by masked men to shoot them unless they made
 confessions. Evidence of such mistreatment was corroborated
 by a priest who was allowed to visit the detainees with a
 doctor and reported their findings to the President, who
 reportedly instructed the Defense Minister to ensure that the
 abuses stop. Thereafter, the prisoners reported their
 treatment improved.
 On December 14, 1983, a Navy non-commissioned officer died
 while under detention in the Naval Military School for alleged
 involvement in selling arms to leftist political groups. The
 Navy and the Medical College stated that the death resulted
 from a heart attack. However, the man's family and other
 naval officers asserted that he died because of beatings and
 electric shocks received in detention. They presented their
 evidence to several La Paz newspapers. The widow and her
 family pressed for the President to punish those responsible
 including the Commander of the Navy, who was later replaced by
 the Government. On April 12 the family brought suit against
 the ex-Commander and other Navy officials for alleged
 complicity in torture.
 Of the 29 persons arrested for suspected involvement in the
 June 30 coup attempt, two complained of torture and
 mistreatment while being questioned in the Ministry of
 Interior. Following the first public accusations by the
 President of the Senate Human Rights Committee, the Government
 denied any abuses and invited the press and human rights and
 international organizations to visit the detainees. The
 Permanent Association of Human Rights and the Bolivian Red
 Cross interviewed most of the detainees but found no evidence
 of mistreatment. A prominent civic leader who complained of
 having been subject to beating, electric shocks, and cold
 water showers refused to be examined by independent doctors,
 making his charges impossible to verify. When, following
 their release, the two detainees again voiced complaints of
 having been tortured, the Interior Minister vehemently denied
 the charges and threatened to sue for slander.
 Most problems of prisoner mistreatment arise from chronically
 overcrowded prison conditions and the lack of properly trained
 prison and police personnel. San Pedro Prison in La Paz,
 which was built to house 300, now holds over 1,000 prisoners.
 Corruption, malnutrition, and unsanitary conditions are
 widespread. Prisoners pay guards for food, better cells,
 passes, contraband liquor, and drugs. In August 1984,
 prisoners staged a hunger strike to protest food shortages and
 the retardation of justice.
 The growing economic and social unrest, coupled with
 continuing political agitation by leftist groups, has
 
 
 432
 BOLIVIA
 generated a series of peasant and union takeovers of private
 firms and property. Four incidents involved hostage-taking of
 local management and technicians in private mines and
 factories while at least a dozen others involved armed seizure
 or occupations of private property. The Government has not
 responded publicly to these assaults, causing private
 entrepreneurs to protest that citizens' lives and property are
 being endangered with impunity and that government protections
 are non-existent.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, no one can be arrested without a court
 order and detainees must be charged or freed within 24 hours.
 From the moment of detention, detainees have the right to be
 represented by an attorney, and any interested party may
 demand a writ of habeas corpus before a superior court or
 local judge. These rights are often not honored because of a
 detainee's lack of education or economic resources, or because
 of the built-in inefficiency and slowness of the judicial
 system.
 Since the return to constitutional democracy, Bolivians have
 been largely free of the fear of being arrested or exiled for
 their political views. In May 1984 a foreign journalist was
 held for questioning for allegedly misquoting a government
 official concerning narcotics, and a radio personality who is
 critical of the Government was detained briefly in July. But
 in both cases the public uproar caused the Siles
 Administration to act quickly and reverse the actions of
 subordinates.
 Following the abortive coup and presidential kidnapping on
 June 30, the Government arrested 29 civilians and military and
 police officials for suspected involvement in the events.
 Most were held incommunicado for a period of at least several
 days. However, the Government was subjected to continual
 public pressure to make sure there were no violations of human
 rights. While nearly all the prisoners said they were
 well-treated, most complained of the long unnecessary
 detentions.
 By late September, 14 of the detainees had been released
 either for lack of evidence after questioning or because of
 intervention by the District Court of La Paz. Two were being
 held by the military and 13 had been transferred to San Pedro
 prison to await civilian trial. Five other officials of the
 police and military who had sought refuge in the Venezuelan
 Embassy were given safe conduct for temporary residence in
 Spain, while the status of three other civilians who sought
 refuge in the Uruguayan Embassy is still undetermined.
 The Government has continued to seek to expel leading
 violators of human rights under previous regimes from
 Bolivia. In August Bolivian authorities arrested Emilio
 Carbone Bagigalupo and charged him with conspiring against
 state security, belonging to paramilitary organizations, and
 involvement in narcotics trafficking. Carbone, an Italian
 citizen, was active in the neo-Fascist group called the
 Italian Socialist Movement and involved in the 1980 coup which
 ousted President Lydia Gueiler. The Government has initiated
 legal procedures to expel him to Italy.
 Argentine national Mario Mingolla, who was arrested in
 
 
 433
 BOLIVIA
 December 1982 for paramilitary activities, including an
 alleged plot against the life of Vice-President Jaime Paz
 Zamora, left his confinement in February 1984 and later
 claimed he had been freed by order of the Ministry of
 Interior. The Interior Minister in turn asserted that he was
 not being held prisoner, but had asked the Government
 for"protective custody* because of the danger of returning to
 his native country. Although the Government had found no
 evidence of the assassination plot, Mingolla was held for 14
 months without formal charges, during which time the
 Government tried informally to arrange for his asylum in a
 third country. His long detention had become a cause of
 criticism from church and human rights groups, but interested
 parties found no foreign government willing to give him asylum.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Government has upheld the right to fair public trial, but
 delays are common.
 The seven person-sdetained by the Army near Luribay in
 October, 1983 for alleged involvement in training of leftist
 groups were tried by a military court for stealing arms,
 falsifying their identity, and attempted treason. The
 seven-month trial sparked an international controversy, as the
 families of the accused and Bolivian and international human
 rights organizations insisted that the military had no
 jurisdiction to try the case. The military prosecutor argued
 that because the group was using military arms and uniforms
 and was illegally carrying out combat training activities, the
 military court was competent to hear the case. The defense
 attorneys appealed the jurisdictional question to the Bolivian
 Supreme Court, but lost. On October 12, the Permanent
 Military Tribunal sentenced the defendants to two to six years
 in prison. The defense then appealed the decision to the
 Supreme Tribunal of Military Justice.
 The "Luribayl controversy became more complicated after 11
 members of a conservative youth group were arrested near Santa
 Cruz on October 20, 1984 for illegal possession of arms.
 Although the Interior Minister said the youths should have
 been turned over to the military court, they were released on
 their own recognizance pending a civilian trial. This led to
 public charges that the Government operated under a double
 standard of justice, prompting President Siles on October 25
 to announce he would grant amnesty to the 'Luribay Seven.'
 Although the Government subsequently issued a supreme decree
 ordering their immediate release, military lawyers challenged
 the constitutionality of the decree, and the decision whether
 to release the 'Luribay Seven' now rests with the Supreme
 Tribunal of Military Justice. In a separate decision on a
 request for a writ of habeas corpus presented by the
 defendants, the District Court of La Paz rejected that
 petition arguing that under the Constitution the Armed Forces
 are subordinate to the Constitution and the Supreme Military
 Tribunal should therefore carry out the Presidential Amnesty
 Decree.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens'
 lives are protected by the Constitution and respected in
 practice. House searches, monitoring of conversations, and
 
 
 434
 BOLIVIA
 other abuses that occurred under military regimes in the past
 have stopped.
 After the Government declared the cocaine-producing Chapare
 valley a military zone in August, there were concerns
 expressed over warrantless entries. In September and October
 the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights investigated complaints
 from peasant groups of widespread abuses, but found them
 contradictory and difficult to document. Although a few cases
 of robbery by the security forces had occurred, there was no
 systematic pattern of abuse.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no government restrictions on free speech or the
 press. The views of opposition parties, leaders and
 organizations--often harshly critical of the Government--are
 given free play in the press, radio, and most television
 stations. President Siles has repeatedly confirmed the
 Government's commitment to unfettered freedom of expression.
 Some extremist political and labor groups, taking exception to
 these liberties, have called for the closing or takeover of
 certain newspapers and radio stations. Although the wave of
 newspaper bombings which occurred in late 1983 has subsided,
 one La Paz daily and several radio stations in Santa Cruz and
 La Paz suffered dynamite blasts in 1984. No one claimed
 responsibility for the bombings, and no suspects have been
 arrested. Both the threats of closure and the terrorist
 attacks were strongly condemned by public figures.
 Another matter of concern to local journalists is the recently
 enacted Bolivian Press Law which creates strict qualifications
 for those allowed to work as journalists and calls for a
 quasi-public commission to rule on applications to the College
 of Professional Journalists, which would control entry to the
 profession. While the full effects of the law have not yet
 been felt in the Bolivian press, many fear that it could lead
 to coercion or manipulation by governmental authorities, and
 that it preempts constitutional guarantees of free speech by
 limiting access to the media only to accredited journalists.
 In television, the network of state and university channels
 has been controlled by the Government, effectively shutting
 out the conservative opposition. Unauthorized private TV
 stations have been functioning in Santa Cruz, Sucre, and
 Cochabamba, and the Government has been unwilling to legalize
 them. When a new station began operations in La Paz in
 October 1984, the Ministry of Transport and Communications
 announced it would confiscate the private operator's equipment
 and apply a 1980 law which prohibits private TV channels. The
 station owners, the press, and the congressional opposition
 responded that the threats of closure represented an
 unconstitutional incursion on freedom of expression. The
 Government has since taken a more conciliatory position.
 All Bolivian universities are part of the state-run system
 except Catholic University in La Paz, the Protestant College
 in Santa Cruz, the private University of Santa Cruz, which was
 founded in January 1984 on free enterprise principles, and the
 new Bahai-related Nur University, which recently received
 government authorization.
 
 
 BOLIVIA
 Academic freedom is recognized in the Fundamental Law of the
 Bolivian University passed in 1972, but political activists in
 student and campus-governing bodies have seriously interfered
 with the exercise of this right. Under the present system of
 *professor-student co-management' in the state universities,
 students have a 50 percent voice in every decision-making
 committee. Leftist activists have used this power to make
 appointments which ignore academic credentials in favor of
 ideological purity, to replace professors who disagree
 withthem politically, and to impose their ideas on the student
 body.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The current Government has not attempted to restrict peaceful
 assembly and association. Labor unions, which played an
 active role in the restoration of democracy in 1982, have
 freely exercised their right to recruit, negotiate, and
 strike. The Senate has yet to act on repealing a
 constitutional provision prohibiting union activity by public
 employees, but the ban has not been invoked by the Siles
 Government. Virtually all Bolivian workers in the mining,
 industrial, public, and service sectors are organized.
 The International Labor Organization's Committee on the
 Application of Conventions and Recommendations commended the
 Bolivian government in 1983 for its efforts to bring the
 country's legislation into conformity with the Convention on
 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to
 Organize.
 The umbrella labor federation which represents the majority of
 Bolivian workers is independent, politically very powerful,
 and, indeed, frequently demonstrates a capacity to paralyze
 the economy with crippling strikes. It has campaigned for an
 *emergency social-economic program" as an alternative to the
 Government's economic adjustment measures. It has also
 pressured the Government to postpone debt servicing with
 private international banks. The number of strikes, work
 stoppages, road blockades, plant takeovers, and other militant
 actions kept rising in 1984 as workers reacted against food
 shortages and the drastic loss of purchasing power in a
 deteriorating economy.
 Private sector owners and managers have also become
 increasingly organized and vocal in defending their
 interests. In 1984 the Confederation of Private Entrepreneurs
 carried out two general strikes to protest the Government's
 failure to consult them on national wage standards or to
 defend private property and citizens against violent
 assaults. In June 1984 the organization also filed a protest
 with the ILO over the Government's disregard for tripartite
 standards in setting economic and wage policies. The ILO will
 reportedy send a committee to investigate the claims.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice,
 and there are no restrictions on publishing, establishing
 places of worship and religious schools, training clergy, or
 maintaining international ties. Bolivian law requires that
 religious groups be incorporated, but there is no state
 control or censorship. Since the return to civilian
 government, no clergy have been persecuted for their political
 beliefs or activities.
 
 
 436
 BOLIVIA
 Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion in Bolivia.
 Catholic bishops receive a nominal stipend from the state, but
 no other secular advantage is conferred. Protestant churches
 operate openly and freely. In 1982, a Protestant college
 opened in Santa Cruz. The Mormons and Seventh Day Adventists
 proselytize and run churches and training centers throughout
 the country. There are Bahai and Hare Krishna centers in La
 Paz. The small Jewish community is not disturbed as it was
 under military regimes, which tolerated neo-Nazi
 'paramilitary' groups that published anti-Semitic tracts. The
 Mennonites have large colonies in Santa Cruz.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within the country
 or abroad.
 Since May 26, 1982, all political exiles from previous
 military regimes have been allowed to return. A program
 coordinated by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 facilitated the return of 1,901 Bolivians in 1983 and 224 in
 1984. The Intergovernmental Committee on Migration is
 assisting other Bolivians who wish to reunite with their
 families.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 The inauguration of President Siles on October 18, 1982
 culminated a long effort to restore freely elected, democratic
 government to Bolivia. Although he had received a plurality
 in the 1980 Presidential elections, he was prevented from
 taking office by a military coup led by General Luis Garcia
 Meza. Over two years later, the Congress which had been
 elected in 1980 was finally seated and chose Siles as
 President under constitutional procedures.
 The next presidential election, originally scheduled for 1986,
 has been moved up to June 1985 when municipal elections are
 also to take place for the first time since 1949. The latter
 have been delayed twice due to inaction by both the executive
 branch and the Congress in providing funds, naming
 representatives to the Electoral Court, deciding on revisions
 in the electoral law, and enacting the Law of Municipalities.
 Fifteen political parties and fronts plus numerous schismatic
 and independent movements are represented in the Chamber of
 Deputies and the Senate. A myriad of other parties covering
 the ideological spectrum also function, although they have no
 elected officials. The Congress, which is controlled by the
 opposition, has played an active, aggressive role in
 monitoring the policies of the executive branch.
 The political system is dominated by persons of largely
 European origin. Those following a traditional Indian
 lifestyle and speaking Aymara or Quechua as a primary
 language, who make up an estimated 60 percent of the
 population, have little opportunity to advance to top
 positions because of economic disadvantages and cultural
 isolation. However, Indians have served in cabinet-level
 positions, and there are several Indian Congressmen.
 
 
 437
 BOLIVIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been sensitive to the opinions of both
 international and non-governmental organizations regarding
 alleged violations of civil liberties and has made human
 rights its most consistent public theme. In October 1984 the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission of the OAS removed
 Bolivia from its list of countries under special consideration
 and commended the Siles administration for maintaining a
 policy of respect for human rights in spite of high social
 tensions and numerous attempts to destabilize the
 constitutional Government. Freedom House in 1984 again gave
 Bolivia a rating of 'free.' Amnesty International in its 1984
 report commented on the Siles' Government's efforts to
 investigate cases of past disappearances, but expressed
 concern about the slowness of these investigations and the
 delays in bringing those responsible to trial.
 Of non-governmental organizations, the Catholic Church, the
 Permanent Assembly on Human Rights, and the press have been
 the most aggessive monitors of human rights in Bolivia. The
 Bolivian Episcopal Conference of the Catholic Church and some
 Protestant ministers played a role in the past in visiting
 detainees and speaking out against abuses. Individual
 Catholic bishops, many priests, and such lay groups as the
 Bacherer Foundation and the Confederation of Lay Persons have
 been active in the investigation of social problems and,
 occasionally, human rights issues.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The World Bank's Development Report estimated Bolivia's
 population in 1984 at 6.04 million with a growth rate of 2.6
 percent. Current estimates by the National Institute of
 Statistics place the population at 6.25 million. Life
 expectancy at birth is estimated at 51.8 years. The infant
 mortality rate, the highest in South America according to
 UNICEF, is 122 per 1000 live births. Data from the 1976
 census indicates that 291 out of 1000 rural children die
 before their fifth year, compared to 186 per 1000 urban
 children. Only 38 percent of the population had access to
 safe water in 1976 (the last year for which this statistic is
 available), and the caloric supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements was only 86.6 percent in
 1977.
 World Bank figures show the adult literacy rate was 63.2
 percent in 1976, but more recent Bolivian estimates place it
 at about 73 percent. Public education is free and generally
 available in urban areas, but the school year is often
 interrupted by strikes and protests. Except in the most
 isolated areas, Bolivian rural youth can expect at least three
 years of schooling, The primary school enrollment ratio was
 approximately 108.22 for 1981.
 For the past several years Bolivia has endured a severe,
 worsening economic crisis which was deepened by the world
 recession and by natural disasters in 1982-83. Inflation,
 stagnation, and the lack of foreign exchange produced sharp
 drops in Bolivia's mineral exports and agricultural
 production, resulting in real losses in gross domestic
 production (GDP) of eight percent in 1982 and nine percent in
 1983.
 
 
 438
 BOLIVIA
 In 1984 inflation exceeded 1000 percent. Bolivian Central
 Bank statistics show that real per capita income, already the
 lowest in Latin America, has fallen by 34.3 percent since
 1980. Bolivia is also burdened by a huge fiscal deficit
 accounting for nearly 20 percent of GDP and a $3.5 billion
 international debt which could claim 60 percent of foreign
 earnings over the next three years. The only bright spot is
 the agricultural sector, which is back to pre-1982 production
 levels and could generate a one percent growth in GDP in
 1984.
 The democratic Government, faced with intense pressure from
 the powerful Labor Confederation and political groups on the
 left, has failed to enact coherent policies to stabilize the
 economy. This paralysis has led to hoarding, speculation, and
 smuggling and consequent shortages in basic goods such as
 sugar, bread, flour, meat, coffee, gas and kerosene. While
 hunger has not yet reached epidemic proportions, futher
 economic decline could cause serious social and political
 disorder.
 Since 1952 racial discrimination has been banned in Bolivia.
 However, informal discrimination persists against persons of
 Indian background by those persons who believe they have more
 claim to European ancestry and who tend to have higher incomes
 and social positions.
 Women do not enjoy a status in society equal to that of men.
 The main obstacles to advancement are cultural traditions,
 social conditions, and a lack of political power. In rural
 families women contribute significantly to economic activities
 but are considered subordinate and rarely participate in
 cooperatives, community meetings, or training programs. In
 Hispanic urban families, women are more likely to stay at home
 and are not economically active. However, women are slowly
 achieving a greater role in Bolivian business life.
 While in general Bolivian laws do not discriminate against
 women, under the agrarian reform law, title to land cannot
 pass to a woman even if she is widowed or divorced. Also,
 agricultural credit to women is restricted by most banks and
 lending institutions. Although by law women workers have the
 right to three months maternity leave, in practice most are
 unaware of this right or are concerned that they will lose
 their salary or jobs if they take such leave. The Chamber of
 Deputies recently formed a Women's Commission which plans to
 work with the many organizations concerned with women's
 advancement and to challenge discriminatory practices. It has
 proposed reform legislation for the unionization of domestic
 workers and their inclusion in the social security system.
 Although there is no overt political discrimination against
 women, they are rarely named to high-ranking positions in the
 Government. The most notable exception was Lydia Gueiler, who
 served as interim President from November 1979 to July 1980.
 The Congress which convened in October 1982 included three
 women Deputies along with a number of women as alternate
 Deputies and Senators.
