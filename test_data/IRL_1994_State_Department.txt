 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a long tradition of or-
 derly transfer of power. The Constitution and Supreme Court decisions protect indi-
 vidual rights. The Government and an independent judiciary traditionally respect
 and protect these rights.
 The Government controls the police and the armed forces. The spillover of vio-
 lence from Northern Ireland led to legislation in 1984 that increased police power
 to detain and interrogate suspected terrorists. The police have shown great restraint
 in exercising these powers
 The economy is based largely on free enterprise. It performed well in 1994, and
 the e      d of unemployment declined.
 Human rights problems within Ireland arise priarily from the substandard pris-
 on conditions (especially the lack of separate facilities for women and for children),
 the lack of a coherent policy on refugees and asylum, and discrimination against
 and abuse of women and children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Ridling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment, and
 there ee no reports of violations. However, in many prisons conditions are barely
 tolerable, due to overcrowdiin Inadequate sanitation, or lack of ther facilities.
 There are no suitable prisons for women, and a lack of separate areas for young
 people results in 14- and 15-year-old being mixed in with adult prisoners. The Gov-
 ernment has indicated it hopes the overcrowding will be eased by the anticipated
 early release of prisoners as a result of the peace process in Northern Ireland, and
 by a planned new large prison. On the other hand, it has shown no intention of sig-
 nificantly increasing its fundin for risons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or IieThe Constitution stipulates that no per-
 son shall be deprived of personal liberty without due process under the law. It re-
 quires that arresting authorities make written explanation to a court about the sus-
 pect, and that the court determine the legality of the detention. The Criminal Jus-
 tice Act of 1951, a aamended in 1984, stipulates that as soon as reasonably pos-
 sible" the police must bring an arrested person before a justice of the district court
 or, if none is available, before a peace commissioner. The Government and the
 courts fully respect these provisions.
 Detention without a charge is permitted for up to 48 hours in cases covered by
 the Offenses Agist the State Act of 1939, which aims to "prevent actions and con-
 duct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State." This Act
 allows police to s-rest and detain for questioning anyone suspected of any terrorist
 offense involving firearms, explosives, membership in an unlawful organization, or
 maliious damage to property. A person arrested under this Act maybe held, with-
 out a charge, for up to 24 hours, and for a further 24 hours if a chief superintendent
 or still higher-rig polie officer so directs. A detainee who is not charged within
 the 48-hour maximum period must be released upon its expiry.
 The Criminal Justice Act of 1984 empowers the police to detain for up to 12 hours
 anyone under reasonable suspicion of having committed a crime. The authorities do
 not impose incommunicado detention or exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for fair public trial, and
 the legal system honors this. The accused generally may choose his or her attorney.
 For indigents, the State assumes the cost.
 
 
 The courts are independent, and jury trial is the norm. However, the Constitution
 provides for the creation of "special courts" to deal with cases in which the "ordinary
 courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the pres-
 ervation of public peace and order" (e.g., due to a likelihood of terrorist intimidation
 of those courts). The Offenses Against the State Act authorizes use of special courts
 for offenses against national security, particularly cases of political violence. In lieu
 of juries, these courts have panels consisting of an odd number of judges (at least
 three) whose verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of evidence are essentially the
 same as in regular courts except that the sworn statement of a police chief super-
 intendent identifying the accused as a member of an illegal organization is accepted
 as prima facie evidence. Sessions of special courts are usually public but the judge
 may exclude certain persons, other than journalists; appeal of exclusion can be made
 only through a separate judicial proceeding. In 1994 there were 15 special court
 trials, resulting in conviction of 20 defendants.
 In cases of certain other types of offenses (e.g., sexual), the judge in a regular
 court may exclude any or all persons except officers of the court, lawyers, or journal-
 ists, ostensibly to protect the reputations of persons involved in the trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The Su-
 preme Court has affirmed that, although not specifically provided for in the Con-
 stitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home must be respected
 in law and practice; and the Government honors this.
 However, the Constitution provides that the State shall enact no law permitting
 divorce. A 1986 nationwide referendum overwhelmingly defeated a proposal to
 amend the Constitution to permit divorce in limited circumstances. In the same
 year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the prohibition of divorce is
 not a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Ireland is a
 party. The Government has pledged to hold another referendum on divorce, which
 now seems likely to occur in 1995.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these freedoms,
 and the Government fully respects them. The law prohibits publication or utterance
 of "blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter?; enforcement of this is directed al-
 most exclusively against pornographic material.
 The state-owned radio and television network has traditionally denied airtime to
 members of certain blacklisted political organizations, even lawful ones, under the
 1960 Broadcasting Act. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of this
 policy. The Provisional Sinn Fein (the legal front of the illegal Provisional Irish Re-
 publican Army (IRA) was long among the excluded organizations, but when the ban
 on it expired in January, the Government decided not to renew this. Broadcasting
 is mostly state-controlled. A Broadcasting Complaints Commission oversees stand-
 ards and investigates complaints about programming. The State does not control
 newspapers, and no legislation regulates them per se.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for by the Constitution, and the Government respects them even as regards groups
 associated with illegal terrorist organizations. Membership in the illegal organiza-
 tions is punishable by imprisonment for up to 7 years.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as well as
 freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and voluntary repatriation.
 The Alien Act of 1935 gives the Justice Minister unlimited discretion in regard
 to treatment of all aliens, including those who qualify for refugee status under inter-
 national law. The authorities have accepted asylum seekers only on a limited case-
 by-case basis, and have held them in detention in some cases for over a year before
 rendering a decision.
 Some asylum seekers have been turned back upon arrival. The police have com-
 pleted the report requested by the Justice Minister on a 1992 incident in which they
 violently forced a group of 27 Kurdish men, women, and children--injuring many-
 back onto an aircraft at Shannon Airport, and denied them access to an interpreter,
 to a lawyer, and to a representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
 The report has not yet been released, pending the outcome of court action.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 A constitutional requirement that elections be held at least every 5 years has al-
 ways been met. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 18, and balloting is secret.
 Several political parties have seats in the bicameral Parliament. Members of the
 Dail-the chamber that carries out the main legislative functions-are popularly
 elected; in the Senate, some members are elected and some are appointed by various
 bodies. The President is popularly elected for a 7-year term, and is limited to two
 terms. An appointed Council of State serves as an advisory body to the President.
 Women number only 20 of the 166 deputies in the Dail; 8 of the 60 senators; and
 2 of the 15 ministers. Of the 15 junior ministers, 3 are women. While women partici-
 sate in all departments of government, they are underrepresented at senior levels.
 fficial data show that at year's end women held 30 percent of all public-sector jobs.
 Section 4. Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The principal independent organization monitoring domestic human rights issues,
 the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, operates without hindrance from the Govern-
 ment. The Government is similarly open to investigation of human rights abuses by
 international or nongovernmental organizations.
 However, most independent critiques of human rights in Ireland have focused on
 the overcrowding and other conditions in the prisons, and the Government has gen-
 erally ignored their recommendations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Except as regards employment, neither the Constitution nor the law prohibits dis-
 crimination on the basis of disability, race, sex, language, or social status. The Con-
 stitution, as amended, forbids state preferment of one religion over another and dis-
 crimination on the grounds of religious profession, belief, or status.
 Women.-Working women are discriminated against as regards pay and pro-
 motions, in both the public and the private sectors, and many are also hampered
 by inadequate child-care facilities. In 1990 the Government established the Second
 Commission on the Status of Women, which published its recommendations in early
 1993; the Government pledged to implement them, including a requirement that at
 least 40 percent of all public appointees be women.
 The Antidiscrimination (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of
 1977 provide for protection and redress against discrimination based on gender. The
 Employment Equality Agency monitors their operation. The number of cases has
 fallen in recent years, but progress in eliminating the differential in earnings has
 been very modest. In 1994 the hourly industrial wage for women was 60 percent
 of what men received and their weekly earnings averaged 68 percent of men's week-
 ly pay.
 Tere have been no systematic studies of violence against women, but indications
 are that it is widespread. In 1994 the Rape Crisis Center, a private organization,
 received some 5,000 telephone calls. The Center estimates that only 30 percent of
 rape victims report the crime to the police, and that only 10 percent of those go to
 trial. A 1990 act criminalized rape within marriage, and provided for free legal ad-
 vice to the victim. In addition to rape and other sexual abuse, beatings of women
 are common.
 Children.-The Status of Children Act of 1987 abolished the concept of illegit-
 imacy and provided for equal rights for children in all legal proceedings. There are
 no reliable data on enforcement, or on societal treatment of children, but it is be-
 lieved that child abuse is common. In recent years, sexual abuse of children has
 been receiving increased media attention.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislation to protect disabled persons from
 discrimination in employment or in other matters, or to improve their access to
 buildings or transportation, and little has been accomplished in these regards. Few
 public or private buildings have facilities for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to join a union is guaranteed by law, as
 is the right to refrain from joining. The law prohibits anti-union actions before reg-
 istration of a union.
 About 55 percent of workers in the private and public sectors are members of
 unions. Police and military personnel are prohibited from joining unions or striking,
 but they may form associations to represent themselves in matters of pay, working
 conditions, and general welfare. The right to strike is freely exercised in both the
 
 
 851
 public and private sectors. The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 prohibits retribution
 against strikers and union leaders; the Government effectively enforces it through
 the Department of Enterprise and Employment. In July the Department of Enter-
 prise and Employment promulgated a code of conduct for industrial relations in es-
 sential services; negotiations between business and labor on the code's implementa-
 tion were in progress at year's end.
 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions represents 68 unions (including some in
 Northern Ireland). Both it and the unions affiliated with it are independent of the
 Government and of the political iarties. Unions may freely form or join federations
 or confederations and affiliate with international bodies.
 In 1994, as in previous years, strikes were common and some went on for several
 months.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have full free-
 dom to organize and to engage in collective bargaining. The Anti-Discrimination in
 Pay Act of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of 1977 make the Employment
 Equality Agency responsible for oversight of allegations of discrimination. If the
 Agency is unable to effect resolution, the dispute goes before the Labor Court, which
 consists of one representative each for the employer and the union, plus an inde-
 pendent chairperson. The Unfair Dismissals Act of 1977 provides various forms of
 relief in cases of employers guilty of antiunion discrimination, including the rein-
 statement of workers fired for union activities.
 Most terms and conditions of employment are determined through collective bar-
 gaining, in the context of a national economic pact negotiated every 3 years by rep-
 resentatives of unions, employers, farmers, and the Government. In February the
 latest such pact was concluded, and as usual it establishes standard pay increases
 and fixes a cap on any increases subsequently negotiated at local levels.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 established the Labor Relations Commission
 which provides advice and conciliation services in industrial disputes. The Commis-
 sion may refer unresolved disputes to the Labor Court, which may recommend
 terms of settlement and may set up joint employer-union committees to regulate
 conditions of employment and minimum wages in a specific trade or industry.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14 years with the written permission of the parents. For children of age 15 the
 law limits worktime to 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week. For those of age
 16 or 17, the limits are 9 hours per day and 40 hours per week. These provisions
 are effectively enforced by the Department of Equality and Law Reform.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no general minimum-wage law, but
 there are several applicable to specific industrial sectors, mainly those that tend to
 pay lower than average wages. Although the lowest of these minimum wages would
 not be sufficint to provide a decent living for a family of four, low-income families
 are entitled to additional benefits such as subsidized housing and children's allow-
 ances.
 The standard workweek is 39 hours. Working hours in the industrial sector are
 limited to 9 hours per day and 48 hours per week. Overtime is limited to 2 hours
 per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a year. The Labor Department is re-
 sponsible for enforcing four basic laws dealing with occupational safety that provide
 adequate and comprehensive coverage. There were no significant complaints from
 either labor or management in 1994 regarding enforcement of these laws.
