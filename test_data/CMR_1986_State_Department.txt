 CAMEROON
 Political power in Cameroon is heavily concentrated in the
 presidency. The President appoints all government and party
 officials and makes all major decisions, although key
 parliamentarians in the National Assembly and others have some
 behind-the-scenes influence. Cameroon had an active multiparty
 system at the time of its independence, but under former
 President Ahidjo, all parties were gradually consolidated into
 the Cameroon National Union, renamed in 1985 under President
 Paul Biya the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM).
 President Biya has moved toward greater democratization of the
 party structure, notably in 1986 by permitting multiple
 candidates for many party offices.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the National
 Police (Surete National), the National Intelligence Service
 (Centre de Documentation Nationale, CND), the Ministry of
 Territorial Administration, Military Intelligence, and, to a
 lesser extent, the Presidential Security Service. The Ministry
 of Territorial Administration is in charge of prisons, and the
 National Police has the dominant role in enforcing internal
 security laws. The CND and the military are still involved in
 both those functions but to a lesser degree.
 Cameroon's economy continues to grow, and its per capita income
 ($840 in 1985) ranks Cameroon among the middle income
 developing countries, though it remains plagued by many
 problems of underdevelopment. Even though revenues from oil
 are down (due to the fall in world prices), the market-oriented
 economy remains strong because of its diversified agricultural
 base and the Government's economic policy management.
 During the 22 years of of President Ahidjo's rule, Cameroon's
 diversity and the armed violence in some parts of the country
 were used to justify authoritarian control and harsh
 restrictions on civil liberties. In contrast, under Biya the
 human rights environment has improved and in 1986 reflected not
 only some liberalization within the CPDM, but also increasing
 freedom of expression, especially in the private press.
 However, this latter progress was countered by occasional
 incidents of arbitrary censorship and harassment. Several
 Anglophone print and radio journalists were arrested and
 detained for 4 months. In August the Government released from
 detention at least 15 activists from an outlawed political
 party. By most estimates, 10 to 20 political detainees remain
 in custody.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is proscribed by the criminal code, which renders
 evidence obtained by torture inadmissible. In addition, the
 
 
 CAMEROON
 penal code prohibits public servants from using force against
 any person. However, very poor prison conditions, including
 overcrowding, inadequate food and sanitation, and limited
 medical facilities remain problems. Prisoners have reportedly
 suffered from severe malnutrition unless provided food by
 friends or families. In 1986 the Government recognized these
 problems and focused attention on the need for prison reform.
 The Secretary of State for Territorial Administration visited
 prisons in most of the provinces and his suggestions for reform
 received wide press coverage.
 There were reports that two members of the outlawed political
 party, Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), arrested in
 December 1985, were tortured during their detention. Persons
 under "administrative detention" (i.e. political detainees) are
 kept in special camps or prisons. Access to the administrative
 detention centers by families and friends is reported to be
 severely restricted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Cameroonian law, a person arrested on suspicion of
 committing an offense may not be held for more than 48 hours
 without a court order. This provision is generally observed in
 nonpolitical cases. However, after an investigating magistrate
 has determined that the case should be brought to trial and has
 issued a warrant to that effect, there is no limitation on how
 long the detainee may be held in "preventive detention" pending
 trial. Accused persons awaiting trial constitute the majority
 of persons in the prisons at Yaounde and Douala. Release on
 bail is infrequent.
 Persons may be held in administrative detention under
 legislation pertaining to subversion. Such detention by
 regional authorities is initially for 1 month, renewable twice,
 and may be extended up to an additional 6 months by the
 Minister of Territorial Administration. Generally, those
 arrested and placed in administrative detention do not
 disappear--their families are told where they are and they are
 eventually released, although the detention may be lengthy.
 Political detainees, 10 to 20 of whom are currently estimated
 to be in custody, are usually held under this type of
 detention. Under the state of emergency which exists in
 portions of three provinces, authorities may also order
 detention for up to 1 week for persons judged "dangerous to
 public security." The Minister of Territorial Administration
 may also order detention of such persons for up to 2 months;
 the order is renewable without limitation. The state of
 emergency provisions were used rarely, if at all, in 1986.
 Fon Gorji Dinka, a radical Anglophone spokesman detained in
 June 1985, was released without trial in January 1986.
 Fourteen members and activists of the UPC, who were arrested in
 December 1985, were released in August. Their release was
 given wide publicity as an example of the increasing
 liberalization of the political system under President Biya.
 An unknown number of UPC members remain in self-imposed exile.
 Another outlawed dissident party, the Cameroon Democratic Party
 (CDP), has had members in self-imposed exile since the party
 lost its bid to be legalized in 1984. President Biya in 1985
 issued a call for all Cameroonians to return to Cameroon
 without fear.
 
 
 CAMEROON
 Local police sometimes harass citizens and threaten to detain
 them unless bribes are paid. These actions are not condoned by
 high government officials and have been sharply criticized by
 the President. In mid-1986 the national campaign to eradicate
 corruption specifically cited the police as needing reform. In
 August the Secretary of State for Internal Security stressed to
 new graduates of the police academy that discipline'and moral
 vigor were necessary for an effective police force.
 There are no reports of forced labor being practiced in
 Cameroon.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trial by a presiding magistrate is guaranteed by law, and this
 practice is followed with the exception of persons held under
 administrative detention. Public trials are also guaranteed by
 law, although exceptions are allowed for the public good or
 national security reasons. Trials which involve prominent
 persons or which are controversial are sometimes held in
 private. Magistrates in Cameroon are drawn from a corps of
 career civil servants and are required to have law degrees.
 Their decisions are generally not subject to government
 interference, and they are usually considered to conduct fair
 trials. Defendants in felony cases are provided attorneys if
 they cannot afford to engage their own.
 Crimes involving subversion or illegal use of weapons, as well
 as crimes involving the military, are tried by military
 tribunal. Each tribunal has three members, and its presiding
 officer must be a magistrate. In some cases, the magistrate is
 a civilian, but often it is a military officer. As in civil
 cases, defendants are entitled to either public or private
 counsel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence
 are violations of Cameroonian law. There are reports that
 police do enter homes without warrants during periodic searches
 for criminals in low income neighborhoods. Surveillance of
 suspected political dissidents, including monitoring of mail
 and of telephone conversations, is also common.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution of 1972 guarantees the freedom of expression
 and press, but under Cameroonian law and practice these
 freedoms are restricted. No written ground rules exist, and
 the private press must submit each issue to see what is deemed
 acceptable and what is not. There is no evidence that anyone
 is punished for privately criticizing the Government, and
 freedom of political discussion exists to a degree that was
 unknown during the Ahidjo era. During 1986 controls on the
 private press continued to loosen, but they remain extensive
 and subject to government interpretation. The private press
 has flourished with close to 20 newspapers publishing on a
 regular schedule. Several new papers have increased the depth
 of their reporting and criticism of Government programs but
 still have difficulties with censorship. One issue of Le
 Messager, one of the most respected of the private newspapers,
 was not distributed after the censor asked for the removal of
 
 
 43
 CAMEROON
 8 pages of the 16-page issue. In February 1986, two Cameroon
 Times journalists were arrested at the Cameroon/Nigeria border
 on charges of carrying subversive materials and currency
 violations. An anniversary edition of the Times, which they
 were taking to Nigeria to be printed, reportedly contained an
 article commenting on Anglophone protests. The two were
 released without charge or trial in March.
 There has also been increased editorial comment in the
 government-controlled press and radio, although the Government
 affords official journalists much less latitude than it does
 their private counterparts. Most official journalists are
 civil servants and can be transferred to less desirable jobs if
 they do not censor their own reporting. After making
 derogatory remarks about some parliamentarians on the air,
 three Anglophone radio jouinalists were detained without charge
 in June and released 4 months later without trial. One of the
 journalists was subsequently charged with "contempt of civil
 authorities," a criminal offense.
 Cameroonian television has been on the air since December 1985,
 and though the television journalists seem to have more leeway
 to tackle sensitive social issues, they, like their print and
 radio counterparts, practice self-censorship on controversial
 political issues.
 Occasionally, issues of international publications are seized
 because they contain articles about Cameroon which the
 Government considers inflammatory or defamatory.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedoms of assembly and association, while guaranteed in
 the Constitution, are restricted in practice and in law. The
 Cameroonian penal code prohibits public meetings,
 demonstrations, or processions without prior government
 approval, and organizations must register with the Government.
 The sole labor union, the Organization of Cameroonian Workers
 Union (OCWU), operates within the framework of the official
 party, and top union leadership is chosen by the Government.
 However, in October 1986, the OCWU voted to adhere to the
 principles of democratization espoused by the party, and local
 and divisional union leaders will now be chosen by open
 election. The union does not play a major role in Cameroonian
 politics, although it has a membership of approximately 450,000
 workers in a working population of more than 3 million. It
 pursues individual worker grievances and seeks improvements in
 government programs for worker safety and training.
 The union participates in government-regulated labor
 negotiations, but strikes are illegal. Political activity by
 the trade union, excepting action designed to protect economic
 and other interests, is prohibited. Contact with foreign trade
 union organizations requires government authorization.
 Cameroon is a member of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO), and rank and file union members comprise the labor
 component of the Cameroonian delegation to its meetings. The
 union is also a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and is
 generally respected. Roughly 20 percent of Cameroonians are
 
 
 44
 CAMEROON
 Muslim, 30 percent Christian, and the rest animist. Officials
 of the Government and party are drawn from members of all
 denominations. Missionaries played a major role in the
 development of Cameroon and continue to be active. However,
 the Jehovah's Witnesses, who do not acknowledge the supremacy
 of the state, were banned in 1970 and have periodically been
 targets of harassment since then. Observance of traditional
 religions is not discouraged by the Government, although acts
 of witchcraft, magic, or divination "liable to disrupt public
 order or tranquility, or to harm persons or property" are
 outlawed with penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment.
 Independent Muslim and Christian publications exist in
 Cameroon, and there is no evidence that they are censored more
 heavily than the secular press. The exception, again, is the
 Jehovah's Witnesses, who are not allowed to publish or
 distribute their religious materials.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by
 law. In practice, however, police frequently stop travelers to
 check identification documents. During 1986 this practice
 lessened and a number of "controls" on heavily traveled roads
 were discontinued. Exit visas are required to leave the
 country and sometimes are obtainable only after long
 bureaucratic delays. In some cases, these delays may represent
 attempts by the Government to discourage or even prevent
 departure. The Government has also been known to refuse
 issuance of a passport, or to confiscate an already issued
 passport, in order to prevent someone from traveling abroad.
 Cameroonians who leave the country must deposit sums sufficient
 to buy a return air ticket for repatriation should they become
 stranded abroad. There are no restrictions on voluntary
 repatriation. Women must obtain the permission of their
 husbands or fathers to leave the country.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safehaven for
 thousands of externally displaced persons and refugees. The
 Government currently acknowledges the presence of approximately'
 45,000 Chadians in Cameroon, some 9,000 of whom are registered
 as political refugees through the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and are living at the UNHCR
 camp at Poli. The rest of the Chadians have integrated into
 the Cameroonian economy and do not receive government or
 international assistance. Cameroon is also host to refugees
 from South Africa, Zaire, Angola, and other African nations,
 and there are roughly 100 Namibians in Cameroon as students.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cameroon continues to be a one-party state with political power
 and administrative responsibility concentrated in the
 presidency. Following the resignation of former President
 Ahidjo on November 4, 1982, his constitutional successor, Prime
 Minister Paul Biya, took office as President. In September
 1983, Biya was elected President of the party, following
 Ahidjo's resignation. President Biya subsequently withstood a
 coup attempt from forces allegedly close to Ahidjo. While the
 Constitution implies the legality of other political parties,
 in fact, only one party, the CPDM, is permitted. On June 26,
 1986, the Cameroon Supreme Court ruled against the latest
 attempt by Dr. Joseph Sende to gain legal recognition for the
 
 
 45
 CAMEROON
 UPC. This was the second time under the Biya Government that
 the Supreme Court heard but rejected Sende's case. Once again,
 the refusal was on technical grounds. Although the election
 law theoretically permits multiple candidates for the
 presidency, President Biya ran unopposed in the January 1984
 elections and received 99.98 percent of the votes. The
 President appoints all governors, prefects, and cabinet
 ministers.
 Cameroon's political system is a product of the country's
 ethnic and linguistic diversity, which includes some 230
 languages and three separate European heritages (French,
 British and German). Both French and English are official
 languages, although some Anglophones allege political
 discrimination by the majority Francophones. A careful
 balancing act, within the one party, is required to maintain
 political cohesion. Membership in the CPDM is open to all
 religious and ethnic groups. While the Party remains
 essentially a centrally controlled organization, open elections
 with multiple candidates for local and more senior offices were
 held for the first time in 1986. The CPDM Congress in March
 1985 formally adopted a program of democratization within the
 party, and this first experiment with elections met with
 widespread popular approval. The National Assembly will hold
 elections in 1988, and President Biya has promised that they
 too will be open for the first time.
 Externally based dissident groups, including the Union des
 Populations du Cameroun (Francophone) and the Cameroon
 Democratic Party (Anglophone), periodically send letters or
 pamphlets into the country. The Government attempts to seize
 these documents when they arrive.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Cameroon Constitution affirms support for the freedoms
 guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
 United Nations Charter. Under President Biya, the Government
 has given increased attention to human rights issues, both
 internally as a part of President Biya's program of
 "democratization" and in public statements in forums such as
 the United Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all
 Cameroonian citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis. Female
 students are noticeably underrepresented in rural secondary
 schools and school attendance rates are one third the national
 average in the Muslim north, where only 22 percent of the
 children attend school. Girls are underprivileged, both in
 access to higher education and in terms of professional
 opportunities. Girls from the southern part of the country,
 although disadvantaged at the level of secondary entrance when
 compared with boys from the same areas, have a considerable
 educational lead over both girls and boys from the eastern and
 northern provinces.
 Women enjoy equal rights under the Constitution and are
 politically active in the party and the sole labor union. The
 women's wing of the party has developed programs aimed at
 encouraging the economic and social productivity of Cameroonian
 
 
 46
 CAMEROON
 women. Women are represented in the modern sector, although
 not proportionately in the upper levels of administration and
 in the professions. There are currently five women in
 President Biya's Cabinet, but no women governors or prefects.
 As a result of the 1983 legislative elections, the percentage
 of women in the National Assembly increased from 10 to 14
 percent.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Cameroonian national labor code sets the minimum working
 age at 14, the minimum annual paid vacation at 18 days, and the
 legal workweek at 40 hours for nonagricultural employees and up
 to 48 hours per week for agricultural workers. Minimum monthly
 wages are set by the Government for all types of jobs in both
 the public and private sectors. Wage rates are based on
 geographic zones, types of industry, and qualifications of
 workers and length of service. The lowest pay levels are not
 sufficient to support a family but, in most cases, such wages
 are supplemented by a second job or another family member's
 earnings. Workers with middle-range wages are also likely to
 need second incomes to support a family, especially in Yaounde
 and Douala. Because of Cameroon's healthy economy,
 opportunities do exist for workers to supplement their wage
 levels with second jobs. Occupational health-and safety is
 mandated by law, based on ILO standards. In theory, these
 standards are enforced by Ministry of Labor inspectors, but
 they lack the means for effective enforcement.
