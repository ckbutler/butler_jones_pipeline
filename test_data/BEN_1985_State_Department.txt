 BENIN
 Following independence from France in 1960, Benin experienced
 considerable political instability and numerous changes in
 government until 1972, when the army staged a decisive coup
 that brought the present Government, headed by President
 Mathieu Kerekou, to power. In 1974, the new leadership
 declared the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist Government
 under the direction of a single political party, the People's
 Revolutionary Party of Benin. Despite the imitation of
 certain political structures, Benin's Marxism thus far bears
 little resemblance to that of the U.S.S.R. The party itself
 is directed by a small leadership group in which the influence
 of the military remains important. It controls the selection
 of candidates for the National Assembly and local government
 bodies.
 Early efforts at radical political and social transformation
 in the mid-1970's encountered widespread resistance and
 resulted in significant erosions of political and personal
 liberties. An unsuccessful coup attempt in 1977 was followed
 by a period of intense suspiciousness toward foreigners and
 domestic critics. In recent years, however, the authorities
 have exhibited greater tolerance of divergent social and
 political views. In August 1984, the Government amnestied all
 political detainees with the exception of those implicated in
 the 1977 coup attempt.
 Benin is one of the world's poorest countries; its
 underdeveloped economy is largely supported by subsistence
 agriculture (80 percent of the population lives in rural
 areas), a small commercial sector and recently oil production,
 located offshore near Cotonou. Economic activity has been
 hampered by the Government's efforts to institute centralized
 controls. In 1985, mounting balance-of-payments problems and
 rising debt service costs led the Government to enter into
 negotiations with the International Monetary Fund to reduce
 the number of state enterprises and to encourage foreign
 private investment.
 The human rights situation did not improve in 1985. The
 Government viewed developments in early 1985, in particular
 activism by students at the National University, as
 threatening to political stability and public order. It
 responded with a series of extraordinary security measures,
 including closing the National University and expelling of 18
 students for subversive activities. According to some
 reports, clashes between demonstrators and police in May
 resulted in the deaths of two youths and one security
 officer. The student unrest reflected in part dissatisfaction
 with government austerity measures intended to address the
 country's worsening economic and financial difficulties.
 Suspicion that outside elements may have been behind the
 strike also led the Government to reissue regulations
 governing access by Beninese citizens to foreign diplomatic
 missions. The implementation of these and other security
 measures occasioned numerous allegations of human rights
 violations.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been several reports alleging that students and
 others arrested in the wake of the student demonstrations in
 April and May were subjected to cruel or unusual punishment.
 Information from several sources suggests strongly that one
 student died as a result of injuries suffered during
 interrogation by security personnel. It does not appear,
 however, that these or other reported excesses were ordered by
 the political authorities. Prison conditions in Benin are
 very poor; sanitation facilities are inadequate; there is
 overcrowding; and the prison food supply is inadequate unless
 supplemented by friends or relatives. Physical punishment
 reportedly occurs. There is no evidence of discrimination
 against prisoners on the basis of sex, religion, or national
 origin.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Benin's legal system provides for the review of detentions by
 a court of law in all but a few sensitive political cases.
 The Constitution states that no citizen may be arrested
 without an order of arrest by an established judicial body.
 In practice, however, persons have been detained, some for
 extended periods, without recourse to legal assistance or
 judicial hearing. Most of these arrests have occurred during
 periods of political tension. Periods of incarceration are at
 the discretion of the authorities. Although arrests are not
 publicized, no special attempt is made to keep them secret.
 A large number of arrests were made in the wake of the 1985
 student strike as a result of the Government's tightened
 security measures. Most of these were for minor infractions,
 such as the inability to produce required identity papers. A
 number of persons were arrested for failing to heed a newly
 revived order requiring all Beninese to obtain prior
 government authorization before seeking entry to foreign
 diplomatic missions. In most cases, people arrested under
 these measures were detained only briefly. In contrast, an
 estimated 30 to 40 persons, suspected of complicity in the
 student strike, including some teachers and university
 professors as well as students, were detained for periods of
 up to 3 months, apparently without specified charges having
 been brought against them. Reportedly, most of these
 detainees have since been released, except for three
 self-proclaimed leaders of the student strike, but this has
 not been confirmed.
 There were several other reports in 1985 alleging the denial
 of prompt trials, including two publicized cases of top
 
 
 15
 BENIN
 officials of state enterprises for possible corruption. Both
 had been released by the end of 1985. In such cases, the
 courts are normally denied a role pending dispositions taken
 by the political leadership. There were reports in December
 1985 that the Government had also detained a number of persons
 allegedly associated with a radical leftist group.
 There were no reports in 1985 alleging the use of forced
 labor, which is prohibited under Beninese law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Benin's judicial system is allowed to function independently
 in all but sensitive political cases. In such instances,
 detainees may or may not be permitted legal counsel or granted
 a public hearing. There is no time limit with respect to
 charging a defendant or on bringing the accused to trial. In
 recent years, the Government has used only the established
 civilian "revolutionary court" system. Courts are organized
 on provincial and national levels, and there are future plans
 for the courts at the district level once sufficient judges
 have been trained. The highest court of appeal is the Central
 People's Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although Benin's Constitution provides for safeguarding the
 inviolability of thehome and calls for warrants to be
 obtained from a judge before the police can enter a residence,
 there have been occasional unconfirmed reports of forced
 entries in sensitive political cases. Other reports indicate
 that security police monitor telephones and the mail of
 suspected persons. There are no other known types of
 interference with the home or family.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With two exceptions, the local press, radio, and television
 are all government-owned and operated. The exceptions are a
 weekly-paper published by the Catholic church and Echo, a
 monthly journal of opinion circulated throughout West Africa.
 While both treat political issues, they do so with
 circumspection. The official media carry only those stories
 that are approved by, or serve the interests of, the
 party-state. Opposition to government policies and open
 criticism of the Government are not tolerated. Academic
 freedom on nonpolitical issues, however, is permitted, and
 there normally is no censorship of foreign books and artistic
 works. One exception in 1985 involved an attempt to prohibit
 distribution of a European journal which carried a report
 critical of the Government's detention of a former Beninese
 bank official. Foreign radio broadcasts are readily available
 to much of the population through shortwave radio. No attempt
 is made to interfere with radio reception.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All meetings of a political nature must be sponsored by the
 single political party. Although organized public opposition
 to the Government itself is not permitted, there are numerous
 examples of groups which have organized to protest specific
 
 
 16
 BENIN
 government policies or actions. In recent years, the
 Government has welcomed the formation of a wide variety of
 private social, service, and professional organizations
 (including Lions and Rotary), many of which maintain active
 international affiliations. There is no known persecution of
 professional groups.
 Labor unions are organs of the party and unified under a
 general labor organization, the Union Nationale des Syndicats
 des Travailleurs du Benin (UNSTB). Although controlled by the
 Government, individual local unions negotiate with individual
 employers on labor matters and represent workers' grievances
 to employers and to the Government. The Government often
 plays the role of arbiter.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly denied, it is
 clear that labor strikes are not sanctioned. The Constitution
 of 1977 states that "union activities are guaranteed to
 workers" but "must be used for the elevation of the conscience
 of the proletarian class and for the augmentation and
 continued development of production.'t When labor actions
 occasionally occur in Benin (usually by students rather than
 workers), they take the form of brief work stoppages to
 protest such things as late salary or scholarship payments.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions all coexist in
 Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer any
 special status or benefit. With the exception of one group,
 Celestial Christianity, which has been declared illegal by the
 Government, there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies
 or teachings, and religious conversion is freely permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is not restricted. International movement
 is controlled in that a passport and exit permission must be
 obtained for travel to other than West African countries but
 obtaining them is not difficult. Economic rather than
 governmental constraints usually preclude travel outside the
 region. There are no restrictions placed on residence within
 Benin, except for recently released prisoners who may be
 subject to travel restrictions.
 Emigration is a way of life in Benin. Many Beninese move to
 neighboring countries to earn their livelihood, and their
 citizenship is not revoked. Beninese who live abroad are
 encouraged to return home to help develop their country, but
 only a small number have returned. In 1985, there were many
 more refugees in Benin than usual. Almost 100,000 Ghanaians
 from Nigeria transited Benin and were given limited assistance
 by the Beninese Government. About 200 Chadian refugees, who
 came to Benin during the past several years, are now more or
 less permanently settled, although they are still free to
 return to Chad according to Beninese law.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Leadership is exercised by President Kerekou and a small group
 of senior officials, many of whom also hold positions in
 government. The electoral process allows for citizen
 
 
 17
 BENIN
 participation in the nomination of candidates for the National
 Revolutionary Assembly, in theory the principal decisionmaking
 body of the Government. Party membership is not a requisite
 for participation in this process or for high office or civil
 service employment. The final selection of candidates for the
 single national slate, however, is made by the party
 leadership. No opposition parties or slates are permitted.
 The Assembly itself rarely takes issue with policies
 formulated by the political leadership.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers any outside attempt to investigate
 human rights practices an interference in its internal
 affairs. Amnesty International's 1985 report (covering 1984)
 cited the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience and other
 political prisoners detained without trial, unfair trial
 practices, and ill-treatment of prisoners as its major
 concerns. All of the prisoners whose cases were taken up by
 Amnesty International were released on August 1, 1984 in a
 presidential amnesty. The Government occasionally denounces
 alleged human rights abuses in other areas of the world, e.g.,
 Grenada. Freedom House rates Benin "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Benin's 4,015,000 population is growing at the rate of 3.1
 percent annually. Over 80 percent of the population is
 engaged in subsistence agriculture. The estimated annual per
 capita income was only $290 in 1983. Although in 1979 an
 estimated 65 percent of the population was below the absolute
 poverty level, these statistics are unreliable since much of
 the country's income derives from informal trade with
 neighboring countries which is not reported and is not
 reflected in official government figures.
 Benin has made a major effort to address health and education
 problems. There is free or nominally priced medical care in
 Benin, and a system of old-age benefits has been established.
 Clinics have been set up throughout the country, many with
 assistance from foreign governments. In 1985, life expectancy
 at birth was estimated at 49 years, and the infant mortality
 rate was 143 per 1,000 live births. Twenty percent of the
 total population had access to safe water in 1980, with 26
 percent in urban areas and 16 percent in rural areas. A 1977
 estimate showed calorie supply as a percentage of requirements
 at 92 percent.
 An active literacy program is in operation in Benin. In 1980,
 it was estimated that 28 percent of the adult population were
 literate, 40 percent of all males and 17 percent of all
 females. In 1982, primary school enrollment was estimated at
 68 percent of the primary school-aged population: 95 percent
 of all boys and 43 percent of all girls.
 The Government has given vigorous support to policies designed
 to improve the conditions of average workers in both the
 industrial and agricultural sectors. It has, for example,
 committed itself to the gradual extension of free or low-cost
 medical care and social services; legislated minimum wage
 levels and occupational safety conditions; and established
 procedures and mechanisms for the protection of worker rights,
 
 
 18
 BENIN
 including legislation prohibiting child labor. The Beninese
 labor code implicitly defines a "minimum age" by authorizing
 participation in the social security system beginning at age
 14, and the civil service administration will not hire persons
 under 18. In many instances, however, the Government's
 ability to enforce these policies and regulations is limited
 by a lack of administrative and financial resources and by the
 need for the entire family to farm subsistence plots of land.
 Historically, Beninese women have played a major role in the
 commercial sector. While there are no women-in ministerial
 positions, a number of women figure prominently in executive-
 level positions in the presidency and the various ministries.
 There are only two women on the central committee of the party.
