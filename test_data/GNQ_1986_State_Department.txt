 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is a former Spanish colony in central Africa
 composed of a continental province (Rio Muni) and the island
 provinces (Bioko and Annobon). It has a population of
 300,000. The capital, Malabo, is on Bioko. The current
 regime, under President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, took power as a
 military government in the 1979 coup which overthrew President
 Macias and ended his 11-year state-sanctioned policy of
 terror. A national Constitution was adopted in 1982, national
 and local assemblies chosen, and the military government
 declared itself a civilian government. During 1986 the
 Government enacted a law mandating the creation of a single
 political party. Only party members may hold public office,
 and the party controls the selection of all candidates.
 The economy based on cocoa, lumber, and coffee was devastated
 by the Macias years and the death or exodus of thousands of
 trained and educated citizens. The economy remains extremely
 fragile, despite substantial foreign aid and attempts at
 reform, which include entrance into the West African Franc
 Zone, debt rescheduling, and efforts to attract much needed
 foreign investment, especially from France. Annual per capita
 income is only $100-$200.
 The human rights situation deteriorated in 1986 amid reports of
 citizen harassment by poorly paid police, of discrimination
 against minority groups and migrant workers, of the use of
 forced labor, and of the suppression of several religious
 groups. The Government arrested and detained over 100 persons
 following a coup attempt in July, and subsequently it tried 15
 persons under the jurisdiction of a military tribunal in
 circumstances which raised doubts whether the trial met
 accepted international standards. There were allegations, yet
 unconfirmed, that some coup detainees were held incommunicado.
 There were three confirmed cases of torture.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported incidents of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were three confirmed cases of torture by police after the
 attempted coup in July. In at least one case, the prisoner,
 later absolved of complicity in the coup, suffered severe
 injury to his arms and ankles.
 Police methods are harsh and often include beatings of
 prisoners either to extract information or to punish offenders
 for, insolence or disrespect. The Government appears little
 inclined to curb such abuses. Arbitrary police beatings of
 politically powerless people, such as expatriate Nigerian and
 Cameroonian workers and members of Bubi and certain other
 indigenous tribes, continued in 1986.

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Mistreatment of prisoners is officially condemned but in fact
 is tolerated. Prisoners are dependent on their families for
 food. Prison conditions are unhealthy. As some cells contain
 a toilet and nothing else, prisoners are often forced to sleep
 and sit on the floor. Occasionally, prisoners are not even
 permitted exercise. Others are taken out to work on private
 plantations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite constitutional provisions, there is no enforcement of
 the right of a person in detention to be charged or released
 within a certain period of time, to have access to a lawyer, or
 to be freed on bail. Arbitrary arrests by security forces or
 police are commonplace, usually on trumped up charges to extort
 money. There were also incidents of house arrests of Jehovah's
 Witnesses during 1986, with no charges being filed and no
 reasons given for the arrests.
 There were no known instances of any person being exiled in
 1986. The Government continued to round up so-called vagrants,
 illegal aliens, and ordinary citizens and put them to work.
 These roundups are a means of obtaining free labor and are
 often linked to preparation for important national days, the
 arrival of visiting dignitaries, and seasonal needs on the
 plantations of important government officials. There were
 reports that members of the Jehovah's Witnesses sect were
 forced by government officials to do manual labor for several
 weeks although they were never charged with nor convicted of
 any offense.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The exact number of political prisoners is unknown but is
 believed to be small. The Government does not admit to holding
 any political prisoners. There continues to be no information
 available on the fate of 26 persons tried on charges stemming
 from a coup attempt in 1983. According to Amnesty
 International, the 26 defendants did not receive fair trials.
 The Government reports that the majority of the accused
 received sentences varying from 5 to 10 years.
 The Ministry of Justice has made little progress in
 establishing a fully functional legal system, and the executive
 branch has been able to act without any fear of judicial
 interference. The Supreme Court justices serve at the pleasure
 of the President, who replaced all but one justice early in
 1986. Of 12 Supreme Court positions, only 4 have ever been
 filled at the same time. The tribunal provided for in the
 Constitution to decide constitutional issues has never been
 established.
 The current court system, which often uses local customary law,
 is a combination of traditional, civil, and military justice,
 and operates in an ad hoc manner for lack of established
 procedures and experienced judicial personnel. Equatorial
 Guinea's estimated 15 lawyers work for the Government and
 consequently are unable to challenge government actions
 effectively.
 It is not known how frequently people are denied trials since
 many detainees deal directly with the arresting authorities and
 resort to bribes to gain their freedom. Most trials are

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 brief. In cases of petty theft or civil disputes, all parties
 are brought before a judge for trial. In civil and criminal
 cases, the judge often levies a fine in lieu of imprisonment.
 In cases involving senior officials, exclusion from public
 office and confinement to traditional villages are common means
 of punishment.
 The major court case of 1986 was the public 2-day trial of 15
 individuals accused of plotting the overthrow of the
 Government. The case was tried by a military tribunal instead
 of a civilian court, and the proceedings were broadcast on
 state radio and television. The defendants were represented by
 government-employed counsel. The military tribunal sentenced 1
 defendant to death, 4 to long prison terms (18-20 years), 6 to
 terms of 2 years, and 4 were stripped of government positions
 and set free. The single death sentence was carried out on the
 day of the verdict.
 The actual charges against the defendants ranged from violating
 three sections of the Constitution to violating a particular
 section of the Military Penal Code. The constitutional
 provisions speak generally of citizens' obligations and are not
 criminal statutes. In addition, it was not clear how the
 military penal code applied to the civilian defendants. The
 speed of the judicial process, the questionable legal basis of
 the charges brought, the doubtful jurisdiction of a military
 tribunal, the lack of independent counsel, and the absence of
 appeal procedures raised serious questions whether the
 defendants received due process.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, but
 not with correspondence. There is a general suspicion that
 telephone conversations are routinely monitored. Search
 warrants are not usually used, even though they are provided
 for in the Constitution. There is no forced resettlement of
 population, and no interference with the right to marry or have
 children.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Open criticism of the Government is not permitted. The making
 of statements critical of the President and of the state of the
 economy were among the charges brought against four senior
 government defendants in the July 1986 coup attempt trial.
 What media exist in Equatorial Guinea are government owned and
 operated. The single newspaper is in fact a government
 bulletin. The officially controlled media do not criticize the
 Government. The radio and television stations transmit
 official government notices and imported entertainment, sports,
 and religious programs. There are no prohibitions on receiving
 foreign publications or periodicals, but for economic reasons
 there are no such publications for sale anywhere in the
 country. It is doubtful that the Government would permit the
 sale or distribution of publications openly critical of its
 conduct. School libraries require government permission to add
 even donated books to their libraries.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Citizens are not free to associate publicly with others to
 discuss political or economic matters, notwithstanding
 constitutional guarantees to the contrary. The Government does
 not permit opposition organizations. Political rallies or
 unsanctioned assemblies are not tolerated. Private
 nonpolitical groups, such as professional organizations and
 sports groups, are generally licensed by the Government.
 There are no labor unions, and there have been no attempts to
 organize workers. It is widely recognized that the Government
 would not permit a union to organize, especially in the cocoa,
 lumber, and coffee sectors which constitute the main economic
 resources, or even among government workers. There is no
 significant industry in Equatorial Guinea.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Until late in 1985, there had been complete freedom of
 religion. In December 1985, the Jehovah's Witnesses and
 several small Pentecostal groups were banned, and their
 churches and meeting houses closed without explanation. In
 1986 some of their members were subject to house arrest,
 harassed and, according to some reports, forced to do manual
 labor despite neither having been convicted nor charged with
 any crime. Missionaries of several faiths are still active and
 have government permission for their activities, including
 proselytizing.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the, Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no explicit restrictions on travel within the
 country, but anyone found without a job in any part of the
 country except his own town or village is subject to a period
 of forced labor and obligatory return to his place of origin.
 Exit visas are required for travel abroad. There were no
 reports of any new Guinean refugees in 1986, but a large number
 of refugees from the former regime continue to reside in Spain,
 France, Cameroon, and Gabon. Many of them voice fears of
 repression from the current Government if they return.
 However, the poor state of the economy is probably the main
 reason many remain abroad. The Government has repeatedly
 proclaimed that returnees need not fear persecution but can
 engage in political activities only within the
 government-sanctioned system.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have only a hypothetical right to change their
 government by democratic means. President Obiang took power in
 1979 in a military coup that toppled the Macias regime, and he
 used the 1982 plebiscite, which involved only approval or
 disapproval of the Constitution, to declared himself
 President. He will face reelection in 1989 under the present
 7-year term established by the Constitution.
 Under the Constitution, a partially elected, partially
 appointed National Assembly was chosen. While the Assembly
 includes members of minority groups, and the Assembly is
 theoretically the legislative branch of government, it is
 
 
 100
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 powerless to take any action not sanctioned by the President or
 his Council of Ministers, members of which can be appointed and
 dismissed by the President. The President has the power to
 suspend virtually all rights guaranteed by the Constitution
 when a threat to national security or national emergency
 exists, and the President himself decides when such a threat or
 national emergency exists.
 In 1986 the Government enacted a law providing for a single
 political party, but at the end of the year there had been no
 action to organize such a party.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has denounced and, in relative terms, has
 reversed the savagery of the previous regime. It is willing to
 discuss human rights issues with international organizations.
 A U.N. human rights team visited Equatorial Guinea in January
 1986, but their report has not yet been released. There are no
 human rights groups in Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law states that both sexes and all tribal groups are equal
 and entitled to the same rights and privileges. The Fang tribe
 comprises more than 70 percent of the population and dominates
 life in Equatorial Guinea, including in the allocation of top
 government positions. The Bubi tribe comprises a small
 percentage of the population but has historically been the
 majority on the island of Bioko, where the capital is located.
 Despite National Assembly elections in 1983 which returned a
 proportionate number of Bubi delegates, they have little
 effective political voice in government. Other tribal groups,
 such as Playeros, Fernandinos, and even less-favored Fang
 subgroups are similarly discriminated against in opportunities
 for economic and social advancement.
 For a variety of reasons, some historical and cultural, and
 others economic, women are accorded a lower status than men and
 have a correspondingly lower status and influence in the
 society and government. Social tradition, and the fact that
 women produce most of the basic staple food items, keep most
 women engaged in agricultural or domestic work. Many times
 more males than females enter secondary school and a higher
 proportion of the graduates are male. Women play only a minor
 role in politics. The three highest positions held by women
 are a mayorship and the positions of Vice Minister of Labor and
 Vice Minister of Health.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Most salaried employment is with the Government. Salaries,
 when paid, are insufficient for ensuring a decent living, and
 many thus must take second jobs. Equatorial Guinea has a
 statutory minimum wage of roughly $34 monthly. Government
 working conditions are well within a maximum 48 hour workweek,
 with a full rest day and holidays. There is no effective
 monitoring of work hours and labor conditions outside of the
 Government. Minimum age for employment is 16, but there is no
 enforcement of this law outside the cities, and children of
 various ages work as necessary to help support their families.
