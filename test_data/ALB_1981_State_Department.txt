 ALBANIA
 Albania is an isolated Balkan nation of about 2.6
 million people. It is governed by a communist
 dictatorship which seized power at the close of World
 War II and has ruled without interruption since then.
 The ruling Albanian Workers' Party and the government
 maintain rigid controls over the Albanian people and
 severely restrict the exercise of political and civil
 rights. There have been reports, corroborated by
 private international organizations, of serious,
 continuing human rights violations in Albania.
 Albania has not ratified the UN covenants on human
 rights, nor has it signed the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
 The United States does not have diplomatic relations
 with Albania, nor has it had official representatives
 in that country since 1946. This fact makes it
 difficult for the U.S. Government to comment
 authoritatively on conditions in Albania.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom froms
 a. Torture
 There are reports from private international groups of
 torture in Albania, specifically of persons accused of
 anti-state or religious activities.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Private international organizations report that
 persons are imprisoned for "anti-state activity,"
 "dissemination of religious propaganda," and
 "opposition to the state's anti-religious campaign."
 There are also reports of summary executions. Amnesty
 International has received reports of prisoners being
 held in solitary confinement during pre-trial
 investigation for up to six months. Under the present
 penal code, Albanian courts may impose the death
 penalty for a number of political offenses, including
 agitation and propaganda against the state (article
 55); incitement of hatred or quarrels between
 nationalities and races (article 56)1 creation of a
 counter-revolutionary organization or participation
 therein (article 57), activity against the
 revolutionary movement of the working class (article
 60); and refusal to carry out a duty and coercing
 others to refuse (article 144).
 c. Disappearances
 Available information on disappearances is
 insufficient for useful comment.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Available information on the practice of arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment in Albania is insufficient for
 useful comment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Albanian judiciary includes a supreme court and
 regional and district courts. While it is clear that
 the ruling party controls the administration of
 justice, virtually no further information concerning
 judicial practices is available.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Information on the extent to which the Albanian
 authorities respect the constitutionally-guaranteed
 inviolability of the home is not available.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Albanian Workers Party maintains rigid control
 over the Albanian people, severely restricting the
 exercise of individual political and civil liberties.
 The Albanian constitution states that citizens "enjoy
 freedom of speech, press, organization, association,
 assembly, and public manifestation." It prohibits
 discrimination, makes special mention of equal rights
 for women, and proclaims the inviolability of the
 home. It also provides, however, that "the rights of
 citizens are indivisible from the fulfillment of their
 duties and cannot be exercised in opposition to the
 socialist order." From the information available, the
 government respects few if any of these constitutional
 rights. For those who deviate from party or
 government-established norms of behavior, reprisals
 appear to be swift and severe.
 Foreign and domestic news is rigidly controlled.
 .Persons found listening to foreign radio broadcasts or
 exhibiting "alien manifestations" are reportedly
 reprimanded and punished. Albanian citizens receive
 mail from other countries on an extremely limited
 basis.
 The Albanian Worker's Party controls the government.
 No other parties are permitted to exist.
 Religious activity is expressly prohibited by the
 Albanian constitution and by government policy. In
 1967 the government abrogated all laws dealing with
 church-state relations and began a campaign to
 eliminate all vestiges of religion. More than 2,000
 mosques, churches, monasteries, and other religious
 institutions were closed; all religious literature was
 banned; and a number of church leaders were imprisoned
 or executed. The regime continues to suppress
 religious activity by imposing harsh penalties on
 persons who engage in religious practices, by
 conducting an educational campaign against religion,
 and by obliging citizens to expose believers. In
 spite of these pressures, some Albanians reportedly
 continue to practice religion secretly in the privacy
 of their homes.

 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Movement within the country and travel abroad is
 rigidly controlled. Transgressors may be punished
 severely. Under article 47K of the penal code,
 "flight from the state and refusal to return to the
 fatherland on the part of a person sent on service or
 allowed to leave the state is punishable by
 imprisonment for not less than 10 years or by death."
 Under these conditions, very few persons manage to
 leave Albania each year.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The constitution provides for the exercise of state
 power and the direction and control of all other state
 organs by the people's assembly and by people's
 councils. The members of these bodies are selected by
 the party and then "elected" by universal suffrage.
 Article 42 of the constitution states that national
 minorities are "guaranteed protection and development
 of their culture and popular traditions, the use of
 their mother tongue and its teaching in the schools,
 and equal development in all fields of social life."
 Information on the treatment of ethnic minority
 members in Albania is generally unavailable.
 Women have the right to vote, but there are few women
 in positions of leadership in the party or state
 organizations.
 3. Government'Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Albanian Government has refused to cooperate in
 any investigation of alleggd human rights violations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Albania is a poor country with limited natural
 resources and the smallest amount of arable land per
 capita in Europe. Per capita GNP is estimated to be
 about $500, but accurate economic data are not
 available. No evidence has been received of chronic
 food shortages or rationing. Rents on residential
 housing appear to be low, but there are reportedly
 housing shortages, especially for newly-married
 couples.
 Albania has taken steps toward industrial development,
 but its economy is grounded in agriculture and the
 production of raw materials. All land belongs to the
 state, and individual citizens are permitted to own
 only limited amounts of personal property.
 Albania is a party to the International Convention on
 the Political Rights of Women and to the Convention on
 the Nationality of Married Women. The Albanian
 constitution asserts that women enjoy equal rights
 with men in work, pay, recreation, social security,
 education, socio-political activity, and in the
 family. Information on the extent to which these
 asserted rights are protected in day-to-day life is
 generally not available. However, there do appear to
 have been advances in the rights and status of women.
 In 1975, reportedly 35 percent of all students were
 women. Women reportedly participate equally in the
 obligatory labor and military service programs. There
 appear to be few women in positions of leadership in
 the economic apparatus, however.
