 DOMINICA
 Since it achieved independence from the United Kingdom
 in 1978, Dominica, a small island with a population
 of under 80,000, has suffered from a combination
 of natural disasters and political unrest. Political
 turmoil in early 1979, culminating in the resignation
 of the government, was followed by the devastating
 hurricane David of August 1979. The savage winds
 destroyed its main source of revenue and employment,
 bananas. The interim government which followed the
 1979 political upheaval was succeeded, via free and
 fair elections in July 1980, by the opposition Dominica
 Freedom Party under the leadership of Prime Minister
 Eugenia Charles. These elections did not end Dominica's
 problems. Hurricane Allen in August 1980 hampered
 post-David recovery, and in early 1981 a coup/mercenary
 invasion scheme was discovered, and Prime Minister
 Charles declared a state of emergency which lasted
 for five months. On December 19, 1981, political
 dissidents attacked the country's prison and police
 headquarters. During the attack three persons were
 killed and several injured, including the police
 chief. Prime Minister Charles again declared a state
 of emergency which, at the end of the year, she announced
 she would ask parliament to extend for a further
 two months. With assistance from the International
 Monetary Fund and a pragmatic, businesslike approach,
 the new government is attempting to reverse Dominica's
 recent economic and political stagnation.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is expressly prohibited by the constitution.
 There have been no reports that it is practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment is expressly prohibited by the constitution,
 and there have been no reports of its occurrence.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides that anyone arrested shall
 be brought before a court within 72 hours. Arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment are constitutionally prohibited.
 Dominica abides by these provisions. Nine persons
 were held by the government under a terrorism act
 promulgated under the state of emergency; the emergency
 act and detentions were judged constitutional by
 the West Indies Supreme Court in June 1981, while
 an independent tribunal was quickly established and
 reviewed the justifications for individual detentions
 on a regular and frequent basis. The nine detainees
 were charged in July 1981 and thereafter fell under

 the regular judicial regime. Their imprisonment
 pending trial is the subject of weekly court review.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Dominica provides for open trial before an independent
 and impartial court. There is a presumption of innocence
 and defendants are allowed legal counsel. These
 provisions are fully respected in practice. All
 proceedings relative to the coup/plot detentions
 conformed with these provisions.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary entry and search,
 and none have been reported.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The constitutional guarantees in these areas were
 upheld before and during the 1980 elections and have
 been fully observed since then, except as prohibited
 under the emergency legislation. During the state
 of emergency, public commentary on the coup was legis-
 latively limited between February and May. During
 this time press reporting on the coup plot had to
 be cleared with the cabinet secretary. No press
 copy was refused clearance under this procedure,
 however. Furthermore, though there was at least
 one reported instance of violation of the regulation
 by a lefist activist, the Dominican government did
 not levy charges. Dominica's small press community
 has taken an independent and sometimes critical view
 of the government without suffering any interference.
 Newspapers are published by independent publishers,
 the Catholic church and unions, and by a leftist.
 political party. There is freedom of religion, except
 for the Rastafarian cult. Membership in the cult
 is forbidden by the 1975 "Dread Act," passed after
 members engaged in criminal activities. The act,
 while still on the books, is "suspended," according
 to the government, and there is no evidence that
 it is enforced, despite continued involvement of
 Rastafarians in criminal activities, including a
 kidnapping-murder in 1981. Religious groups, including
 Rastafarians, have been politically active in the
 recent past and have been allowed full scope for
 their activities. The freedom to assemble peaceably
 is scrupulously observed. Women enjoy full access
 to all the above freedoms.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in law and honored in
 practice.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Four political parties covering the ideological spectrum
 participated in the 1980 elections. They have continued
 to operate at levels consistent with their actual
 degree of public support and internal cohesiveness.

 Political rights continued unhindered during the
 recent state of emergency, when even supporters of
 the detained former prime minister were permitted
 to be polit cally active. Women have full rights
 under the law and are active in the political system;
 the prime minister and a junior minister are women,
 as are several government and other officials.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 With the exception of the case of an Amnesty International
 prisoner of conscience freed in July 1979, Dominica
 has not been the subject of international human rights
 commentary. The government's strict attention to
 legal procedure and openness to judicial review in
 its conduct of the state of emergency of early 1981
 elicited uniformly favorable regional comment, and
 it was responsive to inquiries from the press and
 other governments concerning the treatment of individual
 detainees. There are no branches of international
 human rights organizations in Dominica, nor is there
 any local body active in monitoring human rights
 violations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Even before the series of natural disasters described
 above, Dominica was a poor country. Starting from
 a 1970 per capita income of about $300, generated
 largely from its single cash crop of bananas, slow
 progress was being made in improving social services
 and raising overall wealth. The 1979 per capita
 income was estimated at $400, while the infant mortality
 rate, one of the few measured indicators of social
 welfare, fell from 58.3 per thousand live births
 to 19.6. Other indicators, such as percent of calorie
 supply available relative to nutritional requirements
 or literacy, were constant at adequate if sometimes
 minimal levels. Dominica has had a low population
 growth rate, constant at about 1.7 percent, resulting
 from a moderately high birth rate and increasing
 life expectancy counterbalanced by emigration of
 a high proportion of the population, with the loss
 of human capital this implies.
 Much of the inadequate infrastructure left by the
 colonial government was destroyed by hurricanes David
 and Allen, as was the entire banana crop. Exports
 recently expanded (although into a fairly competitive
 market), and the government has taken steps urgently
 to improve its revenues for the maintenance of vital
 services and infrastructure and to generate new funds
 for capital development. Inheriting a virtually
 bankrupt treasury, the Dominica Freedom Party government
 has imposed fiscal responsibility and secured a three-
 year Extended Fund Facility from the International
 Monetary Fund. Initiatives to obtain capital development
 aid and private investment have been vigorously pursued.
 The Dominican economy is now slowly looking up.
 Although much remains to be done, there is an emerging,
 although still tentative, domestic consensus that
 discipline and austerity are national requirements
 for all sectors.
 Within the limits of its own finances and of proceeds
 from international assistance, which it increasingly
 solicits, the government is attentively providing
 social services to all Dominicans who require them,
 without refercnce to sex, ethnic group or other attri-
 butes, on an equal basis. However, the 1981/82 budget,
 in allocating government funds primarily to infrastruc-
 tural and agricultural development, suggests that
 Dominica is devoting the largest proportion of its
 limited resources to encouraging productive endeavor.
