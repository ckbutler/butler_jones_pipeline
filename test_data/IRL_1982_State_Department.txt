 IRELAND
 Ireland is a parliamentary democracy which attaches great
 importance to the observance and maintenance of human rights.
 Individual liberties and civil rights are guaranteed by the
 Constitution. Ireland plays an active role in human rights
 questions in the United Nations and places strong emphasis on
 human rights in its foreign policy.
 The growth of terrorist activities associated with the civil
 unrest in Northern Ireland has led to cooperative efforts by
 the Irish and British governments to combat terrorism. Under
 Irish lawi the courts determine whether an individual in a
 specific case may be exempted from extradition if he claims his
 offense is "political". However, in a land-mark case the
 Supreme Court in December 1982 rejected such a plea from a man
 who had admitted committing a murder in Northern Ireland on
 behalf of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The Court's
 decision, in ordering his extradition to Northern Ireland, has
 been interpreted as reflecting a considerable evolution in
 Irish thinking and concern about terrorist violence.
 A recent rise in the crime rate country-wide has led to calls
 for heightened police activity, but emphasis continues to be
 placed upon the legal and constitutional rights of the accused.
 Over the past two decades consecutive governments have promoted
 rapid industrialization and economic growth, and various
 inducements have attracted a significant amount of industrial
 investment from overseas. Although industrial output now
 accounts for over 40 percent of Gross National Product and 30
 percent of the nation's jobs, per capita income in Ireland
 remains among the lowest in the European Community.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The Irish authorities do not engage in politically motivated
 killings which have occurred from time to time in the Republic
 as a spillover from the violence in Northern Ireland. In these
 cases responsibility has been claimed by suoh groups as the
 Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and the Irish National
 Liberation Army (INLA), membership in which is illegal as an
 offense against national security. Police officers have been
 killed while exchanging gunfire with members of the INLA.
 Irish Government policy is committed to using the full force of
 law and the full resources of the state against both
 organizations.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities, nor does the
 Irish Government condone such practices.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 
 
 938
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Constitutional protections against such conduct are observed.
 There are no summary executions and no discrimination in
 treatment of prisoners due to race, religion, sex, or social
 class. Conditions in places of detention generally are good to
 adequate, although several prisons are overcrowded.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Irish Constitution states that deprivation of personal
 liberty shall be only in accordance with law and provides for
 habeas corpus. These guarantees are adhered to by the Irish
 authorities. There are no political crimes under Irish law
 and, therefore, no political status for convicted persons. A
 number of those convicted for terrorist offenses are members of
 the PIRA and other illegal organizations.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. The courts are independent of executive
 and military control. The Offenses Against the State Act of
 1939 established separate courts (provided for in the
 Constitution) that may try persons for offenses against
 national security.  The use of such courts is strictly limited
 in practie'. Trial is by a panel of judges, not by jury. The
 verdict is by majority vote. Rules of evidence generally are
 similar to those of regular courts, but the statement of a
 police chief superintendent that the accused is a member of an
 :illegal organization is considered evidence of such
 membership. Court sessions are usually public, but may exclude
 certain persons, except genuinepress representatives. There
 is provision for free legal aid and appeal of conviction.
 Amnesty International's 1982 Report expresses some concern
 about the denial of an appeal on technical grounds of a man
 convicted before such a court in 1980. The denial of appeal
 carried with it the right to appeal the denial, however, and
 the case is still under court review.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and respected in practice. Search warrants are
 required for entry to private property and are issued by
 district justices, peace commissioners, and police
 superintendents.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 in practice. The Constitution provides that the state will
 endeavor to ensure that organs of public opinion, while
 preserving liberty of expression (including criticism of
 government policy), shall not be used to undermine public
 order, morality, or the authority of the state. The
 Constitution provides further that "publication or utterance of
 blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter" is an offense
 punishable by law. Materials considered to be pornographic are
 censored.
 
 
 939
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 This is fully guaranteed by the Constitution and is respected
 in practice. Certain terrorist organizations, however, are
 illegal, and membership in them is an offense against national
 security. The most notable among these groups are the PIRA and
 the INLA, both of which have employed violence and seek radical
 change in the present form of government in Ireland. Political
 parties or groups associated with such organizations, however,
 are not proscribed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The Constitution
 recognizes the "special position" of the Catholic Church, but
 the separation of powers between church and state, which had
 existed before Irish independence in 1921, remains in effect.
 The Constitution guarantees freedom to all religious groups.
 Freedom of religion is respected in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within all parts of the
 country, and freedom of foreign travel, emigration and
 repatriation. To the degree that its resources permit, Ireland
 has accepted refugees. Ireland received 212 Vietnamese
 refugees in 1979-80 and an additional 28 Vietnamese refugees in
 1981.  (For the most part, they were relatives of persons
 admitted previously.)
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All Irish citizens may participate fully in the democratic,
 multi-party political system. The labor movement is free and
 strong, with government workers having the right to strike.
 There are b8 independent trade unions registered in Ireland,
 and a substantial portion of workers are organized in them.
 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions coordinates the work of most
 of the trade unions. The Federated Union of Employers is
 broadly representative of management in the private sector.
 Ireland is a traditional society, but in recent years women
 have begun to play an increasingly important role in Irish
 life. They are represented in growing numbers in positions of
 executive, legislative, and judicial authority, as well as in
 business and labor organizations. The increasing presence of
 women in the work force is a phenomenon which has taken place
 more recently in Ireland than in many other Western societies,
 and-is linked to the necessity of providing supplementary
 family income, rather than to any change in their legal status.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Irish Government has cooperated with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses. Amnesty
 International is quite active in Ireland, adopting "prisoners
 of conscience" in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.
 Because of the nature of the special courts described in
 Section I(f) there has been, as noted, some concern expressed
 by Amnesty International about their conduct. Observers,
 
 
 940
 however, have been given free access to such trials. In this
 way, as well as through the right of appeal, tne rights of the
 individual in such trials are safeguarded.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Successive Irish Governments have successfully promoted
 industrialization and diversification, raising living standards
 considerably. The population in 1982 totalled approximately
 3,400,000 and is growing at 1.5 percent per annum. Life
 expectancy at birth is 72.8 years, and the infant mortality
 rate is 12.4/1,000. The primary school enrollment ratio is 104
 percent. The ratio of calorie supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements is 174 percent. The adult
 literacy rate is 98 percent. Estimated per capita income in
 1982 was approximately $5000.
 Over the last two years Ireland has been hurt by rising
 unemployment (13.1 percent in September 1982) and a high rate
 of inflation (21 percent for 1981). Nonetheless, the people of
 the country enjoy more than adequate access to food, shelter,
 healtn care, and education. These services are available
 without regard to race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or
 political opinion.   People whose means are inadequate and who
 are not entitled to other benefits may receive pensions or
 other payments from public funds.
