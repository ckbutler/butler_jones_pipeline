 FIJI
 Fiji made significant progress in 1997 toward restoration of a more representative
 and democratic government with the approval of an amended Constitution. The new
 legislation, which incorporated the work of the independent Constitutional Review
 Commission, was unanimously approved by both houses of Parliament and was
 signed into law on July 25. The provisions that amend the 1990 Constitution en-
 courage multiethnic government while protecting traditional Fijian values. Under
 the amended Constitution, the Prime Minister and the President can be of any race,
 and for the first time, in addition to the communally allocated seats, there will be
 open seats not allocated to any racial community in the lower house. The judiciary
 is independent.
 The Constitution also includes a strengthened bill of rights and a compact de-
 signed to protect the rights of all citizens. However, it preserves the paramountcy
 of indigenous Fijian interests which cannot be subordinated to the interests of other
 communities. The new Constitution is to come into effect no later than July 28,
 1998; it may take effect sooner once all implementing legislation is approved. Elec-
 tions must take place no later than 1999.
 The passage of this legislation, 10 years after two bloodless military coups, is ex-
 pected to promote greater political stability. Nonetheless, ethnicity remains a domi-
 nant factor in Fijian life and affects the country's politics, economy, and society. The
 
 
 population is a multiracial, multicultural mix, with indigenous Fijians comprising
 51 percent, Indo-Fijians around 42 percent, and Asians and Caucasians making up
 the rest of the over 775,000 population. The racial divide is particularly evident in
 the private and public sectors, where business is largely controlled by Indo-Fijian
 families while government ministries and the military are largely led by indigenous
 Fffians.
 Rhe Fii Military Forces (FMF), a small professional force, comes under the au-
 thority o the Ministry for Home Affairs, as do the police. A separate unit, the Fiji
 Intelligence Service, with limited statutory powers to search people and property,
 monitor communications, and access financial records, also comes under authority
 of the Ministry. There continue to be credible reports of human rights abuses by
 individual police officers.
 Sugar and tourism constitute the mainstays of the economy, accounting for more
 than half of the nation's foreign exchange earnings. The Government is seeking to
 develop the service and light manufacturing industries. Private investment is in-
 creasing after several stagnant years, but is still well below the 12 percent gross
 domestic product level achieved prior to the plitical disturbances in 1987.
 The principal human rights problem, while significantly addressed in the revised
 Constitution, remains ethnically based discrimination. Although the new constitu-
 tional provisions reduce the factors that abridge the right of citizens to change their
 government, there is continuing protection for indigenous Fijian interests through
 government hiring practices, education policies, land tenure preferences, and con-
 stitutional safeguards. Other human rights problems include occasional police bru-
 tality, a magistrate system that fails to perform its functions effectively, informal
 constraints on the freedom of the press, discrimination and cases of violence against
 women, and instances of abuse of children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police sometimes abuse detainees; the authorities have punished some of the offend-
 ing officers, but these punishments have not been sufficient to deter all police
 abuses. The Police Department's internal affairs unit investigates complaints of po-
 lice brutality and is working with the Ombudsman's office to ensure impartial ob-
 servers in the investigation of complaints about police conduct.
 Prison authorities have struggled to meet minimum international standards,
 within the limits of local financial restraints. Prison conditions are Spartan, and
 food and sanitation are limited. The Government permits visits to prisons by church
 groups and family members.
 The law permits corporal punishment as a penalty for criminal acts, but this pro-
 vision is seldom invoked.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Law of Arrest and Detention pro-
 vides that a person may be arrested only if police believe that a breach of the crimi-
 nal law has been or is about to be committed. Arrested persons must be brought
 before a court without "undue delay." This requirement is taken to mean within 24
 hours, with 48 hours as the exception (such as when an arrest is made over the
 weekend). Rules governing detention are designed to ensure fair questioning of sus-
 pects. Defendants have the right to a judicial review of the grounds for arrest; in
 urgent cases, defendants may apply to a judge at any time, whether he is sitting
 or not. Incommunicado and arbitrary detention, both illegal, did not occur.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent under the Constitu-
 tion and in practice. There were no credible reports of courts having been influenced
 by the executive.
 The judicial structure is patterned on the British system. The principal courts are
 the magistrate courts, the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court.
 There are no special courts; military courts try only members of the armed forces.
 Magistrate courts continue to try the large majority of cases. In addition to its juris-
 diction in serious civil and criminal cases, the High Court is granted special interest
 jurisdiction on behalf of the public and is empowered to review alleged violations
 of individual rights provided by the Constitution.
 Defendants have the right to a public trial and to counsel. Trials in the High
 Court provide for the presence of assessors (citizens randomly selected to represent
 the community); cases in magistrate court do not. In litigation involving lesser coin-
 
 
 766
 plaints, a public legal advisor assists indigent persons in domestic or family law
 cases. The right of appeal exists but is hampered by continuing delays in the ap-
 procedures mean that most defendants do not experience any
 The law sometimes treats women differently from men. In some instances, there
 is a presumption of reduced competence and thus reduced responsibility. For exam-
 ple only women can be charged with infanticide (if a man kills an infant the act
 is treated as murder, a more serious charge). A woman in an infanticide case is pre-
 sumed to have diminished mental capacity, and sentences are reduced or suspended
 accordingly.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Inteference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral the Government respects the privacy of the home. However, the Intelligence
 Service has powers, within specific operational guidelines, to search people and
 property, access private financial records, and monitor mail and telephones when a
 warrant is issued by the National Security Council. The Intelligence Service con-
 ducts surveillance of persons it believes represent a security threat.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is generally respected. The
 Government at times criticizes the media for its coverage of sensitive issues, par-
 ticularly if the Government perceives the coverage as resulting in a diminution of
 respect for authority. There are credible reports of attempts by individual members
 of the Government to pressure editors or otherwise interfere with the independence
 of the press.
 Nevertheless, political figures and private citizens can and do speak out against
 the Government. Although the Public Order Act and other acts prohibit actions that
 are likely to incite racial antagonism, there were no reported arrests for such public
 statements.
 Legislation pertaining to the press is contained in the Newspaper Registration Act
 (NRA) and the Press Correction Act (PCA). Under the NRA, all newspapers must
 be registered with the Government before they can publish. Although the Govern-
 ment has never used the PCA, the act gives the Minister of Information sole discre-
 tionarypower to order a newspaper to publish a "correcting statement" if, in the
 Minister's opinion, a false or distorted article has been published. Should the news-
 paper refuse to publish the Minister's correction, it can be taken to court, and if
 found guilty, fined approximately $700 (individual persons convicted under the act
 may be fined approximately $150 or imprisoned for 6 months or both). The PCA al-
 lows the Government to arrest anyone who publishes "malicious" material. This in-
 cludes anything the Government considers false news that could create or foster
 public alarm or result in "detriment to the public."
 The media operate without prior censorship but with considerable self-censorship.
 Newspapers occasionally print editorials critical of the Government but rarely do in-
 vestigative reporting. They widely report statements about the political situation by
 opposition figures and foreign governments. The letters-to-the-editor columns of the
 two daily newspapers also frequently carry political statements from a wide cross
 section of society, including members of the deposed precoup government, which are
 highly critical of the Government, its programs, and the Constitution. Criticism, al-
 beit muted, of the once sacrosanct traditional chiefly system is appearing more fre-
 quently. However, the Government still views comments abeut individual chiefs
 with disfavor.
 An active local organization, the Fiji Islands Media Association (FIMA), is an affil-
 iate of the regionalPacific Islands News Association (PINA). Both FIMA and PINA
 are pressing for better training and the establishment of codes of ethics for journal-
 ists. In a show of tangible support for strengthening the media, the Government has
 unconditionally provided space for housing the Fiji Journalism Training Institute.
 The formerly dormant Fiji News Council has been reorganized and is now active
 again. The Council strives to promote high journalistic standards, enhance the
 image of the media, safeguard its independence, and resolve complaints from the
 public.
 Fiji's television news production is owned and operated by Fiji One, the only
 noncable television station. Fiji One, in turn is owned by private individuals and
 interests, and 51 percent by a trust operating on behalf of Fiji's provincial govern-
 ments. The Government's attempt to open the television market to new entrants is
 being challenged in court.
 While academic freedom is respected, the Government has effectively deterred
 university employees from participation in domestic politics. Since 1991 staff mem-
 bers of the Fiji-based University of the South Pacific must take leave if they run
 
 
 767
 for public office and must resign from their university positions if elected. Senior
 staff cannot hold office in political parties. Student groups organize freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides the
 right to assemble for political purposes, subject to restrictions in the interest of pub-
 lic order. Permits for public gatherings must be obtained from the district officer.
 The Government does not always grant permits for large outdoor political meetings
 or demonstrations, particularly if the police advise of difficulties with the antici-
 pated crowd size or their ability to assure public safety.
 The Government routinely issued permits for rallies organized by political parties,
 religious groups, and groups opposed to government policies.
 All opposition party headquarters operate without government interference. Politi-
 cal organizations operate and issue public statements and did so repeatedly and
 openly throughout the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitutional provision of freedom of religion is
 honored in practice. The Government does not restrict foreign clergy and missionary
 activity or other typical activities of religious organizations.
 There were allegations that police were slow to respond to incidents of desecration
 of Hindu temples (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict freedom of movement within the
 country or abroad. Occasional detentions at the airport occur, but the courts order
 redress where this is warranted. Citizens are free to emigrate, and over 40,000 have
 done so since 1987. The Government does not restrict their return if they choose
 to do so, and has, in fact, encouraged those who left after the coups to return.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. In the past it has been reluctant to grant first asylum without assurances
 that the asylum seeker would be moved to a third country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The constitutional amendment bill passed unanimously by both houses of Par-
 liament is a significant step toward the restoration of a more representative and
 democratic government. The amended Constitution, which is to come into force after
 all implementing legislation is enacted, reduces the ethnically-based factors that
 abridge the right of citizens to change their government. Under its provisions the
 prime minister and president can be of any race. It establishes a 71-member lower
 house with 25 open seats and 46 seats allocated to different ethnic communities.
 The open seats, which are unprecedented, are to be established by an electoral com-
 mission and apportioned into districts of approximately equal population. Of the 46
 communal seats, 23 are allotted to indigenous Fijians, 19 to Indo-Fijians, 3 are "gen-
 eral voter" (for the most part Caucasians and East Asians) seats, and 1 is allotted
 to the Retumans (an ethnically distinct Polynesian people), roughly proportional to
 the different communities representation in the population. The amended Constitu-
 tion also contains an alternate vote system for elections to the lower house, to re-
 place the winner takes all system of the previous constitution. Although the Review
 Commission recommended a mostly elected Senate it remains an appointed body;
 the President a ppoints its 32 members with the Great Council of Chiefs nominating
 14 members, the Prime Minister 9, the opposition leader 8, and the Council of
 Rotuma 1 member.
 Included in the amended Constitution is a strengthened bill of rights and a com-
 pact among the people to protect their respective rights and interests, which, how-
 ever, acknowledges that the paramountcy of indigenous Fijian interests can not be
 subordinated to the interests of other communities. Parliament retains broad emer-
 gency powers that can be invoked if there is a threat to the life of the nation. These
 powers could infringe upon universally accepted rights and privileges contained in
 the bill of rights in the Constitution.
 Fiji has a number of active political parties. The ethnic Fijian SVT (or Fijian Po-
 litica Party) forms the core of the Government's parliamentary majority. The Fijian
 Association Party joined the government coalition during the year. Two other small
 parties representing primarily Caucasians and Asians, also have members included
 in the Ca inet. Two predominantly Indo-Fijian parties, the National Federation
 Party (NFP) and the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) make up most of the opposition. The
 leader of the opposition is the parliamentary leader of the NFP. Discussions were
 held among the parties regarding a future multiethnic government, as prescribed
 in the amended Constitution, following the next general elections.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have functioned primarily in
 traditional roles, although an increasing number of women are rising to prominent
 
 
 768
 positions in politics and public service. Five women sit in Parliament. The two
 women in the lower house are members of the Cabinet, with one the Deputy Prime
 Minister. Women also play an important role in Fiji's chiefly system and can be
 chiefs in their own right. The President's wife is one of Fiji's three highest ranking
 chiefs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local groups that focus solely on human rights matters, but the wom-
 en's rights movement, the labor movement, and various political groups (including
 organized political parties) are engaged in promoting human rights. There are also
 several small, foreign-based organizations that concentrate on human rights causes
 in Fiji, including the Coalition for Democracy in Fiji (with offices in New Zealand
 and Australia) and two United Kingdom-based groups, the International Fiji Move-
 ment and the Movement for Democracy in Fiji.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The amended Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, place
 of origin, political opinion, color, religion, or creed, and provides specific affirmative
 action provisions for those disadvantaged as a result of such discrimination. In the
 compact included in the amended Constitution, there is specific provision for affirm-
 ative action and "social justice" programs to secure effective equality of access to op-
 portunities, amenities, and services for the Fijian and Rotuman people, and for all
 disadvantaged citizens and groups.
 Women.-Women in Fiji are actively addressing the problem of domestic violence.
 Reliable estimates indicate that 10 percent of women have been abused in some
 way, and this abuse is a major focus of the women's movement. Fiji police have
 adopted a "no drop" rule, according to which they will prosecute cases of domestic
 violence even when the victim does not wish to press charges.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement, which has pressed for more
 serious punishment for rape. Courts have imposed sentences that vary widely but
 are generally lenient. Women have sought to have all rape cases heard in the High
 Court where sentencing limits are higher.
 Suva, the capital, and Ba, Labasa, and Lautoka have privately funded women's
 crisis centers, which offer counseling and assistance to women in cases of rape, do-
 mestic violence, and other problems, such as child support payments. There is, over-
 all, a growing awareness of the abuse of women's rights.
 Constitutional changes approved in 1997 are designed to redress the imbalance
 that existed previously in which spousal and offspring rights differed for male and
 female citizens. Under the amended Constitution, male and female citizens are to
 enjoy equal rights relating to the granting of residence for spouses, registration of
 children, and racial designation of offspring with regard to electoral rolls and ethnic
 communal property.
 In general women in the Fijian community are more likely to rise to prominence
 in their own right than are women in the Indo-Fijian community. Women have full
 rights of property ownership and inheritance, and a number have become successful
 entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than men, a discrepancy that is espe-
 cially notable in the garment industry. Garment workers, most of whom are female,
 are subject to a special minimum wage that is considerably lower than that in other
 sectors.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare but has
 limited financial resources to carry out the commitment. In addition the legal sys-
 tem is at times inadequate to protect the rights of children, as children's testimony
 is inadmissible unless corroborated by an adult. Societal changes have undermined
 the traditional village and extended family based social structures-an outgrowth
 of this evolution has been a child abuse problem. The Government in 1993 created
 a Child Welfare Committee to address these problems, but it is likely to remain re-
 luctant to become directly involved in what are generally perceived to be 'family
 matters."
 Corporal punishment is widely administered in schools and at home. The Ministry
 of Education has guidelines for the administration of such punishment by principals
 and head teachers. A number of incidents involving alleged beatings of children in
 religious schools were reported in the media. In at least one instance, a family insti-
 tuted court action against a teacher who reportedly beat a child for lack of dis-
 cipline. There is credible information that not all abuses are reported or punished.
 People With Disabilities.-Legal discrimination against physically disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, and the provision of other state services does not
 
 
 769
 exist. However, there is no legislation or mandated provision for accessibility for the
 disabled. Several small voluntary organizations promote greater attention to the
 needs of the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-A small number of Hindu temples were desecrated during
 the year. Some perpetrators were arrested and convicted (see Section 2.c.).
 Alational/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-The stated purpose of the 1987 military
 coups was to ensure the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and to
 protect their traditional way of life and communal control of land. To this end, the
 Government initiated a number of constitutional and other measures to ensure eth-
 nic Fijian control of the executive and legislative branches (see Section 3). The Gov-
 ernment also successfully raised the proportion of ethnic Fijians and Rotumans in
 the public service to 50 percent or higher at all levels, but most dramatically at the
 senior level: Indo-Fijians now represent only 10 percent of the highest levels of the
 civil service. The amended Constitution seeks to redress this imbalance by specifi-
 cally noting that "the composition of state services at all levels must be based on
 the principle of reflecting as closely as possible the ethnic composition of the popu-
 lation."
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue. Ethnic Fijians currently hold,
 communally, about 83 percent of land, the State holds another 8 percent, and only
 the remaining 9 percent is freehold land. The British colonial administration insti-
 tuted the present land ownership arrangements to protect the interests of the indig-
 enous Fijians whose traditional beliefs, cultural values, and self-identity are tied to
 the land. Most cash crop farmers are Indo-Fijians, who lease land from the ethnic
 Fijian landowners through the Native Land Trust Board. Many Indo-Fijians, par-
 ticularly farmers, believe that the absence of secure land tenure discriminates
 against them. Between 1997 and 2000, most current leases will expire. A cabinet
 subcommittee was established to review agricultural land tenure agreements issues,
 and it is expected that this group will be expanded to a parliamentary select com-
 mittee and will include representatives from all interested political parties.
 Indo-Fijians are subject to occasional harassment based on race. There have been
 no credible allegations of government involvement in such incidents, which the po-
 lice have investigated, sometimes resulting in arrests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law protects the right of workers to form and
 join unions, elect their own representatives, publicize their views on labor matters,
 and determine their own policies, and the authorities respect these rights in prac-
 tice. However, the law permits restrictions to be applied in government employment
 and in the interests of defense, public safety, public order, public morality, or public
 health, or to protect the rights and freedoms of other persons. An estimated 55 per-
 cent of the paid work force is unionized.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the Government. The
 only central labor body is the Fiji Trade Union Congress (FTUC), which was closely
 associated with the opposition Fiji Labour Party until mid-1992. It currently takes
 a more independent political stance. The FTUC is free to associate internationally
 and does so. The labor movement is led largely by Indo-Fijians, with ethnic Fijians
 beginning to assume leadership roles. Persons with close ties to the Government
 have organized rival unions primarily for ethnic Fijians.
 In 1994 Parliament completed a 2-year process of reforming labor legislation by
 amending several acts. The changes include the elimination of a ban on a person
 holding multiple union officer positions and the elimination of restrictions on seek-
 ing international support on labor issues. The FTUC is presently reconsidering its
 decision not to participate in the Government's Tripartite Economic Strategies  om-
 mittee, due to an improved government-labor dialogue.
 Strikes are legal, except in connection with union recognition disputes. The Gov-
 ernment remains involved in certifying union strike balloting, which can be an
 elaborate process given the distance between some of the island locations. The sugar
 industry was affected by a nationwide strike that lasted for approximately 2 weeks.
 Labor unrest continued thereafter in the industry.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law recognizes the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union
 if more than half of the employees in a workplace have joined it. Recognition is de-
 termined by union membership rather than by an election. The Government has the
 power to order recalcitrant employers to recognize unions and has done so. Key sec-
 trs of the economy, including sugar and tourism, are heavily organized. Following
 the May 1992 return to accountable government, the Government lifted wage guide-
 lines, and unrestricted collective bargaining on wages is now the norm.
 
 
 770
 Wage negotiations are still generally conducted on an individual company or en-
 terprise basis, although negotiations on an industrywide basis are on the increase.
 A government proposal to introduce such negotiations has been supported by em-
 ployers but opposed by unions.
 The law specifically prohibits antiunion discrimination. In practice the unions
 generally are successful in preventing discrimination against workers for union ac-
 tivities, but the law does not mandate that fired workers be reinstated.
 Export processing zones (EPZ's) are subject to the same law as the rest of the
 country. The FTUC however, has been unsuccessful in obtaining collective bargain-
 ing agreements in EPZ's and claims that intimidation of workers by employers is
 widespread. The FTUC sees union recognition as the single labor/management issue
 that does not have effective legal recourse. The FTUC argues that because of alleged
 illegal and intimidatory practices in EPZ's, including threats of loss of work for
 those active in organizing workers, the FTUC is unfairly prevented from represent-
 ing workers in EPZs.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, including forced and bonded labor by children, and there is no
 indication that it is practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Children
 under the age of 12 may not be employed in any capacity. "Children" (under age
 15) and young persons" (ages 15 to 17) may not be employed in industry or work
 with machinery. Enforcement by the Ministry for Labour and Industrial Relations
 generally is effective, except for family members working on family farms or busi-
 nesses and "self-employed" homeless youths.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). School is not mandatory.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Certain
 sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Labour and Industrial Rela-
 tions, which effectively enforces them. Minimum wage levels will generally support
 a barely adequate standard of living for a worker and family in all sectors except
 for the garment industry, in which the starting hourly wage, $0.50 (FJ$0.72) for
 learners and $0.65 (FJ$0.94) for others, is based on the assumption that workers
 are young adults or married women living at home and not supporting a household.
 There are no regulations specifying maximum hours -of work for adult males.
 Women can do night work in factories and overtime but are prohibited from under-
 Und work in mines. Certain industries, notably transportation and shipping,
 haeproblems with excessive hours of work. Indo-Fijians, who generall require a
 cash income to survive, are more vulnerable to pressure to work long hours than
 are ethnic Fijians. Many ethnic Fijians can and do return to their villages rather
 than work what they consider excessive hours. Particularly in the garment industry,
 migrant workers, predominantly Chinese or Filipino, are increasing in number
 (presently estimated at around 1,000-2,000 persons) and are a largely unregulated
 work force.
 There are workplace safety regulations, a Workmen's Compensation Act, and an
 accident compensation plan. Awards for workers injured on the job are set by a tri-
 bunal. Government enforcement of safety standards under the direction of the
 Labour Ministry suffers from a lack of trained enforcement personnel, but unions
 do a reasonable job of monitoring safety standards in organized workplaces. The
 International Labor Organization'a (ILO) 1992 recommendations cited thie need to
 improve working conditions, particulariy in the garment industry. The Government,
 supported by the FTUC, passed occupational health and safety legislation which
 came in to effect in November. The Government continues to work with the ILO to
 address working conditions.
