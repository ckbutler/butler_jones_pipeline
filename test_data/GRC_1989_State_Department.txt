 ,Gpeecok s a cqnstitutional republic and parliamentary
 democracy. The.party or coalition with the majority of seats
 in Parliament names the Prime Minister, who forms the
 Government. Parliamentary elections in June and November 1989
 were freely and vigorously contested by a full spectrum of
 politiqal p.arties.and resulted in an orderly, democratic
 change of, govenment. - The President, the largely ceremonial
 Head of State, is elected by Parliament.
 Activities of the '01ice and security.services are monitored
 by the, Government-and the independent judiciary. .The
 gen alyaert -press reports rare Abuses, including the
 ,impr.9per expulsio 4f. political refugees and isolated
 insC." .es of rough treatment of ordinary criminals.
 A developed count'ry and a member 0f the European Corpmunity
 (EC), Greece benefits from EC subsidies designed to bring its
 per capita groas national product int9 line with that of other
 EC members. Economic development is.hampered by a public
 sectorj-bloated by generations of -olitically motivated hirings
 and by consequent massive budget deficits.
 The Constituti6n provides a full range of fundamental human
 rights. Some.members of-religious and ethnic/cultural
 mino4ties, bowever, continue to complain about the behavior
 osome government officials'.who, they allege, restrict their
 iights And discriminate.against them. About 420 Jehovah's
 Witnesses are-in  risoi due.,to the absence of nonjnilitary
 alternative service to conscription. Treatment of the_
 respective Muslim and Greek minorities in Greece and Turkey
 continues to be a subject ofdispute betweefn the two countries.
 RESPECT"POR HUU.ZA1 RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the. Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.-.olitical'andOther Extrajudicial_)illing
 Neither governnjent forces nqr-legal opposition organizations
 engage in politically motiva~ed'kjlings. In 1989 donestic
 .terrorist groups assassinated a prominent 04puty of the
 conservative New Democracy party and.two judicial officials.
 b. Diqappearance
 There were no reports of official abductions, secret arrests,
 or clandestine detentions during 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitutiqn provides for freedom from torture. A
 November 1984 law makes the use of torture an offense
 puniohable by sentences ranging from 3 years, to life
 impriohment. Greek human rights groups contend that police
 overkeliance on confessions occasionally.leads to physical of
 rep0xted psyghological intimidation of ordinary criminals.
 Amnesty International reported.several allegations of torture
 or ill-treatment of prisoners in 1989.
 Poor treatment of the severely mentally handicapped in a
 psychiatric institution on a remote island sparked a storm of
 protest from psychiatrists and journalists in 1989. Current
 
 
 1134
 Greek law on commitment to psychiatric institutions is
 criticized for not insisting on adequate judicial review, but
 there were no allegations of abusive commitments in 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that a judicial warrant is required
 for any arrest except during the actual commission of a
 crime. Occasionally, suspects are briefly and informally
 detained pending confirmation of their identity, but there is
 .no evidence of any serious infringement of civil liberties. A
 person arrested on the basis of a warrant or while committing
 a crime must be brought before an examining magistrate within
 24 hours and charged. The magistrate must issue a warrant of
 imprisonment or order the release of the detainee within 3 days
 of the examination unless special circumstances require a 2-day
 extension of this time limit.
 A Dutch national was imprisoned by administrative order for
 8 months during 1988 and 1989 over a disputed customs
 obligation. New legislation passed in October deprived tax
 authorities of the power to order imprisonment without
 judicial review for unpaid debts to the State.
 The effective maximum duration of detention pending trial is
 18 months for felonies and 9 months for misdemeanors. Most
 trials occur within 12 months zf the charges being submitted.
 Release pending trial,-with or without bail, is granted in
 limited cases.bydecision of .a judicial council.
 Exile is unconstitutional and does not occur, except in the
 form of loss of citizenship-ofox dual nationals (see-Section
 5). With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section
 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for fair and public trials. Greece
 has a regular system of civil and criminal courts. The
 independence of the judiciary, though provided for by the
 Constitution, is occasionally subject to political
 intervention. Judges are sometimes accused of allowing
 politidal criteria to influence their judgments. A new law on
 judicial codes passed din-October was designed to strengthen
 the independence of ohe judiciary-by eliminating the role of
 -politically appointed judicial officials in assigning judges
 to specific trials.
 Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence. Defense lawyers
 are available to all accused persons, at public expense if
 necessary. A defendant or his attorney may confront
 witnesses. Court sessions are public, unless the court
 decides that privacy is required for the protection of victims
 or in matters of national security. The latter provision is
 not abused. A-defendant may appeal a court verdict to an
 appeals court. Pending the'passage of long-delayed enabling
 legislation, the decisions of military courts are-not subject
 to review by the Supreme Court, and the courts themselves are
 criticized for inadequately safeguarding the rights of those
 accused. Miitary courts have no jurisdiction over
 civilians. Greece has no political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary-Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home
 and of the individual's personal and family life. No house
 search may be made except in the presence of a judicial
 representative and with a judicial warrant.issued in
 conformity with strict legal standards. Alleged abuses of
 this-provision'have provoked swift official investigation..
 Thete is-no compulsory membership in political groups. The
 Constitution guarantees privacy of correspondence and of
 communications.- An investigation by Parliament in August
 concluded that the previous Greek government,(1981-1989) had
 engagedcl-systematic wiretapping of opposition political
 parties,--ppliticians, and n~wspaper-publishers. Former Prime
 Uinister Andreas Papandreou and two-senior'officials were
 remanded, to a'special judicial tribunal for trial on these
 charges.-    -
 .Section-2 Respect for Ci-il.Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of, Speech and Press
 Freedom.of zpeech ard the-press isprovided for-in the
 Constitution and respected;in practice. Censorship Is
 pxohibited,. Opposition viewpoints are constantly presented in
 ï¿½he,-active Greek press'and criticism of the Government-is
 unhampered.
 Grlekl.aw prohibited-privately owned television stations until
 new legisIation,-was.p.asped in September. aTwo private stations
 are scheduled to begin, transmitting broadcasts in November,
 though.munici'pal televIsion stations had operated on a
 quasi-illegal experimental basis irregularly during the year.
 Although~the ,activities of opposition political leaders are
 1oyexed-by state-controlled radio and television, opposition
 parties.-assert, that Aews and -Information programming tends to
 .efleotthe-political perspective of the-governing party.
 Duringelecizions, air .time is alocated to all political
 parties#, Legislation passed inl,988 legalized municipal and
 privately.opprated radio stations, which air a-wide range of
 viewpoints. Since 1988, theGovernment rebroadcasts foreign
 satel1Jit' .television programs in major cities.
 The Constitution allows for- seizure, by order of the public
 prosecutor, of publications which insult the President, offend
 rel.igousljeliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate the
 violent overthrow of the political system, or di-sclose -
 military--and defense information. , No periodicals or
 newsp, apers are known to'have been seized in 1989. Academic
 freedoms are protected by democratically chosen faculty
 organizations, though such groups tend to be highly
 politiqie-d.    .
 Freedon .of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 .The Constitution provides-.for freedom of assembly, but the
 police may impose limits on outdoor.,public meetings if they
 dptermine that a serious disturbance of social and economic
 life is threatened. This exception .was not abused in 1989.
 The right of association is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 observed in practice. All citizens are free to establish and
 join organizations of their own choosing, including trade
 
 
 1136
 unions, political groups, and private organizations, without
 previous authorization or government interference.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and prohibits
 discrimi-natory practices against religious minorities, which
 include communities of Muslims, Jews, and non-Orthodox
 Christians. The Constitution nevertheless establishes the
 Greek Orthodox Church, to which 98 percent of the population
 at least nominally adheres, as the "prevailing" religion. In
 addition, the Constitution prohibits proselytism by any
 religious group. The number of foreign missionaries arrested
 has decreased since the courts ruled that distribution of
 literature alone does not constitute proselytism. In the
 first 9 months of 1989, about 110 Jehovah's Witnesses were
 arrested for proselytism, and 5 were sentenced-to fines (about
 $3,000 each) end brief imprisonment. The Jehovah's Witnesses
 allege that on at least two occasions in the past 12 months
 Orthodox priests incited crowds to beat up women distributing
 religious tracts. They also claim that, in defiance of Greek
 law, many public schoolteachers refuse to excuse children of
 Jehovah's Witnesses and other faiths from mandatory religion
 classes, in which their beliefs are attacked in state-approved
 textbooks as heretical.
 The Constitution declares that "no person shall be exempt from
 discharging his obligations to the State-or may refuse to
 comply with laws by reason of his religious convictions."
 Although Greece provides for alternative noncombatant military
 service, it has no provision for nonmilitary alternative
 national service to its universal conscription of men.
 Jehovah's Witnesses and a small number of other conscientious
 objectors of military age who refuse alternative noncombatant
 military service are tried and sentenced by military courts to
 military prison for a term twice that of normal service. In
 September there were about 420 Jehovah's Witnesses serving
 sentences of between 3 and 5 years. A portion of this
 sentence may be served in a minimum security (civilian)
 agricultural prison, where each day served is credited as
 2 days toward fulfillment of the sentence. In 1989 the
 average time actually served was reportedly about 38 months.
 Two conscientious objectors unconnected with the Jehovah's
 Witnesses were released in 1989 after having served two-thirds
 of their sentences. Parliament in 1989 did not debate
 long-pending legislation to create nonmilitary alternative
 service.
 In late 1987, a lower court in Crete held that Jehovah's
 Witnesses do not constitute a "known" religion and are thus
 not entitled to legal protection on the grounds that their
 doctrine of refusal to serve in the military violates Greek
 law. The Supreme Court's consideration of the appeal of this
 decision was postponed until late in 1989. Jehovah's
 Witnesses complain that the Government does not recognize that
 Jehovah's Witnesses' clerics are entitled to the same
 exemption from military service as that accorded to Orthodox
 and other recognized clerics. In addition, Jehovah's
 Witnesses in military prison are reportedly denied access to
 religious services.
 
 
 1137
 GREECE
 Some non-Orthodox churches experience difficulties in building
 or acquiring new meetingplaces when necessary permits from the
 Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, which must
 consider the opinion of the Orthodox Church hierarchy, are
 denied. Jehovah's Witnesses complain that their requests for
 use of public facilities are routinely denied.
 Greece-has a Muslim minority of approximately 126,000,.made up
 of ethnic-Turks, Pomaks, and Gypsies, located principally in
 Thrace in northeastern Greece. Their freedom of religion was
 guaranteed under the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, and some 250
 working mosques exist. Members of the Muslim community insist
 that, in accordance with a never-implemented law of 1920, the
 cOmmnity itself -should elect the Muftis (religious leaders)
 'of'the two major towns (Xanthi and Komotini). An-interim
 Mufti appointed by the Government has. not been accepted by
 many in the community, and the issue remains at an impasse.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution ensures freedom of movement within the
 country, foteign,.travel, and emigration, and these rights are
 gene-ally respected. Persons intending to emigrate-and
 -emigrants who-return to Greece experience no discrimination.
 However, the Greek citizenship code makes a-legal distinction
 between Greek citizens of ethnic Greek descent and those of
 nonethnic Greek descent. Citizens of nonethnic Greek descent
 may be deprived of their citizenship by a simple
 administrative decree if theylmove abroad.with the apparent
 intent not to return. Every year a small number of Greek
 Muslifts-who have moved-to Turkey find that they have been
 stripped of their Greek citizenship. There is no prior
 hear-ing or.-udicial review and.no effective right'of appeal.
 The Muslii Community'protests this practice.as discriminatory.
 Greek-Civil War refugees of Slavic ethnicity (stripped of  -
 their Greek.cititenship for participation in. the Communist-led
 insurrection-of.19A6-49) were expressly excluded from the
 general, amnesty and return of-exiles completed in 1982. In
 1989 the head of the Greek Communist Party (%KKE) denounced the
 Government's refusal to allow their return as "racist."
 Greece is a first-asylumi country under the 1951 Geneva
 Convention'on Refugees but makes no provision for permanent
 -settlement of refugeesin Gteece. -In October 1989, the
 Minister of. Labbr promulgated a decree allowing bona fide
 refugees towork,-.an important step forward in improving the
 inadequate institutional framework for refugees. Refugee
 organizations note that Greece has no objective criteria for
 distinguishing asylum seekers from economic migrants. Greek
 border-officials returned an escaped political prisoner
 involuntarily to Turkish authorities in August. The
 Government characterized- this and other reported expulsions as
 -contrary to its policy but refused to release the report of
 its investigation of the incident.
 Sect-ion 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights, without regard to race,'sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. Greek-citizens freely choose the
 officials and laws governing them; The President is elected
 by Parliament to a 5-year term. Members of the unicameral
 
 
 1138
 Parliament are elected to maximum 4-year terms by compulsory
 universal suffrage (over age 18) and secret ballot.
 Opposition parties function freely, have broad access to the
 media, hold public meetings, and serve as a check on actions
 by the Government. In June the 8-year government of the
 Panhellenic Socialist Movement was voted out of office and
 replaced by an interim coalition of the conservative New
 Democracy Party and an alliance of Communist and leftist
 parties. New parliamentary elections November 5 under the
 same proportional electoral system again did not produce a
 majority government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not objected to visits and investigations
 by human rights organizations, although visits by U.S. and
 other foreign diplomats to the border regions, where the bulk
 of the Muslim minority population resides, are subject to
 prior notification to and occasional refusal by the
 Government, as well as surveillance by the security services.
 Domestic human rights organizations are allowed to operate
 freely and actively assist those who believe their rights have
 been violated. The Government also participates in
 multilateral human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The subject of minority rights is a sensitive one in the
 Balkans, where real or alleged human rights abuses have been
 used in the past to justify irredentist claims. Greece has a
 significant Muslim minority, primarily in western Thrace, and
 there are smaller communities in the Dodecanese Islands and in
 Athens and other industrial areas. Pomaks (Bulgarian-speaking
 Muslims) occupy the mountainous border with Bulgaria, and
 Gypsies are scattered throughout Greece. There are remnant
 populations speaking Albanian, Vlach (related to Romanian),
 and Slavic dialects.
 The Treaty of Lausanne includes provisions protecting the
 political and cultural rights ofthe Muslim (Turkish, Pomak,
 and Gypsy) minority in western Thrace, as it did the rights of
 the Greek minority in Istanbul. -By and -large these rights are
 respected. Muslim villages in Thrace regularly elect Muslim
 mayors, and an independent Muslim deputy was elected to the
 Parliament in June 1989 by an overwhelming majority of the
 local Muslim population in his district. In the November
 parliamentary elections the independent Muslim Deputy, Ahmet
 Sadik, and one of his two running mates were disqualified on
 the basis of a missing affidavit in their applications. This
 exclusion and a sudden strike by-,customs officials which
 closed the border with Turkey just before these elections (and
 the June elections as well) have fueled allegations by critics
 " that local authorities may have played a role in attempting to
 block the Muslim party. The-zemaining independent Muslim
 candidate was nevertheless elected.
 Greek authorities insist on the religious, not ethnic,
 character of the minority (as specified in the Lausanne
 Treaty). The Greek Supreme Court upheld a ruling that local
 minority associations cannot call themselves "Turkish," a
 decision the associations have appealed to the European
 
 
 1189
 GREECE
 Parliament. The independent Muslim candidates campaigned on a
 platform of insisting not only on equal treatmefit, but also on
 the Turkish-ethnic/cultural (rather than Muslim religious)
 identiy of the minority. Most'Greeks assert that the
 Government of Turkey abtively intervened to support the
 indepehdent Muslim candidates, giving as evidehce the
 ~xtensive 'coveragd"the Muslim campaign received in the Turkish
 media.
 Members of the Muslim community complain that Greek officials
 encourage an overly traditional, religious education in
 Turkish-language schools and obstruct entry of'teachers and
 educational materials from Turkpy. Greek officials contend
 that the Government of Turkey has not acted to revise
 materials found unacceptable-'under the terms of a 1968
 agreemeht'on reciprocal imports of textbooks. Access to
 Turkish-1ngfiage secondary schools is restricted by government
 insistnbe tbat entraifce 6xams be given in Greek. In the
 current impasse, Turkish-language schools in Greece are
 donsidered'ihadequgate to prepare students for a modern
 economy, while Muslim Greeks who study in Turkey complain that
 their professional credentials are not accepted by Greek
 piofessional bodies.'
 Muslim leaders complain about barriers to land purchases and
 -discrimination in approval of building permits, business
 licehses, ana many6ther permits. The Government insists that
 ethnic Greeks 'and MusliMs. receive equal treatment, thdugh it
 ''bknowledjis that iidespread illiteracy in Greek, among lebers
 o'f'the minarity hinders-theit access to the States

 1986,'and ifi 1989 was expelled from Greece for "ahti-Greek
 actlvities'."      .- .       .
 Some conseevative'  lement 'of'the'Greek public adopt a
 critical vi'e*rof the open exercise of unfamiliar religions.

 however; the'tunicip'ality of Thessaloniki ceased this practice
 as of'06vembek 10.- According to the Watchtower Society, all
 pending claes'have been satisfactorily resolved.
 Both the'Constitutioh and t'he revised family law provide women
 the'same individual, political, and social rights as men.
 Women's rlghtg advbcates agree that the legal protections for
 women are'sweepiftg and progressive, though attitudes and
 social practice lag behind. The law mandates equal pay for
 men and women in equivalent jobs. Over the past decade the
 Government has made substantial progress in reforming
 marriage, divorce, and property laws, and has expanded
 services to women in unemployment, family planning, and child
 care.
 
 
 1140
 Women's rights figures say that Greece is comparable to other
 Western European countries in the incidence of violence
 against women, with no special pattern of abuse and a low rate
 of alcohol-related crimes. Rape, incest, and wife beating
 exists, but the nearly complete absence of reliable statistics
 makes exact comparisons impossible. The social infrastructure
 for battered women is almost nonexistent, despite past funding
 by the European Community, and police and local authorities
 have no training and little enthusiasm for intervening in
 domestic conflicts.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers except the military and police are entitled to
 form or join unions of their own choosing. The right of
 association is provided for in the Constitution and in
 specific legislation passed in 1978 and amended in 1982. In
 1988 an estimated 35 percent of wage and salary earners were
 organized in unions.
 Unions receive most of their funding from a Ministry of Labor
 organization, the "Worker's Hearth," though a few unions have
 their own additional sources of funding. The Committee of
 Experts of the International Labor Organization (ILO) for some
 years has expressed concern that procedures for collecting
 union dues are not compatible with the provisions of ILO
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association, which Greece ratified
 in 1962. Unions are highly politicized, with competing unions
 linked to political parties, but they are not controlled by
 the parties or the Government in their day-to-day operations.
 There are no constraints on service as a union official. Over
 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral federations
 and 2 umbrella confederations for civil servants and for
 private sector workers. There are no restrictions on
 international contacts. Greek unions and federations are
 affiliated'with the European Trade Union Confederation and the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 Some 250 to 300 strikes took place during the past year. The
 right to strike is restricted only by the Government's power
 of civil mobilization of workers when there is a danger to
 national security, life, or property, or to the social and
 economic life of the country. Although there were no reported
 abuses in 1989, the extent of the Government's powers is
 considered to exceed the standards of ILO Convention 87 by the
 Committee of Experts which has urged the Government to bring
 its legislation into conformity with the principles of the
 Convention. Employees in public services must notify
 employers of their intention to strike 4 days prior to the
 strike and must continue to provide certain basic services.
 Union leaders, particularly those of the stronger private
 sector unions, complain that a high percentage of labor
 agreements are reached through compulsory arbitration.
 Legislative remedies were discussed but not enacted in 1989.
 Security personnel (military, police, fire, port police) are
 prohibited from forming unions and from striking. Police
 personnel staged protests during 1989 against government
 efforts to prevent union organizing activities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargai. collectively is ensured by
 legislation passed in 1955. Antiunion discrimination is
 
 
 1141
 prohibited. Complaints of discrimination against union
 cmbers or organizers may-be referred to the labor
 :-inspecorate'0r to the courts. Litigation is lengthy and
 expensive, however, and penalties for employers are seldom
 severev.ï¿½ 7' ,
 oThere-are O oestrictions on'collective bargaining'for private
 ,workes,.though social security benefits, legislated by
 Farliament,-are excluded from the process. Civil servants
 negotiatetheir-demands with. the Ministry of Interior but have
 no formal system of'collective bargaining. Greece has no
 expdrt processing zones.
 c'_- Prohibition; 6f, Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory,'labor is strictly prohibited by-the
 Constitution and-is not practiced,.       . -
 d. -'Mnimum Age for Employment of'Children
 ,The minim~lm-ge.for work in industry is 15. Additionally,
 legislation and regulations provide alternate minimum ages for
 work in specified-areas or for specific jobs.  For example,
 those perforMing loading orunloading work must be at least
 18, while workers at the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki
 must'be 21..-In family-businesses, theaters, and the'cinema,
 the minimua age:ls 12-years. Enforced by occasional  labor
 inspectorate apotchecks, these age limits are generally -
 respected% However families engaged in agriculture, food
 ,service,oor merchandising;.often have younger family-members
 assistingJ at, least- part- +ime *  .-  ' .
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum daily wage in Greece as of September 1989 was $16,
 sufficient for a decentrstandard of living. Minimum wages and
 salaries,festablished by.-the National Collective Bargaining
 Agreement-and by branch-collective bargaining agreements, are
 geieraly respected byefnployers. The workweek is 40 hours 'in
 the, private sector and 37',.5hourp in the public sector, and
 business' hbuts are strictly regulated by the GoVernmenti The
 law mandates an annual paid holiday, of l~month'per'year and
 sets maximum limits on overtime..
 .Minimum standards of occupational health and safety are
 providedfor by legislation. Although the Greek-Confederation
 of Labor characterizes health 6nd safety legislation as
 satisfactory, it-charges that enforcement of the legislation
 is inadequate, citing the high number of job-related
 accidents. Enforcement reportedly suffers because of
 inadequate'inspection, failure-to enforCe compliance with
 ,.regulations,. and outdated industrial plants and equipment.
 Complaints about unsafe working conditions are usually made
 anonymously.
