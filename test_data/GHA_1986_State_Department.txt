 GHANA
 Ghana is governed by the Provisional National Defense Council
 (PNDC) under the chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant Jerry
 Rawlings, who seized power from the previous elected
 Government on December 31, 1981. Under the Establishment
 Proclamation issued January 11, 1982, the Council exercises
 all powers of government." In practice, government policy is
 developed by Chairman Rawlings assisted by a number of close
 advisers, both inside and outside government. The PNDC has
 nine members and includes, aside from the Chairman (the lone
 survivor of the seven original members), two serving military
 officers (added in 1985) and seven civilians (including one
 woman and one ex-military officer). The various government
 ministries are headed by "Secretaries", each of whom is
 subordinate to the respective PNDC member responsible for that
 particular area of government. A network of Committees for
 the Defense of the Revolution (CDR's) is designed as a channel
 to transmit government policies to the citizens and,
 theoretically, citizen concerns to the Government.
 There are several security organizations in Ghana which report
 to various sections of the Government, but all come under the
 firm control of the PNDC. Most security cases of a political
 nature are handled by the Bureau of National Investigation,
 which reports to both the Ministry of the Interior and the
 PNDC member responsible for security issues.
 Starting in 1983, the Government adopted an exceptionally
 austere economic recovery program in an effort to redress a
 quarter century of economic mismanagement and political
 instability which caused Ghana to decline from one of Africa's
 most promising states to a condition of economic collapse and
 poverty. Remedial measures have included a devaluation of
 more than 5,000 percent in the cedi in less than 4 years.
 Conducted in concert with the International Monetary Fund
 (IMF), the recovery program appears to have had a positive
 effect. The economic growth rate made a fourth consecutive
 positive showing in 1986 (the growth rate for 1986 was
 estimated at 5.1 percent), and triple digit inflation has been
 reduced to between 20 and 25 percent.
 Under Rawlings, the most noticeable improvement in human
 rights has been the restoration of civil order after an
 initial 18-month period of revolutionary excess in 1982 and
 1983. Discipline has generally been instilled in the armed
 forces and the police, but a number of coup plots came
 primarily from members and former members of the armed forces.
 In 1986 one coup attempt was publicly reported, and there were
 several alleged attempts. Problems also continue with certain
 paramilitary elements, such as the militia, which do not yet
 seem firmly under government control.
 Although the Government, through the National Commission on
 Democracy, continued in 1986 to "study" means of restoring a
 democratic system, there is still no guarantee of elections,
 nor are there any current plans to provide for a relaxation of
 government control of the main national newspapers and
 broadcast news media. The potential for arbitrary deprivation
 of liberty was demonstrated by continuing instances of
 incarceration without formal charges and summary dismissal of
 16 judges. A system of public tribunals, which parallels the
 regular courts, failed to enforce procedural safeguards
 adequate enough to constitute acceptable due process.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No killing was reported in which there was evidence of political
 motivation or governmental instigation.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearance traceable to government action or to
 nongovernmental or opposition forces was reported.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been occasional credible allegations of torture
 and/or beatings. Twice during 1985, the Government acknowledged
 that some members of the armed forces beat detainees. In March
 1986, during a series of trials of alleged coup plotters before
 the public tribunals, a defendant alleged that he and a fellow
 defendant had been tortured and, to prove his charge, stripped
 to the waist in court to show the scars caused by the alleged
 beatings. The Government has not refuted these allegations or
 made any known attempt to investigate them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ghanaian security forces occasionally take persons into custody,
 sometimes secretly late at night, with or without a warrant, and
 hold them incommunicado for months. Some of those so detained
 are said by government officials to have committed crimes,
 although their only known "offense" is the expression of views
 critical of, or different from, those of the Government. When
 the Ghana Bar Association has attempted to free some of these
 persons through writs of habeas corpus, the PNDC has either
 stood aside and permitted their release or has interposed ex
 post facto preventive custody orders barring their release and
 citing national security considerations as justification.
 In more routine criminal cases, detentions are generally
 performed in accordance with the legal procedures set forth in
 the criminal code. The criminal code requires that an arrested
 person be brought before a court within 48 hours and authorizes
 bail in many instances. Some writs of habeas corpus continued
 to be granted in 1986, but habeas corpus is limited by a 1984
 law which prevents any court from inquiring into the grounds for
 the detention of any Ghanaian detained under PNDC Law 2 (the law
 setting up the National Investigation Committee and giving that
 Committee the power to investigate virtually any allegation
 referred to it by the PNDC).
 On January 9, 1986 the last minister of the previous government
 still being detained was released on bail. Some other officials
 of the former government who fled Ghana in 1982 and 1983 have
 quietly returned and resumed careers outside of politics,
 reportedly convinced in at least some cases that the danger of
 detention has now passed. Although the Government does not
 announce detentions or releases, there were in 1986, as in
 previous years, a number of prisoners in detention without
 charge or trial. In April a group of four, including a student
 political leader and a journalist, was detained by the
 Government with no public explanation and without charges ever
 
 
 GHANA
 being brought. They were not released until August and were the
 subject of an Amnesty International Emergency Bulletin. In
 August a former government minister, Victor Owusu, was taken
 into detention, and at the end of 1986 no charges had been
 announced against him, and no hearing had been held.
 In August 1985, the Ghana Bar Association published a list of 17
 detainees being held without charge, carefully noting that it
 had published only the names of those for whom firm proof of
 detention was available. The newspaper which published the list
 has since been forced out of business, allegedly by governmental
 restrictions on the provision of newsprint to that particular
 paper.
 Ghana prohibits forced labor, except in the cases of military
 draftees and convicted criminals.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite the creation of a separate judicial system in the form
 of public tribunals and despite the lack of clear guidelines as
 to which cases should go before the tribunals and which before
 the regular courts, traditional legal safeguards based on
 British legal practice, e.g., the right of defendants to present
 evidence and to cross-examine witnesses, remains generally
 available in the regular court system. This system includes
 high courts, appeal courts, and a Supreme Court headed by a
 Chief Justice. Serious questions have arisen, however, about
 the independence of the regular courts. In April the PNDC
 overturned one of its own decrees, which provided for full
 hearings before a judge could be removed from office, and
 summarily dismissed 16 judges including 2 judges of the Court of
 Appeal (Ghana's second highest court). The PNDC alleged that
 these judges were guilty of various forms of malfeasance in
 office, but no formal charges were brought against them, and no
 hearings were ever held. Many legal observers believe that, by
 this action, the PNDC has put judges in the regular courts on
 notice that judges serve at the sufferance of the PNDC and must
 serve government purposes or be summarily removed from office.
 The public tribunals system, set up in 1982 to parallel the
 regular court system, includes the Office of Revenue
 Commissioners, the National Investigations Committee, the
 Special Military Tribunal, and the Public Tribunals Board, as
 well as the public tribunals per se, which exist at the national
 and regional levels and are planned for district and community
 levels. The Government's announced purpose when it established
 this system was to provide more justice to more people in a more
 timely fashion by deemphasizing legal "technicalities." In 1985
 a National Appeals Tribunal was created to hear appeals from the
 public tribunals. Critics contend, however, that the system
 still depends largely on judges with little or no legal
 experience, that it shortcuts legal safeguards in an effort to
 speed proceedings, and that it creates new opportunities for
 corruption because of ambiguities in the jurisdiction between
 the tribunals and the regular courts. Critics note, for
 example, that the panels of presiding judges contain more laymen
 than lawyers, that there are no published guidelines concerning
 the admissibility of evidence, and that conviction is by
 majority vote of the panel trying a case. Critics add that
 meaningful appeals are impossible because no adequate record is
 kept of initial hearings before tribunals, and judges on the
 appeals panel are drawn from the same pool of "lay judges" who
 hear the initial cases, which means some cases include judges
 who actively participated in the initial hearing under appeal.
 
 
 128
 GHANA
 The members of the Ghana Bar Association, citing such
 shortcomings, have elected not to practice before the tribunals,
 and few lawyers are willing to appear in cases before them. In
 1985 the Government approved the creation of a legal aid
 program, but at the end of 1986 this program had yet to be
 implemented.
 In 1986 the public tribunals continued the PNDC policy of
 imposing the death penalty for offenses that were essentially of
 an economic, "white collar" nature. For example, three
 government officials were sentenced to death by firing squad on
 September 26 for embezzling government funds. In May, after
 hearings before a Public Tribunal, nine people allegedly
 involved in coup plotting, including those who had allegedly
 been tortured during interrogation, were executed by firing
 squad.
 Amnesty International has adopted as a "prisoner of conscience"
 a Ghanaian who was sentenced by a public tribunal to 16 years in
 prison for complicity in a November 1982 coup attempt.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The individual citizen is, for the most part, free from
 interference by the State in his or her private conduct,
 although some critics fear that the Committees for the Defense
 of the Revolution (CDR's) have the potential to become
 "neighborhood watch committees", analogous to the Cuban model.
 However, while the Government holds that all citizens are
 "members" of the CDR's, at present actual participation in the
 system is voluntary. Monitoring of telephones and mail rarely
 occurs. Forced entry into homes has been reported in connection
 with security investigations. Informers exist, but informer
 systems, so far as is known, are not widespread. There is no
 forced resettlement of populations nor interference with the
 right to marry or to have children or for parents to provide
 religious instruction for their children.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedoms of speech and the press guaranteed under the now
 suspended 1979 constitution stand abrogated, but the PNDC
 Chairman has publicly encouraged people to speak out on local
 community concerns, though not on government policy. The
 Government owns the radio and television stations, as well as
 the two principal daily newspapers. The press avoids criticism
 of the revolution or of Chairman Rawlings. It focuses instead
 on uncovering instances of waste, fraud, and mismanagement, even
 when they involve relatively high-level officials (though such
 are usually government inspired).
 In the past several privately owned newspapers tried to be
 relatively bold in their news coverage and editorial comments,
 but most of these newspapers, for various reasons, have since
 closed down.   Government actions against the press continued in
 1986, e.g., by limiting supplies of newsprint to the independent
 press, thereby reportedly forcing one of the most outspoken
 newspapers into bankruptcy in early 1986. In December 1985, the
 Government banned publication of the Catholic Standard on
 political grounds. A church newespaper, the Standard was known
 for its independent stand on human rights and other issues.
 Despite efforts by the Catholic Church throughout 1986 to get
 
 
 129
 GHANA
 the Standard reopened, including public issuance of a Bishops'
 communique on the subject in September, it remains under
 government ban.
 Academic freedom tends to be respected within the confines of
 the campus. Private organizations voice occasional dissent from
 official policies but are denied access to the media and have
 difficulty reaching the public with their views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals are generally free to join together formally or
 informally to promote nonviolent causes, but restrictions remain
 on association for the purpose of protesting government
 policies. Political meetings are banned. Permits are required
 for public meetings but are routinely granted except when the
 meeting has an overtly political purpose.
 In 1986 the Trades Union Congress (TUC) continued to be led by
 officials freely elected in December 1983. New elections are
 slated for 1987. The TUC is associated with the International
 Labor Organization and with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity. The right to strike is recognized in law and in
 practice in Ghana. Ghanaian trade unions freely engage in
 collective bargaining with both private sector and state-owned
 enterprises, though in the latter category there are indications
 that the Government has, on occasion, used brief detentions and
 threats against union leaders to force agreement on issues
 involving state-owned enterprises. In April 1986, the TUC
 threatened to call a general strike, charging that the
 Government had changed wage and benefits policy unilaterally and
 negated the principle of free collective bargaining. Senior
 PNDC officials intervened to resolve the problem, and the
 Government now seems to be encouraging greater dialogue with the
 unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion and no restriction on the
 exercise of religion or on contacts with others of the same
 faith, though as the Catholic Standard case indicates, the
 Government will not hesitate to ban religious publications for
 alleged political content. Most Ghanaians, including senior
 government officials, are practicing members of religious
 groups. Foreign missionary groups operate freely throughout the
 country, though the "profusion" of such groups has come under
 criticism from the PNDC Chairman.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are free to move from one part of the country to another
 without special permission. Since 1983 some diplomats have been
 required to give 48 hours' notice before traveling outside the
 greater Accra region. Police roadblocks continue to exist
 countrywide, allegedly for the prevention of smuggling, but are
 less obtrusive than in the 1982-84 period. Roadblocks and car
 searches are still a normal part of nighttime travel in Accra,
 but are no longer conducted during the day.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States,
 Ghanaians are free to travel without visas for up to 90 days
 anywhere in West Africa. Ghanaians are generally free to
 exercise this right, and nationals of other member states are
 free to travel to Ghana. However, the Ghana/Togo border is
 
 
 130
 GHANA
 still closed following allegations of Ghanaian involvement in a
 September coup attempt against the Government of Togo. The
 major restraints on travel by Ghanaians are lack of foreign
 exchange and long delays in the issuance of passports.
 Ghanaians are free to emigrate or to be repatriated from other
 countries. If a person is considered a security threat, special
 permission must be obtained.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The PNDC under Chairman Rawlings exercises total executive,
 legislative, judicial, and administrative power in Ghana (PNDC
 Law 42). There are no other governing organs and no current
 procedure by which citizens can freely and peacefully change
 their laws, officials, or form of government. A panel to design
 new democratic structures to eventually replace Ghana's existing
 provisional system is in existence but has yet to publish any of
 its deliberations or a timetable. Efforts to give substance to
 the revolutionary slogan, "Power to the People", include
 elections for leadership positions at the local level to the
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. These efforts
 were purportedly intended to culminate in July 1986 with a
 National CDR Conference, but organizing difficulties limited the
 1986 CDR meetings to the regional level. Thus far, indications
 suggest that these CDR elections have been relatively free and
 open, but that the CDR's do not seem to be drawing support from
 a wide spectrum of the population. No claim is made by the
 Government, however, that these committees are meant to take the
 place of either elected local or national governing bodies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates with the International Committee of
 the Red Cross which continued its visits to prisons in Ghana in
 1986. There are several internal groups concerned with human
 rights, and they tend to be objective but not especially vocal
 or effective in their reporting. Nevertheless, various
 independent groups and organizations have worked for and have
 sometimes succeeded in gaining the release of persons from
 custody. Official human rights inquiries may be answered at
 various levels, including by cabinet secretaries. In 1986 no
 international human rights organization sent representatives to
 Ghana, although Amnesty International issued an urgent bulletin
 about certain individuals held in detention without charge.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on race, language, religion, or social
 status is not a problem in Ghana. Women's rights in business,
 the civil service, and the home have long been well established
 and respected. One woman serves as a member of the ruling
 PNDC. There is one woman in the Cabinet, and at least six women
 hold subcabinet positions. Although women in urban centers and
 those who have entered modern society encounter little bias in
 most endeavors, role pressures do exist. Women in the rural
 agricultural sector remain subject to the constraints associated
 with traditional male-dominant mores, in spite of efforts by the
 Government and more enlightened elements in the society to
 curtail such practices. In 1985 the Government promulgated four
 laws which overturned many of the discriminatory customary,
 traditional, and colonial laws, i.e., concerning family
 
 
 131
 GHANA
 accountability, intestate succession, customary divorce
 registrations, and the administration of estates.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Working conditions in Ghana are governed by labor legislation
 which specifically prohibits forced labor, sets a minimum
 employment age of 15, and prohibits night work and certain types
 of hazardous employment for those under 18 years of age.
 Government directives establish a minimum normal wage and,
 through both directives and union contracts, the normal hours of
 work are defined in terms of a 40-hour week. Labor legislation
 also provides for labor inspectors and gives them the power to
 order the alteration or closing of any work site "to avert any
 threat to the health or safety of the workers." Terms of
 employment and protection against arbitrary discharge are also
 covered by existing legislation.
