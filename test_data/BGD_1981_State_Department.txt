 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is one of the world's most impoverished and
 densely populated countries. Born only ten years ago in a
 bloody war of independence, Bangladesh suffered greatly at
 first from serious economic problems, exacerbated by an
 untrained bureaucracy and by political difficulties that
 incuded near anarchy and widely pervasive corruption.
 Although improvements have been made in recent years, the
 threat of natural disaster and economic breakdown must
 continue to be taken seriously.
 Bangladesh was governed by President Ziaur Rahman (Zia) from
 1975 to 1981. Zia first came to power as martial law
 administrator at the end of a series of military coups. Be
 was assassinated on may 30, 1981, as a result of a military
 mutiny against him by the garrison of Chittagong, where he
 was visiting. During Zia's years in office there were
 modest but broad-based improvements in the quality of public
 administration, in the economy and in public order. In the
 1978 national elections, Zia was elected president by a 77
 percent majority, and his party won more than two-thirds of
 the seats in the 1979 parliamentary elections. Zia's sudden
 death confronted Bangladesh with a political crisis, but the
 leadership has followed constitutional procedures. On
 November 15, 1981, acting president Abdus Sattar was elected
 to serve a full five year term as president. President
 Sattar has lifted the state of emergency decreed in the
 hours immediately after Zia's death.
 In November 1979, President Zia lifted an earlier, long-term
 state of emergency and martial law imposed in 1975. He-also
 restored the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution.
 The Special Powers Act of 1974 remains in effect. It
 allows, with certain safeguards, the government to detain
 any person indefinitely for having done, or to prevent him
 from doing, any "prejudicial act." A prejudicial act is
 defined as anything that the government considers contrary
 to the political or economic interests, safety or security
 of Bangladesh, including anything that will "cause fear or
 alarm to the public or to any section of the public." The
 act further provides for a degree of press control, the
 banning of all "associations or unions" pursuing a political
 purpose in the name of any religion, the suspension for up
 to six months of the activities of any association the
 government believes may act in a manner prejudicial to the
 maintenance of law and order, and the establishment of
 special tribunals to try violators of the act.
 The number of those in jail who could be termed political
 prisoners decreased slightly during the year. In April,
 1981 the home minister informed parliament that 403 persons
 were being held without trial under the Special Powers Act,
 in different jails throughout the country. Most of these
 are being held on charges unrelated to political activities
 or views. According to press repoits, thirty-three who had
 been held without trial were released at end of July 1981.

 Freedom of speech and association is respected; political
 parties carry on their activities with minimal restriction,
 and a large measure of press freedom exists. Although its
 efforts are limited by inadequate resources, the government
 emphasizes agricultural and rural development, so as to
 improve the lot of the predominantly rural population.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 35 of the constitution states that "no person shall
 be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading
 punishment or treatment." Amnesty International's 1981
 report refers to the death of a prisoner awaiting trial,
 Jheru Karmaker, in a jail hospital in January 1981 and cites
 the jail superintendent as saying he had been admitted to
 the hospital from police custody bearing marks of physical
 torture. Amnesty International also makes allegations of
 mass arrests, torture and forced explusion of hill tract
 tribal people. The report adds, however, that this informa-
 tion was difficult to assess, in part because official
 permission is required to enter the area - which has been
 the site of a low level insurgency that is described in a
 later section of this report.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 As noted above, such practices are forbidden by the constitution.
 Police officials who engage in torture, coerce or intimidate
 citizens, or otherwise abuse police powers are subject to
 prosecution under the criminal laws.
 Prisoners are divided by the court into classes I, II, III on
 the basis of such factors as occupation, education level
 and economic class (a distinction dating back to British
 days). Standards of meals and accommodations vary according
 to the class of the prisoner. Released prisoners have
 complained of inadequate nutrition and medical attention.
 Prisoners are allowed family visits and access to attorneys.
 Women prisoners are not treated differently from men but are
 accommodated separately. There is no differentation on the
 basis of religion or race.
 Bangladesh prisons are overcrowded, largely as a result of
 congestion in the court system, attributed to the shortage
 of rural magistrates. As a result, over 70 percent of
 prison inmates are "under-trial" prisoners--i.e., prisoners
 awaiting disposition of their cases by the courts. Summary
 executions are not practiced in Bangladesh. Punishments
 administered for criminal convictions following court
 sentencing are fines, imprisonment, imprisonment at hard
 labor, and the death penalty.
 c. Disappearances
 No evidence has surfaced of persons being abducted, secretly
 arrested, or held in clandestine detention by authorities of
 the present government, or by elements condoned by the
 government.
 
 
 943
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Preventive detention continues under the Special Powers Act.
 Detainees gain some protection against arbitrary treatment
 from provisions that require a magistrate's sanction of
 detention for more than 24 hours, central government
 approval beyond 30 days detention, and review of cases by
 persons qualified to be judges. A foodgrains supply ordinance,
 promulgated in July 1979 in response to drought-induced food
 shortages, also authorizes preventive detention for up to
 three months for hoarding. This ordinance has recently been
 relaxed and few, if any, persons have been detained under
 it.
 The government has often described as "political prisoners,
 all those detained under emergency legislation (today
 primarily the Special Powers Act), despite the range of
 grounds for detention (e.g., smuggling, black marketeering).
 However, it is estimated that the number of persons being
 held for political activities (often politically motivated
 violence) or views is actually not more than 30.
 Habeas corpus is established in Bangladeshi law. Over the
 past few years, habeas corpus petitions have resulted in the
 release of a substantial number of persons imprisoned under
 preventive detention laws. They are used less frequently to
 obtain release of "under-trial" prisoners.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In July-August 1981, in accordance with Bangladeshi military
 procedures, 31 military officers were tried by a field court
 martial for mutiny leading to the murder of President Zia.
 The government was widely criticized for allowing only three
 defense counsels for the entire group. Amnesty International
 called for an open trial, by either a civilian court or a
 general court martial, so that justice could be "seen to be
 done." Twelve of the convicted men were sentenced to death.
 An appeal for review of the court martial by the Bangladesh
 supreme court (on the grounds that none of the accused were
 given the time and facilities needed to prepare an adequate
 defense) was denied, after a five-day hearing. The twelve
 officers were hanged on September 23, 1981.
 Earlier in the year, in April, a general court martial had
 tried three retired and active army colonels and two civilians
 on charges of inciting military personnel to rebellion in
 June 1980. Amnesty International attempted to have an
 observer present at the trial; the observer was refused
 permission to attend, but was allowed to meet defense
 counsel and a number of senior government officials. AI
 later cabled the president, expressing concerns that the
 trial fell short of internationally recognized standards and
 contending that the trial should have been held by a civilian
 court with provision for appeal. A lawyer for one of the
 defendants, however, who is also an opposition politician,
 has been quoted as describing the trial itself to have been
 .very fair.*
 
 
 944
 Martial law courts ceased to exist after the 1979 withdrawal
 of martial law. Most civilian cases now come before the
 regular civil courts, while special tribunals established
 under the Special Powers Act continue to try offenses such
 as sabotage, subversion and black marketeering. Judges in
 special tribunals are drawn from civil courts, defendants
 enjoy the same rights as those under trial in civil courts
 and judgments can be appealed. However, persons convicted
 by the now-defunct martial law courts do not have the right
 of appeal.
 In the civil courts, defendants are guaranteed fair and
 public trials by the constitution. Defendants are entitled
 to counsel; lawyers have free access to defendants and
 experience little difficulty in holding private consul-
 tations with them. There have been no reported incidents of
 harassment of defense counselors by the government. Defen-
 dants are made aware of the charges against them, and they
 and their lawyers may inform themselves of the evidence upon
 which charges are based.
 A 1975 amendment to the constitution, which transferred
 "control and discipline of persons employed in the judicial
 service and magistrates" from the supremq court to the
 president, remains in effect. However, the courts operate
 with little interference from the executive branch.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Bangladeshi authorities do not engage in arbitrary invasion
 of the home. A judicial warrant is required before author-
 ities may enter a home, and courts require that there be a
 reasonable basis of suspicion of involvement in a crime
 before issuing such a warrant.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Preedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are provided for in articles 27 through 41 of
 the constitution. Freedom of speech and assembly were
 restored in 1978-79. Political parties and other groups now
 organize public meetings and freely express their views in
 these meetings.
 In 1979, the government amended the Printing, Press and
 Publications Act. This permitted several long-banned
 newspapers to resume publication. The press enjoys greater
 freedom today than it has had in some years. Many privately-
 owned papers, including Bangladesh's leading daily, often
 criticize the government. There are no documented instances
 of journalists being intimidated during 1981.
 Laws remain which give the government broad powers to control
 the press. The Special Powers Act prohibits the publication
 of a "prejudicial report," i.e., "any report that will
 prejudice the safety of the public or do damage to the state
 or its relations with any friendly power."
 
 
 945
 Pre-censorship of certain types of news articles is provided
 for by the act. Although these powers have not been used in
 recent years, their existence, as well as the government's
 control of newsprint and substantial public sector advertising,
 have caused some editors to exercise self-censorship on
 sensitive subjects.
 The government also is empowered to ban foreign and domestic
 books and magazines. The government invokes these powers
 rarely --. i.e., when it fears a publication will incite
 "hatred and violence" between religious communities. There
 were three such proscriptions in 1981. There are no reports
 of interference with academic inquiry in the natural or
 social sciences.
 Nearly 100 percent of industrial labor is organized, and
 "worker participation committees* are required for firms
 without unions. The government's new labor policy, enacted
 in May 1980, excludes wages and fringe benefits from the
 collective bargaining process in nationalized industries
 (about 80 percent of the industrial sector). The new policy
 establishes a limited right to strike, but only for 'non-
 essential* industries. The policy, allows a 30-day strike,
 although the government may intervene at any time to end it
 if it judges that the strike is harming local or national
 interests. While wages for nationalized industries are
 determined officially by a wage commission, it has become
 acceptable for unions to circumvent this restriction by
 bargaining over such matters as job classification. Most
 union leaders regard the government's new labor policy as no
 great gain.
 The government's policy is to support equal treatment and
 respect for the rights of religious minorities. Nonetheless,
 Bangladesh's Hindu minority (approximately 13 percent of the
 population) generally occupies a lower economic and educational
 status than that of the Muslim majority. This appears to be
 more the result of emigration in past years of the more
 prosperous and educated members of this community than of
 deliberate discrimination. Some minorities, principally
 Hindus, have encountered serious difficulties in retaining
 their properties as a result of Bangladesh's vested property
 laws. These laws--which provided that property belonging to
 a person who left Bangladesh between 1965 and 1971 shall be
 managed by the government--have been misused by unscrupulous
 officials to divest minorities of their property.
 An insurgent movement exists among the approximately 500,000
 tribal people who inhabit the Chittagong hill tracts district
 of Bangladesh. Their principal grievances are the government's
 claim to own land which the indigenous people regard as
 tribal property, and the movement of ethnic Bengalis into
 the hill tracts. These grievances are aggravated by a
 government program of resettling landless Bangladeshis from
 other areas into the hill tracts.
 Since mid-1980 a simmering, low-level state of guerrilla
 warfare has persisted in these areas, largely due to the
 presence there of over 10,000 resettled ethnic Bengalis.
 Some clashes between police, army, and border patrol units
 on the one hand, end tribal insurgents on the other, have
 taken place from time to time, but the number of deaths is
 
 
 946
 believed to be low. Fewer than fifty on each side are
 estimated to have died in 1980, and about 35 until end of
 September 1981.
 The government is trying to ensure that troops engaged in
 counter-insurgency operations act in a disciplined manner,
 while attempting to contain the insurgency by force of arms.
 The government has also tried to be responsive to the
 grievances of the tribal people by seeking negotiated
 solutions to tribal problems and by increasing the number of
 development projects in the district.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Bangladeshi citizens are free to move within the country.
 Under the Special Powers Act, the government has designated
 "Protected Areas" from which all non-residents may be
 banned. Bangladeshis regarded as "loyal citizens" are free
 to visit or emigrate abroad, subject to foreign exchange
 controls and, for civil servants, the granting of non-objec-
 tion certificates. Intending emigrants face no official
 harassment. The right to repatriation is observed in
 Bangladesh, and repatriates are not treated differently
 from other citizens. The government does not subject
 women to different rules for internal or foreign travel,
 emigration or repatriation. The government has no stated
 policy on refugee and asylum matters. However', in two
 instances in 1978 and 1979, the government provided temporary
 asylum and maintenance to sizeable groups of refugees
 until they could be repatriated safely and voluntarily.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political system is open to all Bangladeshi
 citizens. The people of Bangladesh chose their governing bodies
 through union council (township) elections in early 1978, a
 presidential election in mid-1978, parliamentary elections
 in early 1979, and the 1981 special Presidential election.
 These four elections were generally considered to have been
 relatively free and fair, despite some allegations of fraud.
 Voter turnout was about 53 percent in the parliamentary
 election and about the same in the most recent presidential
 election. In 1980 the government began establishing village
 governments whose members are elected by "consensus" (i.e.,
 in town meetings). The duties of these village councils
 have never been clearly defined by the central government.
 Since the lifting of the application of martial law on
 political activities in 1978, there have been no restric-
 tions on the activities of political parties. Some fifty
 parties are active and thirteen are represented in parliament.
 Political parties hold rallies, processions and demonstrations
 without restriction. Their leaders express themselves
 freely in public and in the press, although access to
 state-owned radio and TV is limited. The next parliamentary
 elections are scheduled to be held in 1983. The only
 current restriction is a 1978 ordinance which outlaws
 
 
 947
 parties "affiliated with, or funded by, foreign parties or
 governments and parties which maintain secret or underground
 organizations." In addition, the Special Powers Act gives
 the government authority to prohibit the formation of
 "subversive associations," whenever "there is a danger that
 the association may act in a manner, or be used for purposes,
 prejudicial to the maintenance of public order." This act
 also authorizes the government to prohibit the formation of
 associations based on any religion which pursues a political
 purpose.
 The constitution provides for equal rights for women in all
 spheres of public life. President Zia strongly encouraged
 the participation of women in the economic life of the
 country. Thirty appointed seats in parliament are reserved
 for women. They hold a few senior government positions,
 including two cabinet posts. In Bangladesh's traditional
 culture, however, women play mainly a domestic role.
 Approximately 250,000 Urdu-speaking Bihari Muslims who
 expressed a desire for Pakistai citizenship after the 1971
 war remain in Bangladesh since Pakistan has not agreed to
 accept them. Mostly housed in camps, members of the Bihari
 community are free to come and go at will, to seek employment
 and to conduct other normal activities. Those Biharis who
 did not opt for Pakistan are treated as citizens of Bangladesh
 and are able to enjoy the same rights as the majority
 Bengali-speaking population. A major difficulty some
 Biharis face is the loss of their properties as a result of
 laws confiscating Pakistani holdings. As a result of a 1976
 ordinance barring access to the courts in abandoned property
 cases, few Biharis in this position have been able to
 recover their properties. Freedom House in its 1981 report
 contends that the Bihari minority suffers discrimination.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 The Bangladesh government has allowed independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations. An
 Amnesty International representative last visited Bangladesh
 in early April 1981, at which time he did not receive the
 permission he requested to attend a general court martial
 proceeding. A number of international non-governmental
 human rights organizations, including Amnesty International,
 the International League for Human Rights and the International
 Commission of Jurists are represented in Bangladesh.
 Several organizations based in Bangladesh (as well as
 individual lawyers) are active in defending and promoting
 human rights. They do so.through publicity campaigns
 designed to inform people of their rights, through provision
 of legal aid to the poor and through challenges in the
 courts to government rules and actions. One of Bangladesh's
 senior judges sits on the Subcommission of the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances.
 The Bangladesh government is not able to guarantee its
 people the basic necessities required for health and
 well-being, and will not be able to do so until the problems
 
 
 948
 of population growth and insufficient agricultural production
 are overcome. Life expectancy at birth stands at 48.8
 years, the infant mortality rate per thousand live births is
 130, and the percentage of the population which has access to
 safe water is 53 percent (15 percent in urban areas). The
 population density is well over 1,500 per square mile, and
 the annual population growth rate is estimated at 2.5
 percent.
 Bangladesh is achieving steady, but slow growth in the
 agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 55
 percent of the gross domestic product and 70 percent of the
 labor force. Factors such as level delta land, heavy rainfall
 and a tropical location permitting year-around cropping
 favor an agricultural economy. Bangladesh's dependence,
 however, on monsoonal rains and primitive farming methods
 result in a precarious balance in nature, so that a tropical
 storm or a few weeks' variation in rainfall patterns can
 change subsistence into famine. In addition, a small
 average farm size (about two acres), a land-holding system
 whereby a significant percentage of the land is sharecropped,
 and fragmented holdings are obstacles to increased productivity.
 As a result, Bangladesh cannot meet its own food needs. The
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative
 to nutritional requirements is 91 percent. On a per capita
 basis, the nutritional intake is 1,870 calories per day, far
 below the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's
 recommended minimum of 2,332.
 The government has committed only about 8 percent of its
 total expenditures to education. It emphasizes vocational
 and post-secondary education for the masses. In 1981 the
 government embarked on a crash adult mass literacy program,
 but achieved very limited results. The average length of
 attendance in school for males is three and a half years,
 and for females three months. Over the last ten years,
 however, the percentage of the eligible population enrolled
 in primary schools has steadily increased from a 1973 figure
 of 36.4 percent to a 1976 level of 41.2 percent, and in 1978
 to 71 percent. Adult literacy stands at about 26 percent
 (37 percent for men and 13 percent for women).
 Eighty percent of the population are below the absolute
 poverty level. According to most indicators in a recent
 World Bank report, Bangladesh is the poorest large country
 in the world. Its per capita annual income is about $l00.
 Both economic constraints and cultural factors obstruct the
 search for solutions to the many problems which the govern-
 ment must address in order to meet basic human needs. The
 principal economic and social problems center on the lack of
 natural resources (other than some natural gas), landlessness,
 small industrial and service sectors based primarily on
 agriculture, and the extremely restricted education and
 employment available to most of the people, particularly to
 women.
 About 87 percent of the population of Bangladesh live in the
 rural areas. The issue of rural land ownership and tenancy
 remains intractable. Although one-half of the rural popu-
 
 
 949
 lation remains effectively landless, existing land holdings
 are already small and fragmented. Lack of trained personnel,
 poor transportation and communications, and the market
 advantages of the cities have discouraged industries from
 locating in the rural areas. The government has yet to find
 solutions to the problems of rural unemployment and under-
 employment.
 The industrial and service sectors are small, and therefore
 reduce the government's ability to make quick and significant
 improvements in employment levels and conditions. There are
 no accurate measurements of unemployment and underemployment,
 but a conservative estimate puts 30 percent of the work
 force in these categories. The major industries also
 function under difficult international and local conditions.
 For example, the government-owned textile industry is under
 strong pressure to improve and expand production in the face
 of rising costs of raw cotton imports, while maintaining low
 prices to accommodate a poor population.
 Present beliefs and underlying social barriers circumscribing
 the participation of women in activities beyond the home are
 strongly entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For
 the 90 percent of Bangladeshi women living in rural areas,
 early marriage, high fertility rates and long hours of
 unpaid labor leave little time for non-family interests or
 outside employment. Even in urban areas and among the
 well-to-do classes, social custom locks women into a pro-
 tective system which makes them the responsibility of their
 male relatives.
 The government has a minister for women's affairs who is a
 strong advocate of the economic emancipation of women.
 Despite the vigorous public and moral support of the late
 President Zia, only a small number of the 20 percent
 "set-aside* government jobs held for women have been filled
 as yet, and the ministry of women's affairs itself is no
 exception.
