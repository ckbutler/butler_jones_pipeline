 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Until December 1989, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was
 ruled as a centralized totalitarian state by the Communist
 Party of Czechoslovakia (CPCZ). The CPCZ leadership decided
 all important political, economic, social, and cultural
 questions and sharply limited the scope of individual human
 rights. A brutal police attack on peaceful student
 demonstrators on November 17, however, sparked massive street
 demonstrations which led to the overthrow of the old Communist
 leadership. In December the first Czechoslovak government
 since 1948 in which a majority of ministers were not
 Communists was installed, and the human rights activist,
 Vaclav Havel, was elected President.
 The new Government is led by Communist Prime Minister Marian
 Calfa but includes ministers associated with the Civic Forum,
 a new prodemocracy opposition group. The Government committed
 itself to free elections, an economic reform program leading
 to a market economy, and an overhaul of Czechoslovak laws
 governing human rights.
 The Government also pledged to gain control of the Ministry of
 Interior, which includes a large, well-funded internal
 security establishment used as an instrument of control by the
 CPCZ. The new First Deputy Prime Minister, Jan Carnogursky,
 who had been imprisoned for a portion of 1989 for his human
 rights activities, was given primary responsibility for
 restructuring the Ministry. In December the Government also
 acted to disarm the People's Militia, the CPCZ's private
 army. The militia has since been disbanded.
 Czechoslovakia's centrally planned economy has allowed
 virtually no private enterprise or ownership in manufacuturing,
 retail operations, agriculture, or services. In recent years,
 the economy, characterized by excessive central planning,
 obsolete equipment and infrastructure, and an almost complete
 lack of incentives for innovation and initiative, had become
 less competitive in world markets. The ministers responsible
 for economic affairs in the new Government have committed
 themselves to creation of a mixed economy responsive to the
 demands of the marketplace.
 The human rights situation worsened until November 1989. The
 4-month imprisonment of playwright Vaclav Havel for his
 peaceful participation in a January demonstration drew
 international condemnation, but dozens of lesser known persons
 were also sentenced to prison or fined for exercising their
 freedoms of speech, assembly, and association provided in the
 Constitution. Other human rights concerns included arbitrary
 detention, arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home,
 and correspondence, and restrictions on freedom of religion
 and worker rights.
 The following report primarily describes the human rights
 situation as it existed before the November 17 student
 demonstration which precipitated the overthrow of the CPCZ
 leadership. Most of the practices that led to widespread
 human rights abuses appeared to have been abandoned by year's
 end, and important changes were being considered. The next
 annual report is likely to include a significantly different
 assessment of human rights practices.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No substantiated reports suggesting political or extrajudicial
 killings came to public attention in 1989. A report that a
 person named Tomas Smid had been killed by police during the
 November 17 demonstration proved false, and the special
 commission investigating the events of November 17 had not
 found evidence that anyone had died as a consequence of the
 police attack.
 b. Disappearance
 At year's end, the Government was unable to substantiate
 reports that several students involved in November
 demonstrations and strikes had disappeared.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The-forfer government did not appear to practice a systematic
 program of torture. However, several persons detained for
 their participation in week-long demonstrations in January,
 commemorating the death of student Jan Palach 20 years
 earlier, were'severely beaten by police. Czechoslovak
 security officers on several occasions also attacked and beat
 human rights activists, such as Petr Placak, Josef Kuhn, and
 Stanislav Penc. In addition, Stanislav Devaty, while jailed
 and:awaiting trial, was chained to a bed in a cold cell for
 several hours while dressed only in his underwear.
 A 1985'Helsinki Watch report strongly criticized prison
 conditions-in Ciechoslovakia. Generally, prison conditions
 have been poor, especially the "third category" of imprisonment
 (the 'harshest regime). Cells are'usually small and unheated,
 family visite'and correspondence are strictly limited, and
 prisoneirs-rport such punishments as reduction in pay:and
 limitations on free time, bathing, and exercise periods if
 they fail to meet unrealistically high production standards.
 Informed sources also reported that prisoners were assigned
 hazardous work such as polishing crystal and costume jewelry
 in environments lacking sufficient ventilation to prevent
 glass fragments and chemicals from being inhaled. Sanitary
 and medical facilities and diet were reported to be inadequate.
 Former prisoners have reported that prison guards sometimes
 encourage hardened criminals to prey on persons serving
 sentences for political offenses. Prisoners or former
 prisoners who complained publicly of mistreatment had been
 severely punished and sometimes sentenced again for having
 complained.
 No consensus exists among independent observers regarding
 whether or not there was widespread abuse of psychiatry in
 Czechoslovakia. H6wever, one case of possible psychiatric
 abuse involved Augustin Navratil, the Catholic activist who
 drafted a 31-point petition for religious freedom. In October
 1988 Navratil was committed involuntarily to inpatient
 psychiatric care for an indefinite period. This decision was
 made despite an examination in September by Western physicians
 who reportedly found Navratills mental condition to be within
 
 
 1074
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 "normal parameters." Navratil was released from psychiatric
 care in early 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Until November, Czechoslovak citizens, especially human rights
 activists, were frequently arrested, detained, interrogated,
 and subjected to personal and home searches for the expression
 of personal views. Judicial and police authorities often
 explained such actions in legal terms and performed them with
 warrants. They also arrested and detained citizens without
 warrants. Under existing law, a person may be detained for
 cause for up to 48 hours without being charged. although in
 practice this limit was not always observed, and the
 authorities used the discretionary powers of the prosecutor
 general to extend such detentions. Searches, detentions, and
 frequent interrogations were among the tactics used by the
 regime when it decided to harass rather than to prosecute.
 Dozens of activists from Charter 77 and other independent
 initiatives were detained during the days before the August 21
 anniversary of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and the
 October 28 anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak
 Republic. Other activists had been warned that they would be
 detained if found in Prague and chose to remain outside the
 city. None of those detained were charged with violations of
 criminal law.
 Detentions were also used before November as a means of
 preventing human rights activists from attending meetings or
 harassing them after a meeting. Members of the reform
 Socialist club Obroda were detained and subjected to
 interrogation on several occasions to prevent their attendance
 at Obroda meetings. Security forces prevented the three
 Charter 77 spokespersons, Vaclav Havel, Dana Nemcova, and
 Tomas Hradilek from meeting together in September, and Havel
 was detained in August in an apparent attempt to prevent his
 attendance at a meeting of the Czech chapter of PEN, an
 international writers' organization. Police detained members
 of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee in September as
 committee members left a meeting and then interrogated them
 and confiscated their papers. One independent observer
 believes there were hundreds, perhaps up to 1,000, such
 detentions until November.
 According to law, a detainee could be held in investigative
 detention for 2 months if the authorities decided to press
 charges. A detainee could generally receive visits by family
 members only after a trial. Investigative detention could be
 extended beyond 2 months at the request of the prosecution,
 and detainees were sometimes held for long periods without
 being brought to trial. Cultural activist Petr Cibulka was
 held in detention for over a year while awaiting trial and was
 allowed only one visit, from his mother, during the entire
 period of detention.
 Although the former government did not formally impose
 internal exile or house arrest, it introduced in 1984, for the
 first time, a regime of "protective supervision" which
 combined features of both. Protective supervision included
 travel restrictions, curfews, frequent searches of persons,
 homes, and guests, and the obligation to report regularly--
 sometimes as often as once a day--to the police. The
 imposition of such a regime, intended for habitually violent
 offenders, against persons who never committed or advocated an
 
 
 1075
 
 CZECHOSLOVAXIA
 act of violence was a form of harassment that sharply
 curtailed their freedom of movement and isolated them from
 normal contact with those outside their h6me.
 Since 1986 there have been no reports of the Government's use
 of forced exile to rid itself of critics. Prior to that time,
 people working or visiting'abroad with official permission
 were at times stripped of their citizenship and refused the
 right to return. The authorities on occasion exerted heavy
 pressure to emigrate on those who had already served a jail
 sentence. If they refused, they and their families suffered
 harassment, denial of jobs and schooling, and the threat of
 rearrest. After a year or more of this treatment, some
 ex-prisoners applied for emigration passports.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Accoiding to Czechoslovak law, people 'charged with criminal
 offenses-are entitled to fair and open public trials. They
 have a right to be informed concerning the-charges against
 them,'to retain counsel, and to present a defense. In
 practice, however, the exercise of these rights was often
 reduced to a mere formaliiy; especially where political
 offenses were concerned.
 The judiciary  tas not independent of the regime and the
 Communist Party. In theory, judges could be removed only by
 the Federal Assembly (national parliament) or by the Czech or
 Srovak National Councils (regional parliaments). In practice,
 they were subject to.direct control and supervision by the
 CPCZ;-to which most judges'belonged.
 Defendants may either choose their own lawyers or request
 court:-appointed-lawyers. However, lawyers were subject to
 direct and indirect pressures from political authorities and
 fn the piat did not always vigorously represent their clients.
 In-1989; however, most independent observers'believe defense
 lawyers generally offered vigorous defenses in cases involving
 politidal charges. Defendants occasionally succeeded in
 having charges dismissed or reduced at the original trial, but
 the prosecution could file an appeal, which sometimes resulted
 in an increase in the sentence or additional charges.
 In 1989 it was easier for friends of defendants, press
 representatives, diplomats, and representatives of human
 rights organizations to attend trials with political content.
 Courtroom size on several occasions prevented all' interested
 observerls from attending a trial, but there'was no evidence of
 manipdlated assignment of courtrooms to limit attendance. The
 authoritiei-also resorted to' a ticketing system for admission
 to trials of particularly prominent human rights activists,
 such as Vaclav Havel. In the Havel trial, there were no
 diplomats in the handful of foreign observers who were
 admitted.
 Persons *arrested for expressing personal views that took issue
 with the Communist regime's official position generally were
 charged with 'subversion," "incitement," or "damaging the
 interests of the republic' abroad." Those arrested for
 religious activities usually were charged with "obstructing
 seate supervision of churches and religious societies."
 The former authorities also resorted to arbitrary or
 trumped-up criminal charges (e.g., "hooliganism" or "illegal
 enterprising") to punish those whose real offense was to
 
 
 1076
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 engage in unauthorized political or cultural activity. The
 hooliganism charge was used against some of those detained in
 connection with January and August 1989 demonstrations in
 Prague. A charge of illegal enterprising was the
 prosecutorial tactic employed against Petr Cibulka.
 The new Government has announced plans to revise the existing
 penal code during 1990, focusing on both procedural and
 substantive provisions of the law. Special attention will be
 devoted to those provisions used in the past to prosecute
 human rights and religious activists.
 Figures available from the Committee for the Defense of the
 Unjustly Persecuted (VONS), which documents individual cases
 to the best of its ability, suggest there were at least 25
 political prisoners in Czechoslovak jails in 1989. However, a
 sweeping amnesty signed in December by former President Gustav
 Husak provided for the release of virtually all persons who
 might have been imprisoned for political offenses. Among
 those not covered by the amnesty were those convicted of
 espionage. Indications are that the new Government, pursuant
 to a request by VONS officials, will review the cases of
 several persons whose convictions for espionage might have
 been politically motivated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The former government monitored and controlled the activities
 of citizens whom it suspected of engaging in antiregime or
 independent activity. Consequently, it also interfered with
 privacy of communications.
 Those who were considered opponents of the regime bore the
 brunt of heavily intrusive surveillance. They, their families,
 and their friends were subjected routinely to such measures as
 electronic surveillance, home searches, tapping of telephones,
 and interception and destruction of mail. The new Government
 has begun the task of dismantling the special security units
 which carried out these activities against human rights
 activists and others considered enemies of the Communist
 regime. It also transferred control of wiretap facilities
 from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of
 Transportation and Communication and ordered sealing of the
 facilities.
 Discrimination in employment was a regular aspect of the
 harassment and persecution of dissidents and their families.
 Instilling fear among intellectuals and white-collar workers
 that their children might be denied higher education was a
 factor in discouraging open dissent. These tactics were
 discontinued after November.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 freedom of the press, it states that these freedoms must be
 exercised -in accordance with the interests of the working
 class." In effect, persons who voiced opinions publicly that
 differed from party policy or that questioned the legitimacy
 of party rule faced fines and imprisonment, especially when
 they asked others who shared their opinions to join them.
 
 
 1077
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Before November, for example, Stanislav Devaty was sentenced
 to 20 months' imprisonment for circulating a petition in
 support of political prisoners. Ivan Jirous and Jiri Tichy
 were sentenced to 16 and 6 months respectively for circulating
 a petition criticizing the Communist management of
 Czechoslovakia since 1948, and Renata Panova was sentenced to
 3 months' imprisonment for the distribution of political
 leaflets.
 As a consequence of the November demonstrations and the
 installation of the new Governmen-, persons were able to
 exercise their right to freedom of speech without official
 interference. The Government promised to enact new laws
 formally-guaranteeing freedom of speech no later than February
 1990.
 The former government also attempted to repress a petition
 campaign centered around-a document entitled "Nekolik Vet"
 (Several Sentences). The document called, among other things,
 for a release of political prisoners, respect for human rights,
 a public discussion of a new constitution, and reevaluation of
 the 1968 Soviet-led invasion which crushed the Prague Spring.
 The petition was signed by about 40,000 people before the
 events of November 17. Dozens of persons who collected
 signatures for the petition were fined for their activities,
 usually between $300 and $500 (i.e., in excess of 1 month's
 wages for the average worker.) Two of the petition's four
 "guarantors" of the signatures, StanislavDevaty and Sasa
 Vondra, were sentenced to prison terms after the petition drive
 began, although their convictions were technically based on
 other charges.
 All domestic radio and televison broadcasting facilities are
 government owned. Self-c.ensorship of news and entertainment
 programs-under CPCZ guidelines was practiced, and there was no
 oppogtunity for views contrary to CPCZ policies to be
 expressed.. However, beginning ii  late November a dramatic
 change occurred as television and radio workers challenged the
 former regime, and radio and television newscasts began
 presenting objective reports of events. Opposition political
 groups were also given air timeto present their views.
 In December 1988 the former government ceased jamming Radio
 Free Europe broadcasts for the first time -in two decades.
 Voice of America and other Western radio broadcasts, also were-
 not jamied. Many people who live near the country's western
 or southern borders can routinely receive Western television
 broadcasts while those in the interioz of the country may do
 so by means of special antennas or satellite dishes.
 All officially recognized newspapers and magazines were
 published and controlled by mass organizations of the National
 Front (e.g., the Union of Socialist Youth, Revolutionary Trade
 Union Movement, or Sports Federation.) -These in turn were
 controlled by the Communist Party. Legally published religious
 literature and'periodicals were subject to strict censorship
 and were available only in.limited editions. Publishing houses
 and the news media, all state owned, employed self-censorship
 under CPCZ guidelines. Editors who.were insufficiently
 vigilant suffered fines or dismissal. Nonetheless, even
 before the events of November 17, some journalists took an
 increasingly more critical line concerning government and
 party policies. In the wake of November 17 the self-
 censorship seen befgre.all but disappeared.
 
 
 1078
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The independent newspaper, Lidove Noviny, began publication in
 1988. Although authorities refused to register the publication
 officially and in 1989 imprisoned its two editors, Jiri Ruml
 and Rudolf Zaman, the monthly continued to appear. Other
 samizdat (self-published) material included a newsletter
 entitled Informace 0 Charte 77 (Information About Charter 77),
 which carried Charter 77 documents and VONS communiques
 reporting human rights violations. In addition, an independent
 new agency called the East European Information Agency was
 formed in December 1988 and functioned throughout 1989,
 providing reports to Western and other new media.
 Some samizdat literature was sent abroad, where it was
 reprinted in emigre publishing houses and then brought back to
 Czechoslovakia. Persons engaging in independent publishing
 activities in 1989 included Frantisek Starek, who received a
 30-month sentence, plus 2 years' protective supervision, in
 connection with the samizdat publications Vokno and Voknoviny
 that he compiled and distributed.
 During 1989 only a limited number of Western non-Communist
 periodicals were imported, and these were usually not
 available to ordinary citizens. No Western non-Communist
 newpapers or newsmagazines were available to the general
 public. Access to Western political publications was limited
 to persons who had obtained special permission from their
 employers or their universities documenting their need for the
 material for official purposes.
 At the end of 1989 virtually complete artistic freedom had
 come to exist in Czechoslovakia. A public reading of a play
 of Vaclav Havel, whose plays had been banned, had been given,
 and plans were under way by several theaters to feature works
 by Havel during 1990. In addition, one student group was
 performing "Animal Farm," a previously banned work. Several
 samizdat publications, such as the newspaper Lidove Noviny,
 had also announced plans to begin regular publication.
 Academic freedom, as it is known in the West, did not exist.
 All universities and research institutes were operated by the
 State or party, and all teaching and research was required to
 conform to official requirements. In areas such as foreign
 policy or contemporary history, these requirements narrowly
 circumscribed the content of research and teaching to the
 virtual exclusion of independent investigation, but discussion
 concerning economic and environment issues was much freer than
 several years ago. Somewhat greater freedom was also allowed
 in scholarship not involving politically sensitive subjects.
 Admission to study at the university level was based on party
 connections and political reliability as well as merit.
 Communist Party membership typically was a prerequisite to
 advancement beyond lower level teaching positions, as was
 basic conformity to orthodox opinions, at least superficially.
 Academics were among those who were required to report
 contacts with Westerners and an "official reason" was
 typically needed to associate with Western diplomats.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly,
 that freedom was severely limited in practice until November.
 Public meetings could be held only with the permission of the
 police, and this permission depended upon whether or not the
 proposed meeting supported state objectives. A 1988 Prague
 
 
 1079
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 -ordinance banned independent demonstrations in the city's
 -historic Wenceslas.and Old Town Squares, although state-
 sponsored rallies continued to.take place there. When the
 authorities wished-to have a.la.rge rally, such as May Day or
 "pe-ace" demonstrations, they exerted pressure on people to
 attend.
 In. January -989,opolice used tear gas, water cannon, dogs, and
 baton charges to disperse.crowds which peacefully gathered in
 Prague's Wenceslas Square for a week-long series of
 demonstrations to commemorate .the anniversary of the 1969
 solfinmmolation of Jan Palach. Vaclav Havel, Jana Petrova,
 Miroslav Sramek, and Otakar Veverka all were convicted for
 thetr.participation in the demonstrations and served from 1 t6
 6 months in prison. Stanislav Penc, Petr Placaki-Jana
 Sternova, and Sasa Vondra were convicted for laying flowers on
 Prague's Wenceslas Square to commemorate Jan Palach's death,
 but the sentences were suspended.
 On Miy 1, a-few-hundred demonstrators attempted to mount a
 counterdemonstration on-Wenceslas Square in juxtaposition with
 an officially sponsored May Day rally. -police broke up the
 .counterdemonstration and-detained approximately 50 persons.
 Among those detained~was a British reporter who tried to
 interview demonstrators.
 On'August 21, the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Soviet-led
 invasion that put an end. to the Prague Spring, the authorities
 suppressed a peaceful demonstration in Prague; Several
 thousand persons-marched for more than 3 hours.until police
 finally dispersedthe crowd, detaining 320 persons.
 On October 28, the anniversary of Czechoslovakia.'s founding as
 an independent state, a crowd of about 10,000 people gathered
 in Wenceglas Square to call for freedom and democracy. Police
 equipped with .riot gear broke up the demonstration, arresting
 at least 250 persons.
 -The November 17 demonstration started as an officially
 sanctioned -rally to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
 death of Jan Opletal, a student leader killed by the Nazi
 Gestapo. The event was jointly sponsored'by the Socialist
 Youth Union and-an independent student group. After the -.
 completion of the official portion of the program,
 demonstrators.numbering up to 50,000 persons attempted to
 march to Prague's Wenceslas Square, but were prevented from
 doing so by a line of police'equipped,with riot gear. After a
 peaceful stand-off of about an hour between the police and.
 demonstrators, the police and-special antiterrorism units of
 the Interior Ministry attacked the demonstrators, using
 truncheons, tear gas, and dogs.
 A special commission of the Federal Assembly investigating the
 events of November 17 determined that at least 291 persons,
 including 7 American Sournalists,'were injured by the police
 attack.**Early reports that a student.had.been.killed during
 the attack proved-.alse, and the'special commission at year's
 end:.had not unearthed evidence that. anyone had died as a
 consequehce of the attack. Former Prague Communist Party
 leaderM roslav Stepan and at least e'ight police officers
 faced criminal charges for their role in the police attacks.
 After November 17, massive demonstrations occurred in Prague
 for 10 cbnsecutive days, with crowds at times reaching
 one-half million persons. Large demonstrations in Bratislava
 
 
 1080
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 and other Czechoslovak cities occurred as well during this
 period, and all of them without police interference.
 The new Government has committed itself to sponsoring
 legislation which would guarantee Czechoslovaks the right to
 peaceful assembly. Such a right already existed in fact at
 the end of 1989. The mayor of Prague promised that police
 would not interfere with peaceful demonstrations, and several
 took place without incident.
 The former government did not permit the establishment of
 independent associations. All social and other groupings were
 required to register with the National Front, an umbrella
 organization including the CPCZ and all legal political and
 social groups.
 In May 1987, the founding committee of a proposed organization
 to be named the Society of Friends of the United States (SPUSA)
 submitted a request for approval of its bylaws to the Ministry
 of Interior. The organization was to be a voluntary, social
 association within the framework of the.National Front, and
 dedicated to developing friendship, trust, and understanding
 between Czechoslovakia and the United States. Following final
 rejection of its application, SPUSA reorganized itself as an
 informal "association." SPUSA was characterized by the
 authorities as an antistate organization. SPUSA cofounder
 Stanislav Devaty was sentenced to up to 20 months'
 imprisonment in August, and other SPUSA activists were
 subjected to repeated harassment by security officials.
 Other citizens, groups subjected to official harassment or
 unable to secure official recognition include the Independent
 Peace Association, the Movement for Civil Liberties, Obroda,
 the John Lennon Peace Club, and the Democrative Initiative.
 Citizens interested in the environment and in the visual and
 performing arts (including rock and punk groups,) although
 also harassed, had some success in organizing indepen4ent
 activities.
 The former authorities in 1989 permitted establishment of an
 "Art Forum" for the promotion of independent cultural
 activities. The Art Forum was set up under the direction of
 Karel Srp and Joska Skanik, formerly imprisoned leaders of the
 Jazz Section.
 After November, a multitude of independent organizations,
 including political parties, were created by Czechoslovak
 citizens. The new Government has not interfered or attempted
 to regulate the formation or activities of such groups.
 In 1989 meetings between citizens and foreign visitors to
 Czechoslovakia generally passed without incident. Police in
 July did detain Jiri Hajek, the Foreign Minister during the
 Prague Spring, preventing him from lecturing to a group of
 visiting West Germans concerning the 1968 reform program.
 Other Czechoslovaks invited to speak to the same group were
 warned they would be detained if they attempted to deliver a
 lecture. In October Jeri Laber, a Helsinki Watch official,
 was briefly detained with members of the Czechoslovak Helsinki
 Committee when they attempted to meet in a Prague restaurant.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 "Scientific atheism" was part of.t-he official ideology, and
 freedom of religion, provided for in the Constitution, was
 
 
 1081
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 strictly limited in practice. The former regime actively
 discouraged all religious activity, especially among the
 young. Teachers, policemen, Communist Party officials, and
 members of certain other professions encountered problems in
 their careers if they were seen in church.
 The former government exercised strict control over all
 religious affairs. Churches were required to register with it
 in order to function legally in Czechoslovakia. Groups which
 proselytize, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, were
 banned outright, and their members suffered frequent
 harassment and arrest. Jehovah's Witnesses were reported in
 several prisons, most apparently because of a refusal to serve
 required military service, but there was no reliable estimate
 of their number.
 Organized religious practice was hampered by both written and
 unwritten restrictions. For example, the ability of clergymen
 to engage in religious work, including charitable endeavors
 outside church premises, was severely restricted. The State
 approved the assignments of clergymen and used its power to
 harass those it deemed too popular or active. In addition,
 clergymen were paid by the State and were required to obtain a
 state license in order to practice. Such licenses were often
 withdrawn without explanation. In 1989 two ministers of the
 Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren, Zvonimir Sorm and Pavel
 Pokorny, lost their licenses as a consequence of their
 relations with independent political groups. Estimates of the
 number of clergymen who had lost their licenses vary, but they
 are known to. have included several bishops. Those who
 continued to practice despite revocation of their licenses
 were liable to criminal prosecution.
 Religious instruction in the home was forbidden, although in
 1989 there were no reports of interference by the former
 government with such instruction. In the past, parents were
 required to apply to local authorities if their children were
 to receive religious education at state schools, but changes
 in 1989 provided that requests for religious instruction were
 to be made directly to a church representative. A student was
 to be registered automatically for religious instruction if
 both parents agreed. Instruction for Catholic children was
 provided at school but was limited to 1 hour per week for
 grades 2 through 7. Instruction for Protestant children took
 place at church, as arranged between the leaders of each
 religious denomination and the former government. School
 authorities warned parents that participation in religious
 classes could be damaging toa child's education and career
 prospects.
 Although the former government stated its intention to
 increase the supply of religious literature, printing was
 severely restricted, and Bibles were in short supply. Bibles
 and other religious literature were smuggled in from abroad
 and produced by underground samizdat methods. Government
 efforts'to confiscate smuggled religious materials or shut
 down samizdat sources of materials appeared to have been less
 extensive in 1989 than in previous years.
 The authorities did not facilitate travel by religious
 officials to and from Czechoslovakia unless the proposed visit
 served the purpose of the State. In the case of the Catholic
 Church, the former government did not invite Pope John Paul II
 to visit Czechoslovakia despite Cardinal Tomasek's request
 that an official invitation be issued and the existence of
 
 
 1082
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 petitions supporting such a visit signed by thousands of
 persons. Priests and other religious leaders were frequently
 denied permission to travel outside the country, although in
 1989 denial of permission to travel was less frequent, and
 Cardinal Tomasek and some 10,000 Czechoslovaks were allowed to
 travel to Rome for the canonization of Agnes of Bohemia.
 The State maintained all church property. In practice, this
 meant that the vast majority of church property was very
 poorly maintained. For many years, no proposed construction
 of new Catholic churches had been approved. However, some
 Protestant congregations--including Baptists--had been allowed
 to build new churches.
 The Roman Catholic Church is the largest of Czechoslovakia's
 19 officially registered religious bodies. There are an
 estimated 6 to 7 million Roman Catholics in the country, and
 up to 300,000 members of the affiliated Greek Catholic
 (Uniate) Church. The Greek Catholic Church was reestablished
 in 1968 after having been forcibly united with the much
 smaller Orthodox Church in 1950. However, the Greek Catholics
 have been unable to reclaim much of their property, which
 remains in the possession of the Orthodox Church.
 In early 1989, only 2 of the country's 13 dioceses had
 bishops. During the course of 1989, the former regime
 approved the appointment of four new bishops to fill empty
 bishoprics. Students in Czechoslovakia's 2 remaining Catholic
 seminaries (out of a prewar total of 13) needed state approval
 to be admitted and ordained. Although the State in recent
 years had raised the limits on the number of Catholic
 seminarians, large numbers of qualified applicants were denied
 admission to theological studies.
 In 1950 all male religious orders were dissolved. A few
 female religious orders were allowed to continue functioning
 and for the first time since a brief period in 1968 were
 allowed to admit a limited number of new members. Despite
 these limitations, some Catholic monastic orders continued to
 operate clandestinely.
 In Slovakia there were several Catholic pilgrimages in 1989 in
 which several hundred thousand people took part. There was no
 substantial police interference with the pilgrimages, except
 for one in Nitra where the authorities controlled the
 pilgrimage's program.
 "Pacem in Terris," the state-sponsored "peace association" of
 Catholic clergy, had been a major instrument of state control
 over the Catholic Church. The association had been losing
 ground since 1982 when the Vatican- banned clerical
 participation in political organizations worldwide, and
 Cardinal Tomasek and the overwhelming majority of Catholic
 clergy in Czechoslovakia disassociated themselves from "Pacem
 in Terris.-
 Protestant denominations registered by the authorities also
 operated under state-imposed constraints. Proselytizing was
 forbidden; religious ceremonies were mostly restricted to
 church premises; and education of the clergy was closely
 controlled. In 1989 the former government recognized another
 Protestant denomination, the Apostolic Church of Bohemia.
 Two Jewish community councils, one in the Czech lands and the
 other in Slovakia, serve the Jewish community of several
 
 
 1083
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 thousand. These councils have been central religious
 organizations financially supported and controlled by the
 Government. There are synagogues and prayer houses open for
 worship and two rabbis, one in*Prague and one in Kosice.
 Religious ritual articles and kosher meat are available in
 limited supply. There is no rabbinical seminary. In late
 December, the Czech Jewish Community (Council of Jewish
 Communities of Bohemia and Moravia) in its first free election
 in decades elected a highly respected former leader ousted
 earlier by the regime because of his independence.
 Officials of the new Government indicated they would support
 repeal of a 1949 law regulating relations between the State
 and churches, and churches therefore will be free to conduct
 their own affairs without state interference.
 Towards the end of 1989, the Minister of Culture of the new
 Czechoslovak government advised Roman Catholic Church
 officials that they were free to fill empty bishoprics without
 gaining prior approval of the State, and the Vatican thereupon
 named three new bishops, leaving four empty bishoprics at the
 end of 1989. In addition, priests and ministers who had
 previously lost their licenses to practice have been allowed
 to return to religious work, including Father Vaclav Maly, a
 former Charter 77 spokesman. The Catholic Church also
 announced plans to open three additional seminaries. Those
 priests who were still members of "Pacem in Terris" notified
 Cardinal Tomasek in December that the organization had ceased
 its activities and disbanded.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 For all Czechoslovaks, freedom of movement has been restricted
 near military installations and along the borders with Austria
 and the Federal Republic of Germany. Movement within the rest
 of the country was not restricted for most citizens. However,
 the former government restricted the movements of Charter 77
 activists and other "suspect" persons, especially to prevent
 their participation in independently organized activities.
 During 1989 the former government eased regulations affecting
 travel to the West. It also announced that it would lift the
 exit permit requirement for private travel in 1990, an action
 which in fact was taken after the events of November.
 Travel by citizens of Czechoslovakia to East European
 countries also was regulated. The new Government at year's
 end had not taken action to alter these regulations.
 Citizens deemed politically unreliable were often denied
 permission to travel outside of Czechoslovakia. They often
 were not provided with substantive reasons for the denials,
 making it difficult to appeal the denials to higher
 administrative authorities. In 1989 Czechoslovak authorities
 temporarily stripped Charter 77 founder Jiri Hajek of his
 passport after Hajek traveled to Norway to attend a conference
 of the Socialist International, but the passport was later
 restored to him. The new Government issued passports to many
 persons who had formerly been denied them.
 The right to emigrate has been extremely limited. In general,
 ,only those wishing to join a foreign citizen spouse, or, in
 the case of retired persons, foreign citizen children abroad,
 
 
 1084
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 have had this right. In 1989 the former government eased a
 series of restrictions affecting family reunification.
 Emigration passports have not been valid for return without
 special endorsement, and in some cases permanent exile has
 been a condition for emigration or study abroad. Czechoslovak
 authorities in 1989 decided administratively not to prosecute
 persons who traveled or remained abroad without permission.
 The law which punishes unauthorized travel remains on the
 books, although authorities have indicated plans to
 decriminalize such travel.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have not had the right to change the political
 leadership or the system of government. The Communist Party
 leadership made all significant decisions regarding
 government, economic, and social affairs. Real power was
 exercised by only a few top-level officials in the party
 presidium and secretariat. They determined who would be
 placed in decisionmaking positions not only within their own
 ranks but also throughout the Government, the economy, the
 media, and mass organizations.
 Ordinary citizens, especially those who were not CPCZ members,
 had no role in selecting their leaders or in participating in
 political or economic decisions. Four minor political parties
 were permitted to exist and publish their own newspapers, but
 they were required to accept the leading role of the CPCZ and
 to conform to Communist Party directives. All parties and
 mass organizations were incorporated in the National Front,
 which was completely controlled by the Communist Party. Among
 its tasks was the nomination of a single slate of candidates
 to stand unopposed at all elections.
 Under the enormous pressure exerted by massive street
 demonstrations after November 17, the CPCZ agreed to delete
 from the Constitution all references to the "leading role" of
 the Communist Party. After roundtable talks with the umbrella
 opposition group Civic Forum, an agreement was reached that a
 government of National Understanding would be formed in which
 members of the Communist Party would be a minority. Human
 rights activist Vaclav Havel was elected President, and
 Alexander Dubcek, CPCZ leader at the time of the Prague Spring
 in 1968, was elected Chairman of the National Assembly. The
 new Government of National Understanding has committed itself
 to changes leading to a democratic, pluralistic society, and
 has promised free, multicandidate elections during 1990.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The former government in Czechoslovakia generally reacted
 negatively to expressions of concern about human rights
 violations either by other governments or by nongovernmental
 institutions- Officials of the former government, however,
 discussed the subject of human rights with U.S. officials.
 During 1989 representatives of the International Helsinki
 Federation and Amnesty International were permitted to travel
 to Czechoslovakia.
 Three groups within Czechoslovakia have been and continue to
 be concerned primarily with human rights issues. One is
 
 
 1085
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Charter 77, composed of persons who signed a document, first
 made public in January 1977, which called on the former
 government to honor its commitments under international
 agreements on human rights, including the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security-and Cooperation in Europe, as well as
 human rights provisions in the Czechoslovak Constitution. The
 second group, VOBS, has used public records and reports from
 friends and relatives of the accused to issue communiques in
 cases where it believes the police, the courts, or the prisons
 have.abused citizens' rights. The third group, the
 Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee, was founded in October 1988
 and has documented the degree of Czechoslovak compliance with
 the human rights provisions of the Helsinki and subsequent
 ilternational agreements. Members of all these independent
 groUps were targets of official harassment.
 The Committee of the Czechoslovak Public for Human Rights and
 Humanitarian Cooperation, an officially organized and
 recognized group, was founded in 1989. Members of the
 committee met with independent human rights activists, but the
 committee clearly was limited in its ability to be an
 outspoken advocate for human rights under the former regime.
 Section 5, Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Health care, education, retirement, and other services are
 provided without regard to race or sex. Membership in the
 Communist Party conferred special access to goods and services
 (including education, medical services, and consumer items),
 and party officials received particularly favorable treatment,
 but such special access is being brought to an end.
 Women are equal under the law, and there are small numbers of
 women in the professions. Women receive pay equal to that of
 their male colleagues if they hold the same job.
 Reliable statistics concerning the level of violence against
 women, such as wife beating, are not available, but anecdotal
 evidence suggests that violence against women is not
 widespread. Although there are reports that police on
 occasion have refused to respond to reports of intrafamily
 violence, prosecutorial authorities generally accept and
 conscientiously prosecute charges involving violence against
 women.
 Czechoslovakia has two major nationalities--Czechs and
 Slovaks--and two substantial minorities--Hungarians and
 Gypsies. Czechoslovakia provides certain guarantees for
 minorities, but interethnic relations are still colored by
 historic animosities. Hungarians, who are concentrated in
 southern Slovakia, form the country's largest minority
 (600,000, according to official statistics). The State
 provides some primary and secondary education in Hungarian and
 permits a limited number of ethnic Hungarians to pursue higher
 education in Hungary. Ethnic Hungarians complain, however,
 that Hungarian-language instruction at the elementary and
 secondary levels is being reduced, and that the lack of
 opportunities for higher education in Hungarian is creating a
 growing shortage of qualified Hungarian-language teachers.
 Gypsies, who number about 300,000, are the only other sizable
 minority. They tend to suffer disproportionately from high
 rates of poverty, crime, and disease. Their problems appear
 to result more from traditional and popular prejudice than
 
 
 1086
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 from government policies. Some observers, however, complain
 that government policies attempted to pressure Gypsies to
 assimilate rather than preserve their distinct identity.
 Approximately 30,000 Vietnamese laborers are temporarily
 working and residing in Czechoslovakia. Reportedly, they are
 allowed to retain two-thirds of their salary. The remainder
 is shared by the Czechoslovak and Vietnamese Governments.
 There are also reports that any Vietnamese who marries a
 Czechoslovak citizen is required to pay about $5,000 to the
 Government of Vietnam to secure permission to stay in
 Czechoslovakia.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have not had the right to associate freely or to
 strike. They could not establish and join organizations of
 their own choosing without previous authorization. An attempt
 to establish an independent trade union in the early 1980's
 was suppressed. The Czechoslovak labor union umbrella
 organization, the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement (ROH),
 has been a mass organization strictly controlled by the
 Communist Party. Membership in official trade unions was
 virtually obligatory for workers. The ROH was affiliated with
 the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions,
 whose headquarters are in Prague.
 Efforts to form independent labor unions were under way at the
 close of 1989. These efforts were attempting to transform
 strike committees which had been formed at various enterprises
 into the basic units of a new labor organization. In
 addition, a grass roots revolt by the membership of the ROH
 had led to a turnover in its leadership, and some persons
 advocated using ROH structures as the basis for a new
 independent labor organization. The Government of National
 Understanding at year's end had not presented legislation
 which would formally allow or regulate the formation of
 independent labor organizations. Legislation permitting
 workers to strike is anticipated in 1990.
 In 1989 both the Committee of Experts and the Conference
 Committee on Application of Conventions and Recommendations
 (CACR) of the International Labor Organization (ILO) examined
 the single trade union system embodied in the Labor Code which
 accords special status to the ROH, as well as the absence of
 freedom of association for workers of collective farms. A
 government representative stated that the Government was
 looking for a solution, but the CACR regretted that no changes
 had yet been made with a view to implementing ILO Convention
 87.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have not had the right to organize or engage in
 collective bargaining. Special economic incentive zones do
 not exist in Czechoslovkia.
 Amendments in December 1988 to the labor code generally
 strengthened the powers of management, which now may:
 terminate a worker's employment with 2 months' (instead of
 6 months') notice, giving no reason; terminate a worker's
 employment for any serious infringement of work discipline
 instead of for major or repeated infringement(s); search the
 
 
 1087
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 work force coming to and leaving work; check for alcohol
 intoxication and drug use; reduce workers' wages for producing
 substandard-products; extend a worker's probationary period
 from 1 to 3 months; and determine independently timework,
 piecework, and other wages, bonuses, and rewards. Under the
 amendments, workers became eligible for leave after 60 days on
 the job instead of 5 months, and maternity leave without pay
 was lengthened to 3 years.
 c. -Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor in Czechoslovakia. However, "work
 education" was gpquired of prisoners. Former prisoners report.
 that convicts faced higher norms (quotas), lower pay, and
 poorr working conditions than did ordinary workers.
 The current Constitution affirms the right to work. In
 practice,-persons considered politically unreliable by the
 former regime were barred from professional positions and
 forced into menial, low-paid jobs such as coal stokers and
 nightwatchmen. The ILO has condemned this practice and has
 called for amendment of the so-called parasitism law..
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 16, although'
 younger persons may accept part-time employment. The law is
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 a'he average workweek is 42.5 hours. Beyond 45 hours, workers
 are paid overtime, and there are additional bonuses for some
 shift and-weekend work. The retirement age is 60 years for
 men, while women may retire between the ages of 54 and 57,
 depending on the number of-their children. The average
 'pension is 55 percent of the average wage, an amount which can
 be insufficient to-meet a citizen's needs if not.supplemented
 from other sources. A welfare system does exist to supplement
 these resources if need can be demonstrated.
 There has been-a nominal labor shortage induced by low
 productivity and the-underutilization of the labor force. The
 need for unskilled and-semiskilled-labor.has-been filled in
 part by workers from Communist countries.
 Working conditions appear generally acceptable, although far
 less attention is paid to occupational safety and health than
 in most.:-advanced industrial economies. Industrial equipment
 -which is obsolete by Western standards .omplicates issues of
 occupatienalsafety. The problem of environmental pollution,
 especially in heavily industrialized areas and in industries
 in which-environmental safeguards have been neglected, has
 become acute for the general population.
 Czechoslovakia does not have a state-wide, legally mandated
 -.minimum wage. However, individual ministries establish wage
 scales of economic enterprises; Workers appear to be able to
 secure-minimally acceptable standards of living for themselves
 and their families based on these wage scales.
 As of December 1989, the Government of National Understanding
 had not introduced legislation which would alter statutory
 provisions governing working conditions.
