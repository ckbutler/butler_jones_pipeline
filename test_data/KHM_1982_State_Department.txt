 KAMPUCHEA
 Claims to authority in Kampuchea are divided between the
 Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) and the
 so-called People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). In 1982, as in
 the previous three years, the United National General Assembly
 voted overwhelmingly to accept the credentials of the CGDK.
 The Coalitton Government of Democratic Kampuchea, headed by
 leading non-communist national politician, Prince Norodom
 Sihanouk as President and Chief of State, is a coalition
 between the communist regime which held power from 1975-79 and
 the non-communist resistance groups created after Vietnam's
 1978 invasion of Kampuchea. The non-communist resistance
 groups include the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, a
 political body with a philosophy closer to European liberal
 thought under former Premier Son Sann, and the National United
 Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral and Cooperative
 Cambodia under Prince Sihanouk, who earlier ruled as hereditary
 king. The appeal of Prince Sihanouk's organization centers on
 the Prince's stature and the group's espousal of Western
 democratic ideals. The 1975-79 communist regime, styled
 Democratic Kampuchea, established itself under the authority of
 the Communist Party of Kampuchea, a Marxist-Leninist
 organization ahd better known as the Khmer Rouge. During its
 rule, the Khmer Rouge dedicated itself to a thorough and brutal
 restructuring of Khmer society and individual personality. One
 of history's worst human rights violators, the Khmer Rouge,
 subsequent to its ouster from Phnom Penh, claimed democratic
 goals for Kampuchea, and has undertaken a campaign to convince
 the Khmer that it has given up many of its egregious human
 rights practices. These moves, however, have not eased the
 profound alienation between the Khmer Rouge regime and most of
 the population.
 The so-called People's Republic of Kampuchea, installed by the
 Vietnamese army in the wake of its December 1978 invasion of
 Kampuchea, claims Marxism-Leninism as its political ideology.
 Only one political group is permitted--the People's
 Revolutionary Party of Kampuchea, a communist party whose
 leadership publicly emerged in May 1981. The regime seeks
 legitimacy among the Khmer people by promising a return to
 traditional cultural values, but in the framework of its
 communist party. Vietnam continues to dominate and control the
 regime and prevent the Khmer people from exercising their right
 of self-determination.
 Kampuchea's chiefly agricultural economic base had only slowly
 begun to develop light industry by 1970. Civil war and
 invasion and the policies of the Khmer Rouge since then have
 left fewer than 100 small industries open in Kampuchea today.
 The past dozen years of devastation, both human and material,
 have wreaked havoc with the economy, made planning a near
 impossibility, and left all national statistics at best gross
 approximations.
 Foreign pressure has been the prevailing political force in
 Kampuchea since the 14th century collapse of the monarchy that
 built Angkor Wat and controlled the states from the South China
 Sea to what has become modern Burma. The national political
 tradition bases itself in the memories of the period of
 greatness, combined with efforts by foreign-backed, competing
 royal brethren to gain power and recreate that glory. In
 practice the weakened position of most monarchs left much
 
 
 autonomy to regional governors. The French interregnum of
 1863-1953 partially succeeded in restoring the monarchy's
 prestige despite the contradictory image of the throne as a
 creature of French indirect rule. The relatively minor efforts
 at education and sanitation during the colonial period did not
 touch popular traditions. Outwardly submissive to authority,
 the Khmer remained self-reliant, individual owner/cultivators,
 generally polite (which was mistaken for gentleness), with a
 firm sense of their nation and culture and a self-conscious
 realization of its past glory and power.
 In 1982 human rights violations in PRK areas continued with
 extensive limitations on civil and political rights.
 Vietnamese occupation and the lack of self-determination are
 the fundamental human rights issues. The food situation
 improved and the material needs of the population promised to
 ease if conditions of climate proved normal. About 180,000
 Vietnamese troops continue to occupy Kampuchea, and an
 extensive Vietnamese apparatus of advisors supervises the
 activities of all party, government, and military entities of
 the PRK. No political parties exist other than the official
 one, the People's Revolutionary Party of Kampuchea, and the
 increasing activities of the PRK internal security forces as
 well as the Vietnamese troops continue to cause anxiety within
 Kampuchea. Within the PRK areas of Kampuchea and among
 resistance groups the right to trial does not exist. In
 Kampuchea political prisons exist in Phnom Penh and in the
 provinces. Execution without trial has been convincingly
 alleged by sources in Phnom Penh. Summary execution of *spies
 and traitors' have reportedly taken place in resistance camps,
 most notably those of the former DK regime, despite its
 promulgation of various laws prohibiting this in late 1981.
 Since September 1981 new evidence in the form of organic
 samples has been found in Southeast Asia and lends weight to
 charges that the Vietnamese allies of the PRK regime are
 employing lethal chemical/biological agents against DK and
 non-communist Khmer resistance groups along the Thai-Kampuchean
 border. (For further information see the Secretary of State's
 reports to Congress on chemical warfare in Southeast Asia and
 Afghanistan of March 22 and November, 1982.)
 No major changes have taken place in the human rights situation
 in Kampuchea over the past year. Nor is it possible to see any
 trends toward an improvement in the state of human rights as
 long as the country remains occupied by Vietnamese troops and
 war continues between the Vietnamese and their Khmer allies
 against the Khmer resistance.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Political murder still exists in Kampuchea. The most grievous
 offender of modern times, the Khmer Rouge, promulgated a law
 against killing in July 1981 that ostensibly imposes harsher
 penalities on officials than on other murderers. No official
 is known to have been tried to date. Reports from Khmer
 Rouge-controlled areas suggest that summary executions continue
 for troops accused of having contacts with the enemy and, in
 certain areas, for desertion. Numbers are not available even
 as estimates, but Khmer Rouge killings appear substantially
 reduced from the period when the Khmer Rouge held power. With
 respect to the PRK, the authority to kill seems to be vested in
 
 
 728
 senior Heng Samrin political and military leaders. Similarly,
 reports from the non-communist guerrilla zones cite occasional
 summary executions of individuals believed to be spies. These
 decisions are those of local commanders apparently without
 reference to the non-communist political leadership. In Phnom
 Penh the regime is accused of secretly executing prisoners, but
 insufficient evidence exists to prove this charge
 definitively. Show trials have taken place without death
 sentences being pronounced.
 A high percentage of fatalities in Kampuchea are directly or
 indirectly caused by the warfare between the Khmer resistance
 on one side and the Vietnamese and their PRK allies on the
 other. Land mines, some left from earlier days of conflict,
 are a particular danger to the civilian and soldier alike. The
 Khmer Rouge have ambushed Soviet workers in Kampuchea and press
 visitors on national highways. They have injured or killed
 Beng Samrin regime officials in such attacks as well; most
 recently the Minister and Vice-Minister of Agriculture were
 attacked in rural Kompong Cham province. Grenade attacks have
 taken place in Phnom Penh, which the Khmer Rouge claims as its
 acts of sabotage. Sources in Phnom Penh, however, ascribe most
 incidents there to actions of drunk or angry Heng Samrin troops.
 b. Disappearance
 Reports from Phnom Penh assert Heng Samrin security officials
 are responsible for regular disappearances. Most of those who
 disappear are thought to be imprisoned. The treatment of such
 individuals is harsh. Information is inadequate to say how
 long they areheld. Some newly returned refugees from the
 Thai-Khmer border are said to be called by the authorities to
 resettle in new areas on government-prepared land. These
 people are not heard from again by family, friends, or
 neighbors. While a problem in the past, there have been very
 few reports of disappearances during 1982 in Khmer
 Rouge-controlled areas.
 c. Torture
 Physical torture has been reported from both rural areas and
 from Phnom Penh prisons. Humiliations are said to comprise
 part-of the interrogations. Beating appears to be the most
 common form of PRK torture and has been credibly reported from
 a variety of Khmer sources and independent investigators.
 Information is not adequate to comment on the extent of torture
 in Khmer Rouge areas nor whether it is practiced in the
 non-communist camps.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 In those few instances where trials are reported, the PRK has
 .meted out long jail sentences, some at hard labor. Conditions
 in political prisons both in Phnom Penh and in rural areas are
 harsh. The central prison in Phnom Penh remains a site for
 incarceration of political prisoners. Earlier reports,
 including two from former inmates, noted no provision of
 medical care or medicines, clothing, or soap. Some prisoners,
 they said, were kept in total isolation and darkness. Some
 inmates allegedly were beaten to death.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment-
 A variety of informants claim that arrests take place in the
 PRK based on regime suspicion that one is a member of one of
 
 
 729
 the resistance groups, refuses to employ a skill in the service
 of the PRK or seeks to resign for other than medical causes, or
 is a family member of a person believed to have joined the
 resistance or be residing in the United States. Political
 prisoners are said to include not only adults, but also
 children. Political prisoners are regularly denied the rights
 to immediate transmittal of records to competent organs for
 decision. The Constitution requires that trials be open except
 in those cases prescribed by law, but the Heng Samrin regime
 gives little publicity to trials that are held. It is
 estimated that several thousand prisoners are held by the Heng
 Samrin regime. Little additional information is available from
 Khmer Rouge zones to add to earlier reports which cited
 sentences of several days 'reeducation* through lectures and
 incarceration for non-combatants caught trying to flee to
 Thailand. In mid-1982, the Khmer Rouge permitted a number of
 their troops and families to leave their zone at Phnom Melai to
 rally to Prince Sihanouk's forces. Officials in other Khmer
 Rouge zones have meted out harsh punishment for attempted
 defections. The non-communist side has briefly incarcerated
 individuals for civil offenses and at the extreme expels
 offenders from their camps after a hearing by camp leaders.
 f. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Under the PRK Constitution defendants supposedly have the right
 to counsel and to a speedy trial. It is not possible to state
 how independent the judiciary is, nor if a judiciary really
 exists. A court has been named in PRK media for Phnom Penh
 city, but its activities were only publicized in connection
 with a show trial for Khmer Rouge urban terrorists in October
 1981. Neither the Khmer Rouge zone, nor the non-communist
 camps have separate judicial systems apart from Cheir civil and
 military administrations.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The PRK Constitution-preserves the inviolability of domicile
 and secrecy of the mails. In fact, local authorities in the
 PRK, as in the resistance areas, search whenever they wish.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While PRK constitutional safeguards exist, the press and radio
 in fact are wholly controlled by the regime. Criticism of the
 regime is not tolerated, nor are foreign books and periodicals
 admitted. Networks of informers are believed to exist
 throughout the country and report to the secret police. A
 similar situation exists in the Khmer Rouge areas. Criticism
 is possible in the non-communist areas and mid-level leaders
 discreetly let their opinions be known, even to outsiders, but
 caution is the rule.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted in the PRK are
 government-created associations for groups such as farmers,
 women, and youth. Industries have organized branches of the
 national trade union, a body which grew out of the "patriotic'
 association founded in early 1979, the Trade Union for National
 Salvation. The second-ranking figure in the trade union is a
 former senior regional official of the Khmer Rouge regime and
 now a member of the PRK parliament. Labor appears to be
 
 
 730
 totally under the PRK regime's control. The Khmer Rouge and
 non-communist resistance areas do not have associations or
 trade unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Khmer Rouge dismantled the previous state religion,
 Buddhism, defrocking some 70,000 monks, forcing many to marry
 and all to labor, and turning pagodas into warehouses. Since
 1979, they have tried to give the impression of reform. They
 have built pagodas in their zone at Phnom Melai, and in January
 1982 welcomed one old and senior monk visiting from abroad.
 Christianity and Islam were even more ruthlessly suppressed and
 are not known to have received Khmer Rouge-sponsored revivals
 in recent years.
 In the PRK, the regime has permitted the return of religious
 practices, but has not reinstituted Buddhism as the state
 religion. In 1981 the supreme patriarch told journalists that
 3,000 monks have been re-robed and 700 pagodas are open. Only
 men over 50 may officially re-robe or become novices, but a
 number of younger men have been quietly ordained with the tacit
 acceptance of local PRK authorities. The supreme patriarch
 himself is a member of the PRK National Front for Construction
 and Defense and is vice-president of the National Assembly,
 elected in May 1981.
 Christian groups in the PRK are harassed. The Protestant
 community of about 2,200 people in 400 families is not
 authorized to meet, but does so clandestinely. Roman Catholics
 in Phnom Penh are said to be prohibited from meeting, but one
 small community in a major rural center is said to have
 received authorization to meet on Sundays. Non-communist
 resistance camps afford full freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Ttavel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The PRK and the Khmer Rouge try to control tightly all travel
 within the regions under their control. In theory passes are
 required for internal movement between villages under the
 control of the PRK regime. Checkpoints are ubiquitous in PRK
 areas and require bribes to cross even with passes in hand,
 although checkpoints can often be avoided. A system of
 neighborhood surveillance, modeled after the Vietnamese system,
 was introduced in 1981. The implementation of these controls
 is loose enough that thousands of Khmer continue to move around
 inside the country and to the Thai-Khmer border for trade,
 looking for missing people or to find the resistance.
 Only the very top PRK and Khmer Rouge officials travel abroad.
 Emigration is not regularized and Khmer seeking to go abroad
 must flee to the border. The Khmer Rouge have accepted more
 than 17,000 people back from refugee camps in Thailand since
 June 1980, and the non-communist sides have taken more than
 23,000 including a wave of over 6,000 in the second half of
 1982 to camps linked to Prince Sihanouk. The PRK expressed
 agreement in principle to accept numbers back from camps in
 Thailand, but has procrastinated, failing to reach actual
 agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. More
 than 80,000 Khmer are still in holding centers in Thailand.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 
 
 731
 The People's Revolutionary Party of Kampuchea, a communist
 party, controls political life in the PRK. In Khmer Rouge
 zones, the Communist Party of Kampuchea was formally dissolved
 in December 1981, but continued as a clandestine entity. In
 fact, it controls all political, economic, and military life in
 Khmer Rouge areas. No other choices are possible. In the
 non-communist zones, the respective political fronts exercise
 looser control, as their organizations are less disciplined.
 Both of the communist parties are governed by only about ten
 people at the top, but there is no doubting the commitment to
 ideology or the sophistication of understanding of that
 ideology by their leaders. Political aspirants in the
 PRK-controlled areas must study the current political dogma,
 which centers on acceptance of the Vietnamese explanation for
 Hanoi's dominant position in Kampuchea. Heng Samrin officials
 in September 1982 promised amnesty and access to full political
 rights, including the vote, for those Khmer Rouge and
 non-communists who surrender to Phnom Penh.
 Elections in the PRK are not a form of political participation,
 but rather an exercise by the regime to demonstrate legitimacy
 through voter activity, and are to underscore the relative
 stat*us of leaders by varying percentages of the *vote.'
 Reports suggest that in the 1981 national elections percentages
 were 'rigged" and certain victors were named regardless of the
 number of votes they actually received. Vietnamese district
 level advisors are reliably reported to have helped validate
 candidacies at lower level elections. These activities and the
 overwhelming presence of the Vietnamese army expeditionary
 force in Kampuchea make a mockery of any suggestion of an open
 political process in PRK areas of Kampuchea.
 In the Heng Samrin areas and to a greater extent in the Khmer
 Rouge areas, both women and minorities form important parts of
 the governing structure. The second ranking figure of the PRK
 regime's party is an ethnic minority, a Thai, and the Minister
 of Defense is a hill tribesman from the northeast.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Kampuchea has been the subject of intense international
 attention to human rights violations since 1978 when the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and its Subcommission on the
 Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities began
 investigations and accepted documents on the question. In
 August 1982 that subcommittee's report noted that the presence
 of foreign forces in Kampuchea raises the question of the Khmer
 right to self-determination, one of the basic human rights, and
 that in the absence of self-determination, civil and political
 rights, in particular, will continue to be violated. The
 report also deplored the failure of Vietnam and the Heng Samrin
 regime to admit UN experts to investigate allegations of the
 use of chemical weapons in Kampuchea. (The three Khmer
 resistance groups have all cooperated in the UN investigation.)
 Amnesty International supported the UN Human Rights Commission
 effort of 1978 and supplied documents to the subcommittee
 then. Amnesty's 1981 report centered on the PRK, noting
 charges of detention without trial for criticizing the PRK
 regime, and expressing concern at delay between arrest and
 trial of former PRK officials who spent nearly a year awaiting
 disposition of their cases. Amnesty's 1982 report, convering
 1981, noted a wide range of concerns. That organization wrote
 
 
 732
 to the regime, particularly urging the release of political
 prisoners and the prohibition of torture.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has tried
 unsuccessfully to visit prisoners throughout Kampuchea. ICRC
 reported to its donors in May 1982 that negotiations with Heng
 Samrin authorities had failed to produce even an agreement in
 principle for ICRC visits to detention centers in Kampuchea.
 The non-communist camps along the Thai-Khmer border have
 substantial daytime presences of voluntary and international
 organization staff who have intervened in securing better
 treatment of minorities such as Vietnamese refugees in these
 camps. Both the Heng Samrin regime and the Khmer Rouge have
 Red Cross organizations, but neither they nor other groups have
 a role in the protection of civil and political aspects of
 human rights.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Kampuchea's economic, social, and cultural situation can only
 be viewed impressionistically. Statistics are unreliable.
 Even the population total is a matter of great debate. World
 Bank figures for 1981 estimated 8.8 million people. The Heng
 Samrin regime claims 6.7 million, but has produced no census
 data. In the wake of the past 12 years of civil war, invasion,
 and purge, and considering the disruption of the
 administration, statistics on life-expectancy, infant
 mortality, and even the population growth rate have little
 validity. It is certain that a baby boom is under way, but
 observers would be well advised to regard as merely educated
 guesses the official figures for a population growth rate of
 3.8 percent (1980), the life expectancy at birth of 33.8 years
 (1980), and the infant mortality rate of 211.5 per 1000
 (1980). Other statistics are based on wartime or Khmer Rouge
 period estimates and are unreliable. The Heng Samrin regime
 has embarked on an effort to restructure the society and remold
 individual personality. Traditional music and dance have
 returned although certain forms of the latter have been
 politicized. Emphasis has been given to reopening primary
 schools and selected university faculties, such as medicine and
 dentistry. Adult education has also been emphasized. In 1962,
 the national census revealed an adult literacy rate of 36.1
 percent. This has probably worsened, especially during the
 Khmer Rouge period when schooling was curtailed.
 Kampuchea is now even more than before 1970 an agricultural
 country. Prewar trends toward urbanization were suppressed as
 the Khmer Rouge forcibly rusticated the entire population in
 1975. Since the Vietnamese invasion, urbanization has resumed,
 but many of the former city people, including Chinese
 merchants, died under the Khmer Rouge or have fled abroad.
 Khmer peasants have streamed into Phnom Penh in search of food
 and work. The emergence of a Khmer entrepreneurial class may
 occur in the future, if the PRK regime permits such a class to
 exist and if the Khmer survive competition from Vietnamese
 carpetbaggers who have flowed into commercial activities in
 market towns from eastern Kampuchea to Phnom Penh itself.
 In the rural areas, the Heng Samrin regime has instituted a
 system of agricultural collectivization using 'solidarity"
 production teams of about a dozen families to till the main
 rice fields. The PRK Constitution permits families to own the
 small plot on which a house and garden exist. Other land is
 owned collectively.
 
 
 733
 The health, medicine, and nutrition difficulties of the recent
 past are slowly being overcome. An inadequate number of Khmer
 medical cadre at all levels has been supplemented by foreign
 medical teams. Despite the presence of a small number of
 foreign volunteer medical workers and reportedly large number
 of Vietnamese health cadre, medical care even in the best
 hospitals in Kampuchea is only adequate, and most Khmer have no
 access to care at all. Kampuchea is subject to the usual
 variety of tropical diseases and to an especially virulent
 strain of malaria. Preventive measures for mosquito-borne
 diseases no longer exist. The most effective fight against
 disease and parasites is to keep the population well-fed, and
 with the easing of the food crisis in Kampuchea, this is
 somewhat easier to do. In 1982 international relief
 organizations, whose programs were intended to concentrate on
 traditionally underpriviledged or vulnerable groups like
 children, widows, and the sick, were not fully successful in
 persuading the PRK authorities to provide sufficient food to
 those most in need. Low rice stocks in spotty areas around the
 country have forced some peasants to move to the border with
 Thailand seeking food. The emergency relief needs inside
 Kampuchea that led to the massive international relief
 operation beginning in 1979 have been judged essentially
 fulfilled, however, and Western donor countries decided to end
 the relief operation in the interior of the country in its
 current form at the end of 1982. The health and nutrition
 relationship is so closely linked that the situation will be
 tenuous for years to come and could easily slip back into the
 perilous conditions of recent years if weather or security
 deteriorate markedly. Emergency relief needs in Coalition
 Government of Democratic Kampuchea areas have not yet been met
 and international donor support is likely continue.
