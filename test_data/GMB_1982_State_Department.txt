 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is a small former British colony on the West
 African coast, with a population of over 600,000 and an
 area of slightly over 4,000 square miles. Its political
 structure has evolved from the parliamentary/prime minister
 type to that of a parliament with a nationally elected
 president. Although the two principal parties dominate
 the parliament, several minority parties also have repre-
 sentation. In May 1982, parliamentary and presidential
 elections were held, and 65 percent of the electorate
 reportedly participated. Since the country's independence
 in 1965, President Dawda Jawara has been first head of
 government and then, under the changed system of govern-
 ment, chief of state.
 In late 1981 a treaty was signed with neighboring Senegal,
 whose territory completely surrounds the Gambia, creating
 the confederation of Senegambia under which both nations
 retain individual sovereignty and political institutions,
 but which provides as well for the creation of a confeder-
 ated superstructure including a president, vice president,
 cabinet, and parliament. During the past year several
 protocols were negotiated to give substance to the new
 confederation, but the most difficult ones involving com-
 mon approaches to defense, customs, and monetary union,
 have yet to take shape.
 On the economic side, the Gambia is poor and underdeveloped,
 relying primarily on a single export crop, groundnuts, a
 sector which has performed poorly over the last few years
 and has been subject to declining world prices over the last
 three years.
 The Gambia and its leadership have been strong advocates of
 individual human rights and have supported a proposed human
 rights code for all of Africa. The Government was shaken by
 two coup attempts in 1980 and 1981, the latter resulting in
 a state of emergency which led to regulations under which
 some 1,090 persons were detained during the second half of
 1981 and early 1982. The names and addresses of those
 detained were published in the official gazette, as were
 the names of those subsequently released. A number of the
 detainees were brought to public trial, in special tribunals
 established for this purpose, with judges and counsel
 furnished from neighboring English-speaking African coun-
 tries. Many detainees were released without trial, and
 cases against others were disposed of administratively.
 In October 1982, an unconfirmed report that an additional
 three persons were released appeared in a Senegalese news-
 paper. The report went on to state that this reduced the
 number of those still in detention as of October 5 to
 97 individuals. A trial for 30 of these cases began on
 November 18 in Banjul.
 During 1982 curfew restrictions were eased considerably,
 and on October 18 the curfew was formally lifted, although
 the underlying state of emergency remains in force.
 The long term effect upon human rights in the Gambia
 of increased integration of its political and economic
 institutions with those of Senegal is unclear. However,
 there is no reason to believe that the present generally
 
 
 118
 constructive approach of both countries to individual rights
 and freedoms is likely to change.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reported cases of killing for
 political motives in the Gambia during the past year.
 b. Disappearance
 The names and addresses of those persons detained under the
 emergency regulations, resulting from the failed coup
 attempt of mid-1981, are published regularly in the official
 gazette. The last persons arrested under those regulations
 were detained in May 1982. There is no record of abduction
 or secret detention of individuals by any elements of the
 Gambian Government or by any opposition groups.
 c. Torture
 The constitutional prohibition against torture is observed
 in practice. No allegations of torture have been reported
 in 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 The Constitution contains a specific prohibition against
 inhuman or degrading punishment, and no evidence of viola-
 tion of this prohibition has been reported or alleged within
 the past year. Sentences, including fines and imprisonment,
 are related to the severity of the crime committed and are
 based upon schedules set forth in applicable statutes or
 regulations, including those imposed under the current state
 of emergency.
 There are segregated prison facilities for men and women of
 both the maximum and minimum security type. The Government
 has allowed prison visits, including visits to those de-
 tained under the emergency regulations, by representatives
 of the local branch of the Red Cross and certain close
 family members.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution states explicitly that a person can be
 arrested only upon reasonable suspicion of having committed,
 or being about to commit, a criminal offense under Gambian
 law. Other provisions grant the right to an early trial
 and, by implication, permit the courts to inquire into the
 reasons for detention. The right of habeas corpus is
 implicit in the Constitution and is respected.
 Under the emergency regulations still in force, the Presi-
 dent may order the detention of any person who, in his opin-
 ion, has been involved in acts prejudicial to the public
 safety or public order, in the preparation or instigation of
 such acts, or in impeding the maintenance of supplies and
 services essential to the life of the community. Such per-
 sons may be held up to 14 days without a detention order.
 Detainees are free to exercise their right to legal counsel.
 
 
 119
 As mentioned above, a total of 1,090 persons have been de-
 tained under these regulations since the imposition of the
 state of emergency in August 1981. Most of these detainees
 have either been tried or released without trial. In
 general, detainees are released if preliminary investiga-
 tions prove inconclusive.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Of arrestees, only those persons detained by presidential
 order under the emergency regulations cited above have not
 enjoyed the right to an early hearing before an independent
 and impartial court.   A special trial division of the
 Supreme (trial) Court was established for their cases, and
 judges and prosecuting and defense counsel were brought in
 from neighboring English-speaking countries to help handle
 the caseload, both because of a shortage of available
 legally-trained personnel in the Gambia and to assure
 impartiality in the trials. Trials held by these special
 tribunals, like all other trials held in the Gambia, have
 been-public. Criminal defendants are guaranteed by the
 Constitution: the right to a public trial; the presump-
 tion of innocence; the right to be informed promptly and
 in language the accused understands of the nature of the
 offense charged; adequate time and facilities for prepara-
 tion of a defense; the right to defend oneself or select
 one's own counsel; the right of cross-examination; and the
 right to a paid interpreter if needed. The accused also has
 the right to be present, not to be required to testify
 against himself, and to be free from double jeopardy and
 from the application of ex post facto definitions of crimes.
 Appeals normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to
 the Court of Appeal, the country's highest tribunal.
 With respect to the special tribunals for offenses charged
 under the emergency regulations, President Jawara in an
 August 2, 1981 radio address stated that 111 persons had
 been convicted and 16 acquitted by these tribunals. In May
 1982 the Court of Appeals heard 35 appeals from such cases.
 Much of the delay in disposing of these cases appears to
 have resulted from the problem of coordinating the avail-
 ability of judges and trial counsel, all drawn from other
 African countries.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution provides guarantees against arbitrary
 search of person and property. It excepts the volun-
 tary submission to a search by the individual, or a search
 that is reasonably required in the interests of defense or
 other public interest. Under the criminal code, search
 warrants are issued by magistrates upon application by the
 police, based on probable cause. Under the emergency
 regulations, searches of premises or vehicles for suspected
 firearms or other specified articles may be authorized by
 the Inspector General of Police or the Commander of Military
 Forces.
 
 
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides guarantees of press freedom and
 the Government does not engage in censorship of publications.
 The emergency powers regulations, however, prohibit the
 publication of items or use of slogans or other demonstra-
 tions of sentiment likely to incite or cause disaffection or
 alarm, or be prejudicial to public safety, public order, or
 the maintenance of essential services or supplies. This
 rather sweeping formulation has as a practical matter helped
 block open criticism of the Government.
 The Gambia's multilingual and largely illiterate population
 does not provide much of a press readership. There are no
 daily newspapers, and the few periodicals published are
 mostly of the mimeographed variety. In addition to a
 government radio station, there is a private commercial one.
 No instances of government interference with this station
 have been reported or alleged. Magazines and other periodi-
 cals from outside the country are freely available at a few
 outlets, mostly in the capital, but radio remains the major
 source of information.
 Although considerable freedom in criticizing the Government
 is permitted in the Gambian press and radio, there are
 understood limits which are usually not exceeded. To the
 extent that any academic inquiry is carried out within the
 country, it has been with complete freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the current emergency regulations no public meeting
 may be held without prior notification to the police. Trade
 unions exist, although they are not at present as active as
 unions in the past years. There have been no strikes during
 the past year. It is not known to what extent current inac-
 tivity on the labor front is due to government pressure or
 to the generally poor economic conditions and high unemploy-
 ment rate in some sectors. One of the few periodicals in
 the Gambia is published by the trade unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While Islam is the predominant faith in the Gambia, Christ-
 ianity is freely and actively practiced. The Constitution
 guarantees freedom of conscience, thought, and religion as
 well as the right to practice and propogate religious
 beliefs. No incidence of discrimination on the basis of
 religion has been reported in employment, educational, or
 other fields. No person is compelled to take an oath, to
 receive instruction, or to attend any ceremony which con-
 travenes his religious beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal police checkpoints still exist, where documents
 of travelers are checked, but freedom of movement is not
 restricted. The Gambia has long land frontiers with
 Senegal, where the populations are often related by ethnic
 
 
 and linguistic ties, resulting in constant movement between
 the two countries, especially for persons in the agricul-
 tural sector. Considering that an international border is
 being crossed, movement between the Gambia and surrounding
 Senegal is relatively free and unencumbered. A small number
 of Gambians are living outside of the country for economic
 reasons, plus a few alleged ringleaders of the last coup
 attempt. Those residing outside of the country do not lose
 their nationality and are free to return at will.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is universal adult suffrage in the Gambia and elec-
 tions were held in May 1982 for president, vice president,
 and members of parliament. An estimated 65 percent of
 eligible voters participated in those elections. The two
 major political parties and several minority parties offered
 candidates for all positions. President Jawara was re-
 elected by a large majority of the votes cast. It should
 be noted that his opponent was detained during the campaign
 under the emergency regulations, having been charged with
 complicity in the coup attempt of the previous year. He was
 later publicly tried and acquitted. Despite the difficul-
 ties of campaigning under such circumstances, the minority
 party candidate drew more than a quarter of the vote.
 Furthermore, the President's majority party lost eight of
 35 contested seats to opposition candidates and inde-
 pendents. One successful candidate became the Gambia's
 first elected woman parliamentarian. There has been no
 serious allegation of election fraud or unfairness.
 There are no legal restrictions on political activity
 and participation by women. Nonetheless, participation
 by women is naturally influenced by custom in this largely
 Islamic and conservative culture.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Gambia considers itself to be one of Africa's leading
 advocates of respect for fundamental human rights. It has
 hosted an all-African conference on this subject, and has
 long advocated within the Organization of African Unity the
 adoption of a code of human rights. Since declaring a state
 of emergency in the wake of the 1981 coup attempt, President
 Jawara has attempted to assure the civil rights of the
 accused participants by engaging expatriate judges and
 counsel for the trials of defendants. He also is permitting
 outside groups to visit the detainees. Thus far only the
 local Red Cross appears to have accepted the offer.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Gambia is a poor, underdeveloped, largely agricul-
 tural country, which is not self-sufficient in food pro-
 duction. Its principal export crop, groundnuts, is subject
 to the vagaries of an uncertain world market as well as
 varying production. The Gambia recognizes private property
 and the right of private business association. A sizeable
 proportion of the retail trade, however, is in the hands of
 expatriate trading houses or third country nationals. Most
 of the Government's budget is required to pay salaries of
 its employees, with little left for other recurrent expenses
 and maintenance of existing infrastructure. There are even
 
 
 122
 fewer resources available for investment in capital im-
 provements and economic development. The level of foreign
 aid has increased in recent years, a small proportion of
 which has been used to provide direct support for the
 Government. Some of this aid, however, has added to the
 Gambian Government's burden by creating additional recurrent
 expenses, as well as demands upon its limited resources for
 counterpart contributions to new capital investment projects
 financed by this aid.
 The Gambia's population, estimated at 619,000 in 1981,
 is growing at a rate of 2.8 percent per year. The gross
 national product per capita of just under $250, as estimated
 for 1980, appears to be declining. Forty-two percent of
 school age children attend primary school, and there is an
 adult literacy rate of 10 percent (1975 estimate). There
 are no universities in the Gambia.
 Life expectancy at birth is 42 years. Infant mortality
 is estimated to be 198.3 per 1,000. Twelve percent of the
 population is reported to have access to safe water.
 It is estimated that the caloric requirement available
 for consumption relative to nutritional requirements is
 97 percent. Although the Gambia suffers from poverty, lack
 of education, and inadequate health care, there is no
 evidence of discrimination in the availability of Govern-
 ment services to any segment of the population.
