 ICELAND
 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty
 parliamentary democracy. Its literate and educated people
 participate in high percentages in regular fair and free
 elections which determine the distribution of power among
 political parties and leaders.
 The civil and criminal justice systems offer equal protection
 to all. The nation has no indigenous military forces or
 political security apparatus.
 Iceland has a mixed, open economy in which all of its citizens
 have the right to hold private property.
 Icelanders have long been strong defenders of human rights both
 at home and internationally, and the country has an exemplary
 human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killings do not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no instances of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumanf, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are all prohibited by law and do not occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process is provided by law and observed in practice. The
 Constitution states that any person arrested by the authorities
 must be brought before a judge without undue delay. The judge
 must rule within 24 hours whether the person. is to be further
 detained. Although the Constitution allows for bail, it is not
 usually imposed as a condition for release. A judge's ruling
 may be appealed immediately to a higher court. Preventive
 detention is not practiced; There were no allegations of
 arbitrary detention. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants may confront witnesses and otherwise participate in
 public trials, which are fair and free from intimidation. They
 are guaranteed the right to competent legal counsel of their
 own choice. In cases in which defendants are-unable to pay
 attorney's fees, the State does so. The courts are free of
 political control. Although the Ministry of Justice administers
 the lower court system, the Supreme Court carefully guards its
 independence and fairness. Juries are not normally -used, but
 multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals
 process. There are no political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution and in practice, there is deep respect
 for the autonomy and rights of individuals. A warrant from a
 court is required for entry into a home, except in cases of hot
 -pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official entities, political
 organizations, or any other organized group into the private
 beliefs or personal liberties of individuals do not occur.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution expressly forbids censorship and other
 restrictions on the freedom of the press and on a person's
 right to express his thoughts. Citizens and the media exercise
 this freedom extensively. Academic freedom of expression is
 vigorously exercised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to assemble unarmed,
 except when it is feared that such gatherings may cause riots.
 In practice, plans for public meetings are virtually never
 rejected, and the authorities only rarely modify them.
 In addition, the Constitution provides citizens the right to
 join together formally or informally to form associations
 without governmental authorization. A varied and wide spectrum
 of voluntary organizations plays a vital role in Icelandic
 politics and society.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Lutheran Church is the established church, and
 most citizens are nominally members, there is complete freedom
 for other faiths. Both Christian and non-Christian faiths are
 allowed to proselytize freely. They may maintain ties with and
 receive support from coreligionists abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Icelanders have freedom to travel at home and abroad, to
 emigrate, and to return at will. Refugees are never compelled
 to return to a country in which they would face persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 To Change Their Government
 The political system is an open, fully functioning,
 parliamentary democracy in which voters freely choose the
 members of the Althing (parliament) who, in turn, make the laws
 of the land and determine the composition of the Cabinet.
 Parliamentary elections are held at 4-year intervals unless the
 Althing dissolves itself before the end of its full term.
 Voting in elections and membership in the various political
 parties are open to all citizens who are 18 years of age or
 older. Primary elections and party caucuses are used to select
 Althing candidates. Multimember districts and proportional
 representation increase the chances for minority points of view
 to be represented. In addition, there is a strong cultural
 insistence on having the views of all significant groups
 represented in the Althing. A center-right coalition

 ICELAN)D
 government was formed following national elections in April
 1991. The Government consists of the Independence Party and
 the Social Democratic Party, with David Oddsson of the
 Independence Party as Prime Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights organizations are active in Iceland. No serious
 human rights violations have been alleged. The Government and
 populace support international efforts to improve human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Iceland's ethnically homogeneous population is fiercely
 egalitarian and opposed to discrimination regardless of whether
 it is based on-sex, religion, or other factors. Government
 legislation and practice reflect this attitude.
 Violence against women, both physical and mental, occurs. The
 problem is not widely publicized, but the Women's List
 political party raises it periodically in political debate. A
 public women's shelter, financially supported by national and
 municipal government and private contributions, operates in
 Reykjavik and offers protection to approximately 180 women per
 year. About 50 percent of those who make use of the shelter
 cite alcohol abuse by their male partners as a factor
 contributing to the violence they suffer. Counseling is
 available from social workers and lawyers at the shelter. The
 Women's List, on the basis of credible research, asserts that,
 despite legislation requiring equal pay for equal work,
 Icelandic women do not receive pay equal to that of men. The
 party and other active women's organizations have given this
 issue top priority.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in Iceland make extensive use of the right to establish
 organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules,
 choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their
 views. The resulting organizations are not controlled by the
 Government or any single political party. Unions take active
 part in Nordic, European, and international trade union
 bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in
 the public sector whose services are essential to public health
 or safety (e.g., air traffic controllers), unions have had and
 have used the right to strike. In 1991, for example, merchant
 seamen struck for 2 days in November for higher wages.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 About 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.
 There are no impediments to union membership in law or in
 practice. Virtually all unions utilize the right to bargain
 collectively on wages, working conditions, and related issues.
 In February 1990, with the assistance of government mediation,
 a 20-month agreement was reached between the central labor and
 management organizations covering a majority of workers. The
 agreement formally expired in September 1991 but continued to
 be observed in practice pending the conclusion of negotiations
 between the parties to the 1990 agreement. Labor courts
 
 
 1142
 ICELAND
 effectively adjudicate disputes over labor contracts and over
 the rights and provisions guaranteed under the 1938 Act on
 trade unions and industrial disputes, which prohibits antiunion
 discrimination. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The employment of children below the age of 16 in factories, on
 ships, and in other places that are hazardous or require hard
 labor is prohibited by law, and this prohibition is observed in
 practice. Children of 14 and 15 may be employed in light,
 nonhazardous work, but their work hours may not exceed the
 ordinary working hours of adults in the same occupation. The
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child
 labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so
 pervasive and effective that labor contracts, in effect, assure
 even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent
 standard of living. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours.
 Icelandic workers are protected by laws which effectively
 ensure their health and safety as well as, provide for
 unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and
 reasonable working conditions and hours. Health and safety
 standards are set by the Althing and effectively administered
 and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Food, shelter,
 health care, and education are all guaranteed without
 discrimination to those lacking adequate income because of
 their age, youth, illness, or other reasons.
