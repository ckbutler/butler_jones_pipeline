 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic governed by an elected president and a bi-
 cameral legislature with an independent judicial branch. Its longstanding demo-
 cratic tradition was interrupted by 12 years of military rule from 1973 to 1985. The
 return to democratic government began with a 1984 election, which was generally
 considered fair although the Government blocked participation by some political
 groupings. On March 1, 1990, following a free and fair election in Novembr 1989,
 power was transferred from one elected civilian president to another for the first
 time since the return to constitutional government in 1985. Political parties, the
 press, labor unions, private interest groups, and other nongovernmental groups
 unction freely, and political debate is vigorous and unrestricted.
 The small military establishment consists of an army, an air force, and a navy
 which has now incorporated the coast guard. It is under the supervision of the Min-
 istry of Defense. According to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
 total military expenditures for 1989 were approximately $170 million. Military
 budgets have increased slightly but, as they are the subject of gwing controversy,
 it is not likely that they will increase significantly in the near future. The miitar
 does not particpate in domestic security matters unless ordered to do so by the ci-
 vilian authorities. Domestic security and public safety matters are under the juris-
 diction of the Interior Ministry, which adinisters all the country's police depart-
 
 
 502
 ments. In 1992 the police continued to be responsible for instances of physical abuse
 of detainees.
 A middle-income country with an estimated per capita gross domestic product of
 $3,600 in 1992. Uruguay's economy is heavily dependent on agricultural exports and
 agroindustry. The economy is a mixture of private enterprise and state entities. Pri-
 vate property rights are respected. Following a period of negligible growth in the
 late 1980's and early 1990's, the economy began to accelerate, growing by 1.9 per-
 cent in 1991, and an estimated 6 to 6.5 percent in 1992. In an attempt to reverse
 the prevailing trend of economic stagnation the administration of President Luis
 Alberto Lacalle has encountered only mixed success in implementing reforms do-
 signed to increase investment, reduce the fiscal deficit, and contain inflation, as well
 asprivatize certain government-owned companies and port operations.
 Uruguayans enjoy a broad range of individual rights and liberties. Nonetheless,
 sporadic reports of police abuse of detainees persist, and few, if any, police have
 been convicted and punished for such abuse. Prison conditions remain generally
 poor. Violence against women attracted increased attention, while latent discrimina-
 tion against the black minority remains a largely unrecognized and unaddressed
 problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No cases of politically motivated kill-
 ing were reported.
 b. Disappearance.-No known or reported incidents of politically motivated abduc-
 tions or disappearances occurred in 1992. The 1986 Expiry Law continued to block
 investigations into killings, torture, and disappearances which occurred during the
 military regime.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the infliction of physical or moral torment on prisoners.
 However, there are persistent, if often unsubstantiated, reports of physical abuse of
 detainees by polie. Physical abuse is alleged to occur most often in the hours imme-
 diately following an arrest. In April two street vendors, arrested for infractions of
 municipal commercial regulations, were allegedly beaten to unconsciousness; they
 lodged a formal complaint against the police. In July two Montevideo policemen
 were allowed to return to active duty, pending a judicial investigation of allegations
 that they had "abused their authority and caused injury" to a narcotics suspect. Mi-
 nors are thought to be particularly vulnerable to abuse. In June the lower house
 of Parliament's Commission on Human Rights called for accelerated investigations
 into the case of a minor who was allegedly beaten while in police custody. In Sep-
 tember another minor riled a complaint that local police had detained him without
 charge and beaten him apparently because they mistook him for a robbery suspect.
 At year's end none of the above cases had been resolved.
 On November 10, Uruguay deposited its instrument of ratification of the Inter-
 American Convention for the Prevention of Torture. The judicial and parliamentary
 branches of Government investigate specific allegations of abuse, and the Interior
 Ministry has an internal section responsible for monitoring police conduct. Nonethe-
 less, many cases of abuse go unreported and there are few instances in which police
 officials are tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison for physically abusing pris-
 oners.
 Conditions in prisons and juvenile detention facilities vary from one institution
 to another but generally remain poor. Complaints commonly voiced by government
 and independent human rights investigators include deteriorated buildings and
 equipment, poor sanitary conditions, inadequately staffed and equipped on-site clin-
 ics, and a near total lack of training, educational, and recreational opportunities. In
 early November, two mentally ill minors died of undetermined causes while in the
 custody of INAME, the government agency for children. Both minors had been treat-
 ed in public health facilities -shortly before their deaths. A parliamentary investiga-
 tion was begun to determine responsibility for the incidents. In December a local
 newspaper printed photos purporting to show that four prisoners were chained in
 their celis in La Libertad prison. The Human Rights Commission interviewed wit-
 nesses and prison officials. Although circumspect in pronouncing on the validity of
 the accusations, the Commission nevertheless called for improvements in general
 prison conditions, while expressing confidence that if the abuse had occurred, it was
 an isolated incident.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires the police to
 have a written warrant issued by a judge before they can make an arrest, The only
 exception is when the accused is apprehended during the commission of a crime.
 
 
 The Constitution also guarantees the accused the right to a judicial determination
 of the legality of detention and requires that the detaining authority explain and
 justify to the judiciary the legal grounds for the detention. A detainee may be held
 incommunicado by the police for a period of 24 hours before being presented to a
 judge, at which time he or she has the right to counsel. If the detainee cannot afford
 a lawyer, a public defender is appointed. The judicial process must begin within 48
 hours; failure to comply has led to the release of accused persons. If the crime car-
 ries a penalty of at least 2 years in prison, the accused person is confined during
 the judge's investigation of the charges unless the authorities agree to release the
 person on bail, or until the case is closed. These constitutional provisions are gen-
 erall respected in pbractie.
 e. enial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, headed by a Supreme Court, which in turn supervises the work of the lower
 courts. There is a parallel military court system that operates under a military jus-
 tice code. Two military justices sit on the Supreme Court but participate only in
 cases involving the military. Military justice applies to civilians only during a state
 of war or insurrection. The independence of the judiciary is well respected in prac-
 tice.
 All criminal trials must open with a public statement of the charge by the pros-
 ecutor or the complainant. Trial proceedings are based on written arguments, which
 are not normally made public, but the defense attorney has access to all documents
 that form part of the written record. Beginning in 1990 the Uruguayan legal system
 began to introduce oral arguments into court proceedings. Under Uruguayan law
 there is no provision against self-incrimination, and the defendant may be compelled
 to answer any questions posed by the judge. All convictions may be appealed by the
 defense attorney or prosecutor to a higher court which may acquit the person of the
 crime, confirm the conviction, or reduce or increase the sentence.
 Uruguay has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Famil , Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the right toprivacy. It staes that the home, absolutely invio-
 lable at night, may be entered and searched only with a judicial warrant during the
 day. Protection for private papers and correspondence is equally strong, and a war-
 rant is required for confiscation. These rights and safeguards are generally re-
 spected in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press. All elements of the political spectrum freely express their viewpoints in
 both the print and broadcast media. Montevideo has 7 daily newspapers and 10 im-
 portant weeklies; there are approximately 100 weekly and a few daily newspapers
 elsewhere. Montevideo has one government-affiliated and 3 commercial television
 stations. There are about 110 radio stations and 20 television stations in the coun-
 try as a whole.
 The National University is autonomous, and academic freedom is generally re-
 spected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law protects freedom of
 assembly and association. Formerly banned groups, such as the Tupamaros (a ter-
 rorist movement active in the 1960's and early 1970's), freely organize and express
 their opinions. Public marches and demonstrations are allowed with permits from
 the Ministry of the Interior and occur without official harassment or intimidation.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion, provided for by the Constitution, is
 respected in practice. Most Uruguayans who practice a religion are Roman Catholic.
 Members of other religious groups exercise their faiths unhindered, and mission-
 arics are free to proselytize. Uruguayans who profess agnosticism or atheism ex-
 press their views freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foregn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -Internal and foreign travel and emigration are unrestricted. Uruguay-
 ans who left the country during the military regime and wish to return are encour-
 aged to do so. All of the prominent political figures exiled by the military regime
 have returned.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Uruguayan citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their govern-
 ment. Uruguay is a multiparty democracy with mandatory universal suffrage for
 those 18 years of age or older. Voting is not restricted by race, sex religion, or eco-
 nomic status. The Colorado party, the National (Blanco) party, the broad Front Coa-
 lition, and the New Space Coalition are the four major political groupings. Each al-
 
 
 504
 lows ideological divisions within the party and each such division may field its own
 slate of candidates in general elections. he electoral system combines a primary
 and a general election in a double simultaneous vote. Each party fields different
 lists of candidates; in essence, voters express a preference for a part.y and for a list
 of candidates rather than for an individual candidate. The winning list of the party
 that receives the most votes wins the presidency and a proportion of seats in the
 Senate and Chamber of Deputies corresponding to the percentage of votes that the
 p arty as a whole received. A party therefore man, run multiple presidential can-
 didates, each with his or her own slate of legislative candidates. National and pro-
 vincial elections are held simultaneously every 5 years. Blacks and women face de
 facto impediments to participation in politics and employment in government (see
 Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups, some of which could not operate openly under mili-
 tary rule, now function freely and without restriction. A prominent local human
 rights group, Peace and Justice Service (SERPAJ), was legalized in early 1985 after
 operating underground for 2 years during the military regime. SERPAJ investigates
 cases involving killing, torture, and disappearances which occurred during the mili-
 tary regime. Another human rights group, the Legal and Social Institute of Uru-
 guay, consists of several lawyers and social workers who once defended persons im-
 prisoned during the dictatorship and who now focus on juridical aspects of human
 rights cases, such as allegations of police abuse. Both organizations also advocate
 improvements in prison conditions.
 The Government is open to inquiries from such organizations and does not restrict
 the activities of human rights investigators. The Government has also fully complied
 with U.N. Human Rights Commission inquiries dating from the military regime pe-
 riod and is a strong supporter of and participant in human rights activities in
 international forums such as the United Nations and tie Organization of American
 States.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status is prohibited
 by the Constitution and by law. There is no evidence of officially sanctioned dis-
 crimination.
 Approximately 4 percent of Uruguay's population, or 120,000 to 130,000 people,
 belong to the country's black minority. Blacks are underpresented among elite
 groups and are almost completely absent from the professional, bureaucratic, politi-
 cal, and academic sectors of society. They lack the educational opportunities and so-
 cia and political onnections necessay or entry into these groups. The Government
 has not addressed this issue because most Urugusyans do not believe that racial
 discrimination is a problem in Uruguay.
 ruguayan women enjoy equaity under the law but face a number of forms of
 discrimination stemming from traditional attitudes and practices. Recent surveys
 show that the work force remains segregated by gender. For example, construction
 is overwhelmingly male, while teaching is overwhelmingly female. Women tend to
 be concentrated in lower paying jobs. Sixty-three percent of women in the work force
 earn less than an amount    al to double the minimum wage while only 33 percent
 of the men earn so little. Women make up about a third of the work force. They
 attend the National University in large numbers and often pursue professional ca-
 reers. However, they are underrepresented in traditionally male professions such as
 engineering or architecture. Women are found at the highest levels of the Uru-
 guayan private and public sectors but their numbers are relatively limited. Con-
 scious of these problems, the Lacaile administration established the National Insti-
 tute for Women to collect data on women's issues and to address these issues more
 effectively.
 Uruguayan society is increasingly sensitized to the question of violence against
 women. According to women's rights groups, a high percentage of Uruguayan
 women are victims of violence. Rape statistics increased sharply in 1992, possibly
 because victims are more willing to report the crime. A strong women's rights move-
 ment in .Uruguay is working to develop statistical data on the problem and to lobby
 for solutions. The Government is also increasingly involved in seeking solutions. In
 1988 the Interior Ministry created a women's division in the police force, concerned
 exclusively with crimes against women. This division was recently merged with the
 division for cases involving minors. The Penal Code mandates prison sentences of
 3 months to 3 years for the crime of "private violence." However, many women are
 unable to make and sustain complaints under this law, especially when they con-
 
 
 505
 tinue to reside with their partners. One priority of the National Institute for Women
 is the creation of a shelter for battered women that is accessible 24 hours a day.
 Some private women's rights groups also offer counseling services, and the Monte-
 video municipality opened a  -hour hot line for battered women in October, which
 soon after opening averaged 30 calls a day.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution guarantees the right of workers to
 organize freely and encourages the formation of trade unions. Civil servants may
 join unions, as may employees of state-run enterprises. However, in June, the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO), in published comments on a complaint against
 the Government of Uruguay, noted that although Uruguay has ratified LO) Conven-
 tions 87 and 98 on freedom of association and collective bargaining, it has yet to
 pass implementing legislation.
 Uruguayan workers, including some civil servants, have the right to strike. Re-
 form legislation now pending in the legislature would require workers to vote by se-
 cret ballot on whether or not to stage a strike. There was significant strike activity
 in 1992. The Labor Ministry has an office that assists in mediating collective and
 individual labor disputes; members of the Parliament's Labor Commissions also oc-
 casionally mediate labor disputes on an ad hoc basis.
 The Government may legally compel workers to work during a strike if their work
 is considered an essential service. The definition of an essential service is relatively
 limited, although in some cases it may exceed ILO guidelines. In 1992 the essential
 services prvision was invoked to maintain services in the postal workers' strike and
 an air traffic controllers' strike. In both cases the declarations appeared to facilitate
 rapid resolution of the conflicts.
 An estimated 17 percent of the work force is unionized. All labor unions are inde-
 pendent of government and political party control. There are no restrictions on a
 union's right to affiliate with international trade union bodies. The largest trade
 union confederation, the Inter-Union Workers Assembly-National Workers Associa-
 tion (PIT-CNT), is by choice not officially affiliated with any of the three world fed-
 erations. In 1992, however, the PIT-CNT sent its first observer to an International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions Congress. Many individual unions are affiliated
 with international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Colective bargaining ceased
 during military rule. From the return of civilian rule until March 1992, industrial
 contracts were ne otiated on a sectorwide rather than a plant-by-plant basis, and
 took place under tIe auspices of a salary council, a tripartite organization composed
 of government, labor, and management. Government representatives played an ac-
 tive role in mediating these negotiations in some sectors; in others, they functioned
 more as observers.
 The Lacalle administration has consistently indicated that it intends to withdraw
 from private sector salary negotiations. Consequently, in March the Government
 mandated a flat 35-percent salary increase for the private sector over the next 12
 months. Under the new policy, contracts may be negotiated on a plantwide or a
 sectorwide basis, with or without government mediation, as the parties wish. Com-
 panies may exceed the 35-percent guideline, but only with the understanding that
 the Government will not help them by easing pricing policy or offering soft loans.
 Union leaders believe that the government presence ensures contracts will be ful-
 filled, and generally object to reducing it in contract negotiations.
 While no institutionalized mechanism exists in Uruguay for resolving complaints
 against employers, discrimination by employers, including arbitrary dismissals for
 union activity, generally is prohibited.
 Workers employed in Uruguay's five special export zones are fully covered by all
 labor legislation. There are no unions in any of these zones, but there are as yet
 relatively few workers in traditionally organizable occupations.
 e. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by" law, and there is no evidence that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children are protected by a Child
 Labor Code. Violations of the Code are punishable by fines of up to $500. Children
 as young as 12 may be employed only if they have a special work permit. Children
 under the age of 18 may not perform dangerous, fatiguing, or night work, apart
 from domestic employment. Salaries and hours for children are controlled more
 strictly than for adults. Children over the age of 16 may sue in court for payment
 of wages, and children have the legal right to dispose of their own income. Children
 working in the expanding informal sector as street vendors or others with no fixed
 place of work, or in the agrarian sector, are generally less strictly regulated and re-
 ceive lower pay.
 
 
 506
 e. Acceptable Conditions f Work.-A legislated minimum monthly wage is in ef-
 fetin both the public and private sectors and appears to be effectively enforced.
 The minimum wage is adjusted whenever public sector wages are adjusted, usually
 once every 4 mnths. It functions mre as an index for calculating wage rates than
 as a true measure of minimum subsistence levels and would not provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. The Government is discussing the possi-
 bilit of establishing a standard hsubsistence wage' instead.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours for a 6-day week. Industrial workers receive
 overtime compensation for work in excess of 48 hours. Workers are entitled to 20
 days of paid vacation after a year of employment. Workers are protected by legisla-
 tion regulating health and safety conditions; it is enforced by the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Security in a generally effective manner. Some labor regulations cover
 urban industrial workers more adequately than rural and agricultural workers. Re-
 cently, however, the Labor Ministry has concentrated on extending labor regulation
 enforcement to rural areas.
