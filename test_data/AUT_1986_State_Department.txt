 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. A
 coalition government (Socialist Party and People's Party) was
 formed after the November 1986 national election. The loosely
 united Green Party and the right-wing Freedom Party are in
 opposition.
 Austria has a developed economy, and Austrians enjoy a high
 standard of living.
 Since World War II, Austria has served as a country of first
 asylum for nearly 2 million refugees from Eastern Europe.
 During periods of crisis and upheaval in Eastern Europe,
 refugee arrivals rise significantly.
 During the 1986 presidential election campaign, observers
 reported several instances in which participants in campaign
 rallies expressed anti-Semitic sentiments directed against
 Austria's Jewish commmunity. These anti-Semitic expressions
 occurred in connection with Kurt Waldheim's candidacy for
 President and accusations concerning his activities during
 World War II. The Government of Austria has spoken out
 strongly against all such manifestations.
 In other regards, the 1986 human rights situation in Austria
 was essentially unchanged from the conditions which prevailed
 in previous years. To a very high degree, human rights are
 respected in Austria, and no charges of human rights
 violations on the part of the Government or other public
 institutions were made during 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings either
 by government authorities or opposition groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions by authorities.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is banned by Article II of the European Convention for
 the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which
 is incorporated into the Austrian Constitution. There is no
 evidence of any violation of this provision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention or exile. The
 law provides for investigative detention for 72 hours, by
 which time an investigative judge must decide on the legality
 of the detention. Provided the investigative judge agrees,
 the accused may be held in detention pending completion of an
 investigation for up to a maximum of 2 years. Grounds for
 investigative detention are enumerated in the law, as are
 conditions for release on bail. A 1983 law reformed the
 provisions concerning detention by shortening pretrial
 procedures, restricting the number of detentions, except in
 
 
 858
 AUSTRIA
 the case of persons who have or are alleged to have committed
 serious crimes, and providing better legal protection for
 detainees. There are no allegations that these provisions for
 investigative detention have been violated.
 Detention for minor infractions of administrative law may be
 imposed by the administrative authorities but is subject to
 court appeal. The Government is considering legislation
 requiring increased judicial control of such proceedings. The
 proposed legislation provides for the implementation of
 Article 5 of the Human Rights Convention according to which
 detention may only be imposed by an independent judge. In
 1985 a total of 2,388 persons were held for varying periods of
 time in investigative detention.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent from the executive and
 legislative branches of government. Trials are public.
 Judges are appointed for life and cannot, in principle, be
 removed from office. Jury trials are prescribed for major
 offenses, and those convicted have the right of appeal.
 Written charges must be presented to the accused, who has the
 right of representation by a lawyer.
 Concerned about the possibility of executive interference in
 the judicial system, critics argue that the public
 prosecutors' lack of independence from the Ministry of Justice
 opens the way for possible governmental meddling. To rectify
 this possible defect, the Government has been considering
 introducing a law which would require that directives issued
 by the ministry to the public prosecutors be made public.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law provides for the protection of personal data
 collected, processed, or transmitted by government agencies,
 public institutions, and private entities. Constitutional
 provisions also protect the secrecy of the mail and telephone.
 The privacy of family life is respected. There is no effort
 by the Government to monitor or control family life.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and,
 respected in practice. Austria has a free, independent, and
 multifaceted press, ranging from conservative to communist.
 Publications may be removed from circulation if they violate
 legal provisions concerning morality or public security. As a
 matter of practice, such cases are extremely rare. Opposition
 viewpoints are given wide attention in Austrian publications.
 Austria's well-established democratic political system, its
 active and independent press, and its effective judiciary
 combine to assure continued freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. The Austrian State Treaty of 1955, though, makes
 
 
 859
 AUSTRIA
 an exception to this principle in the case of Nazi
 organizations and activities. The Constitutional Law of 1945
 also prohibits Nazi organizations. The law on the formation
 of associations stipulates that permission to form an
 association may be denied if it is apparent that the
 organization will pursue the illegal activities of a
 prohibited organization.
 Public demonstrations require a permit from the police
 authorities. While foreigners may participate in demon-
 strations, it must be an Austrian citizen who submits the
 permit application. In processing such applications, the
 police may consider only the public safety aspect of the
 proposed demonstration and not its political purpose. Permits
 are routinely issued.
 Trade unions have an important voice in the country's
 political life due to their role in "social partnership," an
 unofficial system by which Austria's economic policies are
 determined by labor and management representatives. Labor is
 organized in 15 national unions, each of which is a member of
 the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ATUF). This organization
 has a strong, centralized leadership structure. Individual
 unions and the federation are independent of government or
 political party control. Unions have the right to organize
 workers, to negotiate wage agreements, and to strike, although
 strikes in Austria during the postwar period have been rare.
 One member of the present Cabinet is president of a national
 union and, until the Parliament dissolved October 3, 1986, the
 president of the lower house was also president of ATUF.
 Nearly 60 percent of the work force is organized in trade
 unions. ATUF is a member of the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions and also provides the worker delegate for
 Austria's International Labor Organization delegation.
 By law, most employees must be members of the Chambers of
 Labor. This organization, which is unique to Austria,
 represents workers' interests vis-a-vis the Government whereas
 the unions represent the workers vis-a-vis the employers. The
 leadership of the trade unions as well as of the Chambers of
 Labor is elected through democratic balloting. There are, in
 addition, a large number of trade associations and other
 professional groupings in Austria.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is guaranteed by the Constitution, although the
 Treaty of St. Germain, which also is a constitutional
 provision, restricts this freedom to the practice of religions
 which are compatible with public safety and morality. In
 order to qualify as a recognized religious organization under
 Austrian law, religious groups register with the Government.
 Although 85 percent of the population are Roman Catholic, most
 of the world's major religions are represented. Despite its
 dominant position in the country, the political influence of
 the Catholic Church has steadily diminished since 1945 and is
 no longer considered a major political force.
 Although overt and explicit expressions of anti-Semitism are
 not part of public discourse here, several recent surveys
 indicate that such sentiments are latent among some Austrians.
 These came to the surface when accusations concerning the
 wartime activities of Kurt Waldheim (elected President in June
 1986) elicited a disturbing anti-Semitic reaction on the part
 
 
 860
 AUSTRIA
 of individual Austrian citizens. The Government has condemned
 this phenomenon in very strong terms and has recommitted the
 country to combating all its manifestations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement
 within the country or the right to change residence or
 workplace. Austrian residents are free to travel or to
 emigrate. Citizens who have left the country have the right
 to return. No area of the country is closed to travel.
 Austria serves as a country of first asylum for refugees from
 Eastern Europe and as a transit point for Soviet Jewish
 emigrants on their way to Israel or other third countries.
 Once in Austria, refugees are not forcibly returned to their
 country of origin. During 1985 Eastern European refugee
 arrivals totaled 6,050. Arrivals in 1986 numbered 8,179, a 35
 percent increase over 1985. Austria budgeted about $22
 million in 1986 for refugee reception, care, and maintenance.
 The Government has drastically limited the issuance of work
 permits to non-Austrians in an effort to reduce domestic
 unemployment. Austria's guest worker population, which
 averaged 226,400 in 1973, stood at 142,286 in 1985.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Austri is governed through a democratic parliamentary
 system. Under the Constitution, elections must be held at
 least every 4 years. Elections are free and regularly draw
 high levels of participation, The 1986 national elections
 resulted in a change of government in Austria. No party won
 an absolute majority. The Socialist Party, which won SO
 seats, went into coalition with the People's Party, which won
 77 seats. Several small parties also contested the elections,
 including the Communist Party, which did not receive
 sufficient support to elect candidates to the Parliament. The
 right-wing Freedom Party won 18 seats, and'the Greens won 8.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No charges of human rights violations were brought by
 international or nongovernmental organizations during 1985 and
 1986. Austria recognizes the competence of the European Human
 Rights Commission in Strasbourg for implementing the European
 Convention. Austria concerns itself extensively with
 international human rights matters. Representatives of
 oppressed groups frequently visit Austria and meet with
 government officials and political leaders to explain their
 views. Because of Austria's geographic position, such
 meetings frequently focus on the human rights situation in
 Eastern Europe. Austria hosted a Council of Europe conference
 on human rights in March 1985.
 Amnesty International is the major nongovernmental human
 rights organization active in Austria. Austrians also provide
 financial support for the Bruno Kreisky Foundation, which was
 formed in 1976 to honor distinguished human rights activists.

 AUSTRIA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Austria has an extensive public welfare system, the benefits
 of which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis.
 Legal restrictions on women's rights have long been
 abolished. Women are entering the work force in increasing
 numbers and have made substantial progress toward economic
 equality in the postwar era. Nevertheless, significant
 inequality in practice still exists in political, economic,
 and social fields despite legislation enacted in 1977 and 1979
 to reform family law. In 1985 approximately 41 percent of the
 work force was composed of women. Men, however, earned 49
 percent more than women overall. Among men and women with
 equal training and education, men earned one-third more than
 women. Women participate fully in the electoral process and
 constitute 53 percent of the Austrian electorate. Since 1983
 a State Secretary, a woman in the Chancellor's office, has
 been responsible for women's issues within the Government.
 The new coalition Government has two women ministers
 (Education and Family, Sports and Environment).
 The human rights of Austrian minorities are respected, but the
 Slovenian minority in the province of Carinthia is concerned
 about the future of instruction in the Slovene language in
 local elementary schools. The Slovenes fear that changes in
 the province's bilingual education system, which some
 German-speaking groups advocate, would effectively eliminate
 Slovene from most provincial elementary schools. Negotiations
 are currently under way on a proposal which would allow
 parents to determine whether their children should receive
 instruction in German or Slovenian.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no minimum wage in Austria, but anyone whose income
 falls below the official poverty line of about $3,960 per year
 is eligible to receive social welfare benefits.
 Since 1975 the legal Austrian workweek has been established at
 40 hours, although workers in several key branches have
 attained reductions below this level recently. The minimum
 working age in Austria is 15. The Labor Codification Law and
 the Labor Protection Law are among the more important legal
 instruments for ensuring workers' rights and decent working
 conditions. A labor inspectorate attached to the Justice
 Ministry conducts routine inspections of health and safety
 conditions at the workplace.
