 GABON
 President Omar Bongo has ruled Gabon since 1967, but internal pressures begin-
 ning in late 1989 forced him to acquiesce to sweeping political reforms, including
 the promulgation of a new Constitution providing or many basic freedoms and ex-
 plicitly abolishing the former system of one-party rule. However, the National As-
 sembly is still controlled by Bongo's former party (the Gabonese Democratic Party,
 or PDG), which won a majority of seats in multiparty legislative elections in 1990.
 Although the PDG supported independent candidate Bongo in the 1993 Presidential
 elections, Bongo had relinquished all formal ties with the PDG before the electoral
 campaign. There are also deputies from eight other political parties.
 President Bongo's current 7-year term expires in February 1994. In keeping with
 the 1991 Constitution and the recommendations of the 1990 National Conference,
 presidential elections took place in December. In an election marked by administra-
 tive chaos and attempts by supporters of several candidates to influence the out-
 come illegally, Bongo received 51.18 percent of the vote. Following the proclamation
 of the election results, opposition presidential candidates filed suit with the Con-
 stitutional Court on December 20 to have the election annulled. The Court, which
 is charged with verifying the results of all elections, must render a decision within
 3 months from the date the suit was filed. Since the Constitution allows presidents
 to serve two 5-year terms, President Bongo's term would expire in 1999.
 Responsibility for internal security is shared by the gendarmerie (a paramilitary
 force of 2,700) and the national poice (consisting of 2,000 troops). Security forces
 regularly employ beatings when interrogating suspects. The lice and the gendar-
 merie came under criticism for not protecting opposition political gatherings from
 potential and actual violenc  e Section 2.b.).
 Gabon is richly endowed with petrleum, manganese, uranium, and vast timber
 resources, but it has experienced limited agricutra and industrial development
 and must import most of its food and manufactured goods. Rain forest covers 85 per-
 cent of the country, and a pproximately half the 1.2 million population lives in rural
 areas. Gabon's relatively high per capita income ($5,906 in 1992). based largely on
 oil revenues, belies the underdeveloped nature of the country and its economy. Due
 to the precipitous fall in revenue from oil exports in the late 1980's and an increas-
 ing debt load, the Government imposed limited austerity measures to meet Inter-
 national Monetary Fund program criteria in 1991. Since indeendence, Gabon's eco-
 nomic polic has followed a free market orientation and welcomed foreign invest-
 ment.
 In 1993 the Government carefully controlled the political process culminating in
 the Decemer p residential elections. It introduced preelectoral measures, namely, a
 new Electoral Code, a general census, a voting register, and several commissions to
 oversee the  ctuallthe same time, it engaged in or facilitated a series
 of steps during the year which seriously impinged on frieedoms of speech, press, as-
 sembly, and association and harassed political and humn rights critics. Other

 human rights abuses included the security forces' mistreatment of illegal aliens, de-
 tainees, and prisoners and legal discrimination and societal violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was one confirmed report of
 extrajudicial killing carried out by security forces. During demonstrations that fol-
 lowed the announcement of President Bongo's election victory, members of the Pres-
 idential Guard detained, then publicly shot and killed a demonstrator. A soldier was
 arrested in this case, and both the Government and the military were carrying out
 investigations at year's end. In the following 2 weeks, there were at least three addi-
 tional confirmed reports of security forces using lethal force against demonstrators
 or curfew violators.
 In addition, there was an unconfirmed report that one person died in prisn when
 he was deprived of water. An investigation was still ongoing into the death of
 "Fantomas, a prisoner who died in police custody in 1992.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed cases of disappearances or abduc-
 tions ascribed to government security forces or any other group.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and inhuman or extreme mistreat-
 ment. Gabonese security forces and prison guards frequently use beatings, not only
 to obtain confessions but also simply to exercise authority over prisoners. Credible
 witnesses visiting imprisoned nationals report such beatings, along with routine
 strippings and head shavings. In the case of Louis-Venant Makomambasa (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.), in which there were political and security aspects, his relatives reported
 that he had been beaten and harshly interrogated. However, following his release,
 the family elected not to press charges and therefore no investigation was carried
 out.
 Conditions in most prisons are abysmal; sanitation and ventilation are very poor,
 and medical care is almost nonexistent. Only minimal food is provided, and there
 are reports that prisoners are deprived of water as a further means of punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for up to 48 hours of
 initial preventive detention, after which either a court s judgment must be delivered,
 or a more lengthy investigation opened. In practice, however, prisoners are often
 held longer without charge, especially in security-related cases. In a highly pub-
 licized case, a member of the gendarmerie, Louis-Venant Makomambasa, was ac-
 cused of passing military secrets to a leading opposition political party. He was ar-
 rested, questioned, then released. One week later, relatives reported that he had
 again been detained, and that he was held without charge, tortured, and otherwise
 mistreated. After 3 weeks, he was again released.
 There were reports that the authorities called in opposition members and union
 members for short periods of questioning. There were also occasional, unconfirmed
 reports from the interior that local officials held people briefly in connection with
 political activities. As far as known, the Government did not press charges in these
 cases.
 The Government continued to detain frequently-usually for short periods-illegal
 aliens suspected of violating the law. (see Section 2.d.).
 There were no known political detainees or prisoners being held at year's end.
 Exile is not used as a punishment or means of political control in Gabon, and
 there are no opposition leaders currently living in forced exile. Pierre Mambouridou,
 who was convicted in absentia for involvement in a 1989 coup plot, returned to
 Gabon in 1993 to present himself as a presidential candidate. Although he experi-
 enced some difficulty boarding a plane in Dakar, no action was taken against him
 upon his return. The conviction against Mamboundou still exists, but there had
 been no action taken to prosecute him at year's end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system includes the normal court sys-
 tem, a Military Tribunal to handle all offenses under military law, a State Security
 Court, which is a civilian tribunal, and a Special Criminal Court that deals with
 fraud and embezzlement of funds by public officials. There are no traditional or cus-
 tomary courts, but in some areas family disputes may be taken before a village chief
 for resolution. However, chiefs' decisions have no legal weight and are not recog-
 nized by the Government.
 The regular civilian court has three levels: the trial court; the appellate court; and
 the Supreme Court, which has three chambers. The 1991 Constitution transformed
 what had been the fourth chamber into the Constitutional Court, an independent
 body which is devoted solely to constitutional questions.
 
 
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for in the Constitution and is generally
 respected in criminal cases. Nevertheless, procedural safeguards are lacking, par-
 ticularly in state security trials, where the judiciary remains potentially vulnerable
 to intervention by the executive. In these courts, trials are open to the public, and
 defendants are represented by counsel, but appeals to the Supreme Court are re-
 stricted to raising points of law. The State Security Court is not a permanent body
 and is called into existence only as the Government determines to hear security
 cases. It was last convoked in 1990 to hear the coup plot cases of 1989-90.
 The new Constitutional Court, invested in February 1992, has demonstrated that
 it can act independently of the Government. Its decisions were integrated into the
 1993 Electoral Code which governed the country's first multiparty presidential elec-
 tions in December. In November the Court declared unconstitutional several articles
 of a press decree proposed by the President, including an article which would have
 required newspaper publishers to submit copy to the Minister of Territorial Admin-
 istration prior to publication (see Section 2.a.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides protection against searches without warrant and surveillance
 of individuals or other invasions of privacy. Legally authorized searches of private
 homes may occur only during designated hours. Since the promulgation of the new
 Constitution, extralegal abuses of this nature have decreased. Nevertheless, search
 warrants often require minimal justification and may even be issued after the fact.
 Government authorities have used warrants to gain access to the homes of opposi-
 tion leaders and their families although there were no confirmed cases of forced
 entry without warrant. The Government also regularly exercises surveillance of pri-
 vate citizens' movements, correspondence, and telephone conversations. There have
 been credible reports of government and military personnel being discharged, trans-
 ferred, or denied promotion because of membership or association with opposition
 parties.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The. Constitution provides for the right of free
 speech and press. People speak freely, including in the National Assembly.
 There are nine weekly independent and opposition newspapers in addition to the
 government-controlled daily, L'Union. In April the first opposition radio station,
 Radio Liberte, began broadcasting and in September Television Liberte commenced
 operation. The ruling PDG also began a radio station and part-time television serv-
 ice. During the presidential campaig, media, especially those controlled by political
 parties, but also L'Union published numerous allegations of corruption against poli-
 ticians of all stripes and launched personal attacks on political leaders and their
 families.
 A disturbing trend, however, was the growing tendency by security elements to
 resort to intimidation and extralegal acts (such as electronic jamming and the
 confiscation of transmitting equipment) in an attempt to influence the opposition
 media. In July, in response to opposition press attacks on the Government and the
 military, the Ministers of Defense and Territorial Administration convoked opposi-
 tion press leaders and demanded more responsible journalistic pre.ctices. Unidenti-
 fied security elements subjected Radio Liberte, whose legal status was disputed by
 the Minister of Communications, to electronic jamming on numerous occasions
 throughout 1993, with the complicity of the Government. In another incident, the
 Governor of Tchibanga dismantled a Radio Liberte transmitter which was eventu-
 ally restored to its owners. On December 16, the facilities of another independent
 radio station, Frequence Libre, were destroyed by an unidentified group of comman-
 dos operating after the government-imposed curfew. At year's end, an investigation
 was pending.
 In early September, following the publication of an article in an opposition paper
 alleging that human sacrifices were taking place at the Presidency, the Prime Min-
 ister issued a decree prohibiting the publication of any newspaper not in conformity
 with a preindependence press code and existing commercial reglations. This meas-
 ure effectively banned for nearly 2 months the publication oPall but a handful of
 papers controlled by supporters of the President. On October 7, President Bongo,
 acting under his constitutional powers to pass legislation by decree when the Na-
 tional Assembly is not in session, issued a comprehensive press decree. The Na-
 tional Communications Council and an opposition Deputy immediately challenged
 this decree, and the Constitutional Court subsequenty ruled several of its provi-
 sions unconstitutional, including requirements that newspapers register as commer-
 cial entities and submit copy to government authorities before publication. With the
 unconstitutional articles deleted, the National Assembly approved the press decree
 
 
 before the end of its 1993 session, and the decree will enter into force in February
 1994.
 International news is rebroadcast by Gabonese stations, and some foreign stations
 can be picked up via satellite. Foreign periodicals and newspapers are widely avail-
 able, including a number of sensational exposes of high-level corruption which ap-
 peared in the French press. There were no government bans on foreign news.
 There are no official restrictions on academic freedom, including research.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association. -Recognized organizations
 (whether political, labor, youth, women's cultural, ethnic, or otherwise) enjoy free-
 dom of assembly and association. A number of political parties held parts of their
 party congresses in the National Assembly building itself.
 Permits are required for all outdoor assemblies, and the police must be notified
 in advance. By law, unauthorized demonstrations are not permitted, but in practice
 they often take place and are tolerated. There were no known instances of the au-
 thorities prohibiting meetings or demonstrations for most of the year, but the Gov-
 ernment imposed a state of alert in mid-December that banned all public meetings,
 and security forces prevented various opposition gatherings from taking place.
 Gabonese authorities normally showed considerable restraint in dealing with dem-
 onstrators. During the 2 weeks prior to the elections, police acted quickly and effec-
 tively to assure that demonstrations and confrontations between the opposition and
 the PDG remained peaceful. However, during other times of the year security forces
 were noticeably absent from potentially troublesome situations, despite advance
 knowledge. Police failed to defuse riots after an August soccer match that resulted
 in four deaths. They were also absent from some opposition gatherings which were
 disrupted by violence attributed to street gangs paidby rival parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion, and the Constitution provides
 for religious freedom. A significant number of Gabonese in urban areas are Catholic
 or Protestant, while both Christianity and traditional African religions are practiced
 in the interior. Less than 1 percent of Gabonese are Muslims, although the Presi-
 dent and a significant number of the West African expatriate population-perhaps
 as many as 200,000-are Muslim. A number of foreign missionary groups engage
 in both evangelical and social projects with no government interference. In 1970 the
 Government banned Jehovah's Witnesses, claiming that their activities fostered dis-
 unity. This ban has been neither rescinded nor actively enforced.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -Although there are no legally mandated restrictions on internal move-
 ment, Gabonese nationals and expatriates alike frequently encounter difficulties. Po-
 lice and gendarmerie officials often stop travelers to examine identity, residence
 and registration documents. In May what were thought to be politically motivated
 groups formed barricades cn many of the roads in Gabon's interior, demanding im-
 proved government facilities and services. Many of these groups descended into law-
 lessness, extorting cash from travelers and damaging vehicles, thereby greatly re-
 stricting the flow of goods and people. Government authorities eventually sent
 troops to clear out the barricades, and while there were arrests, there were no re-
 ports of serious violence or abuse.
 The curfew and the state of alert imposed in mid-December placed limits on free-
 dom of movement. Police detained or fined anyone out after 10 p.m. and frequently
 stopped vehicles for random searches. Routine identity checks also greatly in-
 creased. During the 2 weeks immediately after announcement of election results,
 the authorities restricted travel of some opposition figures and others associated
 with the "Second Republic Government" of Paul Mba Abessole; two presidential can-
 didates were barred from traveling to their hometowns, and one was not permitted
 to board a flight for Europe.
 Gabonese nationals often encounter difficulties when they wish to travel abroad.
 The Gabonese Center for Documentation requires extensive paperwork from Gabo-
 nese citizens in order to obtain a passport and often imposes delays of up to a year
 before granting the document. An exit visa is required to leave the country. Opposi-
 tion members have complained that they have been subjected to stricter exit visa
 control than nonpolitically active citizens. Women must have permission to travel
 from their husbands, which is sometimes denied, in order to obtain this visa.
 Foreign nationals must pay the equivalent of $100 for an exit/reentry permit for
 each trp out of the country, and even with valid documents they often experience
 difficulties at ports of entry. The authorities turn even documented foreigners away.
 The roughly 250,000 African expatriates resident in Gabon encounter the greatest
 difficulties; residence cards cost over $1,000, and foreigners are often detained even
 when in possession of valid paperwork. Requests for bribes are commonplace.
 Gabon continues to control strictly the influx of foreign workers. The Government
 has established a program of voluntary departure for iflegal immigrants in coopera-
 
 
 104
 tion with a number of African embassies and consulates, and this has greatly dimin-
 ished the cases of mistreatment of undocumented immigrants. Between 1992 and
 1993, the Government forcibly repatriated approximately 15,000 Nigerians without
 due process.
 Gabon continues to exercise its own control over refugee identification, although
 coordination with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has im-
 proved and statistics are more readily published. There are about 150 refugees in
 abon; there were no reports of mistreatment or forced repatriation of refugees in
 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1991 Constitution provides for this right, including the right of citizens to or-
 ganize and campaign in the political process. There were serious irregularities in
 the 1990 multiparty legislative elections, including ballot rigging by the PDG and
 other parties. In March 1992, the National Assembly adopted an Electoral Code
 which gave the Ministry of Territorial Administration control of the organization of
 the 1993 Presidential elections, with political parties and nongovernmental organi-
 zations given observer status. Despite a long lead time, grants of material assist-
 ance from a number of countries, and offers of technical assistance from others, elec-
 tic,'. preparations were inadequate, especially in Libreville where 40 percent of eligi-
 ble voters reside. On election day, the combination of inadequate organization and
 poorly trained election officials facilitated attempts by supporters of several can-
 didates to influence the outcome, in particular through illegal trafficking in voter
 registration cards and multiple voting. The vote count itself took place under chaotic
 conditions. At midnight on December 9 when, according to several reports, votes
 were still being counted, the Minister of Territorial Administration issued results
 showing President Bongo the winner with 51.07 percent of the vote.
 While the Constitutional Court subsequently proclaimed Bongo the winner of the
 elections, a petition was filed with the Court on December 20 by several other can-
 didates to have the presidential election annulled.
 The declaration of election results was followed immediately by the imposition of
 a state of alert which, under the provisions of a preindependence law, provides for
 the house arrest of persons judged dangerous to public order and suspension of cer-
 tain rights, including the right of assembly and freedom from search without war-
 rant. The state of alert also permitted censorship of correspondence, the press,
 radio, film, and theater, limited the free circulation of persons and goods, and estab-
 lished a curfew. By year's end, the Government had invoked only a few of these
 sanctions, most notably a ban on travel by opposition presidential candidates and
 frequent military roadblocks and checkpoints. Citing organizational problems and
 an unsettled political climate, the Government postponed municipal elections, which
 had been scheduled for December 26, until March 27, 1994.
 There are no legal restrictions on women or minorities in politics. Some women
 have risen to positions of prominence in the Government. Of the 120 Deputies in
 the National Assembly, 6 are women, and 3 women head government ministries.
 The President of the new Constitutional Court is a distinguished female jurist, and
 women head many of Gabon's human rights and nongovernmental organizations.
 Despite constitutional protections, the indigenous Pygmies rarely participate in
 the political process, and the Government has made only marginal efforts to include
 them (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While the Government handles most investigations of human rights cases directly,
 it permits local human rights groups to function. Several of these local Kroups have
 become increasingly vocal In the first report of direct government interference, the
 head of the Gabonese League of Human Rights claimed that he was subjected to
 official harassment following a broadcast on Radio Liberte in which he attacked the
 Minister of Communication's decree suspending the independent press.
 There have been no active inquiries or participation from foreign groups in recent
 years, so the Government's attitude toward international inquiries is notknown.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1991 Constitution forbids discrimination based on national origin, race, gen-
 der, or opinion, and there are no systematic government-sponsored activities carried
 out against any specific group.
 Women.-Dcspite the new Constitution, women continue to face legal and societal
 discrimination. A woman is still required to obtain her husband's permission to
 
 
 travel abroad, and in the case of her deceased husband's estate, his family has the
 right to claim large parts of the property. The head of the Constitutional Court-
 a woman-and the League of Women Jurists are actively contesting these laws.
 Urban-based women face much less societal discrimination than those living in
 rural areas. They enjoy greater access to education, government employment, and
 private sector business opportunities than rural women, whose roles are determined
 by tradition and family and who bear the brunt of hard physical labor, both domes-
 tic and agricultural. Urban women are more aware of their legal rights, including
 the right to own property, to associate and invest as they like, and to run busi-
 nesses. Gabon has a common property law, whereby all property and wealth ob-
 tained after marriage is owned jointly by the husband and wife; however, a spouse
 may not demand half control of anything his or her partner earned or gained before
 the marriage. Women may also initiate divorce proceedings and women have initi-
 ated and won suits against discriminatory employers.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, does occur, especially in rural
 areas. Villagers do not frown upon rural women who leave abusive husbands, and
 among some ethnic groups, a woman's family may help her seek recourse from the
 family of the abusive husband. Rape and other violent crimes against women are
 infrequent.
 Children.-The Government has given only limited attention to children's rights.
 However, there was discussion of the subject in the National Assembly in 1993, and
 the Assembly gave the Government authority to sign the U.N. Declaration on the
 Rights of the Child.
 Indigenous People.-Several thousand indigenous Pygmies live in the south of
 Gabon. They exist largely independent of formal authorities, keeping their own tra-
 ditions in independent communities. In theory, they have the same civil rights as
 any citizen, although in practice they are often the victims of local discriminatory
 ractices. They have virtually no ability to participate in decisions affecting their
 I'nds, culture, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources. When the Govern-
 ment instituted its policy of "regroupment," consolidating several smaller villages
 into larger ones along main roads, the Pygmies remained in their outlying villages,
 mostly without electricity, water, or state schools. There are no government pro-
 grams specifically targeted to assist Pygmies.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Credible reports indicate that favoritism in
 hiring and promotion based on ethnicity occurs on a fairly frequent basis in both
 the public and private sectors. However, this occurs back and forth across ethnic
 lines, and neither the Government nor any single ethnic group is able to exercise
 a systematic denial of privilege or right to any other group. Some ethnic groups
 maintain that President Bongo carefully allocates key cabinet and government posi-
 tions to members of his ethnic group, and they complain that there is no legislative
 check on certain appointments, such as to the Supreme Court. However, individuals
 from all ethnic groups occupy prominent positions within the Government, the mili-
 tary, and the private sector.
 People with Disabilities.-There are no laws prohibiting discrimination against
 persons with disabilities, and there are no laws providing for accessibility for the
 disabled. In Auaust members of the National Association of Handicapped People in
 Gabon (ANPHG) staged a protest at the Presidential Palace, demanding accessible
 housing and revision of their social security benefits. In response to the ANPHG
 protests, the President's wife initiated a campaign to provide wheelchairs to the
 andicapped.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution recognizes the right of citi-
 zens to form associations of all kinds, including trade and labor unions. According
 to the Constitution, there are no restrictions on this right of association. Unions, in
 order to be officially recognized, must register with the Government. A 1992 law
 also allowed public employees to organize, although their right to strike is limited
 in areas pertaining to public safety. Under single-party rule, all workers were re-
 quired to belong to a single union, the Gabonese Labor Confederation (COSYGA),
 to which they contributed a mandatory 0.4 percent of their salaries. In 1992 a new
 law allowed for the creation of unions independent from COSYGA and abolished the
 mandatory contribution.
 Among some 70,000 union workers in the modern wage sector, COSYGA contin-
 ued to represent about 30,000, according to its statistics. COSYGA is strongest in
 the construction, commerce, and state-owned sectors, while CGSL is strong among
 teachers and foreign workers. The petroleum sector is also strongly unionized by
 smaller independent unions.
 
 
 A revision of the Labor Code, which dates back to 1978, has been repeatedly de-
 layed. It would grant government recognition to the new Gabonese Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (CGSL). The revised code had still not been officially pub-
 lished by year's end, but the CGSL has been recruiting members and organizing ac-
 tively for nearly 2 years. The CGSL has greatly expanded membership and rep-
 resentation for foreign workers in Gabon, who make up at least 30 percent of the
 work force. The CGSL has also been active in attempting to organize among civil
 servants, but labor leaders report that civil servants have remained reluctant to do
 so.
 According to the Labor Code, unions remain free from Government and political
 interference, although they are permitted to associate themselves as their members
 choose. During the presidential campaign, CGSL openly associated itself with the
 oposition (although not with a specific party), while COSYGA supported President
 Isongo.
 Under the 1978 Code, strikes are illegal if they occur before compulsory arbitra-
 tion takes place. The International Labor Organization and the CGSL have strongly
 criticized this provision, and the revised code holds provisions to change it. The Gov-
 ernment has announced, but has not yet carried through, its intentions to liberalize
 the right of workers to strike in the new code. In practice, the Government has al-
 lowed labor to strike without fear of arrest or other reprisal since the official liberal-
 ization that followed the National Conference in 1990.
 The Labor Code prohibits direct government action against strikers who have
 abided by the compulsory arbitration prvision. It also prohibits the Government
 from pressing charges against a group as a whole for criminal activities on the part
 of an person during a strike. In 1993 the Government did not punish strikers, in-
 cluding those who did not follow the provisions of the Labor Code. There were a
 number of short, wildcat strikes in 1993: Postal and Telecommunication workers
 struck occasionally, including on one occasion in support of Radio Liberte, which at
 the time was being jammed(see Section 2.a.); and university teachers also went on
 strike in June, refusin to give exams until the Government granted them a greater
 role in governing the National University. These strikes all took place with no gov-
 ernment reprisals against strikers.
 Unions and confederations are free to affiliate with and participate in inter-
 national labor bodies. The COSYGA is affiliated only with the Organization of Afri-
 can Trade Union Unity, although it participates with other international bodies.
 Even though the Government still had not granted CGSL legal recognition in 1993,
 CGSL has affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 the right of collective bargaining. Labor and management meet to negotiate dif-
 ferences, with a representative from the Ministry of Labor present only as an ob-
 server. When an accord is reached, the ministry representative is called upon to
 draft an agreement document and witness the parties' signatures. Unions in the pe-
 troleum sector and banking sectors, for example, have effectively engaged collective
 bargaining provisions to reach agreements with employers.
 Unions in each sector of the economy negotiate with management without govern-
 ment interference over specific pay scales, working conditions, and benefits, and the
 agreements reached apply to nonunion workers. While there are no specific laws
 which prohibit antiunion discrimination, decisions against employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are handled on a case by case basis; the law does not spe-
 cifically require employers to reinstate workers, but compensation, as decided by the
 court, must be made. in one case in 1993, a woman who was fired for becoming
 pregnant twice in a 2-year period won a suit against her employer. She informed
 the court that she did not wish to be reinstated, and a different form of compensa-
 tion was stipulated.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children below the age of 16 may
 not work without the express consent of the Ministries of Labor, Education, and
 Public Health. These Ministries rigorously enforce this law, and few people in the
 modern wage sector are under the age of 18. In rural areas, however, children work
 in agriculture and other traditional activities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1978 Labor Code and the 1982 General
 Convention of Labor govern working conditions and benefits for all sectors and pro-
 vide broad protection to workers. Each year representatives of labor, management,
 and government meet to examine economic and labor conditions; they recommend
 a minimum wage rate within government guidelines to the President, who then is-
 sues an annual decree. Currently, the minimum wage for unskilled workers is ade-
 
 
 107
 (cate to support workers and their families. The minimum monthly wage is $219
 (FFA 64,000).
 Gabon's oil and mineral wealth and its developed modern wage sector allow for-
 eign and local firms to pay competitive wages and grant generous fringe benefits,
 including paid maternity leave and 6 weeks of paid annual vacation. Union leaders
 have stated that in many cases adequate conditions of work exist.
 The standard legal workweek mandated by the Labor Code is 40 hours, and work
 over 40 hours a week must be compensated by overtime. A minimum rest period
 of 48 consecutive hours must be allowed.
 The Ministry of Health establishes occupational health and safety standards, but
 does not enforce these standards effectively. Application of labor standards varies
 greatly depending on company policy, and government regulation is largely ineffec-
 tive.
 Conditions for foreigner workers in Gabon, both documented and undocumented,
 are often especially harsh. Employers often stipulate longer hours and allow poorer
 working conditions, and they often hire only on a short-term basis in order to avoid
 paying social security taxes or benefits. Increased labor activities and worker edu-
 cation programs have improved some situations, but abuses still exist.
