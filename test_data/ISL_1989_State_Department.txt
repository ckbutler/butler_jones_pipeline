 ICELANDQ
 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty,
 parliamentary democracy. Its literate and educated people
 participate in high percentages in regular fair and free
 elections which determine the distribution of power among
 political parties and leaders. Freedom of the press and
 freedom of association are sacrosanct.
 The civil and criminal justice systems offer equal protection
 to all. The nation has no indigenous military forces or
 political security apparatus.
 Iceland has a mixed, open economy in which all of its citizens
 enjoy the right to hold private property.
 Icelanders have long been strong defenders of human rights
 both at home and internationally, and the country has an
 exemplary human rights record.
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killings do not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no instances of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are all prohibited by law and do not occur in
 practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process is provided by law and observed in practice. The
 Icelandic Constitution states that any person arrested by the
 authorities must be brought before a judge without undue delay.
 The judge must, within 24 hours, rule whether the person is to
 be detained. Although the Constitution allows for the
 imposition of bail, no such condition is usually applied. Any
 judicial ruling by the judge may be appealed immediately to a
 higher court. Preventive detention is not practiced. There
 were no allegations of arbitrary arrest.
 There is no exile. With regard to forced or compulsory labor,
 see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants may confront witnesses and otherwise participate in
 public trials, which are fair and free from intimidation. In
 addition, defendants are guaranteed the right to competent
 legal counsel of their own choice. In cases where defendants
 are unable to pay attorney's fees, the State does so. The
 courts are free of political control. Although the Ministry
 of Justice administers the lower court system, the Supreme
 Court carefully guards its independence and fairness. Juries
 are not normally used, but multijudge panels are common,
 especially in the appeals process. Due process is rigorously
 observed. There are no political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution and in practice, there is deep respect
 for the autonomy and rights of individuals. A warrant from a
 court is required for entry into a home except in cases of hot
 pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official entities, political
 organizations, or any other organized group into the private
 beliefs or personal liberties of individuals do not occur.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution expressly forbids censorship and other
 restrictions on the freedom of the press and a person's right
 to express his thoughts. Citizens and the media exercise this
 freedom extensively. Academic freedom of expression is
 vigorously exercised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to assemble unarmed,
 except when it is feared that such gatherings may cause riots.
 In practice, plans for public meetings are virtually never
 forbidden, and the authorities only rarely modify them.
 In addition, the Constitution-provides citizens the right to
 join together formally or informally to form associations
 without governmental authorization. A varied and wide spectrum
 of voluntary organizations plays a vital role in Icelandic
 politics and society. Icelanders ate free to maintain
 international contacts.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Lutheran Church is the established church of
 Iceland and most citizens are nominally members, there is
 complete freedom for other faiths. A variety of both Christian
 and non-Christian faiths are allowed to proselytize freely.
 They may maintain ties with and receive support from
 coreligionists abroad. Religious affiliation is not a factor
 in political or economic life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Icelanders have freedom to travel at home and abroad, to
 emigrate, rand ta return to Iceland at will. Refugees are
 -never compelled to return to a country in which they would
 face persecution.
 Section 3 -Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their-Government
 The political system is an open, fully functioning,
 parliamentary democracy in which voters freely choose the
 members of the Althing (parliament) who, in turn, make the
 laws of the land and determine the composition of the
 Cabinet. -Parliamentary elections are held at 4-year intervals
 unless the Althing dissolves itself before the end of its full
 term. Voting in elections and membership in the various
 
 
 1156
 ICELAND
 political parties are open to all citizens who are 18 years of
 age or older. Primary elections are used to select most
 Althing candidates. Multimember districts and proportional
 representation increase the chances for minority points of
 view to be represented. In addition, there is a strong
 cultural insistence on having the views of all significant
 groups represented in the Althing. Because no party gained a
 majority of seats in the April 1987 election, a three-party
 coalition government was formed in July 1987. This coalition
 broke up in September 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left
 Government comprising the Progressive Party, the Social
 Democratic Party, and the People's Alliance with Steingrimur
 Hermannsson of the Progressive Party as Prime Minister. The
 Citizen's Party joined the coalition on September 17, 1989.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No serious human rights violations have been alleged. In 1987,
 however, one Icelander complained to the European Commission
 of Human Rights that it was a violation of his rights to have
 an official of the same agency which accused him of violating
 a traffic law also pass judgment on and sentence him (i.e.,
 impose a monetary fine for speeding). The Commission
 determined that the case was admissible, but no further action
 took place in that forum pending discussions between the
 complainant and the Icelandic Ministry of Justice.
 Furthermore, a law will come into effect in 1992 that will
 transfer all judicial authority from local officials, who also
 serve concurrently as chiefs of police, to a new system of
 eight district courts.
 Several human rights organizations are active in Iceland. The
 Government and populace support international efforts to
 improve human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Iceland's ethnically homogeneous population is fiercely
 egalitarian and opposed to discrimination regardless of
 whether it is based on sex, religion, or other factors.
 Violence against women, both physical and mental, occurs. The
 problem is not widely publicized, but the Women's List raises
 it periodically in political debate. A public women's shelter
 operates in Reykjavik and offers protection to approximately
 200 women per year. Fifty percent of those who make use of
 the shelter cite alcohol abuse by their male partners as a
 contributing factor to the violence they suffer.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers and employers in Iceland make extensive use of the
 rights to (a) establish organizations, (b) draw up their own
 constitutions and rules, (c) choose their own leaders and
 policies, and (d) publicize their views. The resulting
 organizations are not controlled by the Government or any
 single political party but instead reflect the views of their
 members. Icelandic unions participate actively in European
 and international trade union organizations.

 ICELAND
 With the exception of limited categories of workers in the
 public sector whose services are essential to public health or
 safety (e.g.,-air traffic controllers), unions have possessed
 and used the right to strike under the law in Iceland for many
 years. However, the right to. strike was abridged through
 February 15, 1989, after the Government promulgated a
 provisional law on May 20, 1988, intended to cool down the
 overheated economy (also see Section 6.b.).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Over 90 percent of all eligible workers in Iceland belong to
 unions. There are no impediments to union membership in law
 or in practice. Virtually all unions utilize the right to
 bargain' collectively on wages, working conditions, and related
 issues. Labor courts adjudicate disputes over labor contracts
 and over the rights and provisions guaranteed under the 1938
 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes.
 Under the provisional law of May 20, 1988, those unions which
 had not yet concluded labor contracts were prohibited from
 making agreements giving workers larger increases in wages and
 benefits than was provided under the contracts concluded prior
 to May 20. The provisional law, later amended, also set aside
 through February 15, 1989, any provisions of labor contracts
 which would have permitted workers to cancel or renegotiate
 these contracts in the event that the consumer price index
 exceeded the predicted levels (called red lines) on specified,
 quarterly dates. (Red line provisions are common in Icelandic
 labor contracts.) The Icelandic Federation of Labor (IFL)
 protested this law publicly and sent a complaint to the
 Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) citing all three provisions as
 infringements of workers rights. After receiving the
 Government's position and views, the ILO found the
 Government's measures to be violations of bargaining rights,
 but nevertheless found them justifiable in view of the
 condition of the Icelandic economy.
 On August 26, 1988, the Government promulgated another
 provisional law affecting many labor contracts. This law
 froze wages and prices through September 30, 1988. A third
 provisional law, promulgated on September 28, extended this
 freeze through February 15, 1989, thereby depriving most
 workers of two or more wage increases scheduled under existing
 labor contracts. The IFL publicly protested these laws.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 exist in Iceland.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The employment of children below the age of 16 in factories,
 on ships, and in other places which are hazardous or require
 hard labor is prohibited by law, and this prohibition is
 observed in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Icelandic workers are protected by laws which effectively
 ensure their health and safety as well as guarantee them
 
 
 1158
 ICELAND
 unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and
 reasonable working conditions and hours. Although there is no
 minimum wage law, union membership is so pervasive and
 effective that labor contracts, in effect, guarantee even the
 lowest paid workers a sufficient income to give them and their
 families decent living conditions. Food, shelter, health
 care, and education are all guaranteed without discrimination
 to those lacking adequate income because they are too old, too
 young, sick, or otherwise disadvantaged.
