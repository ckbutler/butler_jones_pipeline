 GUINEA
 The People's Revolutionary Republic of Guinea is a one-party
 socialist state. Ahmed Sekou Toure has been the nation's
 president since Guinea broke away from the French community
 and declared its independence in 1958. The party-state,
 under the direction of President Toure, remains the supreme
 authority. The Government's concern with its security in
 years past led to the arrest and imprisonment of many suspect
 persons, some of whom were condemned and executed.
 A general amnesty of all Guinean exiles was declared in July
 1977, and thousands of emigrants returned to Guinea.
 The Government's concerns for its security were lessened in
 March 1978 with normalization of Guinea's relations with
 neighboring Senegal and Ivory Coast. The more relaxed
 climate is reflected in many aspects of Guinean political,
 economic, and social life. Internal security controls have
 been loosened, and international movement of goods and people
 has been eased. An attempted assassination of President
 Toure on May 14, 1980, reports of attempted sabotage at
 Conakry airport in February 1981, and an alleged attempt to
 attack the President in the spring of 1982 have not prompted
 the Government to impose extreme police measures.
 Guinea is a resource-rich, but economically underdeveloped
 country. Its agricultural sector, which produces mostly at
 subsistence levels, provides the livelihood for over 80
 percent of the population and contributes nearly two-fifths
 of the gross domestic product. The modern sector consists
 of a few mining enclaves, which generate nearly all of
 Guinea's foreign exchange, and a variety of state industrial,
 agro-industrial and commercial enterprises. At independence
 the Government implemented state ownership of the
 means of production and centralized economic decision-making.
 The replacement of private market-oriented agriculture with
 agricultural collectives may have been a factor in serious
 shortfalls in production. Large investments in the public
 sector have contributed to inflation and balance of payments
 difficulties. During the past two years, the Government has
 undertaken cautious steps toward economic reform. It has
 opened private retail and wholesale trade for some
 agricultural products, developed an investment code,
 decentralized some state holding companies and established a
 ministry of small and medium-sized industries.
 The party-state emphasizes the "rights of the people" over
 the rights of the individual. Nonetheless, the Government in
 January 1978 ratified the International Covenant of Economic,
 Social, and Cultural Rights. The Government regularly
 emphasizes the individual's duty to the revolution, to
 the party-state and to the people. The Government maintains
 broad police powers and an extensive security apparatus.

 Although exact information is not available, the number
 of political prisoners has been sharply reduced over the
 past several years. There have been no reports of political
 detentions during 1982, and barring a major government-
 perceived threat to internal security, the indications
 for both the short and long term are of continuing reductions
 in the number of political prisoners in Guinea.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 During 1982, there have been no reports of executions for
 political offenses, assassinations, or terrorist activity in
 Guinea. The death sentence of a former minister convicted
 on criminal charges was commuted to 15 years of hard labor,
 while six others sentenced to hard labor in the same case
 were amnestied.
 b. Disappearance
 Arrests and detentions by security forces in Guinea are not
 publicized, but news of their occurrence seems to have had
 no difficulty finding its way throughout the community. No
 reports of prolonged or permanent disappearance have been
 received in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Torture is not prohibited by Guinean law. Although torture
 has occurred in the past, no cases have been reported during
 the past year.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions in Guinea generally are poor. Police
 handling of suspects is frequently rough. Ill treatment and
 poor conditions in Guinean prisons are a recognized feature
 of the prison system, and conditions are most difficult for
 those held in solitary confinement. Prisoners not held in
 solitary confinement can usually receive food from family or
 friends. There is evidence that some categories of prisoners
 are allowed to leave prison during the day on work assign-
 ments. There are no reports that treatment of prisoners
 differs according to social class, race, sex, or religion.
 Prisoners released during the past few years have spoken of
 efforts to improve their prison food and their physical
 condition. The Government of Guinea permitted Amnesty
 International access to some detainees in December 1981.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is no legal prohibition against "preventive detention"
 and no provision for habeas corpus. Persons can be arrested
 and held without charge and without sentencing. There have
 been reports of such actions by the state in the past
 year. A number of arrests and detentions followed the
 attempted assassination of President Toure in May 1980, and
 a reported sabotage attempt at Conakry airport in February
 1981. However, those seem to have been handled as normal
 public security (rather than political) investigations.
 
 
 134
 It is believed that about 1,000 prisoners have been released
 since 1977. In 1980 the Government released more prisoners,
 including three former senior officials in November.
 Most persons arrested during the February 1981 incident
 appear to have been released, although some may still be
 held.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although citizens have access to the courts, most civil
 complaints are handled at the local tribal level under
 traditional procedures. This procedure corresponds to
 African tradition and provides considerable scope for
 testimony by plaintiffs, defendants and witnesses. Guinean
 courts are controlled by the party-state. In civil and
 criminal cases, constitutional and statutory procedures
 exist, but do not seem to be consistently applied. Guinean
 law does not permit professional lawyers to practice pri-
 vately. However, counsel is available from government
 rosters of private or official persons deemed qualified to
 serve as people's lawyers. Defendants have the right to
 legal counsel, which is provided when they so request or
 when the Government decides to appoint counsel from a
 government roster. Those charged with security or political
 offenses do not have benefit of counsel. They are required
 to make their own defense without being aware of the charges
 or evidence against them. However, no political trials are
 known to have taken place in Guinea since 1976.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Police may enter homes without warrants to pursue suspects
 or to obtain evidence, but it is not possible to determine
 how often this practice actually occurs.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although there is little freedom of expression in Guinea,
 the various party-state mechanisms throughout the country
 offer channels of communication between the Government and
 the governed. Participation in the party mechanism at the
 local level is great, and the party strives to build
 consensus on issues before referring them to the next larger
 regional office. This system accommodates a limited degree
 of dissent and opposition. Criticism of party policies,
 and, to a lesser extent, high-level individuals is tolerated.
 When abuses of power are being discussed, criticism is even
 encouraged. While the President himself is rarely criticized
 publicly, policy execution is freely discussed. When
 unpopular decisions are made and implemented, government
 officials (below the President) can and do become the
 objects of public criticism.
 As all media are owned and controlled by the Government or
 party and are staffed only by government journalists and
 officials, post-publication censorship does not occur.
 Self-censorship by authors of domestic books and
 artistic works exists, however, as writers and artists
 generally are well aware of what would and would not be
 permitted. Self-censorship occurs largely in subjects
 involving criticism of Guinea, of countries with which it
 
 
 135
 -has friendly relations, and of movements and policies
 supported by the Government. There are no reported recent
 ihstances in which private authors have overstepped
 government guidelines. In films, violence,, sexual
 explicitness, and scenes considered to mock or undermine
 Guinean values are not shown. International mail is often
 opened, and foreign publications must be cleared by the
 Ministry of Interior. Publications distributed by diplomatic
 missions are cleared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Certain foreign publications are banned and have been
 confiscated from persons trying to bring them into the
 country. Contacts between Guineans and diplomats are
 theoretically subject to control and although some official
 attention may be paid to activities of diplomats in Guinea
 and to those Guineans who are suspect, it appears to be more
 relaxed than in the past. Most surveillance appears aimed at
 controlling fraudulent or criminal commercial activity, e.g.,
 illegal currency exchanges, rather than at curbing undesired
 political activity.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings are largely organized under the auspices
 of the party-state, and no meetings by opposition groups
 are allowed. All Guinean workers in state enterprises,
 mixed and private companies are required to join the gov-
 ernment controlled National Confederation of Guinean
 Workers. No other labor union is permitted to operate.
 Guinea's sole political party, the Parti Democratique de
 Guinee, has its origin in the labor movement. Unions now
 play a much less visible role in Guinean political and
 economic life.
 At the enterprise level, unions exist in the form of
 worker organizations. Each enterprise has a Worker Com-
 mittee which consists of seven employees elected by
 their coworkers. The committees oversee employee-management
 relations, settle employee disputes, hear grievances and
 serve as a link between firms and political organizations.
 Problems that cannot be resolved by the committee are referred to
 workers' organizations at higher levelst arrondissement,
 regional and national. Strikes have been forbidden since
 independence. The majority of Guinean workers are employed
 in state enterprises and are expected to participate in the
 enterprise labor organizations. Any union member is eligible
 to hold office in the union. Union leaders are elected from
 a slate of names comprising the more experienced workers,
 and drawn up by the Parti Democratique de Guinee.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Islam is officially supported, Christianity
 is fully accepted by the state. There has been no evidence
 of persecution or discrimination on the basis of religion,
 nor does adherence to a particular faith confer any
 particular advantages or disadvantages in Guinea.
 Sects within Islam (brotherhoods) are not currently prohib-
 ited by law. The preamble to the Constitution proclaims the
 "equality and solidarity of all nationals without regard to
 race, sex, or religion*; articles 41 and 45 forbid discrimi-
 
 
 136
 nation on racial or religious grounds. However, in the
 early days of independence, the party, in an effort to
 create a national unity, launched campaigns to demystify
 animism and eliminate "maraboutism" from Islamic practices.
 Brotherhoods were deemed to be divisive. It appears that
 the early campaigns were successful, and brotherhoods
 do not exist in Guinea.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, while traditionally a part of African
 custom, is not guaranteed by Guinean law. Families and
 tribal groups are frequently located across national
 frontiers, and substantial movement back and forth has been
 permitted and observed in recent years. Legal entry into
 and exit from the country remains subject to control, but
 enforcement has become notably relaxed, except for those
 who, in the Government's view, might pose threats to the
 state. Many former Guinean exiles, primarily those who
 departed for economic reasons, have returned since the
 general amnesty of all "exiles" was announced in 1977.
 Internal movement remains, as it has for the past several
 years, substantially free. Documents are often required,
 but are readily obtainable and do not present unreasonable
 difficulties for Guinean travellers or foreigners within
 the country. Women and other groups are subject to the
 same rules in matters of internal travel, emigration and
 repatriation.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process is restricted
 to the confines of Guinea's strong one-party system.
 However, all Guineans are strongly encouraged by the
 leaders to participate in the "continuing revolution"
 which the party-state conducts in their name under the
 direction of President Toure. It is difficult for the
 individual to avoid taking part in the party-controlled
 political activity which guides most aspects of national
 life.
 President Toure was unanimously elected in May 1982 for
 a seven-year term as the only candidate put forth by the
 National Revolution Council, a body which supervises the
 various party-state organizations. The Council is elected
 from a slate proposed by the 15-member national political
 bureau, the highest leadership organ in the party-state.
 The 15 members of the bureau are selected by the Secretary-
 General of the party (President Toure) from the 75-member
 central committee (decision making organ v. leadership
 organ), which in turn is elected by the national congress
 of the party.
 The political role of women in Guinea matches the
 significant influence and power which they enjoy
 in economic life. Women traditionally have been
 a large, articulate, and faithful political group
 in President Toure's power base, and on occasion
 have demonstrated the will and capability to
 influence policy.

 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 In December 1981, representatives of Amnesty Interna-
 tional's London office visited Conakry and met with gov-
 ernment officials. Amnesty's 1982 report noted that the
 Amnesty representatives had discussed concerns regarding
 Guinea, including detention without trial of suspected
 political opponents of the Government, the forcible re-
 patriation of refugees, ill treatment of detainees, and
 poor prison conditions.
 The Government of Guinea continues to reject charges leveled
 by the International League for Human Rights and Amnesty
 International regarding political prisoners and their treat-
 ment. The President came under strong attack on the issue
 of human rights by the French press during a visit to France
 in September 1982. On that occasion, as well as after the
 release of the 1982 Amnesty report, the President and state-
 controlled media have maintained that persons imprisoned
 after the abortive invasion in 1972 and more recent attempts
 against the security of the President and state are traitors
 and enemies of the people rather than political prisoners.
 Following on Amnesty's visit to Conakry in December 1981,
 the President announced his willingness to allow another
 international inquiry into human rights violations in his
 country.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Circumstances
 Guinea's estimated per capita GNP was $293 in 1980. This
 does not accurately reflect the fact that most of Guinea's
 population is essentially outside the money economy and is
 largely self-sufficient in foodstuffs. In 1980, 74 percent
 of the population was estimated to be rural. Private
 commerce, allowed since 1977, has continued to bring more
 goods into the parallel non-official market place -- al-
 though at relatively high prices. Occasional government
 efforts to enforce official prices, however, tend to provoke
 withdrawal of goods from the normally flourishing parallel
 market. Compared with earlier years, a gradually expanding
 range of food and consumer goods is available. The pre-
 liminary signs of an improved standard of living noted
 during the past two years remain in evidence.
 The Government of Guinea has devoted the largest share
 (26 percent) of the latest five-year plan budget to the
 agro-pastoral sector, but agricultural development and
 food production continue to lag. In 1977 the calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirement was 84 percent.
 Life expectancy at birth rose from 38.5 years in 1968 to
 44.5 in 1980. Infant mortality, however, rose from 141 per
 1,000 in 1960 to 165 per 1,000 in 1980. Infant mortality
 may be linked to poor nutrition and sanitary conditions as
 well as to a higher birth rate. Even with the high rate of
 infant mortality, the overall population growth rate was 2.9
 
 
 138
 percent in 1980.
 About 44 percent of the urban population has access to a
 safe water supply, but this drops to 2.5 percent for the
 rural population. The Government has a nationwide program
 for improving the rural population's access to safe water
 that concentrated initially on improving wells and springs
 in the Foutah Djallon region. Its goal is to provide safe
 water within a reasonable distance from each village in the
 country.
 Education is free and open to all. Since independence,
 Guinea has implemented a far-reaching educational reform
 program, using local languages as the medium of instruction
 at the primary level. Total enrollment at primary, secon-
 dary and higher education levels was estimated to be 450,000
 students in 1981 as compared with 45,000 in 1958. Uni-
 versity programs are offered by two polytechnic institutes,
 three agricultural institutes, one teacher training insti-
 tute and one mining institute with faculties in at least 20
 of the 33 administrative regions. The national service of
 "tele-enseignement" offers adult education courses by radio
 reaching an estimated 250,000 listeners. In September 1982
 the Government also launched an adult literacy program among
 workers in indpstrial and agro-industrial installations. As
 a result, Guinean officials report about 20 percent of the
 population is literate in French and about 48 percent in one
 or more of the Guinean national languages.
