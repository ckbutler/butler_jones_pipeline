 GHANA
 
 Ghana' is ruled by a military government which came
 to power in January 1972, when it overthrew the
 elected government of Kofi Busia. Upon assuming
 power the military government suspended the 1969
 constitution and banned political parties. These
 measures remain in force and the government rules by
 decree. The civil judicial system has continued to
 function. The current regime recently initiated a
 program to return Ghana to a form of constitutional
 rule which includes human rights guarantees. The
 Ghanaian government has applauded the commitment of
 the US government to the advancement of human rights.
 It has also nurtured basic Ghanaian customs and
 traditions which conform to internationally recog-
 nized human rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not officially countenanced in-,Ghana. How-
 ever, public testimony was given by defendants at
 two 1976 trials that torture was either used or threat-
 ened in order to obtain statements from them. The
 Ghanaian government allowed this testimony to be given
 and reported in the press. There have been no reports
 of torture in Ghana since the 1976 trials.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Few cases of civil, inhuman or degrating treatment have
 been documented, mostly dating from 1972-74, and in
 such cases the perpetrators were disciplined. Amnesty
 International is protesting some sentencings in Ghanaian
 courts including 5-8 years at hard labor for three men
 convicted of sedition in 1975 and the death sentences of
 five individuals convicted of subversion in May 1976.
 Legal and procedural safeguards against cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment, nonetheless, appear
 to be effective in the vast majority of cases.

 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 An active bar association, independent courts, and the
 right of habeas corpus serve as restraints against arbi-
 trary arrest or imprisonment. Ghana has had provisions
 for preventive detention almost continuously since inde-
 pendence. Since 1973 the use of preventive detention
 has been limited, and reasonably prompt judicial action
 is taken to protect defendants. Although the government
 claims there are no political prisoners in Ghana, the
 Ghana Bar Association asserts that there are approxi-
 mately 450 such individuals currently in detention, 175
 of whom it claims were taken into custody without any
 court order or executive decree. The case is sub judice.
 On July 31, 1977, Amnesty International listed Joseph H.
 Mensah and Ibrahim C. Quaye as Ghanaian legislators
 imprisoned on political charges. Mensah and Quaye
 were charged with sedition by the Ghanaian government
 for authorship of a pamphlet on the Ghanaian economy.
 The government considered the pamphlet, which Mensah
 admitted writing, to be in violation of Ghana's criminal
 code. Mensah and Quaye were given a public trial and
 were represented by lawyers. On November 21, 1975, they
 were found guilty. Mensah was sentenced to eight years
 imprisonment and Quaye five years. Their lawyers are
 appealing the verdicts.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public hearing, with the accused having the
 right of counsel, before independent national tribunals
 is the rule. Alleged exceptions are noted in l.c. above.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is respected; search warrants
 are required.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Ghana's recently published development plan recognizes
 the government's responsibility to fulfill the basic
 needs of food, shelter, health care and education. The
 plan also notes the problems (poor production, inflation,
 
 
 43
 lack of foreign exchange, etc.) which cause difficulties
 in the fulfillment of these needs. The Ghanaian govern-
 ment has emphasized programs designed to respond to the
 needs of the rural poor, but implementation of such
 programs has been uneven. For example, "Operation Feed
 Yourself", which was designed to make. Ghana self-
 sufficient in food production, did well in years of
 adequate rainfall but has fared poorly during the past
 two years of insufficient precipitation.
 Drought conditions in northern Ghana led to food
 shortages during the first nine months of 1977.
 Foreign donors, including the United States, pro-
 vided emergency food, and Ghana purchased about-
 200,000 tons of foodstuffs. to meet emergency demands.
 OXFAM and the Agency for International Development
 reported cases of diversion of some food to indi-
 viduals and groups not severely affected by the
 drought, and the Ghanaian government has responded
 by replacing some senior officials and by taking
 steps to ensure that supplies reach the needy.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Poitical Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 With the important exceptions noted below these free-
 doms are respected in Ghana. Freedom of association
 is restricted by a ban on political parties. Labor
 unions, youth and university groups, church and civic
 associations, active bar associations, and some inde-
 pendent newspapers flourish. Although press freedom
 officially exists in Ghana and the government does
 not undertake to direct the day-to-day content of the
 media, it sometimes exerts control over press treat--
 ment of specific issues when it feels Ghanaian govern-
 ment interests are significantly involved. Freedom of
 expression is also hindered by a "Prohibition of
 Rumors Decree" which provides that any person who,
 with intent to bring the head of state or senior
 members of the government into hatred, ridicule or
 contempt, publishes any insulting matter by writing,
 print, or word of mouth shall be quilty of a crime
 punishable by five to ten years imprisonment. This
 decree was published in June 1977, but few cases have
 
 
 been prosecuted. Persons who oppose positions advo-
 cated by the government are sometimes subject to
 harassment from government supporters.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There are no Ghanaian restrictions on movement, travel
 or emigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 At present political parties are banned, and the
 military regime rules by decree. On July 14, 1977,
 the Ghanaian head of state, General Acheampong,
 announced a timetable for a return to elected and
 constitutional government by July 1, 1979. Ghanaians
 have been registered to vote in a March 30, 1978,
 referendum on the concept of union government. A
 report issued 6n October 1977 by an ad hoc committee
 on union government recommended that a new government
 be created with a president, vice president, and uni-
 cameral parliament--all chosen by direct general
 elections; a cabinet appointed by the president; im-
 portant advisory positions for senior military and
 police officials; an independent judiciary; a consti-
 tution enshrining human rights; and a free press.
 There would be no political parties permitted, how-
 ever. Should the referendum be approved, a commission
 would draft a constitution for consideration by a con-
 stituent assembly, and parliamentary elections would be
 held on June 15, 1979.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Government Investiga-
 tion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Ghanaian officials have been generally responsive to
 inquiries by such groups as Amnesty International.
 During a series of 1976 trials involving Ghanaians
 charged with subversion, General Acheampong invited
 members of the international press to attend the
 
 
 45
 court sessions, which were open to the public. An
 invitation to Amnesty International to observe the
 trial of Dr. Kofi Awoonor in October 1976, however,
 was cancelled at the last moment. We have no infor-
 mation that any on-site inspections from groups such
 as Amnesty International have been requested since
 that time.
