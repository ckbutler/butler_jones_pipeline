 ESTONIA
 Estonia is a parliamentary democracy. With its statehood widely recognized as
 continuous for more than 70 years, Estonia regained its independence in 1991 after
 50 years of Soviet occupation. The Constitution, adopted by referendum in 1992, es-
 tablished a 101-member unicameral legislature (State Assembly), a Prime Minister
 as Head of Government, and a President as Head of State. The judiciary is inde-
 pendent.
 The official conversion of the Soviet militia into the Estonian police preceded the
 reestablishment of the country's independence by about 6 months. Its conversion
 into a Western-type police force committed to procedures and safeguards appro-
 priate to a democratic society is proceeding, with police leadership actively working
 to professionalize the force. The police, who are ethnically mixed, are subordinate
 to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Corrections personnel are subordinate to the
 Ministry of Justice. The security service, called Security Police, is subordinate to the
 Interior Ministry but also reports to the Prime Minister. Police and corrections per-
 sonnel continued to commit human rights abuses.
 Estonia has a market economy. Reflecting the extent, of post-1992 reforms, Esto-
 nia started accession negotiations with the European Union (EU). Services, espe-
 cially financial and tourism, are growing in importance compared to historically
 more prominent light industry and food production. Privatization of small and me-
 dium firms is virtually complete, and privatization of large-scale enterprises is
 under way. The economy continues to grow steadily, with gross domestic product
 (GDP) estimated to have increased by about 6 to 8 percent in 1998. Although prices
 continue to rise, incomes are rising faster than inflation. Per capita GDP is about
 $3,140 per year. Two-thirds of Estonian exports (textiles, food products, wood, and
 timber products) now are directed to Western markets. Unemployment remained
 fairly low overall (unofficially about 8 percent) but was significantly higher in rural
 areas.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens and the
 large noncitizen community, but problems remained in some areas. The major
 human rights abuses continued to be mistreatment of prisoners and detainees, and
 the use of excessive force by the police. Prison conditions are poor. The deadline for
 noncitizens to file for permanent residency expired in 1996, after being extended
 twice. An undetermined number of noncitizens still have not filed for residency. By
 mid-1998, 17,000 of 19,000 noncitizen Soviet ex-military personnel had received
 temporary residence permits. Processing of applications for alien passports contin-
 ued. By year's end, most applicants for alien passports had received them. The Gov-
 ermnent continued to issue temporary travel documents and to accept officially in-
 valid former Soviet internal passports for identification in emergency situations,
 such as registering births and deaths. In January 1997, the Council of Europe
 closed its human rights monitoring mission in Estonia.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 In May President Meri announced plans to form an international commission for
 research into crimes against humanity perpetrated in Estonia from 1939-91. The
 commission was expected to begin work in January 1999.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law. However, there continued to be credible re-
 ports that police used excessive force and verbal abuse during the arrest and ques-
 tioning of suspects. Punishment cells ("kartsers") continued to be used, in contraven-
 tionof international standards. In 1997 most of the top leadership of one prefecture
 was dismissed for abuse of power.
 Prison conditions remained poor, although there were some improvements. Lack
 of resources and trained staff continued to be a serious problem. Overcrowding in
 the antiquated Tallinn Central Prison persisted. The percentage of prisoners suffer-
 ing from tuberculosis was much higher than in the general population. The Govern-
 ment refurbished some prison buildings and opened a 52-bed wing in the Parnu City
 Prison that fully meets EU standards. Modest gains were made in hiring new prison
 staff and retaining existing personnel. Work and study opportunities for prisoners
 increased slightly as the Government implemented new programs. The Government
 is considering new regulations that would significantly reduce the number of people
 incarcerated and thereby alleviate overcrowding. The Government implemented an
 early-release program for prisoners and by y~ar's end 549 prisoners had been pa-
 roled. Unlike previous years, there were no reports of prisoners killed by other pris-
 oners.
 The Government has drafted but not yet implemented a multiyear plan to refur-
 bish and restructure all the country's prisons and to close the Tallinn Central Pris-
 on. Prison authorities successfully implemented some suggestions made by Council
 of Europe (COE) representatives in 1993, but could not implement others due to
 lack of resources and high turnover among prison staff.
 The Government permits human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exie.-The Constitution and laws forbid arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally observes these prohi-
 bitions. Under the Constitution, warrants issued by a court are required to make
 arrcets. Detainees must be informed promptly of the grounds for the arrest and
 given immediate access to legal counsel If a person cannot afford counsel, the State
 will provide one. A person may be held for 48 hours without formally being charged;
 further detention requires a court order. A person may be held in pretrial detention
 for 2 months; this term may be extended to a total of 12 months by court order.
 Police rarely violate these limits. By year's end, 1,212 of the 4,301 persons held in
 prisons were awaiting trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution establishes an independent judi-
 cial branch, and the judiciary is independent in practice. The judiciary operates
 through a three-tier court system: rural and city courts; district courts; and the
 State Court (which functions as a supreme court). The district and state courts are
 also courts for "constitutional supervision." At the rural and city levels, court deci-
 sions are made by a majority vote with a judge and two lay members sitting in judg-
 ment. All judges and lay judges must be citizens. The President nominates and the
 State Assembly confirms the Chief Justice of the State Court. The Chief Justice
 nominates State Court judges who are subject to confirmation by the State Assem-
 bly. He also nominates the district, city, and rural court judges who are then ap-
 pointed by the President. Judges are appointed for life.
 The Constitution provides that court proceedings shall be public. Closed sessions
 may be held only for specific reasons, such as protection of state or business secrets,
 and in cases concerning minors. The Constitution further provides that defendants
 may present witnesses and evidence as well as confront and cross-examine prosecu-
 tion witnesses. Defendants have access to prosecution evidence and enjoy a pre-
 sumption of innocence.
 Estonia continued to overhaul its criminal and civil procedural codes. An interim
 Criminal Code that went into effect in June 1992 basically revised the Soviet Crimi-
 nal Code by eliminating, for example, political and economic crimes. The Code of
 Criminal Procedure was adopted in 1994. The Government is considering a new
 Penal Code that fully meets European standards to be implemented by the year
 2000.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 1242
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property. During the investiga-
 tive stage, warrants are issued by the prosecutor upon a showing of probable cause.
 Once a case has gone to court, warrants are issued by the court. The Constitution
 provides for secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and other means of commu-
 nication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept a person's communications.
 Illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in court. At year's end, security police
 and parliamentary investigations were continuing into the 1995 case involving then
 Interior Minister Savisaar who was implicated in making unauthorized recordings
 of conversations. Both Parliament and the security police concluded Savisaar's in-
 vestigation in 1998 without bringing any charges.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech- and Press.-The Government respects constitutional provi-
 sions providing for freedom of speech and the press. The media routinely do probing
 and thorough investigative reporting. Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely
 available. All newsprint, printing, and distribution facilities now are private compa-
 nies. There are four major national Estonian language and three Russian language
 dailies, in addition to important weeklies. In a widely reported 1997 case, a well-
 known journalist was tried and convicted for insulting the spouse of a prominent
 politician in a newspaper interview and received a fine. The sentence was upheld
 by all levels of the judiciary. The European Court of-Human Rights agreed in 1998
 to hear the case.
 State broadcast media, including one nationwide television channel, continue to
 receive large subsidies, and the State has assured that these subsidies are to con-
 tinue. The cultural committee of Parliament plans to allocate a certain percentage
 of the state budget to finance state television. Beginning in 1998, state television
 does not receive money from commercials. However, it receives subsidies from pro-
 gram sponsors. Independent channels and state television have entered into an
 agreement whereby independent channels provide financial support to state tele-
 vision, as state television has agreed to cease broadcasting commercials.
 There are several major independent television and radio stations. Several Rus-
 sian language programs, mostly produced in Estonian, are broadcast over state and
 private television channels. The Government played a key role in encouraging Rus-
 sian language programs on state television. These Russian programs include highly
 professional talk shows and comprehensive news broadcasts. Russian state tele-
 vision and Ostankino programs are widely available via cable.
 Estonia still lacks a law on freedom of information. The governmental expert com-
 mittee has worked out a draft law but it has become an object of criticism. Neither
 journalists nor parliamentarians agree with the draft law. The main criticisms are
 that the draft bill does not define official information and that the bill allows offi-
 cials to withhold official information.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble freely, but noncitizens are prohibited from joining political
 parties, although they may form social groups. Permits for all public gatherings
 must be obtained 3 weeks prior to the date of the gathering. The authorities have
 wide discretion to prohibit such gatherings on public safety grounds but seldom ex-
 ercise it. There were no reports of government interference in mass gatherings or
 political rallies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 The 1993 Law on Churches and Religious Organizations requires all religious or-
 ganizations to have at least 12 members and to be registered with the Interior Min-
 istry and the Board of Religion. Leaders of religious organizations must be citizens
 with at least 5 years' residence in Estonia.
 The majority of Estonians are nominally Lutheran, but following deep-seated tra-
 dition there is wide tolerance of other denominations and religions. Persons of vary-
 ing ethnic backgrounds profess Orthodoxy, including communities of Russian Old
 Beievers who found refulge in Estonia in the 17th century. The Estonian Apostolic
 Orthodox Church (EAOC), independent since 1919, subordinate to Constantinople
 since 1923, and exiled under the Soviet occupation, reregistered under its 1935 stat-
 ute in August 1993. Since then, a group of ethnic Estonian and Russian parishes
 preferring to remain under the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church structure
 imposed during the Soviet occupation has insisted that it should have claim to the
 EAOC name but has been unable to register under the same name. Representatives
 of the Moscow and Constantinople Patriarchates continued consultations to resolve
 the question, which centers on property issues. The Government and some promi-
 
 
 1243
 nent businessmen were facilitating the discussions. In early 1998, the Moscow Patri-
 archate declared that it would register under a different name but failed to do so
 by year's end. By mid-1998, the dispute between the two Patriarchates flared again
 over official names and property rights, including the controversial Nevski Orthodox
 Cathedral. In a more positive light, early in the year an agreement was reached be-
 tween the State and the Kuremae monastery on the use of the property. Throughout
 the dispute, free worship has occurred in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law permits free movement within the country, and it is honored
 in practice. The law also provides for the right of foreign travel, emigration, and re-
 patriation for citizens. There are no exit visas.
 In 1993, Parliament enacted a Law on Aliens that defines an alien as a person
 who is not a citizen of Estonia, that is, a citizen of another country or a stateless
 person. The majority of noncitizens are ethnic Russians. The law provided a 1-year
 period during which noncitizens who came to Estonia prior to July 1, 1990, and
 were permanent residents of the former Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, could
 apply for temporary residence permits. They also could apply for permanent resi-
 dence at the same time. Following delays and confusion in implementation as well
 as criticism by international human rights observers, the application deadline was
 extended by a year, until July 12, 1995. By that date the vast majority of aliens-
 327,737 of the-estimated 370,000-had filed applications. The Government extended
 the registration  period until April 30, 1996. An indeterminate number of nonciti-
 zens-estimates ranged from 20,000 to 50,000-still had not registered. In 1997 the
 Government began a campaign to register this group of aliens, pledging not to take
 any measures against them. By September some 2,000 had come forward. In 1997
 the Government proposed and Parliament approved an amendment to the aliens law
 that allowed those who had applied for residence by July 12, 1995, to change tem-
 porary residence permits to permanent ones. This law was implemented in Septem-
 ber, 2 years earlier than the original act envisioned.
 There were complaints about the slow pace with which the Government was proc-
 essing residence applications for some 19,000 Russian military pensioners. The proc-
 ess was complicated by the lack of Russian-provided passports in which to affix the
 permits. An estimated 35 percent of the first group of military pensioners missed
 the deadline to present their passports for residence permits. Technically, the Citi-
 zenship and Migration Board could move to have them deported. However, by mid-
 year, no recommendations to deport any persons had been made. In fact the Govern-
 ment is moving on a case-by-case basis to solve the outstanding issues. By Septem-
 ber, out of some 19,000 persons who applied, the Government issued 17,000 tem-
 porary residence permits to retired Russian servicemen. Approximately 2,200 retired
 Russian servicemen have submitted applications to extend their residency. The Gov-
 ernment refused residence to 22 former members of the Soviet military. The Govern-
 ment continued to issue alien passports to those former servicemen who could not
 or did not want to take out Russian citizenship.
 No restrictions are placed on the right of noncitizens to foreign travel, emigration,
 or repatriation, although some noncitizens complain of delays in obtaining travel
 documents. The Government began issuing temporary travel documents valid for a
 single departure and reentry into the country to resident aliens in 1994. To accom-
 modate entry visa requirements of other countries, the validity period of the docu-
 ment was extended in 1994 from 6 months to 2 years. In late 1994, the Government
 began issuing alien passports which are issued to resident aliens not in possession
 of any other valid travel document. Such aliens included: (1) persons who are des-
 ignated as stateless; (2) foreign citizens who lack the opportunity to obtain travel
 documents from their country of origin or from another state; (3) persons who file
 for Estonian citizenship and pass the language examination if required; and (4)
 aliens who are permanently departing Estonia. The Government plans to expand
 the classes of noncitizens eligible for alien passports. It has already approved their
 issuance to noncitizens intending to study abroad and has agreed to issue them to
 former military personnel who cannot or do not want to take out Russian citizen-
 ship. By December 174,000 persons had applied for alien passports and 170,297
 passports had been issued.
 The Government has deported a Telatively small. number of illegal aliens, usually
 those caught in criminal acts. By September 28 illegal aliens weye held as internees,
 pending deportation or a court order granting them .residence. Internees are held
 in a wing of a regular prison, until a new facility in-East Viru County is completed.
 In 1997 Parliament passed a refugee law that brought Estonia into conformity
 with the 1951 United Nations (U.N.) Convention Relatingto the Status of Refugees
 and its 1967 Protocol, and also in 1997 amended several social security acts to pro-
 vide refugees with social benefits identical to those of-citizens. Implementing regula-
 
 
 1244
 
 tions have not yet been issued. The Government has selected a site for processing
 asylum seekers but construction has not begun. One asylum application that had
 been pending since 1997 was refused. By September, 23 persons had filed petitions.
 A total of 15 Iraqi refugees who are awaiting adjudication of their status remain
 in a holding center in the town of Aa, near the city of Kohtla Jarve in northeastern
 Estonia. There were no reports of refugees returned to areas where they would face
 persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their Government. In 1995 free and fair elec-
 tions to the second post-Soviet Parliament were held. Among the deputies are six
 ethnic Russians. Indirect presidential elections were held in 1996. When the Par-
 liament failed to muster the required two-thirds majority to elect the President, an
 Electoral Assembly consisting of parliament members and representatives of local
 governments convened and reelected the incumbent, Lennart Meri. By year's end,
 preparations were under way for parliamentary elections to be held in March 1999.
 Local elections were held in 1996. According to legislation, resident noncitizens
 can vote but not run for office. The local elections were free and fair. All candidates
 had certified that they knew Estonian sufficiently to be able to function in local gov-
 ernment. However, after the elections, there were complaints that some candidates
 did not know sufficient Estonian. In 1997 the Government brought court charges
 against a former chairman of the Sillamae town council for having filed a fraudulent
 certificate. The former chairman was found guilty. The case was appealed but the
 Government's position was upheld through all the appellate courts, with the State
 Court ruling in favor of the Government in October. Since then, several teachers
 and policemen were found to possess fraudulent certificates, but no court charges
 had been filed by year's end.
 The Citizenship Law enacted in 1992 readopted the 1938 Citizenship Law. Ac-
 cording to that law, anyone born after 1940 to a citizen parent is a citizen by birth.
 The parent does not have to be an ethnic Estonian. The Government estimates that
 under this provision some 80,000 persons not ethnically Estonian have obtained citi-
 zenship. The law included requirements for naturalization, such as a 2-year resi-
 dency requirement, to be followed by a 1-year waiting period, as well as knowledge
 of the Estonian language. According to Max van der Steel, the Organization for Se-
 curity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) High Commissioner on National Minori-
 ties, over 200,000 persons experienced a reduction in status to that of resident alien.
 Automatic citizenship is provided to those who were citizens in 1940 and their de-
 scendants, not to those who moved there during occupation (resident aliens).
 In 1995, Parliament adopted a new Citizenship Law revising the 1992 law and
 combining into one statute provisions regarding citizenship that were scattered
 among several pieces of legislation. It extended the residency requirement for natu-
 ralization from 2 to 5 years and added a requirement for knowledge of the Constitu=-
 tion and the Citizenship Law. Persons who had taken up legal residence in Estonia
 prior to July 1, 1990, are exempt from the 5-year legal residence and 1-year waiting
 period requirements. The law allows the Government to waive the language require-
 ment but not the civic knowledge requirement for applicants who have Estonian
 language elementary or higher education, or who have performed valuable service
 to Estonia. In an effort to fulfill the remaining 2 (of 30) recommendations of the
 OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities, the Government simplified the
 civic knowledge test, and on December 9 approved legislation that would amend the
 citizenship law to grant automatic citizenship to stateless children born after Feb-
 ruary 26, 1992 to legally resident stateless parents (upon the parents' or guardians'
 application). The President proclaimed the law in December and it is scheduled to
 go into effect in July 1999.
 Based on current law, the following classes of persons are ineligible for natu-
 ralization: those filing on the basis of false data or documents; those not abiding by
 the constitutional system or not fulfilling the laws; those who have acted against
 the State and its security; those who have committed crimes and have been pun-
 ished with a sentence of more than 1 year or who have been repeatedly brought to
 justice for felonies; those who work or have worked in the intelligence or security
 services of a foreign state; or those who have served as career soldiers in the armed
 forces of a foreign state, including those discharged into the reserves or retired. (The
 latter includes spouses who have come to Estonia in connection with the service
 member's assignment to a posting, the reserves, or retirement.) A provision of the
 law allows for the granting of citizenship to a foreign military retiree who has been
 married to a native citizen for 5 years.
 
 
 1245
 Between 1992 and December, 105,805 persons had received citizenship through
 naturalization. In 1997 the Russian embassy reported that some 120,000 persons
 had obtained Russian citizenship; however, the Embassy declined to supply the Gov-
 ernment with a list. The actual number of Russian citizens may be lower since the
 Russian Embassy apparently does not appear to keep records of those who die or
 leave Estonia. The Government reported that it had issued 108,815 residence per-
 mits to foreign nationals, of which 90,188 were Russian, 2,058 Ukrainian, 1,145 Eat-
 vian, and 1,056 Belarusian.
 While some officials in the Russian Government and in the local Russian commu-
 nity continued to criticize the citizenship law as discriminatory, numerous inter-
 national fact-finding organizations, including the Finnish Helsinki Committee and
 the OSCE, confirm that the Citizenship Law conforms to international standards.
 Bureaucratic delays and the Estonian language requirement are also cited as dis-
 incentives for securing citizenship. The Government has established language-train-
 ing centers, but there is a lack of qualified teachers, financial resources, and train-
 ing materials. Some allege that the examination process, which 75 to 90 percent
 pass, is arbitrary.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics. However, women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are
 11 women among the 101 members of Parliament. Two ministers are women. There
 are six ethnic Russian deputies in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the formation or functioning of human rights
 organizations. In response to allegations of poor treatment of ethnic minorities, the
 President established a Human Rights Institute, which first convened in 1992. The
 purpose of the Institute is to monitor human rights in the country and to provide
 information to the international community. It investigates reports of human rights
 violations, such as allegations of police abuse and inhuman treatment of detainees.
 In 1997 the Institute established an information center in the heavily ethnic Rus-
 sian town of Kohtla-Jarve. In addition because of tensions surrounding the adoption
 of the Elections Law and the Aliens Law in 1993, the President established a round-
 table composed of representatives of Parliament, the Union of Estonian Nationali-
 ties, and the Russian speaking population's Representative Assembly. An analogous
 but independent roundtable meets in the county of East Virumaa. In addition with
 initial funding from the Danish government, a nongovernmental legal information
 center in Tallinn provides free legal assistance to individuals-citizen and nonciti-
 zen alike-seeking advice on human rights-related issues.
 In the context of repeated Russian allegations of human rights violations among
 the noncitizen population, both the OSCE mission in Estonia and the OSCE High
 Commissioner on National Minorities have declared that they could not find a pat-
 tern of human rights violations or abuses in Estonia. The Government addressed
 the last 2 of the 30 recommendations of the OSCE High Commissioner on National
 Minorities, by simplifying the civic knowledge portion of the naturalization process
 and passing legislation to grant automatic citizenship to children born to resident
 stateless persons upon parental application.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, social status, or for any other reason. The Government reports that no
 court cases charging discrimination have been fied. Two court cases are pending
 but have not come to trial, regarding allegations of racial hatred made by a leader
 of a Russian military pensioners' group in northeast Estonia. The pensioners' leader
 organized an unauthorized assembly in the city of Sillamae and claimed that the
 human rights of the Russian pensioners in the region were abused by the Govern-
 ment.
 Women.-Violence against women, including spousal abuse, was the subject of in-
 creasing discussion and media coverage. According to women's groups and law en-
 forcement officials, family violence is not pervasive. Rape and attempted rape occur
 relatively infrequently. In the first 7 months, there were reports of 32 rapes and
 9 attempted rapes, compared with 69 rapes and 17 attemptedrapes for 1997. How-
 ever, studies show that 40 percent of crime in the country goes unreported, includ-
 ing domestic violence. Even when the police are called, the abused spouse often de-
 clines to press charges.
 Discussion ofi the role and situation of women has been extensive, especially in
 the wake of the !ourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995, as well
 
 
 1246
 
 as during former Social Affairs Minister Siiri Oviir's run for the presidency. A Cen-
 ter of Women Citizens was established in May and in October a roundtable of wom-
 en's organizations was founded. Women have the same legal rights as men and are
 legally entitled to equal pay for equal work. Nevertheless, although women's aver-
 age educational level was higher than men's their average pay was lower, and the
 trend did not seem to be improving. There continue to be female- and male-domi-
 nated professions. Women constitute slightly more than half of the work force. They
 also carry major household responsibilities.
 Children.-The Government's strong commitment to education is evidenced by the
 vides freeimedical care for children and subsidizes school meals. In 1992 the ov-
 ;      thtit givs tobulding and refurbishing schools. The Govnm    tro
 ernment adopted a Law on Child Protection patterned after the U.N. Convention on
 the Rights of the Child.
 There is no societal pattern of child abuse, but a- 1995 research project conducted
 by the nongovernmental Estonian Union for Child Welfare on children and violence
 at home found that a significant proportion of children had experienced at least oc-
 casional violence at home, in schools, or in youth gangs. In the first 8 months of
 the year, police registered 17 cases of sexual abuse-15 female victims and 2 male
 victims. There continue to be reports of underage prostitution. Also in the first 8
 months of the year, there were 2 rape cases in which the victim was younger than
 14.
 People With Disabilities.-While the Constitution contains provisions to protect
 disabled persons againt discrimination, and both the State and some private orga-
 nizations provide them with financial assistance, little has been done to enable is-
 abled people to participate normally in public life. There is no public access law, but
 some effort to accommodate the disabled is evident in the- inclusion of ramps at
 curbs on new urban sidewalk construction. Public transportation firms have ac-
 quired some vehicles that are accessible to the disabled, as have some taxi compa-
 mes.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The OSCE mission in Estonia, established
 in 1993, continued to promote stability, dialog, and understanding among-commu-
 nities. The President's Roundtable, also established in 1993, and which is composed
 of members of Parliament, ,representatives of the Union of Estonian Nationalities,
 and the Representative Assembly of the Russian Community, continued to work to-
 ward finding practical-solutions to problems of noncitizens. The analogous but inde-
 pendent roundtable that met in the northeastern part of the country (see Section
 4) worked on similar issues.
 The Law on Cultural Autonomy for citizens belonging to minority groups went
 into effect in 1993. The tradition of protection for cultural autonomy dates from a
 1925 law. Some noncitizens termed the law discriminatory, since it restricts cultural
 autonomy only to citizens. The Government replied that noncitizens can participate
 fully in ethnic organizations and that the law includes subsidies for cultural organi-
 zations.
 Estonia's population is slightly less than 1.5 million. Ethnic Russians total ap-
 proximately 29 percent, and nonethnic Estonians total approximately 37 percent.
 During the years of Estonia's forced annexation by the.Soviet Union, large numbers
 of non-Estonians, predominantly ethnic Russians, were encouraged to migrate to Es-
 tonia to work.as laborers- and administrators. These immigrants-and their descend-
 ants now make up approximately- one-third of the total population; about 40 percent
 of them were born in Estonia. About 8 percent of the population of the pre-1940 Re-
 public was ethnic Russian.
 Some noncitizens, especially Russians, continued to allege job, salary, and housing
 discrimination because of Estonian language requirements. Russian government of-
 ficials and parliamentarians echoed these charges in a variety of forums. In March
 the Government accepted a Russian Government proposal to establish a high-level
 commission to examine all aspects of bilateral relations. One of the sub-groups of
 the commission would examine-the humanitarian .aspects of the-Russian minority
 in. Estonia and possibly of the Estonian minority in Russia.
 � Other than for land ownership, the 1993 Law does not distinguish between citi-
 zens-and noncitizens for-purposes of business or property ownership._A 1996 law
 on land ownership further liberalized land ownership-by foreigners; such ownership
 is now restricted only in certain strategic areas. All legal -esidents of Estonia may
 participate equally in the privatization of state-owned housing.
 - Estonian language requirements for those employed in the civil-service went into
 effect in 1993- The new Law on Public Service as originally passed required state
 employees to be proficient in Estonian by the end of 1995. In December 1995, Par-
 liament amended the Law on Public Service to allow noncitizen local and national
 government employees without adequate Estonian to continue working until Feb-

 ruary 1, 1997. No noncitizens were to be hired after January 1, 1996. This amend-
 ment reflected the Government's awareness that in some sectors, the number of em-
 ployees with inadequate Estonian remained high. In May 1997, 3 policemen were
 dismissed for not knowing sufficient Estonian; earlier in 1997, 11 policemen were
 dismissed for not filing for Estonian citizenship by the established deadline. Also in
 1997 five prosecutors and two judges were dismissed for presenting forged certifi-
 cates regarding their knowledge of Estonian; two have been restored to their posi-
 tions; criminal charges against one judge were dropped. Three of the prosecutors
 found employment as police inspectors. By year's end, a total of 300 police officers
 had been dismissed.
 The language office liberally grants extensions to persons who can explain their
 failure to meet the requisite competence level in 4 years. Estonian language training
 is available; however, some claim it is too costly. Some Russian representatives have
 asked for free language training. They have charged also that the language require-
 ment for citizenship is too difficult. There has been talk of making the language re-
 quirement less rigorous. The examination fee for either language test-for employ-
 ment or citizenship-is 15 percent of the monthly minimum wage, although it is
 waived for the unemployed.
 Legislation and a government decision provide that, in districts where more than
 one-half of the population speak a language other than Estonian, the inhabitants
 are entitled to receive official information in that language. Moreover, the local gov-
 ernment may conduct business in that language. In practice city governments of
 predominantly Russian speaking communities conduct most official business in Rus-
 sian.
 All residents, whether or not they are citizens, can complain directly to the State
 Court about alleged violations of human or constitutional rights. The State Court
 justices review each case and have decided in favor of complainants. All decisions
 are in Estonian but if a complaint is received in a language other than Estonian
 (usually Russian) the court provides a complimentary translation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join a union or employee association. The Central Organization of Estonian Trade
 Unions (EAKL) came into being as a wholly voluntary and purely Estonian organi-
 zation in 1990 to replace the Estonian branch of the official Soviet labor confed-
 eration, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU). The EAKL has
 90,000 members. Another trade union, the Organization of Employee Unions
 (TALO), split from the EAKL in 1993 and has 45,000 members. A central union of
 food processing and rural workers was established in 1997. About one-third of the
 country's labor force belongs to one of the three labor federations.
 The right to strike is legal, and unions are independent of the Government and
 political parties. The Constitution and statutes prohibit retribution against strikers.
 There were no strikes during the year, although Tallinn bus drivers threatened to
 walk out.
 Unions may join federations freely and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While Estonian workers now
 have the legally acquired right to bargain collectively, collective bargaining is still
 in its infancy. According to EAKL leaders, few collective bargaining agreements
 have been concluded between management and workers of a specific enterprise. The
 EAKL has, however, concluded framework agreements with producer associations,
 which provide the basis for specific labor agreements, including the setting of the
 minimum wage. The EAKL also was involved with developing Estonia's new Labor
 Code covering employment contracts, vacation, and occupational safety. The Labor
 Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employees have the right to go to court
 to enforce their rights. In 1993 laws covering collective bargaining, collective dispute
 resolution, and shop stewards were enacted.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor although it does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded
 labor by children (see Section 6.d.). The Labor Inspections Office effectively enforces
 this prohibition.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution forbids forced labor for anyone. There were no reports of forced or bonded
 labor by children in enterprises (see Section 6.c.); however, there were instances of
 families forcing their children to engage in peddling or begging. The Government
 ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Chd, which bans forced child
 labor. The statutory minimum for employment is 16 years of age. Minors 13 to 15
 years of age may work provided they have written permission of a parent or guard-

 ian and the local labor inspector. The work may not endanger the minor's health
 or be considered immoral, cannot interfere with studies, and must be included on
 a Government-prepared list. Government authorities effectively enforce minimum
 age laws through inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government, after consultations with the
 EAKL and the Central Producers Union, sets the minimum wage. The monthly min-
 imum wage iso$60 (845 Estonian crowns). The minimum wage is not sufficient to
 provide a worker and family with a decert standard of living. About 3 percent of
 the work force- receive the minimum wage. The average monthly wage in the second
 quarter was about $253.
 The standard workweek-is 40 hours, and there is a mandatory 24-hour rest pe-
 riod. According to EAKL sources, legal occupational health and safety standards are
 satisfactory, but they are extremely difficult to achieve in practice.. The National
 Labor Inspection Board is responsible for enforcement of these standards, but it has
 not been very effective to date. In addition the labor unions have occupational
 health and safety experts who assist workers to bring employers in compliance with
 legal standards. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
