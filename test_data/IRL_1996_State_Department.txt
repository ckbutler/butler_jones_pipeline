 IRELAND
 Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a long tradition of orderly transfer of
 power. The Government isheaded by a president and a prime minister, and there
 is a bicameral parliament. The judiciary is independent.
 The national police are under the effective civilian control of the Minister of Jus-
 tice and have sofe responsibility for internal security. Ireland's principal internal se-
 
 
 978
 curity concern has been to prevent the spillover of terrorist violence from Northern
 Ireland. Despite the end of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) cease-fire in Feb-
 ruary, the Government did not reinstate the state of emergency, which it lifted in
 1996 when the cease-fire began.
 Ireland has an open, market-based economy that is higy dependent on inter-
 national trade. It is a large net recipient of funds from the European Union (EU)
 designed to raise per capita Cras national product to the EU average. Despite
 strong economic growth over the past few years, unemployment remains high at
 12.4 percent.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Human
 rights problems arise primarily from: prison overcrowding and substandard facili-
 ties; instances of abuse by police and prison officials; the continuation of special ar-
 rest and detention authority and the nonjury court; discrimination and violence
 against women- abuse of children- occasional censorship of films, books, and periodi-
 cals; and a lac of explicit antidisrimination legislation, especially in relation to
 persons with disabilities and "travelers" (an itinerant ethnic community).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Re8pect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extraojudicial Kldling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-The
 law prohibits such practices, and security personnel generally did not employ them.
 However, at least 66 cases were filed against the State by persons claiming dam-
 ages for personal injuries resulting from alleged mistreatment while in police cus-
 tody. While mistreatment by police officers is not widespread, in one case two per-
 sons accused of murdering a police officer alleged that they had been severely beat-
 en by police while in custody. At their initial court appearance, the men showed
 physicl injuries consistent with their allegations. No official public action was
 taken on their complaint.
 Ireland has a low incarceration rate (73 inmates per 100,000 population), and the
 prison regime is generally liberal. However, the physicaf infrastructure of many
 prisons is-barely a equate: facilities are plagued by chronic overcrowding, requiring
 doubig-up in many single-person ells. Almost all of the country's 12 prisons are
 very old buildings that were built originally for other uses; as a result, less than
 half the cells have toilets and running water. According to the May report of its
 oversight committee, a statutory body made up of ministerial appointees not con-
 nected to the prison service, drug abuse is widespread at Mountjoy prison, the coun-
 trys largest. The report also cites overcrowding and describes medical services as
 "ad hoc and uncoordinated." The Government is in the process of upgrading prion
 facilities to improve sanitary conditions and to meet statutory health and safety
 standards.
 Prisoners have filed 26 cases against the State for alleged mistreatment. The Gov-
 ernment admitted that "in at least some prisons in Ireland * * * there are certain
 officers who have a propensity to ill-treat prisoners." There is no evidence that these
 officers have been reprimanded or removed. The Government has improved training
 of prison officials in order to reduce prisoner abuse.
 The Government has continued to arrest and incarcerate at Portlaoise prison per-
 sons involved in paramilitary activity. Conditions for these inmates are the same,
 if not better, than those for the general prison population.
 The Government has a 3-year prison construction plan to build 800 new cells and
 a new women's prison annex at Mountjoy prison. However, human rights observers
 are skeptical that the plan will lead to the end of the present chronic overcrowding
 given the Government s failure so far to expand prison capacity under the 5-year
 plan published in 1994. International human rights monitors are permitted to visit
 prisons without reservation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that no per-
 son shall be deprived of personal liberty without due process under the law. A de-
 tainee has the right to petition the High Court which is required to order release
 unless it can be shown that the person is being detained in accordance with the law.
 Under the 1984 Criminal Justice Act, the maximum period of detention for ques-
 tioning in most cases is 12 hours, plus a possible extension of 8 hours overnight to
 allow a detainee to sleep.
 . Detention without charge is permitted for up to 48 hours, however, in cases cov-
 ered by the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act. This act allows police to arrest
 and detain for questioning anyone suspected of committing a 'scheduled offense,"
 
 
 979
 i e.,one involving firearms, explosives, or membership in an unlawful organization.
 Although the stated purpose of the act is to "prevent actions ad conduct calculated
 to undermine public order and the authority of the state," it is not restricted to sub-
 veraive offenses. Therefore, the police have broad arrest and detention powers in
 any case involving firearms.
 The act also provides for the indefinite detention, or internment, without trial of
 any Jperson who is engaged in activities that are "prejudicial to the preservation of
 n                order or to the securityof the state." While this power has not
 n      ed since the late 1950's, the  vernment could do so by simply issuing
 a proclamation. There are no previsions for the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act
 to be renewed; it continues indefinitely.
 The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act of 1996 permits detention without
 charge for up to 7 days in cases involving drug trafficking. To hold a suspected drug
 trafficker for more than 48 hours, however, the police must seek a judge s approval.
 The authorities do not impose exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial system includes 23 district courts, 8 circuit courts, the High Court,
 the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the Supreme Court. Judges are appointed by the
 President on the advice of the Government.
 Most criminal cases are prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a state
 official with semiautonomous status. Jury trial is the norm. The accused generally
 may choose his or her attorney. For indigent defendants, the state assumes the cost
 of counsel.
 However, the Constitution explicitly allows "special courts" to be created when
 "ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and
 the preservation of public peace and order." In 1972, under the 1939 Offenses
 Against the State Act, the Government set up a nonjury "Special Criminal Court"
 (CC) to try scheduled offenses," i.e., ones involving firearms, explosives, or mem-
 bership in an unlawful organization. Largely a reaction to the spillover of para-
 military violence from Northern Ireland, the SCC has been justified over the years
 as addressing the problem of jury intimidation in cases involving defendants with
 suspected paramilitary links.
 Since the paramilitary cease-fire in 1994, far fewer cases have been handled by
 the SCC than during the "troubles." However, since the IRA resumed its campaign
 of violence, the Government may use the 5CC mre frequently in the future. It was
 used at least twice in 1996, and several additional cases are pending. In addition
 to the "schedled offenses," the Director of Public Prosecutions can have any case
 tried by the SCC by simply certifying that the ordinary courts are "inadequate" to
 deal with it.
 In lieu of a jury, the Special Criminal Court usually sits as a three-judge panel
 Its verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of evidence are essentially the same as in
 regular courts, except that the sworn statement of a police chief superintendent
 identifying the accused as a member of an illegal organization is accepted as prima
 facie evidence. Sessions of the SCC are usually public, but the judge may exclude
 certain persons other than journalists. Appeals from the SCC are only allowed on
 points of law or against the sentence imposed.
 There were no reports of  litical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The Su-
 preme Court has affirmed that, although not specifically provided for in the Con-
 stitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home must be respected
 in law and practice. This is fully honored by the Government.
 In 1996 the High Court upheld a referendum that removed the ban on divorce.
 The Government is expected to enact implementing legislation that allows courts to
 grant divorces under certain circumstances.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides individuals with the
 right to "express freely their convictions and opinions." Freedom of the press, how-
 ever, is subject to the qualification that it not "undermine public order or morality
 or the authority of the state." Publication or utterance of "blasphemous, seditious,
 or indecent matter" is prohibited. While the press, in practice, operates freely, the
 1961 Defamation Act (which puts the onus on newspapers and periodicals accused
 of libel to prove defamatory words are true) and the 1963 Official Secrets Act (which
 gives the State wide scop to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of sensitive govern-
 ment information) are believed to result in some self-censorship.
 
 
 980
 More than 80 libel actions against newspapers and other publications were pend-
 ing before the courts; the National Newspapers Association of Ireland estimated
 that libel awards and related legal bills cost its members about $10 million (6 mil-
 lion Irish pounds) per year.
 Broadcasting remains mostly state controlled, but under the 1988 Radio and Tele-
 vision Act, private sector broadcasting is growing. There are at least 22 independent
 radio stations, and negotiations are proceeding for an independent television station.
 The Broadcasting Complaints Commission oversees standards and investigates com-
 plaints about programming. The 1960 Broadcasting Act empowers the Government
 to prohibit the state-owne radio and television network from broadcasting any mat-
 ter that is "likely to promote or incite to crime or which would tend to undermine
 the authority of the state." It was on this basis that the Government banned Sinn
 Fain (the legal political front of the IRA) from the airwaves from 1971 to 1994.
 Films and videos must be screened and classified by the Office of the Film Censor
 before they can be shown or sold. Distributors must pay a fee between $1,100 and
 $1,300 (650 to 800 Irish pounds) per film, which is used to finance the censor's of-
 fice. Under the 1923 Censorship of Films Act the censor has the authority to cut
 or ban any film that is "indecent, obscene or biasphemous" or which tends to "incul-
 cate principles contrary to public morality or subversive of public morality." There
 has been a diminishing use of this broad power in recent years: only two films were
 banned in 1996. Decisions of the censor can be appealed to a nine-member appeal
 board, but neither the censr nor the appeal boardisrequired to hear arguments
 or evidence in public or to state reasons or its decisions.
 Books and periodicals are also subject to censorship. The 1946 Censorship of Pub-
 hcations Act calls for a five-member board to examine publications referred to it by
 the customs service or a member of the general public. It can also examine books
 or periodicals on its own initiative. The bard can prohibit the sale of any publica-
 tion that it judges to be indecent or obscene. In 1996 the board banned at least 46
 books and 43 periodicals, a sharp increase from 1995, when it banned 17 books and
 3 periodicals.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides citi-
 zens with the right to 'assemble peaceably and without arms" and to form associa-
 tions and unions. However, it also allows the State to "prevent or control meetings"
 that are calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance
 to the general public." Under the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act, it is unlawful
 to hold any public meeting on behalf of, or in support of, an illegal organization.
 Although the Government prosecutes and incarcerates persons for mere membership
 in a terrorist organization, it allows meetings and assemblies by some groups that
 are associated with illegal terrorist organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith. Even though Ire-
 land is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, there is no state religion. However, almost
 all primary and secondary schools are denominational, managed and controlled by
 the Catholic Church. Religious instruction is an integral part of the curriculum, but
 there are provisions for parents to exempt their children from such instruction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as well as
 freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and voluntary repatriation.
 The Government approved a new refugee law in 1996 but it had not been imple-
 mented by year's end. Currently, there is no domestic law dealing with the status
 of refugees or procedures to be followed when a person applies for asylum. As a re-
 sult, the legal rights andprotections for asylum seekers and refugees are tenuous.
 The issue of provision of first asylum did not arise in 1996; nor were there reports
 of forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. Ireland im-
 plements its obligations under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refu-
 gees on an administrative basis. Specific administrative procedures for the deter-
 mination of refugee status were drawn up in consultation with the U.N. High Com-
 missioner for Refugees; in 1992 the Supreme Court ruled that these procedures
 were binding on the Minister of Justice. However, as the number of asylum seekers
 has increased (from only 31 in 1990 to 1,179 in 1996), these administrative proce-
 dures have proved inadequate. In particular, there have been complaints o long
 delays and a lack of transparency in decisions concerning refugee status. The Min-
 ister for Justice approved only 33 iefugee petitions in 1996.
 The new refugee law provides for a refugee commission, an appeals board, and
 provides criteria for evaluating refugee applications. These measures are designed
 to improve refugee processing and provide more openness.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Righta: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitutional requirement that parliamentary elections be held at least
 every 7 years has always been met. Suffrage is universal for citizens over the age
 of 18, and balloting is secret. Several political parties have seats in the bicameral
 Parliament. Members of the Dail (House of Representatives)- the chamber that
 carries out the main legislative functions- are popularly elected; in the Seanad
 (Senate), some members are elected and some are appointed by various bodies. The
 President is popularly elected for a 7-year term and is limited to two terms. An ap-
 pointed Council of State serves as an advisory body to the President.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. Although a woman is
 president, only 23 of the 166 deputies in the Dail and 7 of the 60 senators are
 women. Of the 22 legislative committees, the only one chaired by a woman is the
 Joint Committee on Women's Rights. Two of the 15 government ministers are
 women, as are 3 of the 17 junior ministers. There are 3 women on the 20-member
 High Court; only 1 of the 8 Supreme Court judges is a woman. While women partici-
 pate in all departments of government, they are underrepresented at senior levels.
 Women hold about 30 percent of public-sector jobs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The principal independent organization monitoring domestic human rights prob-
 lems, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, operates without hindrance from the Gov-
 ernment. The Government is open to investigation of human rights abuses by inter-
 national or other nongovernmental organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Except as regards employment neither the Constitution nor the law prohibits dis-
 crimination on the basis of disability, race, sex, language, or social status. To ad-
 dress these and other shortcomings in Irish civil law, the Government in 1993 cre-
 ated the Department of Equality and Law Reform. The Department has drafted an
 equal status bill and an employment equality bill, but neither bill was passed by
 i ar's end. The Constitution, as amended, already forbids state promotion of one re-
 lion over another and discrimination on the grounds of religions profession, belief,
 or status.
 Women.-There have been no systematic studies of violence against women, but
 indications are that it is significant. According to a 1995 survey by Women's Aid,
 a private organization, 7 percent of the women interviewed said that they had been
 abused by a partner or ex-partner in the past year, and 18 percent reported having
 been abused at some time. The Dublin Rape Crisis Center reports a 20 percent in-
 crease in the number of calls received in 1996. In 1995 it received more than 10,000
 calls. The Center estimates that only 29 percent of rape victims report the crime
 to  lice and that only 8 percent of those go to trial. A 1990 act criminalized rape
 wi'n marriage and provided for free legal advice to the victim. There are 12 wom-
 en's refuges in the country, funded in part by the Government, with accommodation
 for about 50 families.
 Another indication of the extent of violence against women is the number of appli-
 cations for barring orders. In 1995 there were 4,448 applications for orders to bar
 the husband from the family home; the courts granted 1,891 barring orders. In 1996
 the Government approved the Domestic Violence Act, which strengthens barring
 and protection orders and gives the police new powers to deal with these cases. A
 new working group on violence against women, chaired by a high-ranking govern-
 ment official, is sceduled to report in February 1997 on measures to deal further
 with the problem of violence against women.
 Discrimination against women in the workplace is unlawful, but inequalities per-
 sist regarding pay and promotions in both the public and the private sectors. Work-
 ing women are also hampered by the lack of adequate child-care facilities. The Ma-
 ternity Protection Act was passed in 1994, providing a woman 14 weeks of mater-
 nity leave and the right to return to her job. The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act of
 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of 1977 provide for protection and redress
 against discrimination based on gender and marital status. The Employment Equal-
 ity Agency monitors their implementation. The number of cases brought to the
 agency has fallen in recent years, but progress in eliminating the differential in
 earnings has been modest. In 1996 the hourly industrial wage for women was 60
 percent of that received by men, and weekly earnings of women averaged 68 percent
 of the weekly pay of men.
 
 
 Children.-The Government is strongly committed to the welfare and rights of
 children, as demonstrated by its ongoing implementation of the 1991 Child Care
 Act. Education is compulsory for chiliren 6 to 15 years of age. Among other things.
 the act places a statutory duty on government health boards to identify and hep
 children who are not receiving adequate care and gives the police increased powers
 to remove a child from the family when there is an immediate and serious risk to
 health or welfare. The Minister of State (junior minister) for Health has special re-
 sponsibility for children's policy, including implementation of the Child Care Act; by
 the end of 1996, only parts of the act remained to be implemented. The Status of
 Children Act of 1987 abolished the concept of illegitimacy and provided for equal
 rights for children in all legal proceedings.
 Sexual abuse of children has been receiving increased media attention; the num-
 ber of reported physical abuse cases is also rising. Surveys suggest that 12 to 15
 frcent  children experience physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or gross neglect.
 1996 t er   e  several scandals involving allegations of sexual abuse of children
 by orphanage staff and members of the Roman  atholic clergy. In at least three
 cases, members of the clergy pled guilty to sexually abusing minors and were con-
 victed. At least five more cases are pending.
 People With Disabiities.-An estimated- 15 percent of the adult population have
 a disability; 80 percent of those are unemployed. There is currentIy no leaislation
 to protect persons with disabilities from discrimination in employment or m other
 matters or to improve their access to buildings or transportation. Few public or pri-
 vate buildings have facilities for people with disabilities. The Commission on the
 Status of People with Disabilities issued a comprehensive report of the conditions
 faced by persons with disabilities. The report, which makes 402 recommendations
 for legislative and policy changes, is regarded by government officils and advocates
 for persons with disabilities as a first step towai~iimproving the rights of the latter.
 Nationl/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are some 25,000 nomadic people with-
 in Ireland who regard themselves as a distinct ethnic group called "travelers,"
 roughly analogous to the Roma of continental Europ. The "traveling" community
 has its own hsto ry, culture, and language. The travelers' emphasis on self-employ-
 ment and the extended family distinguish them from the rest of Irish society. In
 1991 a European Parliament committee reported that in Ireland, "the single most
 discriminated against ethnic group is the 'traveling peopleym That remained true in
 1996.
 Travelers are regularly denied access to premises, goods, facilities, and services;
 many restaurants and im bs, for example, have a policy of not serving them. Despite
 national school rules that provide that no child may be refused amision on ac-
 count of social position, travelers frequently experience difficulties in enrolling their
 children in schol. Sometimes they are segregated into all-traveler classes. Of an es-
 timated 3,500 traveler families, more than 1,000 are residing on roadsides or on
 tmporar'y sites without toilets, electricity, or washing facilities.
 Indicative of public hostility towards travelers, a Watrford county councilman
 said at a council meeting in April that travelers should be "run out" of the country.
 He said that "they are not our people, they are not natives of this country." In 1996
 there were fewer reported instances of violence against members of the traveling
 community than in the past.
 The tense relations between the traveling community and the rest of Irish society
 led the Government in 1993 to establish a task force to study theproblm and make
 recommendations. One of the main recommendations of the task force was that te
 distinct culture and identity of the traveler community be recognized and taken into
 account," especially in the context of the proposed equal status legislation. The trav-
 eling community is specifically addressed in the 1989 Prohibition of Incitement to
 Hatred Act, but to date, there have been no prosecutions under that law.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right tojoin a union is provided for by law, as
 is the right to refrain from joining. Abeut 55 percent of workers in the pri vate and
 public sectors are members of un ons. Police and military personnel are prohibited
 from striking, but they may form associations to represent themselves in matters
 of pay, workng conditions, and general welfare. The right to strike is freely exer-
 cised in boththe public and private sectors. The Industrial Relations Act of 1990
 prohibits retribution against strikers and union leaders; the Government effectively
 enforces this provision through the Department of Enterprise and Employment. In
 1996 the numiber of strikes was signifcantly down from past years; however, the
 number of work days lost by strikes increased fom 1995. The Irish Congress of
 Trade Unions (ICTU) represents 65 unions in the Republic of Ireland and Notern
 Ireland. Both the ICU and the unions affiliated with it are independent of the Gov-
 
 
 983
 
 ernment and of the political parties. Unions may freely form or join federations or
 confederations and affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have full free-
 dom to organize and to engage in collective bargaining. The Anti-Discrimination
 (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of 1977 make the Employment
 Equality Agency responsible for oversight of allegations of antiunion discrimination.
 If the Agency is unable to effect resolution, the dispute goes before the Labor Court,
 which consists of one representative each for the employer and the union, plus an
 independent chairperson. The Unfair Dismissals Act of 1977 provides various forms
 of relief in cases of employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination, including the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activities.
 Most terms and conditions of employment are determined through collective bar-
 gaining, in the context of a national economic pact negotiated every 3 years by the
 social partners," i.e., representatives of unions, employers, farmers, and the Gov-
 ernment. The social partners negotiated the current 3-year agreement, entitled
 "Partnership 2000," at the end of 1996. Formal ratification is expected early in 1997.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 established the Labor Relations Commission,
 which provides advice and conciliation services in industrial disputes. The Commis-
 sion may refer unresolved disputes to the Labor Court, which may recommend
 terms of settlement and may set up joint employer-union committees to regulate
 conditions of employment and minimum wages in a specific trade or industry.
 There is an export processing zone at Shannon airport that is subject to the same
 labor laws as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law and does not
 occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-By law children are required to
 attend school until the age of 15. The employment of children under the age of 15
 is generall prohibited by the 1977 Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act
 but those 14 years of age are allowed to do light non-industrial work during school
 holidays with the written permission of their parents. They are limited to working
 7 hours per day and 35 hours per week. For children 15 years old, the law limits
 work time to 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week. For those 16 or 17 years old,
 the limits are 9 hours per day and 45 hours per week. The Department of Enter-
 prise and Employment effectively enforces these provisions.
 The Government approved the Protection of Young Persons Act of 1996, which be-
 comes effective in 1997. Under the new act, maximum work hours would be reduced
 slightly, and children the age of 14 or under would not be allowed to work in most
 circumstances.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no general minimum wage law, but
 there are several minimum rates of pay applicable to specific industrial sectors,
 mainly those with lower-than-average wages. Although the lowest of these minimum
 wages is not sufficient to provide a decent living for a family of four, low-income
 families are entitled to additional benefits such as subsidized housing and children's
 allowances.
 The standard workweek is 39 hours. Working hours in the industrial sector are
 limited to 9 hours per day and 48 hours per week. Overtime is limited to 2 hours
 per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a year. The Department of Enterprise
 and Employment is responsible for enforcing four basic laws dealing with occupa-
 tional safety that provide a     and comprehensive coverage. No significant cor-
 in ts arose from either labor or management regarding enforcement of these laws.
 ecent regulations provide that employees who find themselves in situations that
 present a srious, imminent and unavoidable risk" may absent themselves without
 the employer being able to take disciplinary action.
