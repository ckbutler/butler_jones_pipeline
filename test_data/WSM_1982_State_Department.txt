 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa lies in the Pacific Ocean approximately 5,000
 miles southwest of the continental United States and consists
 of two main islands with a population of 170,000. Western
 Samoa became independent on January 1, 1962, ending more than
 40 years of UN Trusteeship and League of Nations mandate rule
 by New Zealand. Western Samoa's Constitution is based on the
 British pattern of parliamentary democracy, modified to take
 into account Samoan customs. Apia, the capital and commercial
 center, is the only major city in the country. While Samoans
 have tended to retain their traditional ways, the face of
 Western Samoa is changing; Western Samoa's exposure to outside
 influences has greatly increased.
 Most Samoans still live within the traditional social system
 based on the "aiga," or extended family group, headed by a
 ï¿½matai,* or chief. The legislative assembly (*Fono*) has 47
 members, 45 of whom are elected by matai suffrage on a
 territorial basis. There are some 10-12,000 matais who are
 eligible to vote for members of the Fono. The present head of
 state holds his position for life; future heads of state will
 be elected by the legislative assembly for five-year terms.
 The Constitution establishing the system was overwhelmingly
 adopted by a universal suffrage plebiscite conducted under
 United Nations supervision in 1961.
 A new head of government, Tofilau Eti, was sworn in as the
 Prime Minister of Western Samoa on December 30, 1982. This
 followed former Prime Minister Efi's loss of a no-confidence
 motion in parliament, and in turn followed a Western Samoan
 Supreme Court decision that previous Prime Minister Va'ai
 Kolone had lost his parliamentary seat due to violation of
 election regulations. Kolone was found guilty of personation
 -- using ineligible citizens to vote in place of dead or absent
 matai. In addition, a recent ruling by a specially-constituted
 court of appeals overturned the decision by Western Samoa's
 former Chief Justice that the country's Electoral Act was in
 conflict with its Constitution. That decision by the court of
 appeals, made up of three justices from New Zealand, now allows
 by-elections to take place. Other than the elections and
 constitutional controversy, there have been no major human
 rights issues in Western Samoa during 1982.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 Killing for political motives, or by government and opposition
 political organizations, does not occur in Western Samoa.
 b.   Disappearance
 Disappearances, abductions, and secret arrests do not occur in
 Western Samoa and clandestine detention does not exist. There
 are no political terrorist organizations in Western Samoa.
 C.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Western Samoa, and the
 Constitution ensures that "no person shall be subjected to
 torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.'
 This is observed in practice by reason of law and custom.

 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 All are illegal and not practiced or condoned. Treatment of
 prisoners is fair and humane. Prisoners are not discriminated
 against by reason of offense, social class, race, sex, or
 religion. Prison conditions do not appear to be harsh.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Western Samoa. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice. Preventive detention
 does not exist. Suspects must be (and are) formally charged
 within twenty-four hours of arrest. Persons awaiting
 sentencing are housed in the same detention facilities with
 those already convicted and serving time. Most Samoans who are
 jailed have been convicted of relatively minor crimes such as
 petty theft, and their terms of sentence are short. There have
 been several cases of individuals who have been sentenced to
 death waiting up to several years to learn whether their
 sentences would be commuted. With this exception, however,
 there are no lengthy delays between arrest, arraignment, trial,
 and sentencing. Local custom ('ifoga') is taken into account
 in sentencing.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants may be represented by counsel,
 and assessors are provided to assist in cases involving
 traditional matters. As noted previously, charges are filed
 within twenty-four hours following arrest and are formally and
 clearly stated. The judiciary is independent of the executive,
 and there are no political, security, or military courts.
 g.   Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home and search
 warrants are required by law. The Samoan Constitution does not
 specifically refer to illegal entry, but provides for the
 protection from invasion or seizure of property without due
 process of law. Local custom dictates that this law be
 respected.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, assembly,
 association, movement, and residence. These rights are
 respected in practice and there have been no charges of
 infringement or violation.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As noted above, these rights are guaranteed by the Constitution
 and are respected in practice. Western Samoa has only a
 fledgling trade union movement that is not yet well developed.
 However, the movement is under no restrictions by the
 Government and is free to organize.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of thought, conscience, and
 religion. These rights are respected, and there is no state
 religion. Adherence to a particular faith does not confer
 adyantage or disadvantage in civil, economic, political, or
 
 
 835
 other secular status.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Western Samoans are free to travel within the country and
 abroad, and rights of emigration and repatriation are
 respected. There are no refugees in Western Samoa.
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The primary basis fox suffrage is the matai system. The title
 of matai is conferred upon a selected member of an extended
 fami:ly group. Two members of the Parliament are elected by
 universal adult suffrage by-people lacking family group ties
 (generally, people of mixed.-uropean/Samoan origin). Matais
 traditionally consult with their "aiga before making decisions
 for the group. Most Samoans support the matai system. Members
 of Parliament serve for three years. Women are active in
 community affairs. Women have been represented in parliament
 and also serve in other public offices, but are generally
 underutilized as a development resource. Women's Ikomiti"
 (committees) are formally regarded as service groups operating
 under the authority of male chiefs. Western Samoa's Government
 is based on the Westminster parliamentary system with real
 power vested 'in the Prime Minister and ruling group. During
 the latter part of 1982, a decision was handed down by Great
 Britain's Privy Council which would have given some Samoans New
 Zealand citizenship. However, the matter was resolved by
 agreement between the two countries. There are no outstanding
 problems of nationality, citizenship, or statelessness.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 No requests for such investigations have been made to the
 Western Samoan Government, nor have human rights organizations
 found cause for comment or reporting upon Western Samoa.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Western Samoans' economic and social needs are met on a
 non-discriminatory basis, and there is no legal, sexual,
 racial, or religious discrimination in this regard. The right
 to own property alone and in association with others is
 protected. In recent years, the Western Samoan economy has
 performed poorly. Dependent on outside economic developments
 and vulnerable to internal management problems, economic
 prospects do not look good in the short and medium term.
 Per capita income estimates vary from under $400 a year to
 around $600 a year; what is clear is that Western Samoa is not
 well off even by developing country standards. Nonetheless, an
 adequate food supply is available which meets the population's
 caloric intake requirements, and there is adequate shelter --
 aided, of course by the mild, tropical climate.  Western
 Samoa's dedication to literacy is remarkable, and 98 percent
 of the population is able to read. Health standards are good,
 with adequate medical care available, as infant mortality
 figures of 17.8 per 1,000 live births indicate.
