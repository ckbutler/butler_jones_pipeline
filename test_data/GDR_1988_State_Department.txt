 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The German Democratic Republic (GDR) was created in 1949 as a
 Communist state out of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany.
 Approximately 380,000 Soviet troops still are stationed on its
 soil. The country is ruled by the Communist party, known as
 the Socialist Unity Party (SED). Four other parties, whose
 existence is tolerated, have no real power or independence,
 and the SED leadership makes all important political decisions.
 Despite such formidable barriers as the Berlin Wall, deep
 historical, cultural, linguistic, and family ties remain
 between the people of the GDR and those of the Federal
 Republic of Germany (FRG). Concern that such ties and
 constant exposure to Western values could undermine support
 for the Communist system is a central reason for the
 Government's tight control over its population. Control is
 maintained with an efficient and pervasive security apparatus
 administered by the Interior and State Security Ministries,
 which together employ approximately 300,000 people.
 The GDR has a highly industrialized, centrally planned economy
 in which the bulk of industrial and agricultural property is
 state owned. Although holding private property is permitted,
 controls are placed on its acquisition, inheritance, and the
 income derived from it. Small private businesses, which may
 have up to 10 employees, are being licensed in increasing
 numbers.
 The GDR continues to restrict the fundamental freedoms of
 speech, press, religion, assembly, and travel. A general
 amnesty announced in July 1987 resulted in the release of
 24,621 persons, including all political prisoners. West
 German government officials, however, estimate that increased
 internal security measures subsequently restored the number of
 political prisoners to preamnesty levels. At the same time,
 the Government allowed record numbers of GDR citizens, many
 under retirement age, to make short-term private visits to the
 West. The FRG estimates that there were 5 million visits by
 GDR citizens to the West in 1988. The travelers include more
 than 1,400,000 persons under retirement age. By comparison,
 only 60,000 persons under retirement age were permitted to
 travel just 3 years ago. By October 1, a total of 18,116 GDR
 citizens had legally emigrated to the FRG in 1988. The FRG
 Permanent Mission expects the final figure for 1988 to be
 close to the 1986 level of 21,500--substantially higher than
 the 13,000 allowed in 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 A 1982 law instructed border guards that they should open fire
 as a last resort to prevent a person from leaving the country
 without permission. By mid-1987, there were reports that the
 practice had been virtually suspended, except in cases of
 military or police deserters or self-defense. However, a
 number of shooting incidents occurred in 1988, and in one case
 a civilian was injured. The Government has not clarified its
 policy, and it is difficult to determine if the policy has, in
 fact, been modified.

 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 There were 288 unauthorized border crossings in 1987. By
 October 1, 418 persons had successfully crossed the GDR-FRG
 border or the Berlin Wall "illegally." The Government
 apparently has removed some lethal barriers, such as automatic
 shooting devices and minefields, but it has increased the
 height of the border fence to 3 meters, set up 150 kilometers
 of special dog-patrolled areas, and expanded its system of
 barriers on the inner-German border to a depth of
 approximately 20 kilometers.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of permanent disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Specific laws state that the life, health, and ability to work
 of arrestees and prisoners must not be jeopardized. A new law
 promulgated in December makes it a crime, with penalties up to
 10 years' imprisonment, for an official performing state
 functions to mishandle a person psychologically or physically.
 No reports were received in 1988 of physical abuse by prison
 officials, although in the past prisoners have complained of
 cruel treatment, including the beating and hanging of
 prisoners by their hands for periods of up to 24 hours, and
 have reported excessively harsh conditions and psychological
 strain in prisons. In its 1988 report (covering 1987),
 Amnesty International cited reports from former political
 prisoners who stated that they had been beaten, chained to
 beds, or held for prolonged periods in solitary confinement.
 The Council of Europe in September 1986 issued a report
 denouncing prison conditions and calling on the Government to
 uphold the principles of the United Nations International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it ratified in
 1973. Recently emigrated prisoners report the selective
 easing of conditions within prisons. In particular, they note
 an improvement in the guards' behavior. However, the
 psychological strain and harsh disciplinary treatment
 continue. In September 1987, the GDR ratified the U.N.
 Convention Against Torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Security agencies have blanket authority to detain and
 interrogate citizens on suspicion alone. Citizens who become
 particularly active in officially disapproved ways are
 sometimes subject to repeated harassment, such as recurrent
 police interrogations, despite the absence of formal charges.
 They may be arrested with or without warrants, merely for
 expressing dissenting views. A person held in detention has
 the right to a judicial review of continued detention, but in
 political cases this may not be effectively observed.
 Although the Criminal Procedure Code sets a limit of 3 months
 on investigatory proceedings, prosecuting authorities appear
 to have no difficulty in extending this period. In most
 political cases, it takes longer than 24 hours--often many
 weeks--before interested parties are notified of the arrest.
 Although the code guarantees access to a defense attorney, and
 this right exists from the beginning of the investigative
 proceeding, the authorities are not required to inform a
 detainee, and the right is not always exercised in a timely
 
 
 1059
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 manner. The prosecutor may monitor and restrict contacts
 between the defense attorney and his client. Recent
 developments in legal procedures have reduced the
 arbitrariness and extent of this practice but not yet
 eliminated it.
 Charges filed in clearly political cases are often based on
 laws which are written in vague and general language. The
 penal code provides, for instance, that the transmission of
 information "detrimental to the interests of the German
 Democratic Republic," even if it is not classified, may be
 considered treason. Laws against "antistate agitation" and
 "asocial behavior" (parasitism) are often applied selectively
 against citizens who become politically active. The broad and
 vague wording severely restricts the possibility far defense.
 In several instances in late 1987 and 1988, charges were
 dropped prior to trial in response to public outcries and
 church intervention. East German defense attorneys report
 that prisoners brought to trial under these laws occasionally
 have been acquitted.
 A small group of human rights and emigration activists
 attempted a peaceful counterdemonstration at a government
 rally January 17. These persons and numerous others connected
 with them, including dissident balladeer Stephen Krawczyk,
 were arrested, and some were charged with "eng-aging in
 treasonous contacts." After weeks of negotiations with the
 Evangelical (Lutheran) Church, the authorities ieleased all of
 them, most to the FRG. Krawczyk and several others alleged
 that they were coerced into signing documents in which they
 agreed to leave the GDR permanently.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The public is usually excluded from trials involving security
 and political issues. Prisoners are allowed to select their
 own attorneys. However, all attorneys are to some extent
 dependent on state toleration, and only a handful are willing
 to take on political cases. Until investigatory proceedings
 are completed, prisoners may be permitted to see their lawyers
 only in the presence of the police and to discuss only matters
 not related to the case. The number of instances in which
 such restrictions are applied reportedly has been declining,
 at least in nonsensitive cases. Discussion of a case itself
 often takes place in a brief interview shortly before the
 trial. Attorneys may not make photocopies of their clients'
 files. Files may be reviewed only in court, and notes must be
 taken in longhand or with the aid of a dictaphone.
 GDR attitudes regarding the Criminal Procedure Code are
 changing. A 1987 official commentary to the Criminal Code and
 the Criminal Procedure Code stated a presumption against
 restrictions forbidding a defense attorney from discussing the
 case with his client. Another official commentary has
 advanced the defense attorney's ability to gain more and
 earlier access to investigative documents. A court recently
 handed down a decision which freed a person from pretrial
 detention, and a Supreme Court justice published an article
 critical of excessive use of pretrial detention by many
 prosecutors and lower courts. The plenum of the Supreme Court
 has established new evidentiary rules which require
 prosecutors to meet a higher standard. It appears, however,
 
 
 1060
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 that none of these changes have yet affected the conduct of
 politically sensitive cases.
 Trials in sensitive cases may be short and perfunctory.
 Constitutionally, the courts are under the control of the
 Council of State. In reality, they are controlled by the SED,
 which in effect appoints the judges. Military courts try
 civilians only in military espionage cases.
 The Government does not admit to holding political prisoners,
 nor does it publish statistics which would assist in
 determining the number of political prisoners held. However,
 the FRG Ministry for Inner-German Relations has announced that
 it bought freedom for some 1,500 political prisoners from the
 GDR in 1986, for 1,247 in 1987, and for 506 by October 1,
 1988. The Salzgitter Center, an FRG government office which
 monitors GDR human rights abuses, has registered some 25,000
 prosecutions for political offenses in the GDR over the past
 25 years. Such prosecutions have generally resulted in prison
 sentences of 18 to 24 months. Most observers agree that
 approximately half of the political prisoners were jailed
 because of efforts to emigrate.
 In the fall of 1987, the GDR began implementing a general
 amnesty which covered all prisoners except those convicted of
 murder, espionage, and war or Nazi crimes. The terms of this
 amnesty were considerably broader than those of earlier
 amnesties carried out in 1979 and 1972. By December 1987,
 24,621 persons, including all political prisoners, had been
 released.
 Estimates of the current number of political prisoners in the
 GDR vary widely, both because of the difficulty in obtaining
 information and the use of different definitional criteria.
 (Before the amnesty, official FRG sources spoke of "more than
 1,000 known by name," with possibly another 1,000 being held.
 The private West German-based International Society for Human
 Rights estimated that there were 6,000 political prisoners,
 while Helsinki Watch reported estimates of political prisoners
 ranging from 7,000 to 10,000.) Official West German sources
 speak of more than 1,000 who are currently being held. This
 figure indicates that the number of political prisoners has
 reached preamnesty levels.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Assisted by informers, the secret police open mail, install
 listening devices, place people under surveillance, subject
 them to interrogation and intimidation, and arrest them
 without due process. By law, the police need court
 authorization to enter and search a house. They may authorize
 entry themselves, however, and the courts will retroactively
 give approval. State security organs, solely on their own
 authority, routinely and legally tap telephones and open
 mail. Evidence thus obtained can be used in court. The
 Government has achieved its goal of instilling a widespread
 belief that state security informants are ubiquitous and
 discovery of oppositiod to the State is certain.
 Young people are not forced to join the SED's youth movement,
 the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend--FDJ), but school
 and government authorities make it clear that failure to do so
 will limit educational and job opportunities. Helsinki Watch
 has reported that 15- and 16-year-olds must attend a 2-week
 
 
 1061
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 paramilitary training camp where they learn such skills as
 using weapons and throwing grenades.
 GDR citizens must obtain government permission to marry
 foreigners. The Government appeared to follow faithfully
 during 1988 the letter of a 1983 law which specified that
 authorities should decide on applications for binational
 marriage within 6 months of submission of the application.
 Under a new law, binational marriage applications filed after
 January 1, 1989 must be decided within 3 months. Assembling
 documents for submission can be time-consuming, however.
 A large group of persons--at least several million in number
 --in positions deemed sensitive by the Government have not
 been eligible for private travel nor allowed to maintain
 Western contacts. It appears that the number of persons so
 restricted was considerably reduced in 1988. Engineers,
 teachers, doctors, and members of certain other professions
 still have more than usual difficulty obtaining permission to
 travel.
 With a law passed in December, the GDR has given citizens the
 right, effective July 1, 1989, to challenge in local county
 courts many of the bureaucracy's actions personally affecting
 them in certain important civil code areas such as travel,
 emigration, property rights, compensation for damages, and
 applications to obtain a building permit or open a private
 shop or business. While the local courts may now set aside
 administrative decisions in these areas, the decisions of the
 local courts are final, and the citizen has no right to appeal
 to a higher court. Nonetheless, this is the first time
 persons have had the option of a judicial review of such
 administrative decisions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech remains severely circumscribed. There are
 restrictive laws relating to free expression, and public
 dissent can result in prison sentences. A young technician
 was sentenced in March to 10 months, imprisonment after
 distributing emigration rights leaflets on church grounds.
 Perhaps out of a conscious effort to seem less repressive
 abroad, however, the authorities appear increasingly reluctant
 to punish publicly dissenting speech. Most persons engaging
 in such activities are merely picked up and detained briefly
 by the police without charges being filed, though they may
 later be subjected to police harassment and intimidation.
 The Government controls all media and licenses all
 publications prior to distribution. The media's basic
 function is to support and strengthen the Socialist order.
 Over the past 2 years, articles have appeared in established
 journals on previously taboo social subjects, such as AIDS,
 homosexuality, environmental pollution, and juvenile
 delinquency. While these articles generally stress the
 Government's efforts to solve such problems, the mention of
 these topics marks a new development.
 In 1988 the Government censored church newspapers for the
 first time in years, especially their coverage of church
 convocations which discussed subjects such as education
 policy, environmental protection, military service, and
 conscientious objection. In August the president of the
 
 
 1062
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 Evangelical (Lutheran) Church Federation met with the new
 State Secretary for Church Questions on this issue.
 From time to time, unofficial activist groups produce,
 independently of both the church and the State, newsletters
 and underground newspapers in limited quantities. One example
 was the monthly bulletin, Grenzfall, published by the Peace
 and Human Rights Initiative, which covered peace, ecology,
 human rights, and independent activities in the GDR. After
 members of the group were arrested on January 17 (see Section
 l.d.), publication of Grenzfall stopped.
 Circulation or importation of most printed materials requires
 an official permit. Since SED General Secretary Erich
 Honecker's September 1987 visit to the FRG, however, East
 Germany has relaxed somewhat the stringent controls governing
 importation of printed materials from the West. Private
 persons may now import certain specialized publications, even
 if the publications do not have a special postal license.
 However, the regulation elastically excludes literature
 "directed against the preservation of peace and containing
 other agitation" or "contravening the interests of the
 Socialist State and its citizens."
 The GDR also controls the distribution of Soviet publications.
 In March it banned three issues of a German-language Soviet
 newspaper, Neue Zeit, in which a play about Lenin and Stalin
 previously criticized by the party paper, had been
 serialized. In November it removed the Soviet periodical
 Sputnik from the postal mailing list--thereby effectively
 depriving East German subscribers of the magazine--purportedly
 for regularly distorting Soviet history and the history of the
 Soviet and German Communist parties, particularly with regard
 to the Stalin era.
 Western newspapers and magazines are generally unavailable to
 the public at large. Small quantities of Western journals are
 for sale for hard currency in international hotels upon
 request. Some libraries, university departments, and official
 institutes also receive Western journals, but circulation is
 highly restricted. GDR and Western travelers may be
 interrogated or arrested simply for possessing unlicensed
 printed material.
 Western journalists' ability to report on events in the GDR is
 limited by laws restricting their ability to travel without
 prior permission and to contact potential sources directly.
 For the average East German, contact with Western journalists
 is technically illegal. In the spring, Western reporters were
 refused permission to cover church synods, and in June several
 were roughed up and had their cameras smashed by state
 security police when they attempted to cover a spontaneous
 gathering of rock music fans at the Brandenburg Gate during an
 outdoor concert in the West.
 West German television can be viewed by 80 percent of the GDR
 populace. Some of the few areas still unable to receive West
 German television by antenna are now installing cable
 systems. Western radio broadcasts can be heard throughout the
 country. The Government does not attempt to jam or otherwise
 hinder these broadcasts.
 The SED conceives of art and literature as means of promoting
 political goals. The value of works is judged on whether they
 ultimately convey a positive view of Communist society and
 
 
 1063
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 goals, though they can be quite critical of individual
 aspects. Overly critical views or perceptions are discouraged
 or censored. Publishing houses practice self-censorship, and
 works must receive official clearance before they are
 published, performed, or exhibited. Some works are banned
 completely; others may be published only outside the country
 under contracts negotiated by state-run agencies; others are
 permitted to be published, performed, or exhibited in the GDR
 only in edited form.
 While cultural figures continue to emigrate, there are
 indications that the authorities may be attempting a limited
 cultural relaxation. At a quadrennial Writers' Congress in
 December 1987, authors were more outspoken in criticizing
 cultural policies than they have been for years. A
 Filmmakers' Congress called for more conflict in films; some
 previously banned books began to appear in East German
 editions; controversial plays were performed; and a literary
 journal printed articles criticizing the Stalinist era and
 cultural policy in the 1960's.
 Individual academic freedom is severely limited and even
 formally restricted by law. The State views education as an
 instrument for "building socialism." All areas of academic
 inquiry are strictly controlled. Teachers who allow open
 classroom discussion of unapproved themes or topics, or who
 deviate from the party line, are disciplined. Many books are
 prohibited totally; others are permitted only in university
 libraries to which only carefully screened and authorized
 personnel are allowed access.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly,
 only the various churches have maintained the ability to
 organize meetings without prior state approval. Even they
 exercise restraint to avoid unduly antagonizing the
 Government.
 The formation of private organizations or clubs also requires
 government permission. Professional associations for writers
 and artists are headed by party members and ultimately
 controlled by the State. Dissidents and critics have been
 expelled and deprived of important professional privileges.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion \
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief and
 worship. The State officially promotes atheism but in
 practice tolerates and even provides some financial subsidies
 for religious activity. Overt adherence to religious beliefs
 may result in disqualification for preferred jobs and
 educational opportunities, although the largest religious
 community, the Evangelical (Lutheran) Church, has had some
 success in pleading the cases of its members who have suffered
 such discrimination.
 New churches continue to be built, and old ones restored, in
 limited numbers with government approval. Clergy are trained
 in both state universities and church-run seminaries. The
 Government has demonstrated some flexibility in its treatment
 of minority religions. Relations with the Catholic Church
 
 
 1064
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 remain steady, and those with the small Jewish community
 continue to improve.
 For the first time since the building of the Wall, Jewish
 leadership from both sides of the city participated as joint
 hosts of an event, the commemoration of the start of Nazi
 death camp deportations from Berlin. The State took an
 unprecedentedly active role in 50th anniversary commemorations
 of the Kristallnacht, the Nazi pogrom, and it is supporting
 restoration of Berlin's largest synagogue and the
 establishment of a Jewish museum and cultural center.
 While the Government has not rescinded a ban on organized
 activities by Christian Scientists, it has made no effort to
 interfere with those activities. Members of the Church of
 Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continue to practice their
 faith relatively unimpeded, and state and church
 representatives jointly participated in the recent dedication
 of a new Mormon community center.
 The churches remain under continuing government pressure to
 watch their words and deeds, and the secret police continue to
 monitor church-sponsored events closely. Nonetheless, the
 Evangelical (Lutheran) Church remains the only institutional
 forum in which divergent opinions can be expressed with
 relative freedom. With the exception of church-sponsored
 events held on church grounds, groups are not allowed to
 organize events without official approval. After the
 Evangelical and Catholic churches held their first-ever joint
 ecumenical conference in February, during which participants
 expressed sharp criticism of some public policies, the State
 attempted to pressure the church newspapers into printing only
 highly expurgated accounts of the discussion. Persons
 attending a March service at a Berlin church had their
 identity papers examined by the authorities before they could
 enter the church.
 The authorities have also censored church newspaper accounts
 of synod discussions. Such censorship and the Evangelical
 Church's efforts on behalf of would-be emigrants and those
 arrested on January 17 strained the Church's relations with
 the Government. In August the new State Secretary for Church
 Questions met with Bishop Leich to discuss the censorship
 issue. However, there has been further censorship of church
 newspapers since then. The church-state dialog on issues such
 as freedom of religion and thought, conditions of military
 service, conscientious objection, and compulsory military
 training in the schools, was postponed by the State in the
 fall of 1987 and has not resumed.
 Western clergy were permitted to attend church synods and lay
 conventions, and some GDR religious leaders were allowed to
 attend similar meetings in the West. In at least one case,
 however, the State did not permit the entry of West Germans
 who were to talk at a church-sponsored meeting.
 For some time, young men subject to universal conscription who
 are religious conscientious objectors have been able to choose
 alternative service in unarmed construction units. However,
 those opposed to any military service whatever were
 incarcerated. Recently the Government adopted a policy of
 ignoring such persons, i.e., neither drafting nor prosecuting
 them. Conscientious objectors may still face discrimination
 in schools and jobs.
 
 
 1065
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Most citizens can travel freely within the country, except
 within special border zones or near military installations.
 Technically they are not free to change their place of
 residence without government approval, but normally this
 amounts only to a requirement to register with the police.
 All citizens must carry identification cards which the police
 have the right to check at will. Because of their criminal or
 political records, including the filing of emigration
 applications, approximately 60,000 citizens carry a special
 identification card called PM-12, which in many but not all
 cases restricts domestic as well as foreign travel. Foreign
 travel is tightly controlled. Exit visas are required for
 travel to other Communist countries except Czechoslovakia, and
 travel to Poland remains restricted.
 Under GDR regulations in effect through December 31, 1988,
 travel to non-Communist countries was not allowed until
 citizens reached retirement age (60 for women, 65 for meny.
 On a case by case basis, the Government also permitted its
 citizens below retirement age to travel to the West, chiefly
 the FRG, on urgent family matters, narrowly defined as births,
 deaths, marriages, and significant birthdays and anniversaries
 for first-degree relatives (spouses, parents, and childreny
 and siblings. For the last 3 years, however, the Government
 substantially eased these restrictions and the authorities
 increasingly made exceptions to their own rules. During 1987
 some 3 million GDR citizens traveled to the West, including
 1.2 million under retirement age. Of these, less than
 one-half of 1 percent failed to return to the GDR. In 1988 an
 estimated 4 million persons, including more than 1.4 million
 under retirement age, were able to visit the West. There were
 still many complaints, however, that official decisions on
 travel applications were made arbitrarily and unpredictably
 and that the citizen had no effective right of appeal.
 A 1983 law, valid until the end of 1988, narrowly restricted
 cases of family reunification to first-degree relatives
 (spouses, parents, and children). Though some East Germans
 other than those with first-degree relatives were allowed to
 leave, the narrow definition of eligibility for emigration
 created difficulties for the large majority of applicants.
 Many successful applicants waited from 1 to 5 years for
 permission to leave, often in the meantime suffering loss of
 employment and even imprisonment.
 In December the GDR published a new law on short-term Western
 visits, and permanent emigration which gives promise that this
 hitherto arbitrary process may become more predictable and
 consistent. Under this law, which came into effect on January
 1, 1989, the categories of persons eligible to submit
 applications and the circumstances under which applications
 may be made are somewhat broader and more clearly defined.
 The bureaucracy is required to accept applications, reach
 decisions within fixed time periods, and provide a clear legal
 statement for rejections. After July 1, 1989, citizens will
 have the right to appeal the decisions to a court. The new
 law appears to codify the more liberal practices of the past
 3 years, but the grounds for refusal listed include some
 "rubber" clauses reserving for the authorities considerable
 discretionary power.
 
 
 1066
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 Those who left the country illegally before January 1, 1981,
 are eligible to apply for permission to visit, but reportedly
 only half of those who have applied have obtained visas.
 Those who fled after 1980 face criminal prosecution if they
 return to the GDR. Those who emigrate legally must generally
 wait 5 years before they are permitted to return again.
 However, persons who have received permission for an extended
 stay in the West but who have made no attempt to change their
 citizenship, such as the noted writer Monika Maron, apparently
 are allowed to return at any time for a visit. In addition,
 some persons sent temporarily abroad in the wake of the
 January 17 events were allowed to return in August, although
 those who agreed to leave permanently have not been permitted
 even transit visas to take the train from the Western sectors
 of Berlin to the FRG-GDR border.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change the system of government. The
 SED leadership makes all important decisions, and lower-level
 functionaries are expected to approve and carry them out. The
 party leadership controls the Government and its operations,
 determines who will fill executive positions in the government
 apparatus, and ensures that its party members occupy a
 majority of them. Although four other parties are represented
 in the Government, they are not permitted to challenge
 Communist leadership or control. The unicameral legislature,
 the Volkskammer (People's Chamber), has yet to reject a
 government proposal.
 All parties and mass organizations (such as trade unions) are
 represented in the National Front, which is controlled by the
 SED. For election purposes, the National Front prepares lists
 of approved candidates according to a formula which ensures
 the SED's complete domination. The list of candidates on a
 ballot exceeds the number of available seats, and a candidate
 high on the list may be rejected if more than 50 percent of
 voters cross his name off the ballot. In such a case, a
 candidate lower on the list may be elected. This is last
 known to have happened in a provincial election over 20 years
 ago.
 Women are widely represented at the lower levels of both the
 party and the Government. At the upper levels, however, few
 women hold positions. Of the 26 members and candidate members
 of the SED's Politburo, for example, 2 are female. There are
 16 women on the 161-member Central Committee of the SED. Six
 women sit on the 30-member Council of State, and there is
 1 woman in the Council of Ministers.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although the GDR is a signatory of the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, it has
 generally taken the position that inquiries into its human
 rights policies constitute interference in its internal
 affairs. Requests by'private human rights groups in the West
 for information on human rights conditions go unanswered, and
 the Government discourages visits by such groups. Within the
 GDR, members of unofficial human rights groups, such as the
 Peace and Human Rights Initiative and the Solidarity Church
 Working Group, face surveillance and harassment by the secret
 
 
 1067
 GERMAN DE40CRATIC REPUBLIC
 police and may be arrested if their activities are deemed
 threatening to the Government. Such groups are often the only
 source of current information available to outside observers
 on human rights developments in the GDR. Their ability to
 disseminate information is restricted by official harassment.
 The government-sponsored Committee for the Protection of Human
 Rights does not attempt to safeguard the human rights of GDR
 citizens but criticizes human rights conditions in other
 countries while claiming there are no problems in the GDR.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 An extensive social welfare system provides free medical care
 to the population without discrimination. Men and women are
 treated equally in most respects, and women's marriage and
 property rights are generous.
 Almost 90 percent of women of working age are employed, and a
 comprehensive child care system exists for working parents.
 As one of the many incentives to increase the birth rate,
 women are given extensive maternity leave with pay. Women are
 given 1 day a month off to do household shopping, as are
 single fathers with custody of children.
 Women and men receive equal pay for equal work. Women can be
 found in all professions, although they tend to be concentrated
 in the lowest paying jobs--trade, services, and textiles. In
 time of war, they are liable for the military draft. Few women
 hold high positions in most professions, although they are.well
 represented in the medical profession, and a woman has become
 the director of one of the country's largest economic
 enterprises.
 The Democratic Women's Federation of Germany officially
 represents women's interests within the SED. Its functions,
 however, are nominal.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to establish and join unions of
 their own choosing. The Free German Trade Union (FDGB) is an
 appendage of the SED. It consists of 16 unions covering all
 workers and professionals and represents some 90 percent of
 the work force. All large industrial, retail, and agricultural
 enterprises--which employ 96 percent of the labor force--are
 owned by the State. The FDGB's role is to enforce and promote
 official government and party policies--which are considered
 to correspond with the interests of the masses--rather than to
 promote members' interests, which might conflict with those
 policies. The FDGB is affiliated with the World Federation of
 Trade Unions.
 Workers do not have the constitutional right to strike.
 Although this right existed in the 1949 Constitution, it was
 deleted from the 1968 Constitution because, according to the
 SED, workers do not need this right under socialism. The
 right to strike was not restored in the 1974 Constitution.
 There were no published reports of strikes in 1988.

 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Col]ectively
 There is no legal provision for collective bargaining, nor
 does it exist in practice. Although worker representatives
 are allowed to sit on the enterprises' boards, in reality they
 only rubberstamp the boards' policies. Labor law and practice
 are uniform throughout the GDR.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is not practiced in the GDR. There is a
 requirement that teenagers must work at least one summer for
 the State, but they receive compensation for their work.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children from age 14 may work part time during vacations and
 to further their education. Children can work full time with
 parental permission between ages 14 and 18. Youths under the
 age of 18 may not work between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Youth
 commissions within the FDGB effectively enforce the child
 labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Under the law, a full-time worker is entitled to a minimum
 wage of approximately $216 per month. The minimum provides
 subsistence-level living for workers and their families.
 The maximum workweek is 43 3/4 hours, with a maximum of an
 additional 120 hours overtime per year permissible by law,
 except under extraordinary conditions. A 2-day weekend is
 conmon. The GDR guarantees citizens the right to a job, and
 there is essentially no unemployment.
 Labor law obliges enterprises to protect their employees'
 health and safety in the workplace. In reality, working
 conditions are often difficult, especially in mining and heavy
 industry. The Government has had some success, however, in
 reducing the relatively high rate of accidents in the
 workplace.
