 ZIMBABWE
 President Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe     wrican National Union-Patriotic
 Front (ZANU-PF) have dominated the legislative and executive branches of
 Zimbabwe's Government since independence in 1980. The Constitution allows for
 multiple parties; in addition to ZANU-PF, ther e ma large number of smaller par-
 ties. However, they are poorly organized and led, poorly financed, and subject to
 periodic intimidation by the ruling party and Government security forces. Late in
 1997, the Parliament amended the election laws to allow for increased access to
 funding for opposition candidates, and this action should increase the size of the
 eletorate; th ese chane will go into effect in early 1998. The judiciary is id nd-
 ent, but the Government occasionally refuses to abide by court decisions.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) are responsible for maintaining law and
 order. The Zimbabwe National Army and Air Force are responsible for external se-
 curity. The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) under the Ministry of State Se-
 
 
 385
 curity is responsible for internal and external security but no longer has powers of
 arrest. Members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Zimbabwe's economy is agriculturally based, with strong mining and tourism sec-
 tors and a diversified manuacturing base. It has become increasingly market based
 following the 1991-95 structural adjustment program. Primary exports are tobacco,
 cotton, oil seeds, livestock, gold, and nickel. Over 60 percent of the population en-
 gages in subsistence agriculture. The formal sector unemployment rate is above 45
 percent. Indigenization (black economic empowerment) is a Government priority to
 redress economic disparities between the majority black population and a small
 white elite. The estimated 1996 annual per capita gross domestic product of $588
 is expected to rise or decline if another drought occurs as predicted. Due to the rapid
 decline in the Zimbabwe dollar and escalating inflation at year's end, the poor and
 working class saw a significant drop in their standard of living.
 The Government respected some of the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were significant problems in some areas, including incidents of police brutal-
 ity, harsh prison conditions, pretrial detention, the Government's refusal to abide
 by several court rulings, CIO intimidation of opposition party candidates and their
 supporters, restrictions on academic freedom, infringements on citizens' privacy, re-
 strictions on opposition party financing, and attempts at interference with non-
 governmental organizations'(NGO) leadership selection. The political process re-
 mained heavily tilted in favor of the ruling party.
 As a result of the Government's improper handling of the October 1995 mayoral
 elections in Harare, Bulawayo, and Gweru, the High Court nullified the results of
 those votes. Ruling party candidates won the subsequent 1996 mayoral elections in
 all three cities, and in 1997 the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the new elec-
 tions.
 During the December mayoral election in Chitungwiza an independent candidate,
 Fidelis Mhashu, campaigned strongly, but was defeated by the ZANU-PF candidate
 by a narrow margin. Mhashu was beaten severely in June at a local government
 office in the presence of government officials. There have been no reports of arrests
 or charges being brought against any individuals arising out of that attack. Al-
 though the small independent press was increasingly open and critical of the Gov-
 ernment, there was some self-censorship. The electronic media-the major source of
 information for most citizens-remained totally Government controlled, and strict
 anti-defamation laws also led to self-censorship. Three new private television sta-
 tions were ganted broadcast rights. All three stations are liely to face financial
 difficulties due to imited revenue, and are restricted to broadcasting on an available
 channel leased from the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation; creation of an inde-
 pendent transmission facility is still forbidden under the Broadcasting Act. Domestic
 violence against women remained widespread, and traditional, often illegal, dis-
 crimination against women and the disabled continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Exrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of-political
 killings by Government security forces.
 Harsh prison conditions contributed to the average of 25 deaths per month of pris-
 oners in custody (see Section l.c.).
 The Legal Resource Foundation and the Catholic Commission for Justice and
 Peace (CCJP) interviewed thousands of victims or relatives of victims of atrocities
 committed during the 1982-87 Matabeleland crisis and presented their findings to
 the President in March. The Government did not respond to the report nor take any
 action on the 1993 Simplicius Chihambakwe commission investigation of the
 Matabeleland crisis. Despite calls by the CCJP for an investigation into the wide-
 spread killings of civilians in Matabeleland and recommendations for compensating
 people in the affected area, the Government took no further action on the bodies
 discovered at various locations nor has anyone been held accountable for the mas-
 sacres.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 In the case of the 1990 disappearance of Rashiwe Guzha a court declined to de-
 clare her dead but ordered the distribution of her estate. The former CIO Deputy
 Director-General, with whom Guzha had a romantic relationship before her dis-
 appearance, and who was rumored to have been involved in her disappearance, died
 during the year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and cruel and inhuman treatment. There were
 no credible reports of torture. The ZRP service charter and improved training have
 
 
 386
 resulted in markedly better treatment of suspects and the public. However, there
 are still reports of occasional police brutality. In July police beat 20 female residents
 of a Harare housing complex and arrested 45 for alleged prostitution and loitering.
 Most of the women arrested were married and in their own residences at the time.
 Only one Government official, independent Member of Parliament Margaret Dongo,
 challenged the arrest and beating of these women. There have also been frequent
 reports that police beat detainees at Mbare Musika police station in one of the high-
 est crime areas in Harare. A police officer also publicly beat a female bus inspector
 for refusing to give him a bribe. There has been no public Government reaction to
 this beating.
 The Government has not actively pursued past allegations of torture, nor pros-
 ecuted CIO or ZRP officers for such abuses. The CIO continued to refuse to pay
 court-ordered damages to a 1990 torture victim.
 Prison conditions remained harsh and have improved little since the CCJP issued
 its 1993 report describing extreme overcrowding, shortages of clothing, and poor
 sanitary conditions. Overcrowding and poor sanitation aggravated outbreaks of chol-
 era, diarrhea, and AIDS-related illnesses. An average of 25 prisoners a month died
 in custody, 18 from AIDS-related illnesses, in 1996 (the last year for which statistics
 are available). The Government has established a successful community service sen-
 tencing program to try to alleviate prison overcrowding. The Legal Resource Foun-
 dation, in cooperation with the prison service, established a human rights training
 program for prison officials. Officials who mistreat prisoners are routinely punished.
 The Government permits international human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions. The law
 requires that police inform an arrested person of the charges against him before he
 is taken into custody. Warrants of arrest issued by the courts are required exept
 in cases of serious crimes or where there is the risk of evidence disappearing. The
 Ministry of Home Affairs pays an average of $150,000 (Z$1.5 million) each year in
 damages in wrongful arrest cases.
 Although a preliminary hearing before a magistrate is required within 48 hours
 of an arrest (or 96 hours over a weekend), the law is often disregarded if a person
 does not have legal representation. A 1992 amendment to the Criminal Procedures
 and Evidence Act substantially reduced the power of magistrates to rant bail with-
 out the consent of the Attorney General or his agents. In practice, however, a cir-
 cular issued by the Attorney General giving a general authority to grant bail has
 lessened the negative impact of the rle. High Court judges grant bail independ-
 ently.
 ThKe Government still enjoys a wide range of legal powers under the Official Se-
 crets Act and the Law and Order Maintenance Act (LOMA). Originally promulgated
 30 years ago and widely used in the past to prosecute political opponents of the Gov-
 ernment, the LOMA gives extensive powers to the police, the Minister of Home Af-
 fairs, and the President to address political and security crimes that are not clearly
 defined. The Government invoked the LOMA in July to ban demonstrations by
 former combatants who demanded compensation for wartime injuries. The ban was
 not vigorously enforced against the war veterans and was lifted after 2 weeks. In
 December opposition leader M.P. Ndabadingi Sithole was convicted and sentenced
 to 2 years under the LOMA for conspiring to assassinate President Mugabe in 1995.
 At year's end, no appeal had been filed nor was there any government reaction to
 the judge's call for a pardon in light of Sithole's age, poor health, and evidence of
 the Government's prior notice of the assassination plans.
 The Government proposed a security bill to repeal the LOMA; however, the draft
 bill contains several negative elements or similarities to the LOMA, including vague
 definitions of political and security crimes, harsh penalties for failure to report the
 acts of others, and restrictions on freedom of assembly, speech, and association. Fol-
 lowing unprecedented public debate on the bill and subsequent consultations with
 legal, democracy, and human rights organizations, the Government withdrew the
 bill for further revisions.
 According to the Government, the total prison population has been reduced to
 18,000 from 22,000 in 1996, due in large part to alternative sentencing under the
 community service program for youth offenders. The Government also reports that
 6,000 prisoners are pretrial detainees. Detainees spent an average of 6 months in-
 carcerated before their trials because of a critical shortage of magistrates and court
 interpreters.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary has a well-deserved reputation for independence. However,
 on occasion the executive branch refuses to abide by judicial decisions. The Cus-
 
 
 tomary Law and Local Courts Act of 1990 created a unitary court system, consisting
 of headmen's courts, chiefs' courts, magistrates' courts, the High Court, and the Su-
 preme Court. With this restructuring, civil and customary law cases may be heard
 at all levels of the judiciary, including the Supreme Court.
 Judges are appointed for life and can be removed from the bench only for gross
 misconduct. They are not discharged or transferred for political reasons. Mag-
 istrates, who are part of the civil service rather than the judiciary, hear the vast
 majority of cases and are sometimes subject to political pressure. Military courts
 deal with disciplinary or court martial proceedings. Police courts, which can sen-
 tence a police officer to confinement to camp or demotion, handle disciplinary and
 misconduct cases. Trials in both these latter courts meet internationally accepted
 standards for fair trials; defendants in these courts have the right to appeal to the
 Supreme Court. All levels of the judiciary often make rulings unpopu ar with the
 Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary rigorously
 enforces this right. Every defendant has the right to a lawyer of his choosing. How-
 ever, well over 90 percent of defendants in magistrates' courts go unrepresented. In
 criminal cases, an indigent defendant may apply to have the Government provide
 an attorney, but this is rarely done and rarely granted. However, in capital cases
 the Government provides an attorney for all defendants unable to afford one. Liti-
 gants in civil cases can request legal assistance from the NGO Legal Resources
 Foundation, but no longer from the government-established Citizens Advice Bureau,
 which was eliminated due to budget constraints. All litigants are represented in the
 High Court. The Supreme Court has instructed magistrates to ensure that unrepre-
 sented defendants fully understand their rights and to weigh any mitigating cir-
 cumstances in criminal cases, whether or not the accused presents them as part of
 his defense.
 The right to appeal exists in all cases and is automatic in cases in which the
 death penalty is imposed. Trials are open to the public except in certain security
 cases. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and the right to present wit-
 nesses and question witnesses against them. Defendants and their attorneys gen-
 erally have access to Government-held evidence relevant to their cases. The legal
 system does not discriminate against women or minorities.
 The Government generally abided by court decisions even when it was strongly
 opposed to the rulings. However, the Government routinely delayed payment of
 court costs or judgments awarded against it. For example, the CIO continued its re-
 fusal to pay damages awarded by the High Court to a former opposition party offi-
 cial whom CIO agents had tortured in 1990.
 Legal and human rights activists continued to criticize the Government's efforts
 to adopt constitutional amendments detrimental to human rights protections. For
 example, Amendment 11 (1992) changed the Constitution to allow corporal punish-
 ment of minors after the Supreme Court ruled that caning of minors constituted
 cruel and inhuman punishment. Amendment 14 (1996), which denies both men and
 women the right to confer automatic residency on their foreign spouses, was passed
 in response to a 1994 Supreme Court ruling declaring that women should have the
 same rights as men to confer residency and citizenship on their spouses (see Section
 2.d.). Amendments to the Constitution are not ratified by the public but are subject
 to the ZANU-PF-dominated Parliament's approval only.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or cor-
 respondence. Human rights groups are concerned that Amendment 14 erodes these
 constitutional rights by repealing Section 11 of the Constitution which specifies pro-
 tection for the right to the privacy of one's home and from the compulsory acquisi-
 tion of property without compensation. Although Government authorities generally
 respect citiz ens' right to privacy and violations are subject to legal sanction, it is
 widely known that the Government sometimes monitors private correspondence and
 telephones, particularly international communications.
 The need for land reform is almost universally accepted; however, there are prob-
 lems with implementation of the 1992 Land Acquisition Act (Land Act). Under the
 Land Act farmers whose lands have been designated for acquisition may appeal only
 the amount of compensation, not the initial decision to acquire their farms. In No-
 vember the Government said that it would not compensate for land, but only for
 improvements on the land, a position not sustainable under the act. In the past, the
 act was implemented largely along racial lines; the Government stated that black-
 owned commercial farms would not be subject to acquisition. However, in November
 owners of 1,471 farms, some of which are black-owned, were notified their land
 would be acquired by compulsory means in 1997. In some cases, land was appar-
 
 
 388
 ently targeted for acquisition to achieve political goals. In December, 1,420 adminis-
 trative appeals were filed with the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture by owners of
 the targeted farms, challenging the notices to acquire their lands. By years end, the
 Government had not acquired any of the newly identified land. Opposition party
 leader M.P. Ndabadingi Sithole continued his legal battle with the Government over
 its 1993 acquisition ofhis farm.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion but allows for legislation to limit this freedom in the "interest of defense, public
 safety, public order, state economic interests, public morality, and public health." Al-
 though the independent press is increasingly open and critical of the Government,
 there is some degree of.self-censorship in private media and a high degree in the
 Government-controlled press. For example, the Catholic Commission for Justice and
 Peace and Legal Resources Foundation's detailed report on the 1980's Matabeleland
 crisis was distributed to government and private papers. However, only one private
 paper commented on the substance of the report. Self-censorship is aggravated by
 anti-defamation laws that make no distinction between public and private persons.
 In addition an extremely broad Official Secrets Act makes it a crime to divulge "any
 information acquired in the course of official duties."
 The Government has shown a modest increase in tolerance for private media criti-
 cism of official corruption during the Chidyausiku Commission's investigation into
 fraud and malfeasance in the management of the war victims compensation fund.
 The major print media (seven English language newspapers and one local-lan-
 guage tabloid) belong to the Mass Media Trust, a holding company heavily influ-
 enced by the government ruling party. The Ministry of Information controls the
 Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency wire service. The Government influences main-
 stream media through indirect ownership, editorial appointments, directives to edi-
 tors, and removal of -wayward editors. In December a popular radio broadcaster was
 dismissed following her refusal to cease airing public calls reporting on the then-
 ongoing demonstrations inHarare against new taxes to fund the war veteran's com-
 pensation package. The Government controls the only two daily newspapers, the
 Chronicle and the Herald. The small independent press consists primarily of three
 weekly and three monthly magazines. They carefully monitor government policies
 and open their pages to opposition critics. Other minor independent publications
 exist with fewer than 3,000 subscribers.
 All radio and television channels are entirely government owned and controlled.
 Following a Supreme Court ruling that the Government's monopoly on telecommuni-
 cations was unconstitutional because it interfered with the right to freedom of ex-
 pression, the Government granted a broadcasting license to private television sta-
 tion Joy Television (Joy TV). However, Joy TV's independence has been questioned
 because of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Commission's (ZBC) apparent favoritism
 both in granting Joy a license, which was denied to earlier bidders, and in specula-
 tion over possible ZBC editorial control of Joy programming. President Mugabe's
 nephew, Leo Mugabe, reportedly has financial ties to Joy TV. Two other broadcast-
 ing stations, MABC and LDM, was licensed in September and November, respec-
 tively. Like Joy TV, the two stations lease air time from ZBC; all three stations are
 likely to face difficulties due to limited advertising revenue.
 Books and films are subject to review by the Zimbabwe Board of Censors. A film
 on the liberation struggle, which the National War Veteran's Association claimed
 was offensive and which was seized by the police in 1996, is now publicly available.
 Following the controversial banning of the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe
 (GALZ) exhibit on AIDS counseling and prevention at the 1996 Harare Inter-
 national Book Fair, which the High Court overturned, there was no GALZ exhibit
 at the 1997 fair.
 The University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Amendment Act and the National Council for
 Higher Education Act curtail academic freedom by restricting the independence of
 umversities, making them subject to government influence, and extending the dis-
 ciplinary powers of the university authorities against staff and students. After pro-
 testing government delays in disbursement of their subsidies, UZ students were vic-
 tims of teargas and arrest; they were subsequently released.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly and association for political and nonpolitical organizations, in-
 cluding a broad spectrum of economic, social, professional, and after protesting Gov-
 ernment delays in disbursement of their subsidies recreational activities. Permits
 are not required for meetings or demonstrations. The Government was sharply criti-
 cized by human rights, democracy, and labor leaders for its use of excessive force
 in Harare to prevent a 1-day planned national demonstration in December against
 
 
 new taxes to fund the war veterans compensation packages. The Zimbabwe Con-
 gress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) had obtained a court order prohibiting the Govern-
 ment from interfering with its plans for a peaceful demonstration. However, violence
 erupted in Harare early on the day of the demonstration when police used tear gas,
 dogs, and sticks to disperse people who had congregated at assembly points.
 The formation of unions and political parties is not restricted. Organizations are
 generally free of governmental interference as long as their activities are viewed as
 nonpolitical. In a case brought by a women's nongovernmental organization (NGO)
 the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional those sections of the Private Voluntary
 Organizations Act of 1995, which had empowered the Minister of Social Welfare,
 Labor, and Public Service to suspend the executive body or "any member of the ex-
 ecutive committee of an organization and to appoint persons to manage the affairs
 of the organization for a specified time. Following the ZCTU's successful national
 work stoppage in December, in which the organization urged the support of employ-
 ers, government media attacked the ZCTU's leadership for allegedly aiding white
 employers to undermine the Government's land policy. Prior to the Supreme Court's
 ruling, several new NGO's decided to set up their organizations as "associations"
 connected with established NGO's so that their executive bodies would not be sub-
 ject to government interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice.
 In response to a 1994 Supreme Court ruling that Zimbabwe's law allowing men,
 but not women, to confer residency rights on their foreign born spouses was dis-
 criminatory and unconstitutional, the Government proposed a constitutional amend-
 ment establishing the practice in the Constitution. After an outcry from civic, par-
 ticularly women's, organizations, the Government withdrew the amendment and
 proposed a revised bill that allows neither men nor women to confer citizenship on
 their foreign born spouses automatically. Parliament passed the amendment in Oc-
 tober 1996, but implementing immigration regulations have not yet been promul-
 gated.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. Zimbabwe provides first asylum. According to the Government, 223 asylum
 seekers were given refugee status, and at least five persons were denied first asy-
 lum in 1997. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim
 to refugee status. There were reportedly 1,564 refugees in Zimbabwe from more
 than 20 countries; the largest groups consisted of 226 Rwandans, 166 Congolese
 (Democratic Republic of the Congo), 138 Burundians, 138 Somalis, and 137 Ango-
 lan,.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although citizens have the legal right to change their Government democratically;
 the politi~cal process continued to be tilted in favor of the ruling party. However,
 early next year two recent parliamentary changes will go into effect that will allow
 for increased access to the political process for opposition candidates and potentially
 increase the size of the electorate. The Political Parties Finance Amendment Act
 (PPF Act) will no longer base government financial grants on the number of mem-
 bers already in Parliament, but on a percentage of votes received in the lastgeneral
 election, with a minimum of 5 percent required. The new Local Authorities Election
 Laws Amendment Act (Election Act) amended and, in effect, replaced the Election
 Act, Rural District Council, and Urban Council Acts to eliminate restrictions on poor
 people's right to vote in local elections. The act abolished the provision in the pre-
 vious Council Acts which disqualified from voting those who were not long-term
 residents or property owners in an area. It also abolished the old Rural District
 Council Act provision which gave multiple votes to property owners by allowing
 them to delegate voting rights based on their corporate ownership in a district,
 while retaining a personal vote.
 Governent critics have charged that the ruling ZANU-PF party delayed the De-
 cember 28 and 29 mayoral election in Chitungwiza to allow the ZANU-PF's can-
 didat more time to mount a successful campaign in the    e of strong opposition
 from an independent. The ZANU-PF candidate won the election by 1,641 votes with
 less than 7 percent of the total registered voters participating. President Mugabe
 and his ZAN    e-PF party remained the dominant political force within the country.
 
 
 390
 President Mugabe won reelection in March 1996 with little opposition in an elec-
 tion considered generally free and fair by hundreds of NGO monitors. In the 1995
 parliamentary general elections, ZANU-PF captured 117 of %he 120 popularly elect-
 ed seats. The 10 chiefs who sit as Members of Parliament (M.P.s) are elected by
 their peers. The President also appoints 8 provincial governors, who sit as M.P.s,
 and 12 nonconstituency M.P.s. Alf30 of these persons are ZANU-PF members. The
 net result of several constitutional amendments has been to consolidate the power
 of the executive branch and to limit the independence of M.P.s.
 There is no effective Parliamentary opposition, and the legislature remained sub-
 ordinate to the executive branch. However, in 1997 Parliament had greater influ-
 ence on the content of, proposed legislation in ruling party caucus debates and dur-
 ing the committee phase than in previous years. There are many small opposition
 parties. However, their growth was inhibited by a variety of factors, including the
 Political Parties Finance Act (PPFA) (sections of which were ruled unconstitutional
 by the Supreme Court), the Government's virtual monopoly of the electronic media,
 and credible reports of CIO harassment of opposition and independent candidates
 and their supporters. In addition to serious institutional problems, however, the op-
 position parties' lack of organization and leadership played a significant role in their
 poor electoral showing.
 In September the Supreme Court held unconstitutional those provisions of the
 PPFA that provided government funding only to parties that had more than 15 Par-
 liamentary seats, effectively giving all public funding to the ruling party. In October
 Parliament passed the PPFA, which authorizes the Government to fund any reg-
 istered party that obtains 5 percent of the votes cast. The court noted that "in poor-
 er societies, where private funding is either not available or offers inadequate assist-
 ance, the inability to obtain state funding, because the qualification is set too high,
 causes a reduction of the effective freedom of expression of political parties." While
 the Supreme Court did not order a specific alternative criteria for party funding,
 the Minister of Justice said that he would propose an amendment in Parliament
 that would base it on the total number of votes cast.
 The Supreme Court rejected an opposition party challenge to the 1996 Gweru
 mayoral elections, called for by the President before Parliament established the post
 of executive mayor, ruling that Parliament's subsequent enactment of the required
 legislation validated the election.
 There are institutional problems with the management and supervision of elec-
 tions. Although the Ministry of Justice technically administers the Electoral Act, the
 Registrar General's Office fails under the Ministry of Home Affairs. With a meager
 budget and a tiny staff seconded from the Ministry of Justice, the Electoral Super-
 visory Commission lacks the institutional capacity to oversee all of the country's
 polling stations. Nor do commissioners have the executive authority to order that
 an irregularity be corrected. Despite an attempt to computerize the voters' roll, it
 contains a very large number of redundancies or errors, including misspellings, mul-
 tiple entries, and names of the deceased. No date has been set for rural district elec-
 tions because of a conflict between government officials and opposition parties over
 the Government's proposed use of a national versus local voters' roll for all elections.
 Women participate in politics without legal restriction. However, according to
 local women's groups, husbands-particularly in rural areas-commonly force their
 wives to vote for the husband's preferred candidates.
 Twenty of the 150 M.P.'s are women, including the Deputy Speaker of Parliament.
 Three cabinet ministers with portfolios, three ministers of state, and three deputy
 ministers are women. All major ethnic groups are represented in Parliament and
 in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Government permits local civic and human rights groups to operate,
 it monitors their activities closely, in particular those of the Catholic Commission
 for Justice and Peace and Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS).
 Other groups that promote human rights include the Legal Resource Foundation,
 the Southern African Federation of the Disabled, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human
 Rights, the Child and Law Project, the Zimbabwe Women Lawyer's Association, and
 the Southern African Human Rights Research and Documentation Trust. The Foun-
 dation for Democracy in Zimbabwe (FODEZI) was established in July as a watchdog
 organization to support independent candidates. Amnesty International, Trans-
 parency International, and the International Committee of the Red Cross operate
 in Zimbabwe. The Government does not discourage representatives from inter-
 national human rights groups from visiting Zimbabwe.
 
 
 391
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that "every person in Zimbabwe" is entitled to fun-
 damental rights whatever his race, tribe, place of origin, political opinions, color,
 creed, or sex.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is common
 and crosses all racial and economic lines. It extends throughout the country, and
 at times results in death. According to Women in Law and Development in Africa
 (WILDAF), domestic violence accounts for more than 60 percent of murder cases in
 the Harare High Court. A women's rights organization, the Musasa Project, con-
 ducted a 3-week study in all the districts of Midlands province on domestic violence
 against women in which 37 percent of the women interviewed said that they had
 been sexually abused. Thirty-two percent said that they had been physically abused
 since the age of 16. Human rights groups have noted that increased training has
 improved police community relations officers' handling of these cases. There were
 approximately 2,000 cases of rape reported in the first 6 months of 1997, up from
 1,400 cases in the first half of 1996. Women's groups and the police believe the ac-
 tual number is much higher, but the majority of cases go unreported because of the
 social stigma of rape. Men cases come to court, lengthy sentences for rape and wife
 beating are generally imposed. However, a "binding over" order (an order to appear
 in court to respond to an accusation of violent behavior) is issued based only on ac-
 tual physical abuse and not on threats of violence. In addition, the courts do not
 have the power to oust an abusive spouse from a matrimonial home. In a case that
 is attracting much public attention, Canaan Banana, Zimbabwe's first president
 (1980-1987) has been charged with sexual abuse arising out of allegations of forcible
 sodomy made by a former aide. This is the first case involving a prominent public
 figure accused of sexual abuse. The case has been referred to the Supreme Court
 for a ruling on the issue of pretrial prejudice from the publicity. At year's end, the
 court had not ruled in the case.
 Since independence the Government has enacted major laws aimed at enhancing
 women's rights and countering certain traditional practices that discriminate
 against women. However, women remain disadvantaged in Zimbabwean society. fl-
 literacy, economic dependency, and prevailing social norms prevent rural women in
 particular from ombating societal discrimination. Despite legal prohibitions, women
 are still vulnerable to entrenched customary practices, including the practice of
 pledging a young woman to marriage with a partner not of her choosing; the custom
 of forcing a widow to marry her late husband's brother; and the custom of offering
 a young girl as compensatory payment in interfamily disputes.
 Although two women preside as chiefs in Mashonalan  a dispute erupted in 1996
 over the ascension of a female chief, sanctioned by the President, in Matabeleland
 South. Provincial Governor Welshman Mabhena declared that "under Ndebele cus-
 tom a woman can never preside over a man. It is a mockery of our culture." How-
 ever, the female chief in Matabeleland remains in office.
 The Legal Age of Majority Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act recognize women's
 right to own property independently of their husbands or fathers. However, while
 unmarried women may own property in their own names, women married under
 customary law are not allowed to own property jointly with their husbands. The Ad-
 ministration of Estates Amendment Act, which came into effect in October, removes
 inheritance laws unfavorable to widows. Women's groups have praised the amend-
 ment as a major step toward ending the unfair and unequal distribution of inherited
 assets for women. The new inheritance amendment is awaiting the President's sig-
 .nature to become law. Divorce and maintenance laws are favorable toward women,
 but women generally lack awareness of their rights under the law.
 Although labor legislation prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of
 gender, women are concentrated in the lower echelons of the work force and com-
 monly face sexual harassment in the workplace.
 Several active women's rights groups in Zimbabwe, including WILDAF, the
 Musasa Project, the Zimbabwe Women lawyers' Association, and the Women's Ac-
 tion Group, concentrate on improving women's knowledge of their legal rights, in-
 creasing women's economic power, and combating domestic violence. There is no
 Government office specifically responsible for women's affairs.
 Children.-The Government continued to demonstrate its strong commitment to
 children's rights and welfare through a system of primary health care and education
 overseen by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. However, budget cuts and
 the lack of adequate attention to AIDS prevention are eroding the Government's ca-
 pacity to address children's needs in these areas. The Children's Protection and
 Adoption Act, the Guardianship of Minors Act, and the Deceased Person's Mainte-
 nance Act all protect the legal rights of minor children. While there is no compul-
 
 
 sory education, Zimbabwe has made considerable progress in providing education for
 girls, and overall primary school attendance has increased by more than 400 percent
 since independence. About 93 percent of children reach grade 5. With the reintro-
 duction of school fees in Urban schools and rural secondary schools, however, enroll-
 ment has declined. If a family is unable t pay tuition costs, it is most often female
 children who leave school. There are an estimated 12,000 homeless street children
 in Zimbabwe, many of them the children of former Mozambican refugees or AIDS
 orphans. Although it is not known yet whether the statistics reflect the fact that
 more cases are actually occurring or only that more are being reported, child abuse,
 including incest (long taboo in Zimbabwean society), infanticide, child abandonment,
 and rape is increasing but still is not widespread. There are reports of child labor
 (see Section 6.d.). The Ministry of Justice's Vulnerable Witnesses Committee estab-
 lished victim-friendly courts to improve the judicial system's handling of child vic-
 tims of rape and sexual abuse. The criminal justice system has special provisions
 for dealing with juvenile offenders.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is rarely per-
 formed in Zimbabwe. However, according to press reports, the initiation rites prac-
 ticed by the small Remba ethnic group in Midlands Province include infibulation,
 the most extreme form of FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-President Mugabe appointed a disability activist to Par-
 liament in 1995 to represent the needs of the disabled. The Disabled Persons Act
 of 1992 specifically prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in em-
 ployment, admission to public places, or provision of services and is viewed by advo-
 cates of the disabled as model legislation. In practice, however, the lack of resources
 for training and education severely hampers the ability of disabled people to com-
 pete for scarce jobs. Although the act stipulates that Government buildings should
 be accessible to disabled persons, for budgetary reasons this is rarely implemented.
 Disabled people face particularly harsh customary discrimination, According to tra-
 ditional belief, people with disabilities are considered bewitched, and reports of dis-
 abled children being hidden when visitors arrive are common.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Shona ethnic group makes up 77 per-
 cent of the population, Ndebele 14 percent, Kalanga 5 percent, whites 2 percent, and
 other ethnic groups 2 percent. Government services are provided on a nondiscrim-
 inatory basis, and the Government has sought to expand and improve the previously
 "whites only" infrastructure in urban areas to provide health and social services to
 all citizens. Nevertheless, in social terms Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified
 country. While schools and churches are all legally integrated, social interaction
 among racial groups is rare. Although intertribal relations are generally very good,
 the disproportionate number of Shona speaking teachers and headmasters in
 Matabeleland schools remained a sensitive issue.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1985 Labor Relations Act (LRA) provides pri-
 vate sector workers with freedom of association and the right to elect their own rep-
 resentatives, publish newsletters, and set programs and policies that reflect the po-
 litical and economic interests of labor. Workers are free to form or join unions with-
 out prior authorization. The LRA allows for the existence of multiple unions per in-
 dustry, provided that each is registered with the Ministry of Public Service, Labor,
 and Social Welfare (MPSLSW). While the Government may deregister individual
 unions, the High Court has ruled that the LRA does not give the Minister the power
 to suspend or deregister the national umbrella labor confederation, the Zimbabwe
 Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
 Approximately 20 percent of the formal sector work force belongs to the 33 unions
 that form the ZCTU. ZCTU officers are elected by delegates of affiliated trade
 unions at congresses held every 5 years. While the Government encouraged the
 ZCTU's formation, anticipatingthat it would form the labor arm of ZANU-PF, it no
 longer directly influences ZCTU actions. The Government and the ZCTU often clash
 on economic policy, particularly the Economic Structural Adjustment Program
 (ESAP). The Government usually does not consult either the ZCTU or employers be-
 fore implementing policy decisions that affect the workplace. This lack of consulta-
 tion often results in reactions that disrupt labor relations, thereby promoting uncer-
 tainty and even strikes. Following the Government's efforts in December to impose
 huge income and other tax increases without consultation, the ZCTU organized a
 nationwide, 1-day work stoppage, which was described as the most successful indus-
 trial action in Zimbabwe's history. While thousands demonstrated peacefully in
 most cities throughout the country, the aggressive police tactics (see Section 2.b.)
 led to street violence in Harare.The ZCTU secretary general who organized the
 
 
 393
 work stoppage was attacked and badly beaten in a raid on his office 2 days later.
 At least one suspect was arrested for this attack by year's end.
 The LRA allows for the formation of multiple national federations. A second um-
 brella labor organization, the Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions (ZFTU), was
 launched in October 1996 with the stated purpose of providing an alternative of the
 ZCTU. The new organization states that its goal is to work in collaboration with
 the Government, and it is openly critical of the ZCTU. The ZFTU's origin, leader-
 ship, and membership remained unclear at year's end. Although key personnel have
 not been publicly identified, most observers believe that they are principally former
 senior ZCTU leaders, some of whom were involuntarily separated from that organi-
 zation. No ZFTU activity has been observed.
 Public servants and their associations, the Public Service Association (PSA), the
 Zimbabwe Teachers Association (ZIMTA), and the Zimbabwe Nurses Association
 .(ZINA), are not covered by the provisions of the IRA. Instead, their conditions of
 employment are provided for under the Constitution. Although civil servants are
 constitutionally barred from forming unions, in 1995 ZIMTA stated its intention to
 affiliate with the ZCTU and the PSA in August. All public servants are deemed es-
 sential and are prohibited from striking. Nonetheless, a nationwide, civil servant
 strike rocked the country in August 1996, followed by a public sector doctors and
 nurses strike in October 1996. Although the Government declared the strikes illegal,
 arrested worker representatives, and ordered wholesale dismissals, many were ulti-
 mately rehired. However, despite promises to the contrary strike representatives
 were not allowed to return to their jobs. Public service wage increases above the
 1997 inflation rate preempted a repeat of the 1996 strikes, but they helped set the
 stage for a series of private sector wage negotiation strikes that were popularly de-
 scribed as the "winter of discontent."
 The Labor Relations Amendment Act (LRAA) of 1992 specifies that workers may
 establish independent worker committees, which exist side by side with unions, in
 each plant. Worker committees must also be registered with the MPSLSW, which
 is free to refuse registration. Trade union officials believe that the formation of
 worker committees was an attempt to dilute union authority. However, the ineffec-
 tiveness of worker committees demonstrated the need for the experienced worker
 representation of the established trade unions.
 The International Conference of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has criticized
 Zimbabwean labor legislation for giving "wide scope to the authorities to declare
 that a given enterprise or industry constitutes an essential service, and then impose
 a ban (on strikes) on it." The authority to reclassify a previously nonessential serv-
 ice as essential was not used in 1997. Workers in sectors deemed "nonessential"
 have the right to strike, provided the union advises the Government 2 weeks in ad-
 vance of its intention to do so. The Government has often declared strikes illegal
 on the basis of failure to give timely notice. If the MPSLSW finds that administra-
 tive requirements were not met for a strike, it can issue a disposal order that gives
 the employer the right to dismiss striking workers. There were no reports that this
 occurred in 1997. More than 100 collective job actions were reported during the
 year.
 The ZCTU and its officials are free to associate with international labor organiza
 tions and do so actively. The ZCTU is affiliated with the ICFTU and the Southern
 African Trade Union Coordinating Council.
 The American Federation of Labor/Congress of Industrial Organizations's Amer-
 ican Centre for International Labour Solidarity maintains a regional office based in
 Harare.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The LRA provides workers
 with the right to organize. As originally enacted, this act was silent on the right
 to bargain collectively. However, the 1992 LRAA permits unions to bargain collec-
 tively over wages. Worker committees, which are by law not organizationally part
 of the unions or the ZCTU, are empowered to negotiate with the management of
 a particular plant on the conditions of labor and codes of conduct in the workplace,
 except for wages.
 Collective bargaining wage negotiations take place on an industry wide basis be-
 tween the relevant union and employer organizations sitting on joint employment
 boards or councils. These bodies submit their agreements to the Registrar in the
 MPSLSW for approval. The Government retains the power to veto agreements that
 it believes would harm the economy. However, it did not directly involve itself in
 labor negotiations unless requested to do so by one of the two parties. When no
 trade union represents a specific sector, representatives of the organized workers,
 such as the professional associations, meet with the employer associations, under
 the mediation of labor officers from the MPSLSW. Public sector wages are deter-
 mined by the Salary Service Department of the MPSLSW, subject to the approval
 
 
 of an independent Public Service Commission (PSC). Each year PSC officials meet
 with PSA representatives to review wages and benefits. These reviews result in a
 recommendation that is forwarded to the MPSLSW. The Minister is not required
 by law to accept the recommendation.
 Employees designated as being in managerial positions are excluded from union
 membership and thus from the collective bargaining process. There were some re-
 ports that firms designated excessive numbers of employees as being in managerial
 positions in order to exclude them from the collective bargaining exercises.
 The LRA prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members.
 Complaints of such discrimination am referred to labor relations officers and may
 subsequently be adjudicated by the Labor Relations Tribunal (LRT). Such com-
 plaints are handled under the mechanism for resolving cases involving "unfair labor
 practices." The determining authority may direct that workers fired due to
 antiunion discrimination should be reinstated, although this has yet to be utilized
 he LRAA streamlined the procedure for adjudicating disputes by strengthening
 the LRT. Now, labor relations officers hear a dispute; their decision may be ap-
 pealed to regional labor relations officers, after which the LRT may hear the case.
 Ultimately, it may be appealed to the Supreme Court. In 1993 the Government
 filled long vacant positions on the LRT, but at year's end the LRT boards were still
 not fully staffed.
 The Export Processing Zones Act states the LRA shall not apply to workers in
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 and bonded labor by children. There were no reports that it occurred (see Section
 6.d.). Compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there were no reports that it was
 practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded labor by children. There were no reports that
 it occurred (see Section 1.c. ). Legislation passed in March 1997 bans employment
 of children under the age of 12 and restricts employment of those between the ages
 of 12 and 17 to light work during school holidays for periods not exceeding 6 hours
 per day. Light work is defined as work not likely to prejudice the education, health,
 safety, rest or social, physical, or mental development of a child. All hazardous em-
 ployent, overtime and night shift work is banned for those under the age of 18.
 Chlrnwork in the agricultural sector, and there were reports that children
 worked in the domestic worker sector, and worked as car-watchers on the streets.
 Although schooling is not compulsory, over 90 percent of children attend school
 through grade 5 (see Section 5).
 Child labor in the formal agricultural sector, such as on tea and coffee planta-
 tions, reportedly involves children working in the fields after school during the
 planting and harvesting seasons and full-time during school holidays. Long hours
 are common. Children often work alongside their parents and their working condi-
 tions approximate those of adults. While some form of child labor or child work on
 large commercial farms is widespread, agricultural organizations maintain that the
 labor performed is not exploitative, involuntary, contrary to law, or outside of cul-
 tural norms that allow children to engage in field work with their families. Anec-
 dotal evidence suggests some school schedules and calendars are tailored to allow
 children to work in. the fields during busy farming periods. Economic hardship often
 makes child labor imperative for families to make ends meet.
 The AIDS epidemic is resulting in increased numbers of orphans, street children,
 and child laborers. Similarly, increased economic hardship among the poor results
 in more children working. Exploitation of children as domestic workers is widely dis-
 cussed, but concrete information is not available.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The maximum legal workweek is 54 hours, and
 the law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest period per week. Working condi-
 tions are regulated by the Government on an industry-specific basis. The Constitu-
 tion empowers the PS0 to set conditions of employment in the public sector. Govern-
 ment regulations for each of the 22 industrial sectors continue to specify minimum
 wages, hours, holidays, and required safety measures. In recent years, in an effort
 to opt out of the wage bargaining system, the Government mandated wage param-
 eters and specified minimum wage increases only for domestics and gardeners. Due
 to an ineffective monitoring system, many such workers are remunerated below the
 The minimum monthly wage for domestics and gardeners of approximately $35
 (Z$450 and Z$400 respectively) is the de facto minimum wage for other workers. In
 most instances, the employer must provide housing and food to workers or allow-
 ances for such. On commercial farms, the employer may provide schooling for work-
 
 
 395
 era' children. The minimum wage is not sufficient to sustain a decent standard of
 living for a worker and family. The ZCTU pegs Zimbabwe's poverty datum line at
 $200 per month (Z$2,400). Workers in sectors covered under collective bargaining
 agreements received wage -increases averaging 28 percent following numerous
 strikes (inflation hovers at about 21 percent). In theory, labor relations officers from
 the MPSLSW are assigned to monitor developments in each plant to assure that
 government minimum wage policy and occupational health and safety regulations
 are observed. In practice, these offices are understaffed, cannot afford to routinely
 inspect workplaces, and must rely on voluntary compliance and reporting by em-
 ployers.
 Approximately 200 work-related deaths and 12,000 occupational injuries were re-
 ported in the first half of 1997. Many of the basic legal protections do not apply to
 the vast majority of farm, mine, and domestic workers. Unions charge that there
 are no general standards for the work environment, such as threshold limits for
 manually lifted weights or conditions for pregnant workers. Health and safety
 standards .are determined only on an industry-specific basis. The Government inter-
 venes on a selected basis (and often seemingly in response to~the mast recent acci-
 dent) and sets standards by regulation in -some industries. In theory workers have
 a legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy
 to continued employment; in practice they risk the loss of their livelihood.
