 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa, a small Pacific island country with a population of approximatel
 210,000, is a parliamentary democracy but with certain concessions to Samoan cul-
 tural practices. The Constitution provides for a Samoan Head of State, a unicameral
 (Legislature composed of Matai family heads) elected by universal suffrage, an inde-
 pendent judiciary, protection of Samoan land and traditional titles, and guarantees
 of fundamental rights and freedoms. Executive authority is vested in the Head of
 State, with the Government administered by the Cabinet, consisting of the Prime
 Minister and 12 ministers chosen by him. All laws passed by the Legislative Assem-
 bly need the approval of the Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II, who holds the
 position for life. His successors will be elected by the Legislative Assembly for 5-
 year terms.
 Western Samoa does not have a defense force. The small national police force is
 firmly under the control of the Government but has little impact beyond Apia, the
 capital city. Enforcement of rules and security within individual villages is vested
 in the Fono (Council of Matai), which settles most internal disputes. Judgments by
 the Fono t sually involve fines or, more rarely, banishment from the village.
 Western Samoa is a poor country with a market-based economy in which over 60
 percent of the work force is employed in the agricultural sector. Coconut products
 and kava are the principal exports. The small industrial sector is dominated by a
 Japanese factory which assembles automotive electrical parts for export. The Gov-
 ernment has initiated a major push for tourism. Per capita gross domestic product
 is $1,100 per year. Western Samoa is heavily dependent on foreign aid and on re-
 mittances sent to family members by the more than 100,000 Samoans living over-
 seas, mostly in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 it brought sedition charges against two leaders of an antitax movement over state-
 ments made during a protest rally. The charges were subsequently dismissed by the
 judiciary for lack of evidence. Principal human rights abuses arise out of political
 discrimination against women and nonmatai, and violence against women and chil-
 dren. Societal pressures and customary law may interfere with the ability to conduct
 fair trials, and there are some restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, and reli-
 gion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings in 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 
 
 748
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials practiced
 them. However, villages are controlled by customary law, and the Fonos may mete
 out banishment when deemed necessary. This is one of the harshest forms of pun-
 ishment in this collective society.
 Although jail conditions are fairly basic so far as food and sanitation are con-
 cerned, there have been no reports of abuses in prisons. While there are human
 rights groups operating in Western Samoa, the question of monitoring of prison con-
 ditions by them has not arisen. Prison visits by family members and church rep-
 resentatives are permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prhiits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The law assures the right to a fair public trial
 and this is honored by the official court system. However, many civil and criminal
 matters are not handled by Western-style courts but b village Fonos, which differ
 considerably both in their decisionmaking style and in the number of matai involved
 in the decisions. The Village Fono Act of 1990 gives legal recognition to the decisions
 of the Fono and provides for limited recourse of appeal to the Lands and Titles
 Courts and to the Supreme Court. In a 1993 court case, a village Fono ordered the
 property of a villager to be burned after he had disobeyed and flouted village rules.
 An angry mob killed the villager and burned all his belongings. The villager who
 had actually shot the victim was tried in 1994 and sentenced to death by the Su-
 p reme Court. The six matai members, though originally charged by the Supreme
 Court with inciting murder, were subsequently charged only with willful damage
 and received a minimal fine and no jail sentence. Western Samoa's Attorney Gen-
 eral lodged an appeal in 1994 on the grounds that the sentence was "inadequate
 and inappropriate.* A ruling on this appeal was postponed until 1996.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property without sub-
 stantive and procedural safeguards, including search warrants, which are issued by
 the judicial branch. Practically, however, there is little or no privacy in the village.
 Village officials by law must have permission to enter homes, but there can be sub-
 stantial social pressure to grant such permission.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 The Government charged two senior members of Tumua and Pule, the traditional
 leadership organization of Samoa, with sedition stemming from statements they
 made during a protest rally in 1994. The two were leaders of a protest movement
 against a highly unpopular value-added tax recently imposed by the Government.
 The judiciary dismissed all charges when the Government failed to present any evi-
 dence against the defendants. The Newspapers and Printers Act and the Defama-
 tion Act require journalists to reveal their sources in the event of a defamation suit
 against them. There has been no court case requiring that these acts be invoked.
 Two English-language newspapers and numerous Samoan-language newspapers
 are printed regularly in the country. The Government operates a radio station and
 the country's sole television station. There are two private radio stations. Television
 from American Samoa is readily available to viewers in Western Samoa.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. Nearly 100 percent of the population is
 Christian. While the Constitution grants each person the right to change religion
 or belief and to worship or teach religion alone or with others, in practice the matai
 often choose the religious denomination of the alga (extended family). There is
 strong societal pressure to support church leaders and projects financially. Such con-
 tributions often total more than 30 percent of personal income.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, but in
 practice some citizens have been banished either from village activities or com-
 pletey from the village. The Government actively supports emigration as a "safety
 valve for pressures of a growing population, especialy for potentially rebellious
 youths, and because it generates foreign income through remittances. The Govern-
 ment does not restrict foreign travel arbitrarily or the right of citizens to return
 from abroad.

 Western Samoa has not had any refugees or asylum seekers, and it is not aparty
 to any international protocol on them. However, the authorities have indicated that
 they would conform to international norms if such cases should arise.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through direct, multiparty
 elections, but women's political rights are restricted by the fact that few of them
 are matai. While all citizens above the age of 21 may vote, the right to run for 47
 of the 49 seats in the Legislative Assembly remains the prerogative of the approxi-
 mately 25,000 matai, 95 percent of whom are men. The remaining two seats are re-
 served for citizens not of Samoan heritage. While all adult Samoans may vote for
 the Legislative Assembly, matai continue to control local government through the
 village Fono which are open to them alone.
 The political process is more a function of personality than of party. The Human
 Rights Protection Party (HRPP) led by its leader, Prime Minister Tofilau Eti
 Alesana, holds the majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Samoan Na-
 tional Development Party is the opposition party. The next general elections will be
 held in 1996.
 Women occasionally reach high public office. The 12-member Cabinet has 1 female
 member, and women hold 2 of the 47 seats in Parliament. The first female judge
 was named in 1994.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operated without government restriction, inves-
 tigating the Tumua and Pule sedition case and publishing their findings about it.
 Government officials are usually cooperative.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, or social status. Western Samoa is a homogeneous society with no signifi-
 cant ethnic minorities. Samoan politics and culture are the product of a heritage of
 chiefly privilege and power, and members of certain families have some advantages.
 While there is discrimination against nonmatai and women, women (and particu-
 larly female matai) play an important role in society and may occasionally reach
 high office.
 Women.-The traditional subordinate role of women is changing, albeit slowly, es-
 pecially in the more conservative parts of society. While abuse of women is prohib-
 ited by law, social custom tolerates physical abuse of women within the home. The
 role and rights of the village Fonos and tradition would prevent police from interfer-
 ing in instances of domestic violence, barring a complaint from the victim-which
 village custom strongly discourages. While police do receive some complaints from
 abused women, domestic violence offenders are typically punished by village coun-
 cils, but only if the abuse is considered extreme. ("Extreme abuse" would be visibly
 evident signs of physical abuse.) The village religious leader may also intervene in
 domestic disputes.
 Many cases of rape may still go unreported because tradition and custom discour-
 age such reporting. In spite of this, the authorities note a greater number of re-
 ported cases of rape, as women are slowly becoming more forthcoming with the po-
 Iice. Rape cases that do reach the courts are treated seriously. Convicted offenders
 are often given relatively stiff sentences of several years' imprisonment.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs oversees and helps ensure the rights of women.
 Children.-The Government has made a strong commitment to the welfare of chil-
 dren through the implementation of various  tpro.ms by the Ministry of Edu-
 cation and the Ministry of Health. The law prohibits abuse of children, but tradition
 tolerates physical abuse of children within the home. The police noted an increase
 in reported cases of child abuse, attributed to Samoans becoming more aware of the
 reort physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children.
 Peope Wth  isabilities.-The Government has passed no legislation pertaining to
 the status of handicapped or disabled persons or regarding accessibility for the dis-
 abled. Samoan tradition dictates that handicapped persons be cared for by their
 family, and this custom is widely observed in practice.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have legally unrestricted rights to establish
 and join organizations of their own choosing. To date, two trade unions have been
 organized. The Western Samoa National Union, organized in 1994, is a six-member
 
 
 750
 association which includes workers from the three major banks. A second union rep-
 resents members at the sole factory in the country. Both unions are independent
 of the Government and political parties. There are no laws specific to union activity.
 The Commissioner of Labor would adjudicate any cases of retribution against strik-
 ers or union leaders on a case by case basis.
 The Public Service Association, representing government workers, an increasingly
 important sector of the work force, also functions as a union. The Supreme Court
 has upheld the right of government workers to strike, subject to certain restrictions
 imposed principally for reasons of public safety. Workers in the private sector have
 the right to strike, but in 1995 there were no strikes. The Public Service Association
 freely maintains relations with international bodies and participates in bilateral ex-
 chb.n   Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While workers have the legal
 right to engage in collective bargaining, they have seldom practiced it, due to the
 newness of union activity and the _iexperience of union leaders. However, the Pub-
 lic Service Association engages in collective bargaining on behalf of government
 workers, including bargaining on wages. Minimum wages are set by an advisory
 commission to the Minister of Labor. Waes in the private sector are determined
 by competitive demand for the required skills. Any antiunion discrimination case
 would be reported to and adjudicated by the Commissioner of Labor. Arbitration and
 mediation procedures are in place to resolve labor disputes, although these rarely
 arise.
 Labor law and practice in the one export processing zone are the same as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While the Government does not
 demand compulsory labor and it is prohibited by law, in this collective society  ple
 are frequently called upon to work for their villages. Most people do so willingly,
 but if not, the matai can compel them to do so.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the terms of the Labor and
 Employment Act of 1972 as amended, it is illegal to employ children under 15 years
 of age except in "safe and light work." The Commissioner of Labor refers complaints
 about illegal child labor to the Attorney General for enforcement. The Attorney Gen-
 eral has received no complaints about violation of the child labor laws, which prob-
 ably seldom occurs. The law does not apply to service rendered to the matai, some
 of whom require children to work, primarily on village farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions o Work.-The Labour and Employment Act of 1972, as
 amended, established for the private sector a 40-hour workweek and an hourly mini-
 mum wage of $0.50 (Tala 1.25). This minimum wage suffices for a basic standard
 of living when supplemented by the subsistence farming and fishing in which most
 families engage. The La bour and Employment Act of 1972 provides that no worker
 should be required to work for more than 40 hours in any 1 week.
 The Act also establishes certain rudimentary safety and health standards, which
 the Attorney General is responsible for enforcing. Independent observers report,
 however, that the safety laws are not strictly enforced except when accidents high-
 light noncompliance. Many agricultural workers, among others, are inadequately
 protected from pesticides and other dangers to health. Government education pro-
 grams are addressing these concerns. The Act does not apply to service rendered
 to the matai. While the Act does not specifically address the right of workers to re-
 move themselves from a dangerous work situation, a report of such a case to the
 Commissioner of Labor would prompt an investigation, without jeopardy to contin-
 ued employment. Government employees are covered under different and more
 stringent regulations, which are adequately enforced by the Public Service Commis-
 sion.
