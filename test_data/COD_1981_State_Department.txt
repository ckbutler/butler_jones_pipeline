 ZAIRE
 
 Zaire's constitution provides for a highly centralized
 and personalized presidential one-party government.
 Formation of additional parties is illegal. Consti-
 tutionally, the executive council (prime minister and
 council of ministers), the legislative council
 (popularly-elected national assembly), the judiciary,
 and the labor movement are organs of the Peoples
 Revolutionary Movement (MPR), along with the party
 congress, its political bureau, and central committee.
 The president heads both the party and the state,
 appointing the prime minister (first state commissioner)
 and his cabinet. The president retains and exercises
 the constitutional power to promulgate laws by decree
 although he shares law-making authority with the
 legislative council. Zaire has a civilian government,
 but military officers are sometimes appointed to
 government positions and President Mobutu himself
 retains his military rank.
 The government continued to apply a policy of amnesty
 toward political exiles, refugees and ex-Katangan
 rebels returned home for resettlement in 1981. The
 government cooperated sporadically with international
 human rights organizations. It permitted Amnesty
 International (on one occasion) and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (irregularly) to visit
 prisons and interview prisoners-but sometimes withheld
 information on particular cases. Prison conditions,
 particularly at local jails, remained harsh.
 Incidents of abuse, extortion, and corruption by
 military and civilian security officials were still
 common. Arbitrary arrests for political reasons and
 because of personal vendettas:apparently increased
 during 1981. There was also a trend in 1981 toward
 detaining more political prisoners in unofficial
 and clandestine prisons. Many Zairians continued to
 suffer from a lack of adequate food, shelter, health
 care, transportation, access to education and jobs that
 pay an adequate wage. Though progress toward economic
 stabilization under an International Monetary Fund
 (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) has been encouraging,
 high inflation and economic stagnation remain serious
 problems affecting the welfare of Zaire's citizens.
 1. Respect For The Integrity Of The Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 Although the Zairian constitution explicitly prohibits
 the use of torture and all other degrading and inhuman
 treament, some prisoners were tortured in 1981.
 Incidents of local police and military personnel
 beating suspected criminals and extorting money also
 continued to be widespread. Although some senior
 government of Zaire officials took measures to stop
 prisoner abuse when incidents of torture were brought
 to their attention, disciplinary action against personnel
 inflicting physical punishment continued to be sporadic.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading treatment or
 Punishment
 Although some prisons continued to make progress in
 improving conditions, overall government efforts to
 improve prisons diminished during the past year.
 Legally, civilian suspects cannot be held more than 24
 hours before appearing before a magistrate to hear the
 charges against them. However, some prisoners continued
 to be held without charges for days, weeks and sometimes
 months. Incidents of prisoner abuse, overcrowding, and
 inadequate medical attention, sanitation, food,
 and exercise were reported. Conditions in local jails
 were particularly bad. In some local jails, prisoners
 must take turns sleeping on the floor for lack of
 space. Reports of brutality and extortion by the
 arresting officer and guards are common. Some prisoners
 continued to be denied access to normal judicial
 procedures, and held incommunicado for months.
 The Zairian judicial system provides for execution for
 certain crimes, and several criminals were executed
 during 1981 after receiving benefit of due process. A
 few reports of summary execution were plausible but
 could not be substantiated.
 c. Disappearances
 During 1981 there were more reports than during 1980 of
 the national security and military police arresting and
 detaining prisoners for up to several months before
 notifying their families. Once notified, family
 members were permitted to visit prisoners and bring
 supplementary food.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Although there is no way of knowing the number of
 detainees currently being held without charges and
 benefit of formal legal procedures, arbitrary arrests
 appeared to be more frequent this year than during
 1980. During early summer 1981, a campaign was launched
 to detain unemployed youths and vagrants. Hundreds
 were held without charge for varying periods of time.
 Most had reportedly been released by the end of 1981.
 Corruption is common with irregularly paid or underpaid
 soldiers and policemen often detaining citizens
 without provocation or on flimsy grounds in order to
 extort bribes for their release. In other cases
 military police confiscated the homes and businesses of
 those arbitrarily arrested.
 Non-judicial sanctions against persons suspected by the
 security police of threatening the security of the
 state are authorized by law. These sanctions range
 from restriction of movement or travel to house arrest
 or administrative detention. Although never formally
 charged in a judicial court, thirteen parliamentarians
 were sanctioned in January by the central committee of
 the party for writing an open letter critical of the
 Mobutu regime. Subsequently all were banished to
 their home villages, but were freed on December 2, 1981.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are usually public but are not always fair,
 although the right to a fair trial is provided by law.
 Defendants have the right to a defense counsel, who is
 generally free from government pressure.   Indigent
 defendants are assigned free counsel by the court.
 Private lawyers continue to enjoy freedom and indepen-
 dence from government control after successfully
 resisting a 1979 move to bring all lawyers into govern-
 ment employment. Arrestees are in theory protected
 procedurally from arbitrary arrest by the requirement
 that within 24 hours they be brought before a magistrate
 to hear charges against them.
 In 1972, a special court of state security was established
 to hear cases involving threats to national security,
 armed robbery and smuggling. The procedures outlined
 for legal protection in civil courts are available to
 defendants in security courts, except that the latter's
 judgments cannot be appealed.
 Procedures for trial in the military courts are provided
 for in the military penal code. Normally, these courts
 hear only those cases involving military personnel. In
 times of emergency and military operations the president
 can suspend the civilian courts and require all cases
 to be heard in the military courts. The civilian court
 procedures for protection of defendants' rights still
 apply. Some civilian cases are now being tried in
 military courts in Shaba and South Kivu.
 In practice, defendants in criminal, security or
 military cases are often held for extended periods with
 no charges brought against them. Some are released
 after months of detention without-ever having been
 brought to trial. During 1981 many citizens were
 arrested for possessing copies of the parliamentarians'
 letter critical of the Mobutu regime. They were never
 indicted nor brought before the court. Most, but not
 all, were released in July prior to an Amnesty Inter-
 national prison visit. The fairness of trials,
 particularly at the lower levels, is sometimes compro-
 mised by bias or corruption. Because judges are
 poorly paid, many solicit and accept bribes from
 defendants to render favorable verdicts, thereby
 corrupting the system and favoring the wealthy.
 f. Invasion of The Home
 Judicial warrants are required by law before the police
 are permitted to search a home, except in cases of
 threats to national security. During 1981, military
 police entered and searched citizens' homes without
 obtaining warrants on flimsy evidence that a threat to
 national security existed. In some cases they confis-
 cated property without compensation. No incidents of
 "bugging," demolition, or sealing doors and windows of
 private homes or offices have been reported.
 2. Respect For Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution incorporates the guarantees called for
 in the universal declaration of human rights.
 
 
 305
 The government controls the press and media. Articles
 and opinion pieces must be approved by a government
 review commission before publication. Although the
 review process has an intimidating effect upon journal-
 ists, they are not harassed if a piece is rejected by
 the board. Investigative reporters and academic
 researchers both tend toward self-censorship.
 Journalists and writers take care not to criticize the
 president directly (a criminal offense) or his close
 associates. They do criticize government practices,
 inadequate services, and corrupt local officials. From
 time to time certain issues of foreign magazines are
 censored or banned primarily because of articles
 critical of the government and its leaders.
 Groups of more than a few persons may not assemble
 without a permit, which is only issued to legally
 recognized groups. Under the constitution, all citizens
 are members of the sole political party, the Popular
 Revolutionary Movement (MPR). Likewise, all social,
 political, sport or youth associations must be under
 the rubric of the party to have legal status. The
 government recognizes one labor union which functions
 as an umbrella organization for functional unions and
 is empowered to call strikes, negotiate and organize.
 Its right to strike is restricted by both legal and
 political considerations. In addition, the government
 intervened increasingly in the union's internal affairs
 in 1981, even arresting union leader Mukwakani on
 questionable charges.
 Nearly 65 per cent of Zaire's population is affiliated
 with a Christian church. The government officially
 sanctions most of the major world religions and there
 are established procedures for new churches to obtain
 legal recognition. Although relations between the
 State and the Catholic Church were very good after the
 Pope's visit in May 1980, tensions and distrust between
 the Mobutu regime and church leadership developed
 during 1981 leading to exchanges of public criticism.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within The Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In principle, any Zairian citizen may obtain a passport
 and exit visa. In practice, this process is sometimes
 delayed and impeded by officials angling for bribes to
 facilitate the paper work. A married woman must have
 her husband's authorization before obtaining a passport,
 but once the document is issued she need not get her
 husband's approval to travel. If her husband is
 incapacitated in some way or refuses to authorize the
 passport, she can take her case to the courts, which
 are empowered to override a husband's denial. Travel
 within Zaire is generally unrestricted, although
 special permits are required in certain (mainly
 diamond-mining) areas. In some areas, soldiers manning
 highway check points routinely demand payment from
 travelers.
 The government sets the official figure for refugees to
 whom it is providing safehaven at approximately 400,000
 (215,000 Angolans, 22,000 Rwandans, 11,000 Burundians,
 150,000 Ugandans, and 1,800 Zambians.)   Since the
 
 
 306
 government permits rerugees to seek employment and
 settle on farms, most refugees are self sufficient and
 integrated into the Zairian economic system within a
 few years of arrival. Zaire allows refugees access to
 all social services provided Zairian citizens.
 Since the declaration of general amnesty for refugees
 and political exiles in June 1978, about 200.000
 Zairians have been repatriated from Angola, Zambia,
 Europe, Sudan and Tanzania. The government continues
 to negotiate with ex-Katangan rebel leaders, the
 Zambian and Angolan governments and the UNHCR for the
 voluntary return to their homelands of several thousand
 Zairians and tens of thousands of Angolan refugees.
 c. Freedom To Participate in The Political
 Process
 The 1978 constitution provides for a powerful
 presidency and a highly centralized government. All
 citizens are members of the one political party (The
 MPR) headed by the president. Opposition parties are
 illegal and the single party functions to mobilize
 popular support rather than as a vehicle to express
 citizens' opinions. Citizens over 18 years of age must
 vote. Legislative council (national assembly) elections
 held in 1977 were contested freely and by all accounts
 fairly, by multiple candidates in each regional constitu-
 tency. Although the legislative council exercized
 considerable influence during 1979 and early 1980 by
 debating public policy, interpellating ministers, and
 formulating Zairian laws, it suffered a great reduction
 in power during 1981. The newly created central
 committee of the party now outranks the parliament and
 is able to give directions on new legislation. The
 president also exercizes the constitutional power to
 promulgate laws by decree and thereby override the
 council.
 Whereas last year no regional, ethnic, social or racial
 group was denied citizenship or political participation,
 a new nationality act going into effect in 1982 may
 rescind the citizenship of some ethnic groups that had
 been granted to them by the 1971 nationality act. It
 is still unclear as to how this new law will be applied.
 There are unofficial regional and ethnic quotas in the
 university. These quotas are designed to protect
 various ethnic groups from exclusion by university
 officials who tend to recruit and select from their own
 ethnic group. Women's rights to own property and
 participate in the political process are protected by
 law, but their role is restrained by tradition and
 custom. There are growing numbers of women in the
 professions, government, business, and the university.
 Women have a limited role in the modern sector of the
 economy and top levels of government. Married women
 must obtain their husband's authorization before
 opening a bank account, accepting a job, or renting or
 selling real estate.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 During 1981 the government continued its policy of
 permitting international and non-governmental investi-
 
 
 307
 gations of alleged human rights violations. In July
 1980 two representatives of Amnesty International
 spent a week in Zaire at the invitation of the govern-
 ment. During this time they had frank interviews with
 Zairian officials in the justice and penal systems,
 visited four prisons in and around Kinshasa and
 talked with fourteen prisoners whose cases they
 had been following. During the first half of 1981,
 ICRC delegates visited places of detention in Kinshasa
 and in Shaba and Kivu regions and had access to about
 1,800 detainees. In addition, the Central Tracing
 Agency, which set up an office within the Kinshasa ICRC
 delegation in November 1980, has been active filing
 reports on detainees visited, exchanging messages
 between persons deprived of freedom and their families,
 and inquiring into the whereabouts of missing Ugandan
 and Angolan refugees in Zaire. Although a dialog
 was maintained between both these organizations and
 some government officials intermittently throughout the
 year, at times other officials withheld information
 and authorization for prison visits.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Zaire is Africa's second largest sub-saharan country in
 area (one million square miles) and third largest in
 population (about 28 million). At the time of indepen-
 dence in 1960, when the Zairian population numbered
 only about 18 million, development of the industrial,
 agricultural and transportation sectors was considerable
 but geared primarily to the export markets. Social
 infrastructure (health, education) had been sorely
 neglected and provided almost exclusively by religious
 missions. Wages for the Zairian workers were held low
 purposely. During the first decade after independence
 the sudden flight of Belgian supervisors and technicians,
 disintegration of the central government's power, and
 serious ethnic rebellions badly damaged the economy.
 The return to political stability, prudent government
 measures and better terms of trade produced improvements
 in the economy in the early 1970s. During this period
 all sectors except agriculture increased their production.
 Felling copper prices, heavy government expenses on
 capital projects and the cumulative effects of domestic
 mismanagement, neglect and widespread corruption all
 contributed to a dramatic decline in the Zairian
 economy after 1975. Real GDP growth was negative in
 the years 1975-79 inclusive with 1979 per capita GDP
 estimated at $260. The standard of living of the
 average citizen is lower today than that enjoyed during
 the sixties and seventies. The annual inflation rate
 was about 60 per cent in 1978, 100 per cent in 1979, 50
 per cent in 1980, and may exceed the IMF target of 45
 per cent for all of 1981. Industry today operates at
 most at only 30 to 40 per cent capacity. Urban
 unemployment statistics are unreliable, but the jobless
 rate may approach 50 per cent in Kinshasa, the capital.
 Remuneration for productive activity in industry,
 agriculture, and the services sector is so inadequate
 that many public and private employees often hold
 second positions in the official or parallel economies.
 Low pay is also a major cause of the corruption which
 pervades all levels of Zairian society.
 
 
 308
 In the years since 1976, Zaire has sought both bilateral
 and multilateral assistance, including assistance from
 the IMF, to institute the reforms needed to stimulate
 economic recovery. Most recently on June 22, 1981 the
 IMF approved an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement
 with Zaire which will provide SDR 912 million over
 three years conditional on Zaire's meeting stated
 performance criteria. An IMF team which visited
 Kinshasa in late August and early September apparently
 concluded Zaire met its June 30 targets. Time will
 tell whether Zaire can bring under effective control
 the government budget and the growth of the money
 supply, institute pricing and saving policy reforms,
 reduce corruption, streamline the operations of
 major foreign exchange earners, stimulate new investment
 and make the external sector more responsive to world
 market conditions, all of which are necessary to effect
 long term economic growth.
 The approximately 75 per cent of the Zairian population
 who live in rural areas today are among the world's
 poorest, lacking adequate access to public services
 such as medical care and schools. One quarter of the
 population is urban, and migration from rural areas
 continues to swell urban populations. Food is scarce
 and expensive. Malnutrition, prevalent both among
 urban dwellers and in the countryside, is probably the
 single most serious health problem, contributing to
 high rates of illness and death from other causes.
 Life expectancy for the total population in 1979 was
 only 46. Health care in 1981 still tends to be curative
 rather than preventative, is extremely limited in scope
 and availability in urban areas, and outside the few
 church-run hospitals and clinics is practically non-
 existent in rural areas. Many public hospitals and
 dispensaries do not function for lack of supplies.
 Theft and sale of medical supplies by poorly paid
 public health personnel is common.
 The literacy rate in Zaire for persons over age 15
 varies regionally between 40 and 50 per cent. Rates
 are lower in rural areas and lowest for rural women.
 Education is expensive and in short supply at all
 levels, particularly in the rural areas where secondary
 schools and institutions of higher learning are virtually
 nonexistent. Increasing numbers of parents cannot
 afford to send their children to schools. There are
 only half as many girls enrolled in primary schools as
 there are boys. Teachers' salaries are paid sporadically
 and late by the government, although an effort is
 currently underway to rationalize the payroll system
 and eliminate systematic padding by administrative
 personnel.
