 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The United Kingdom (U.K.) of Great Britain and Northern
 Ireland is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic
 government. As there is no written constitution, human rights
 are "residual," i.e., assumed unless limited by statute.
 Human rights traditionally have been respected and guarded by
 the. people and their elected governments. Laws bar
 discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, or
 political opinion.
 Conflict between the Protestant majority and Catholic minority
 communities in Northern Ireland continued in 1989 to require
 special measures for governing the regign and providing for
 public security. Illegal paramilitary groups on both sides of
 the conflict continued their.campaigns of violence. The
 Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA), signed by the Governments of the
 U.K. and Ireland in 1985, affirms that the status of Northern
 Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom can only be changed
 with the consent of a majority in the North. It also provides
 for an intergovernmental conference to discuss the two
 Governments' views on Northern Ireland affairs. The
 conference has met regularly since its inception and has given
 particular attention to enhancing security cooperation.
 Throughout the U.K. and Hong Kong, public order is maintained
 by civilian police forces. In Northern Ireland, because of
 terrorist violence, police of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
 (RUC) are supported by Army units.
 The United  ingdom has a highly developed-industrial economy.
 Persons may own property and pursue private economic
 interests. The Government provides comprehensive social
 welfare services.
 Under a 1985 agreement between the U.K. and China, control of
 -Hong Kong will revert to China in 1997. The agreement states
 ,that Hong Kong after 1997.will retain its social, legal, and
 free-market capitalist system and will continue to be
 nonsocialist. For now, Hong Kong's legal system closely
 parallels that of the U.K., and fundamental rights ultimately
 rest on oversight exercised by the British Parliament.
 In the United Kingdom and in-Hong Kong there continued to be
 widespread support for and protection of human rights in
 1989. Both Governments continued to be responsive to popular
 pressures for changes in goyernance, and both took measures to
 bring regulations and practices into accord -with the findings
 of domestic and international bodies which have recommended
 changes to improve legal and other human rights. However,
 U.K. policy toward refugees in Hong Kong generated
 international controversy.
 Terrorist bombings and killings carried out by the illegal
 Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) in both Northern
 Ireland and Britain, and terrorist acts in Northern Ireland
 committed by similar groups claiming to represent parts of the
 Protestant community, constitute the single most dramatic
 threat to public order and security in the U.K. Actions of
 the security forces and the legal system were primarily
 responsible for keeping deaths caused by terrorism and the
 conflict between communities to far fewer than 100 in 1989, as
 in recent years. However, a public prosecutor's decision to
 overturn the 1975 conviction of the "Guildford Four" (three
 men and one woman) for murder by bombing (and widespread
 charges that the police falsified evidence in the case)
 
 
 1293
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 underlined skepticism among Catholics in Northern Ireland
 about equality of justice there (see Section l.d.).
 There was controversy in the last months of 1989 because of
 revelations that security force documents identifying alleged
 PIRA suspects and others were allowed to come into the
 possession of Protestant terrorists who used them to identify
 targets for attacks. Tensions and long-held animosities
 between the two communities in Northern Ireland continued to
 mean that many Catholics were denied equality of'some rights
 and opportunities despite government efforts to redress their
 grievances. New legislation approved in 1989 will strengthen
 government efforts to eliminate employment discrimination.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The British Government does not practice or condone killing
 for political motives.
 By August 20, 1989, 2,755 people had died in 20 years of "the
 troubles" in Northern Ireland (which has a population of 1.5
 million). In 1989, 62 persons were killed in incidents of
 terrorism in Northern Ireland, 23 of whom were members of the
 security forces (including the regular army, Royal Ulster
 Constabulary and the Ulster'Defense Regiment). Thirty-nine
 persons were killed by security forces.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland continued the use of
 plastic baton rounds (PBR's or plastic bullets) for riot
 control. One person was killed by a PBR in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 Government authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest, or hold
 persons in clandestine confinement, nor do they sponsor or
 condone such activities. In 1989 there continued to be
 instances of persons abducted or illegally held hostage in
 terrorist incidents in Northern Ireland.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 British laws forbid torture and other cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment of prisoners and provide penalties for
 violations of those laws. Confessions obtained by such
 methods are not admissible as evidence in court.
 In February 1988, Amnesty International (AI) called on the
 Government to review the convictions of those involved in an
 October 1985 riot at the Broadwater Farm housing estate in
 north London in which a police officer was killed. Several..
 defendants claimed that they were denied access to lawyers and
 families during police interrogation and that they were
 threatened and forced to make admissions or sign statements
 under duress during interrogation. As of February 1989,
 results of an official investigation have not been made
 public, and no statement has been issued by the Police
 Complaints Authority, which has been supervising the
 investigation.
 
 
 1294
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 New codes of practice regarding.the questioning of suspects by
 security forces in Northern Ireland were mandated under the
 provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern
 Ireland) Order 1989. They will come into effect in early 1990.
 All complaints concerning the police made by members of the
 public in Northern Ireland are monitored by the independent
 Commission for Police Complaints. The Commission is
 independent of both, the Government and the police and is
 charged with supervising police investigations into the most
 serious complaints.
 There was controversy over the introduction of "genetic
 fingerprinting" in criminal investigations and as evidence in
 trials. The law in Northern-Ireland allows police to use oral
 swabs for DNA testing of cells in cases of serious crime. In
 NortheTn Ireland, taking oral samples is considered
 "nonintimate" and may be done against a prisoner's will. In
 England and Wales, however, such samples are considered
 "intimate" and may be taken only with the written consent of
 the subject and then only by a medical practitioner.
 Britain has ratified the Council of:Europe Convention on the
 Transfer of Sentenced Persons, by which prisoners may be sent
 to their home cduntries to serve their sentences. Mithin the
 United Kingdom; convicts arealmost always required to-serve
 their prison time in the general region where the crime was
 committed.
 .On Auigust-24, the Hong Kong Government announced it would end
 in .l 90_the practice of corporal punishment based on a review
 of obligations under international conventions and other
 factors.- There were complaints by some nongovernmental
 organizadoins-thdt the Hong Kong Government deliberately
 allowed living conditions in overcrowded Indochinese refugee
 camps to deteriorate and failed to provide adequate shelter,
 nutrition, and health care. The Government moved the asylum
 seekers to other centers, which also became very overcrowded
 (see Section 2.d.).
 d- Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police may make arrests without warrants-in cases of
 reasonable cause to suspect criminal guilt. Those arrested
 without warrant must be released-on bail unless brought before
 a magistrate's court within 24-hours. Generally, persons
 charged with nonserious offenses may be released on bail. In
 cases such as'crimes of violence, however, magistrates have
 remanded persons for periods of up to 18 months before trial.
 The law-allows the Government, in an emergency situation and
 subject to review by Parliament, to restrict personal
 liberties.
 Acting, on the premise that the fundamental "right to life" has
 been in serious jeopardy due to the violence in Northern
 Ireland, the Government adopted the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Acts of 197a and 1987 which are
 applicable only to Northern Ireland; and the Prevention of
 Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1989 (originally
 enacted in 1974), almost all of which is applicable to the
 entire United Kingdom. Both Acts are subject to parliamentary
 review and require periodic renewal to remain in effect.
 
 
 1295
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The 1989 Prevention of Terrorism Act allows the police to
 arrest, without warrant, persons anywhere in the U.K. whom
 they reasonably suspect to be involved in terrorism. Such
 persons may be detained for up to 48 hours without judicial
 review, and up to a further 5 days on the authority of the
 Home Secretary or, in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State
 for Northern Ireland.
 In November 1988, the European Commission of Human Rights
 ruled that, in the case of four men detained in 1984 under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act, aC detention of just over 4 days
 was excessive and violated the requirement contained in the
 European Convention on Human Rights that a person should be
 brought "promptly to court." In response to an adverse
 decision, the Government gave notice of its intention to
 derogate temporarily from the relevant articles of the
 European Convention on Human Rights and the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which govern
 detention. Although the Government has said it was seeking
 ways to bring U.K. practice into conformity, the 7-day
 detention power was retained in the Prevention of Terrorism
 Act of 1989.
 In Northern Ireland police and military personnel, in dealing
 with cases of suspected terrorism, may enter and search
 without warrants, and members of the Armed Forces on duty may
 arrest without a warrant any person suspected of having
 committed or being about to commit any offense. Such persons
 may be held for up to 4 hours, after which they must be
 transferred to police custody or released.
 In Northern Ireland persons arrested or detained have the
 right to a lawyer after 48 hours. There is credible evidence,
 however, that lawyers often encounter delays in access beyond
 the legal limit.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is provided for by law and observed in practice in
 the United Kingdom in the vast majority of cases. An indigent
 defendant has the right to counsel of his choosing. All
 criminal proceedings must be conducted in public, with the
 exception of juvenile court cases and cases involving public
 decency or security. In a trial on charges under the Official
 Secrets Act, the court may be closed at the judge's
 discretion, but the sentence must be passed in public.
 In October the U.K. Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)
 directed that the Government abandon its charges against the
 "Guildford Four" who had been convicted and imprisoned with
 life sentences in 1975, and the four were released from
 prison. The decision was taken before the court because DDP
 received information contrary to evidence used in
 prosecution. The State therefore sent the case for review by
 -the Higher Appellate Court, which subsequently overturned the
 conviction. The Government also initiated corruption
 proceedings against police officers who had been involved in
 taking the case to court. New reviews of the cases of the
 "Birmingham Six" and "Maguire Seven", who had been imprisoned
 since 1974 also for murder by bombing, now appear likely.
 The majority of criminal prosecutions in Great Britain which
 come to trial are heard by juries. In Northern Ireland,
 
 
 1296
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 however, the right to trial by jury has been suspended for
 certain-terrorist-related offenses because of the intimidation
 of juries by terrorists.. "Diplock Courts," in which a single
 High Court judge presides over.a trial without a jury, were
 established in Northern Ireland by legislation in 1973.- While
 thesoe-courts have been criticized by some human rights groups,
 a report published by the Association of the Bar of the City
 of New York stated that Diplock Courts conform to the
 requirements of international standards of fair trials and
 that there )as been no serious claim that a factually
 errofteous-conviction has occurrbd in a Diplock Court.
 The Government's ability to provide trials by multiple judges
 or with juries is limited in Northern Ireland because of PIRA
 terrorism against the judiciary. The PIRA has announced it
 will even attack-workmen who perform services at the homes of
 judges.. On July 31, a massive car bomb exploded outside the
 Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast causing extensive damage.
 In November 1988, the general law on evidence in Northern
 Ireland, the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988,
 was enacted. In part, the law affects the traditional right
 to silence of accused persons under British law by permitting
 the courts to draw whatever inference they deem proper,
 including an inference of guilt, if a subject remains silent
 during questioning. -The provision was introduced as a means
 of dealing with the *wajl of silence" encountered by the
 police when questioning suspected terrorists as well as with
 "ambush-testimony" whereby a suspect does not speak until his
 trial when he presents a surprise alibi. The Standing
 Advisory Commission on Human Rights believes that unless such
 inferences are-restricted in their application and incorporate
 appropriate safeguards, the law may lead to a lack of
 confidence in the administration of justice in Northern
 Ireland.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdictions Act, enacted by both the U.K.
 Government (1975) and the Irish Government (1976), permits
 trial in either the Republic of Ireland or in the U.K. of
 those accused of certain terrorist offenses regardless of
 whether the offense was committed in the other country.
 Minors convicted of murder may be subjected to indeterminate
 detention. In Northern Ireland, where public attention has
 focused on this issue, there were 30 minors serving
 indeterminate sentences at the end of 1989, including 17
 prisoners who, had served 8 or more years for murders committed
 while they were under the age of 18 and whose release dates
 had not been decided.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is well respected in both law and
 custom. Warrants are generally required for a police search
 of private -premises. However, under the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978, any member of the Armed
 Forces on duty or any-constable may enter any premises or
 other place if he or she considers it necessary to do so to
 preserve peace or maintain order. Changes.in the 1987
 Emergency Provisions Act now require a standard of "reasonable
 grounds of suspicion" before a dwelling may be entered to
 search for munitions or transmitters.
 
 
 1297
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Strongly held tradition, an independent press, and a
 democratic political system combine to secure freedom of
 speech and press. Viewpoints independent and critical of the
 Government are well represented.
 In 1988 the Government banned radio and television broadcasts
 of live or recorded statements made by representatives of PIRA
 or other illegal terrorist organizations or of Sinn Fein, the
 legal political arm of the IRA, or by others who express views
 which "solicit, support, or invite support for such
 organizations." There are no restrictions on reporting their
 words. Exceptions are made for coverage of elections and
 parliamentary proceedings. The written media were not
 dffected by the notices. The measures drew widespread
 criticism as undermining freedom of speech and pxess. The ban
 is being challenged in domestic courts on grounds it is
 unlawful under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act of 1973
 and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
 Hong Kong has traditions and practices of free speech and
 press similar to those in the U.K. Individuals and groups
 freely criticize the Hong Kong Government, and the media are
 free to air all views and opinions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except in cases of extreme civil disorder, in which public
 safety is judged to be at risk, the authorities do not
 exercise their statutory right to limit the freedom of public
 assembly. However, some critics believe that the 1986 Public
 Order Law gives police too much discretion to restrict public
 assembly.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1989 and the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 include sections
 prohibiting membership in, or support of, organizations
 involved in terrorism. These organizations are specifically
 listed in the statutes. The lists do not include political
 parties.
 The summer "marching season" in Northern Ireland presents
 special problems. These marches commemorate the traditions of
 opposing sectarian communities. Each community considers them
 a right, but they are controversial and have been a source of
 public disorder. Under the law, the police must be notified 7
 days before a planned march and may impose conditions,
 including rerouting. No permits to march were denied in 1989,
 and there were no serious disorders during the 1989 marches.
 Peaceful assembly and association are permitted and regularly
 practiced in Hong Kong.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Government policy and general practice ensure freedom of
 religion in Great Britain and Hong Kong. While both England
 and Scotland have established churches, the U.K. Government
 makes no direct financial contribution to them, and their
 
 
 1298
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 existence does not limit the freedom or access to public life
 of members of other churches. The Government provides funds
 for church schools.
 In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 specifically
 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious belief or
 political opinion. There is no similar law in Great Britain.
 There are no religious bars to holding public office. The
 sovereign must be a member of the Church of England.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 U.K. citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country and'
 in foreign travel, emigration-, and repatriation.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act includes one exception to this
 general principle. The Act gives the Home Secretary the
 authority to exclude or prevent from entering mainland Britain
 anyone he believes may be connected with terrorism related to
 Northern Ireland, unless that person was born in Great Britain
 or has been ordinarily resident there for 3 years. Similar
 authority is granted to the Secretary of State for Northern
 Ireland to exclude persons not native to or resident in that
 provinqe. Bptween November 1978 and March 1989, 287 persons
 were the subjects of exclusion orders in the U.K. As of March
 1989, 143 of these orders still were in operation. The
 National Council for Civil Liberties has called exclusion
 orders a system of "internal exile" to exclude persons in
 Northern Ireland from enteiing Britain (which does not
 preclude travel outside of Britain). The Standing Advisory
 Commission on Human Rights objects to the continued
 availability of exclusion orders because the evidence used is
 not tested in any court. The Secretary of State must only be
 "satisfied" that a person is or has been involved in the
 commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism.
 In Hong Kong, in response to the arrival of large numbers of
 people from Vietnam seeking asylum, the Government implemented
 a screening program in accord with an agreement concluded by
 the International Conferenceon Indochinese Refugees in Geneva
 in June 1989. 'Those who are determined by the screening
 process not to be eligible for refugee status are detained in
 camps pending determination of what will become of them.
 There were international complaints that the Government
 deliberately allowed living conditions in some camps to have
 inadequate standards of shelter, nutrition, and health care.
 At the same time, the widespread opinion of Hong Kong
 residents was that their Government should not expend any
 additional resources on the camps and asylum seekers.
 On December 12, 51 Vietnamese were forcibly returned from Hong
 Kong to Vietnam on the grounds that they were found to be
 economic migrants, not.genuine refugees. The ensuing public
 debate included the U.S. view opposing involuntary
 repatriation to Vietnam and favoring concerted international
 action to encourage voluntary repatriation of Vietnamese, on
 the one hand, and the U.K. view of the need to repatriate
 Vietnamese like other illegal immigrants, on the other hand.
 The U.K. Government undertook to monitor the treatment of the
 51 returnees through periodic visits to their homes.
 In the U.K., there were charges by human rights and
 immigration rights groups that the Government denied asylum to
 
 
 1299
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 some who were entitled to recognition as refugees, among them
 Tamils and others from Sri Lanka.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is formed on the basis of a majority of seats
 in the House of Commons, won in freely contested elections
 held at intervals not longer than 5 years. Participation in
 the political process is open to all persons and parties, of
 which there are several, representing a broad range of
 political views. For parliamentary and local elections, all
 citizens 18 years of age and over have the franchise. Women
 have full rights of participation and are represented at all
 levels of British political life. Racial minorities comprise
 about 5 percent of the total population. There are several
 nonwhite members of Parliament, and there are nonwhite elected
 members of local governments.
 Most British dependent territories have small populations,
 under 60,000, and are ruled by appointed governors or
 administrators assisted by executive councils (usually
 appointed) and legislative assemblies or councils (partly
 elected).
 Hong Kong, with a population of over 5 million, is a free
 society with legally Protected rights but without a broad
 democratic base. The Governor is appointed by the crown, and
 representative government with members selected by universal
 franchise exists only in rudimentary form and without formal
 political parties. The Hong Kong Government is committed to
 further democratization but elections, direct or indirect,
 determine only a minority of seats in municipal councils and
 the legislative assembly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains an open attitude toward international
 inquiries into alleged violations of human rights in the
 United Kingdom. It cooperates fully with the European
 Commission of Human Rights in investigations of complaints and-
 has usually taken steps to rectify its own laws and policies
 when they were found not to be in conformity with the European
 Convention on Human Rights.
 The United Kingdom is a party to several human rights
 conventions, participates in international and regional human
 rights bodies, and is the host country to international
 nongovernmental human rights organizations, including Amnesty
 International. In 1973 the Standing Advisory Commission on
 Human Rights was established to monitor human rights in
 Northern Ireland.
 The Hong Kong Government has cooperated with international and
 nongovernmental organizations, for example, by providing
 access to its centers for Vietnamese asylum seekers.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Race Relations Act bars discrimination on the basis of
 race, color, nationality, or national or ethnic origin, and
 outlaws incitement to racial hatred. Various studies,
 
 
 1300
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 however, have shown disproportionate unemployment, low
 educational Achievement, and other problems for some minority
 groups. In 1984 a code of practice on employment, proposed by
 the Commission for Racial Equality and accepted by the
 Government, took effect but does not have the force of law.
 The Government has made improvements in the legal protection
 offered women in employment as a result of test cases taken to
 the European Court of Justice which have claimed that British
 law did not conform to European Community legislation on equal
 rights. U.K. tax laws as of 1990 will treat married women
 more equally. Women have equal property rights and equal
 rights in divorce courts.
 The Government's technical and vocational education
 initiative, covering all students aged 14 to 16, was launched
 to counter sex stereotyping in the school system and in career
 counseling. Equal opportunity commissions were established in
 Britain in 1975 and in Northern Ireland in 1976 to assist in
 the enforcement of equal opportunity legislation.
 There are no conclusive statistics on the extent of violence
 against women in the U.K. Women increasingly report violence
 in the family to the police;-offenders in such cases often are
 prosecuted and may be imprisoned. Women's shelters, operated
 by voluntary groups, provide refuge for battered wives, and
 local governments routinely provide counseling services. Rape
 victims receive similar support, and convicted rapists usually
 are imprisoned. It is not illegal, however, for a man to rape
 his wife.
 In Hong Kong, violence against women, including wife beating,
 occursbut the extent of the problem is not known. There has
 not been a significant increase in reported cases in recent
 years, but cultural and other factors are believed to hinder
 reporting of incidents to the authorities. The Hong Kong
 Gove;nment passed a domestic violence ordinance.in 1987
 covering violence inflicted upon spouses, cohabitants, and
 those under 21. Domestic violence also may be prosecuted
 under criminal statutes. The Government enforces these laws
 and prose6utes violators. Professional counseling and medical
 services are, available to victims, and there are some private
 shelters for battered women.
 There is no evidence of governmental discrimination on
 religious grounds in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland,
 however, anti-Catholic discrimination involves a complex range
 of historical and social factors. The majority Protestant
 community historically has controlled much of the local
 economy and been more prosperous than the Catholic community.
 Since 1972, when direct British rule was introduced in
 Northern Ireland, specific measures have been taken to combat
 religious discrimination. These include reform of the
 electoral rolls, prohibition of religious or political
 discrimination by any level of government, appointment of a
 Commissioner for. Complaints to deal with grievances against
 local government, appointment of a central housing authority
 to meet the problem of discrimination in housing, prohibition
 of discrimination in employment, and a special effort to
 recruit more Catholics into the police.
 Since 1976 the Fair Employment Agency (FEA) has served as the
 focal point of the Government's efforts to end job
 discrimination in Northern Ireland. Within the Northern
 Ireland civil service, the proportion of Catholics under age
 
 
 1301
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 35 reflects their proportion in the population, but
 Protestants still dominate in the upper age groups. In
 Northern Ireland overall, the Catholic male unemployment rate
 is 2.5 times that of Protestant men.
 The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act, approved by
 Parliament in 1989, is intended to end employment
 discrimination and is aimed at outlawing even unintentional or
 "indirect" discrimination. All public sector employers and
 private firms with 25 or more workers must register with the
 new Commission, monitor the religious composition of their
 work force, supply annual monitoring reports to the
 Commission, and review their overall employment practice at
 least once every 3 years. Employers must have regard to the
 need for affirmative action measures to remedy
 underrepresentation and consider the setting of goals and
 timetables. They will face criminal penalties and loss of
 government contracts for failure to comply with the law. The
 Act also establishes a new Fair Employment Tribunal to
 adjudicate individual complaints of discrimination. While the
 legislation has been criticized by some for not proposing
 "strong and effective provisiois for targets and timetables,"
 in general it has been praised by leaders of the Catholic
 community.
 PIRA assassinations and death threats have largely stymied
 government efforts to increase recruitment of Catholics, now
 around 10 percent, into the police force and related security
 fields. The PIRA has carried out a terror campaign not only
 against police officers but also against persons who provide
 services to the security'forces. Since 1973, for example, 26
 prison staff members were murdered while off duty.
 In Hong Kong, the Chinese language has equal status with
 English in many government operations. Legislation is enacted
 on a bilingual basis, and Legislative Council proceedings are
 conducted in both languages. The Hong Kong Government actively
 promotes "localization" of the civil service by increasing the
 number of Hong-Kong Chinese in top administrative and
 policymaking positions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 U.K. workers have the right to associate freely, choose
 representatives, publish journals, openly promote their views,
 and elect representative assemblies to determine union
 policies and procedures. Workers in the dependency of Hong
 Kong have the same rights guaranteed by the Hong Kong trade
 union ordinance. British worker rights are underlined by U.K.
 ratification of relevant International Labor Organization
 (ILO) conventions which also apply in most instances to
 dependent territories, including Hong Kong.
 U.K. unions are free of government control but must register
 their accounts with the government trade union certification
 officer. The law requires periodic selection of senior union
 officials by secret ballot. It also mandates secret ballots
 before strike calls, prohibits unions from disciplining
 persons who ignore strike calls, and establishes a procedure
 for trade union members to lodge complaints against their
 unions with a government-appointed ombudsman.
 
 
 1302
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 There i-s no specific statutory "right to strike" in the U.K.
 .or Hong Kong,:and yoluntary cessation of work may be
 considered a breach of contract. A system of immunities,
 however, protects unions and individuals from prosecution when
 engaged in legitimatedisputes. Legislation adopted in the
 1980's narrowed these immuijities in the U.K. by excluding
 secondary strikesand those deemed to be political. Unions
 encouraging such strikes were fined in the courts and had
 assets seized. -Where there is no right to strike, as with the
 police, there are alternative means to resolve disputes.
 The British Trade Union-Congress (TUC) lodged a complaint with
 the ILO, supported by the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU), ,about a series of legislative changes in
 the 1�80's. The ILO's Committee of Experts (COE) in 1989
 stated that it considers a number of aspects of the
 legislation are not compatible with the requirements of ILO
 Convention 87"on freedom of association. These include the
 concept of "unjdstifiable'discipline" by unions, the erosion
 of protection against ,civil liability for industrial action,
 and dismiSsals in connection with strikes and other industrial
 action.
 The TUC also brought a separate complaint to the ILO about
 legislated restrictions in the U.K., charges which were
 repeated in a -report of the ICFTU. The COE observed that the
 U.K. legislation was notcompatible with ILO Conventions 87
 and -98.
 The TUC also complained to the ILO that the Government as an
 employer limited4the freedom of association of public sector
 workers. qhe Government dismissed workers at a high-security
 communications .facility who retained membership in a union
 after a government ban. The COE affirmed that the dismissals
 were 'n violation of Conventiofi 87.
 U.k." and Hong Kong unions maintain active affiliations with
 international organizations, although Hong Kong uniqns must
 first obtain governmenV'permission for such affiliations.
 Politically, many major trade uni-ons in the U.K. have
 traditionally had a close relationship with the Labour Party.
 The party and the unions pride themselves, however, on their
 independence. Unions are allowed to make political
 contributions if they have voted to establish separate
 political funds. Hong Kong unions, however, are not permitted
 to have political action funds and instead emphasize social
 and cultural activities.
 b. The Right To Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is deeply
 rooted in common law. It is confirmed under appropriate ILO
 conventions ratified by the U.K. which also apply to Hong
 Kong., There is no. legal-obligation for employers to bargain
 with workers' representatives, but collective bargaining is
 extensively practiced in the U.K. and involves 10.5 million
 werker , about 40 percent of the work force. Approximately 17
 percent of Hong Kong's work force is organized.
 In 1987, after a prolonged period when the Government and
 teachers' unions failed to reach agreement, the Government
 abolished the negotiating forum for teachers' contracts and
 empowered the concerned Cabinet Minister to settle disputes
 after hearing the recommendations of an advisory body. The

 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Government said it will not establish a new negotiating
 procedure until 1991. The ILO, in response to a TUC complaint
 that this was contrary to Convention 98, asked the Government
 to ensure that new procedures would enable teachers to bargain
 collectively.
 Hong Kong workers may appeal through industrial tribunals in
 cases of alleged antiunion discrimination. Remedies may
 include reinstatement, which rarely occurs, or indemnities,
 which are rarely imposed.
 There are no export processing zones in the U.K. or its
 dependent territories and possessions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited in the U.K. and its
 dependent territories and possessions and is not practiced.
 d., Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The compulsory school age in the U.K. is 16, and children
 under that age are prevented from doing industrial work unless
 part of an educational course. Educational authorities may
 prohibit or restrict other employment of children. Child
 labor is only rarely a problem in the U.K. Children in Hong
 Kong may do part-time work at age 13 and full-time work at age
 15. The Labor Inspectorate effectively enforces Hong Kong law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The U.K. and Hong Kong do not have legislated minimum wage
 rates. In some low-wage industries in the U.K., wage councils
 of employers and trade unionists establish wage rates which
 are enforceable for workers aged 21 or over. Minimum rates so
 established are substantially below national average wage
 figures. Trade unions expressed concern that a government
 proposal in December 1988 to abolish wage councils would leave
 U.K. workers without minimum wage protection.
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 requires employers
 in the U.K. to ensure worker health and safety in ways that
 are "reasonably practicable." A Health and Safety Executive
 (HSE) enforces applicable regulations and may initiate criminal
 proceedings and issue enforcement notices. A Health and Safety
 Commission submits regulatory proposals to the Government,
 encourages research and training, and appoints investigatory
 Committees. The law allows unions to name workers as safety
 representatives and requires employers to give paid leave for
 them to fulfill their functions. An employer must establish a
 safety committee if requested by two such representatives.
 The U.K. system and practice for assuring health and safety is
 well regarded, but unions in 198& said lack of staff and
 resources limit the abilities of the HSE. Oil.rig workers
 expressed concern that the Department of Trade and Industry,
 not HSE, is responsible for safety on oil rigs.
 Under legislation in Hong Kong the Labor Department's Factory
 Inspectorate promotes workers' safety and health in industry
 through education, publicity, and inspection. In 1988 it
 conducted nearly 70,000 inspections. The Occupational Health
 Division investigates occupational disease claims, conducts
 workplace environment testing, and provides medical
 examinations to workers handling hazardous materials.
