 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional provisions
 for human rights, freely functioning political parties, regular
 elections, and universal suffrage:
 France's military/security apparatus consists of the three
 traditional services,, a 90,000-strong gendarmerie (national
 police/paramilitary force), and police forces in major cities.
 These forces come under civilian control and are highly
 professional. Nevertheless, in 1991 there were several
 confrontations between police and members of minority groups
 which deteriorated into violence (see Section l.a.).
 France .has a developed and diversified economy and a skilled
 labor force. It has substantial agricultural resources and a
 modern industrial system based on a mixture of public and
 private enterprises.
 French authorities respect human rights and civil liberties.
 France's Secretary of State for Human Rights is tasked with
 encouraging respect for human rights both in France and abroad.
 The Government in 1991, as in previous years, consistently
 condemned sporadic acts of violence against ethnic and religious
 minorities. The National Consultative Commission on Human
 Rights-which includes government representatives, leaders of
 religious and ethnic groups, and representatives of private
 human rights groups, and which is responsible to the office of
 the Prime Minister--worked closely with various human rights
 groups during the Gulf War to prevent and defuse ethnic
 conflicts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no evidence that French authorities engaged in
 political or other extrajudicial killings in 1991. The level
 of terrorism in France remained generally low, although the
 assassination near Paris of former Iranian Prime Minister
 Shapur Bakhtiar in August was widely believed to have been
 committed by foreign terrorists. The investigation of the
 incident continues. The incidents of violence perpetrated by
 domestic terrorist groups (particularly Basque and Corsican
 separatists), although increasing in frequency relative to
 1990, were nonlethal and largely symbolic.
 An example of confrontation between police and members of
 minorities is the incident in mantes-la-Jolie near Paris.
 Following an apparently deliberate hit-and-run incident by
 youths in a stolen car, whith resulted in a policewoman's
 death, her partner shot and killed a passenger in another
 stolen vehicle a few minutes later. The policeman was charged
 in connection with the shooting.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that the authorities have engaged in
 abduction or secret arrests.

 FRANCE
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 France does not condone or practice torture or cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment. In the occasional
 instances of alleged police brutality, there are administrative
 and judicial mechanisms for determining guilt and punishing
 transgressors. In regard to a case noted in the 1990 report,
 in which an American alleged mistreatment by police during his
 arrest in 1986, the French authorities denied he had been
 mistreated, although the examining magistrate found the
 American's accusations credible. The American served his
 sentence and was released. In another case reported in 1990,
 the police took no action on an American's allegations that
 they had used unnecessary force during a December 1989 search
 of his home. There were no accusations of police brutality by
 Americans arrested during 1991.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 French law provides for freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus
 in the French legal system, but there is a limit of 2 days--
 4 for drug and terrorist cases--before a suspect must be
 referred to a magistrate for investigation.
 The judiciary plays a determining role in the detention process.
 Government authority to hold a person beyond the prescribed
 periods is severely restricted, and such detention must be
 ordered by the competent court.
 There is no evidence that the authorities detained any person
 for political reasons. There is no provision for exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is provided by law and respected
 in practice. Suspects are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty and have the right to legal counsel as soon as their
 cases are transferred from the police to the magistrate. For
 misdemeanors, pretrial confinement--which is very rare-is
 limited normally to 4 months, with extensions in special
 circumstances of approximately 8 to 12 months. Although all
 drug-related crimes are technically classified as misdemeanors,
 those convicted of serious narcotics offenses are subject to
 penalties otherwise reserved for felonies. Those found guilty
 of some drug offenses may be sentenced to up to 20 years'
 imprisonment. Pretrial confinement in drug cases and in
 felonies is not limited. This pretrial period can be lengthy,
 depending upon the seriousness and complexity of the case.
 Evidence is gathered and assessed by an independent examining
 judge. Defendants are free to request and present evidence
 during this investigatory period.
 Trials in France are normally open and public, but provisions
 exist for the defense to request a closed proceeding. All
 felonies are tried before juries, and a defendant does not have
 the right to refuse a jury trial. The press has free access to
 records of court proceedings, although under French law the
 prosecutor may not disclose information about cases being tried
 or investigated. French law provides for the right of appeal
 for those convicted of misdemeanors. Those convicted of
 felonies may appeal to the Court of Cassation only on
 procedural grounds.

 FRANCE
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Rome, or
 Correspondence
 French law provides for freedom from invasion of privacy, and
 this freedom is respected in practice. The search of a private
 residence requires a search warrant and-must-take place between
 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., except in special circumstances, such as in
 drug cases, when the search may be undertaken at any time.
 Telephone conversations may be monitored by authority of a
 court order in conjunction with criminal proceedings. However,
 no court order is required in national security cases.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a: Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. Newspapers and magazines are free from government
 control and present views ranging across the political spectrum.
 There are three state-owned and three private television
 networks, in addition to private cable channels. Hundreds of
 private radio stations offer a wide array of independent,
 uncensored programming. Academic freedom of expression is
 respected in both public and private academic institutions.
 b. Freedom of'Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is widely respected
 in France, although--except for a specific reference to trade
 unions-it is not mentioned in the Constitution. Groups wishing
 to organize public meetings, protest marches, or demonstrations
 must obtain a permit from the local authorities. Permits are
 usually granted for both political and nonpolitical gatherings.
 Local authorities have on occasion, however, denied permits to
 extremist groups. Private associations, whether political or
 apolitical, must register with the prefecture in the department
 in which they are established, but they do not require the
 prefecture's authorization to exist. Such registration is
 considered routine in France. Informal associations, such as
 those without officers, bylaws, or dues, need not register.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest.-religious
 group in France, all religions are tolerated. Separation of
 church and state is guaranteed by law, although both private
 and parochial schools receive substantial subsidies from the
 Ministry of National Education.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 French law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. All lawful resident
 aliens, including refugees, may undertake foreign travel and,
 in most .instances, return to France. France has a long history
 as a haven for refugees. During 1991, however, the Government's
 expulsion of Moroccan political refugee Abdelmoumen Diouri to
 Gabon after he was accused of fraud and political agitation
 sparked widespread criticism by human rights groups. A Paris
 administrative tribunal overturned the expulsion order, and
 Diouri returned to France less than 1 month after his forced
 departure.

 FRANCE
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people have the right and ability to change their government
 by peaceful means, not only through the election of the
 President, the National Assembly, and local officials, but also
 through amendment of the Constitution by means of national
 referendum. The Constitution guarantees the equality of all
 citizens before the law, without regard to origin, race, or
 religion. All French citizens who have reached the age of 18
 may vote, except for most convicted criminals, bankrupt persons,
 and persons certified to be mentally incompetent. These
 provisions are fully respected in practice. Presidential
 elections are held every 7 years, and elections for the
 National Assembly are held every 5 years, unless the Government
 is dissolved, in which case elections may be called sooner.
 Voting is by secret ballot.
 A wide variety of political parties compete freely in regularly
 scheduled national and local elections. Many special interest
 groups--business, labor, veterans, consumer advocates,
 ecologists, and others--organize freely and regularly support
 candidates for elective office.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Both local and international human rights organizations operate
 freely in France. France has traditionally been a leader in
 the human rights field. In October France hosted an
 international human rights conference held under the auspices
 of the United Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. Nevertheless, amid rising
 anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by a rising unemployment rate,
 incidents of racism have been directed at the large Arab/Muslim
 and black African immigrant communities, as well as toward the
 Jewish population. The Government and a wide spectrum of public
 opinion have consistently condemned these incidents.
 The French media and French political leaders in 1990 became
 very sensitive to a perceived increase in anti-Semitic sentiment
 and activity, and an accompanying rise in popularity of
 rightwing extremist political groups. A law passed in 1990
 called for restricting participation in the political process
 for up to 5 years by anyone convicted of committing racist,
 anti-Semitic, or xenophobic acts. Prior laws proscribed
 "racism"; the new law was more broadly targeted, aimed at
 helping "victims of discrimination based on national, ethnic.
 racial, or religious origin." During 1991, people were brought
 to court, convicted, and began serving prison sentences under
 the new law.
 A report of the National Consultative Commission for Human
 Rights, submitted to the Goveriment in March, noted no
 substantial increase in violent crime of a racist nature and
 expressed a belief that firm judicial-penalties had begun to
 bear fruit. However, the Commission expressed concern over an
 increase in 1990 in so-called soft tacist incidents--anonymous
 threatening letters and telephone calls, tracts, and graffiti.
 
 
 1113
 FRANCE
 In 1991, at the start of the Gulf War, human rights groups
 feared another rise in racist incidents and redoubled their
 education and mediation efforts. In any event, there was no
 apparent increase in racist incidents during or immediately
 following the war.
 The French are assertive about the primacy of the French
 language in the educational system but are tolerant of the
 numerous residents of France who have non-French origins and
 whose mother tongue is not French.
 The Government does not tolerate violence and abuse against
 women, and such violence, including wife beating, is prohibited
 under article 309 of the penal code- The State Secretary for
 Women's Rights has estimated previously that as many as 10
 percent of French homes experience family violence of a
 physical, psychological, or sexual nature. The Government
 sponsors an educational campaign underscoring the need to
 address the problem.
 While French law requires that women receive equal pay for equal
 work, this requirement is not met in many cases. Women's rights
 groups actively lobby for full implementation of equal rights
 statutes and seek solutions to the increasingly publicized
 phenomenon of violence-against women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Freedom of labor union association is provided for by the
 Constitution. Although less than 10 percent (12-15 percent for
 the public sector; 5-6 percent for the private sector) of the
 work force is unionized, trade unions exercise significant
 economic and political influence. Their principal role and
 legitimacy derive from elections held by workers for
 professional works councils and other tripartite (government,
 employer, and workerl bodies dealing with social matters.
 These include labor courts and the Economic and Social Council,
 a constitutionally mandated consultative body.
 All unions are technically independent of the political parties,
 but many of the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor
 belong to the Communist Party. Leaders of most other unions
 are members of one or another faction of the Socialist Party,
 although members of other parties are also active in the labor
 movement. There, are no restrictions on the unions'
 international activities, and all three world trade union
 confederations have French affiliates.
 French workers, including civil servants- are free to strike,
 with a few exceptions in cases where strikes are determined to
 be a threat to public'safety. There were strikes of short
 duration almost daily in September and October. The attempt to
 organize a general strike by the Force Ouvriere Labor
 Confederation on October 24 was unsuccessful.
 b. The Right to Organize-and Bargain Collectively
 Workers, including those in the two small export processing
 zones in France, have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. French law- strictly prohibits antiunion
 discrimination. Amendments added in 1982 require at least
 annual bargaining on wages, hours, and working conditions at
 both plant and industry levels. The 1982 law does not require
 
 
 1114
 FRANCE
 that negotiations result in a signed contract. Outside
 mediators, drawn from the upper ranks of the civil service, may
 impose solutions that are binding unless formally rejected by
 either side within a week. About 20 percent of France's
 private sector work force is covered by annually updated,
 bilaterally conducted collective bargaining agreements. There
 are also trilateral consultations on such subjects as the
 minimum wage, temporary work, social security, and unemployment
 benefits.
 French law requires that businesses with more than 50 employees
 have a works council, in which workers are consulted on
 training, working conditions, profit sharing, and similar
 issues. Works councils are open to both union and nonunion
 employees, and elections are held every 2 years.
 Trade union rights, as guaranteed by the Constitution, extend
 to France's overseas departments and territories. Social
 benefits, such as the minimum wage or supplemental retirement
 payments, may be reduced in the overseas departments and
 territories to take into account the local economies.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and this
 prohibition is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 With a few exceptions for those enrolled in recognized
 apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Work considered arduous or work between the hours
 of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. may not be performed by minors under the
 age of 18, except in certain circumstances. Laws prohibiting
 child employment are effectively enforced through periodic
 checks by labor inspectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 France has an administratively determined minimum wage, revised
 whenever the cost of living index rises two percentage points,
 and which is sufficient to provide a decent standard of
 living. The legal workweek is 39 hours, and overtime, in an
 effort to increase employment, is restricted to 9 hours per
 week. Women may not perform arduous work or night work, except
 in certain exempted categories, such as hospitals and a few
 service industries. In October 1991, however, a police court
 aquitted a factory director of all charges in a long-running
 case in which he was accused of having permitted 77 female
 employees to work a night shift.
 French labor legislation and practices, including those
 pertaining to occupational safety and health, are fully
 comparable to those in other industrialized market economy
 countries. The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility
 for policing occupational safety and health laws. Standards
 are generally high and well enforced. To assist the Ministry,
 French law requires that any enterprise with 50 or more
 employees have an occupational health and safety committee.
 Sixty-five percent of all enterprises covering 80 percent of
 employees had such committees as of 1989.
