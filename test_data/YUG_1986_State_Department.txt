 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a
 multinational, federal state comprising six republics, one of
 which has two autonomous provinces. The league of Communists
 of Yugoslavia (Communist party) maintains a monopoly on
 political power. The ideology and practice of Yugoslav
 communism and Socialist self-management differ substantially
 from the highly centralized Soviet model of Communist rule.
 In recent years, Yugoslav society has evolved toward greater
 openness, including more freedom of speech and the press.
 In the Yugoslav political system, the party is decentralized
 so that Republic and Provincial party authorities wield power
 that is seldom challenged by the central party bureaucracy.
 In the economic system, Socialist self-management theoretically
 and legally provides that the workers run their own
 enterprises. Nearly 85 percent of agricultural land is
 privately owned, and there are some private enterprises in
 services and small-scale manufacturing.
 State security and uniformed police are under the jurisdiction
 of Federal and Republic secretariats for internal affairs.
 Security and police forces are generally subject to, and
 heedful of, overall direction from the political level,
 although on an operational basis they maintain considerable
 independence.
 Growth in 1986 in the largely decentralized Yugoslav economy
 has been broadly based but has taken place amid rampant
 inflation. The implementation of austerity and economic
 reform programs adopted in earlier years has taken longer than
 anticipated, and the Federal Government is grappling with a
 worsening trade performance, a high level of hard currency
 debt, and the perceived need to protect the Yugoslav living
 standard while enforcing financial discipline.
 Although the fundamental tenets of Socialist self-management
 and the present federal structure of the State are among the
 few subjects which cannot be questioned, there is relatively
 open debate on the implementation of these concepts. Key
 topics frequently discussed in public include the boundaries
 of permissible political and cultural expression, economic
 reform, and the functioning of the political system. Some
 issues, however, appear to be so sensitive that free speech is
 only partially tolerated. Hence, Yugoslav officials, wary of
 historically rooted separatist sentiments, have taken stern
 measures to repress displays of ethnic "nationalism."
 The human rights situation in Yugoslavia in 1986 continued much
 as in 1985, with both positive and negative developments:
 --Arrests and convictions for what are called "verbal
 crimes" (most often on charges involving "nationalism" or
 "hostile propaganda") continued at a significant level. A
 U.S. citizen (dual national) was charged with joining a
 hostile organization in Detroit and participating in an
 anti-Yugoslav demonstration in Washington, D.C., activities
 which are legal under U.S. law.
 --The well-known Croatian dissident Marko Veselica was
 released early from his prison term, and one of the two
 convicted "Belgrade Six" defendants remained at liberty. The
 other, however, began serving his 18-month prison sentence in
 July.

 YUGOSLAVIA
 --Violent incidents among ethnic groups, particularly in
 the Autonomous Province of Kosovo, continued to reflect and
 exacerbate social tensions.
 --Some 100 ethnic Albanians, allegedly irredentists, were
 prosecuted on charges of hostile activity and conspiracy to
 overthrow the State.
 --Three spontaneous mass marches, rarities in Yugoslavia,
 took place peacefully in Belgrade early in the year. A fourth
 was forcibly broken up.
 --Nearly all religious groups had significant building
 projects under way or recently completed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported instances of killing by government
 forces. In the past, Serb-Albanian ethnic tensions in Kosovo
 have resulted in violence and occasional fatalities. Attacks
 by members of one nationality on the other continued at a low
 but steady level in 1986, but no deaths were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of prolonged or permanent disappearance of
 persons inside Yugoslavia came to light.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although both Yugoslav law and the Constitution forbid
 torture, various sources reported that people (including dual
 U.S.-Yugoslav citizen detainees) were beaten, maltreated, or
 threatened during pretrial detention or while serving
 sentences. In 1986 journals in Slovenia twice carried
 extensive reports on the alleged abuse in prison in recent
 years of two prominent dissidents (Vojislav Seselj and
 Dobroslav Paraga).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 Yugoslav legal procedures derive from Napoleonic law and are
 generally followed in all, including political, cases.
 Arrests are conducted pursuant to warrants, defendants are
 usually brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest,
 persons arrested for political reasons are usually charged
 with the specific sections of the Criminal Code dealing with
 political crimes, and defendants have the right to independent
 counsel.
 "Political crime," as defined by the Yugoslav Criminal Code,
 consists of attempts to overthrow the constitutional order or
 to undermine the country's territorial integrity, unity, or
 basic constitutional system. "Political crime" includes a
 number of broad, imprecise categories such as
 "counterrevolutionary acts," "association (for the purpose of)
 hostile activity," "insulting the reputation of the President
 of the Republic," "fostering national hatred," and "hostile
 
 
 1084
 YUGOSLAVIA
 propaganda." Enforcement of these laws Varies from republic
 to republic, with the result that persons have been jailed in
 some parts of Yugoslavia for acts which in other parts of the
 country rarely, if ever, result in criminal sanctions.
 Pretrial confinement in political cases sometimes occurs.
 The Criminal Code permits the arrest and imprisonment of
 Yugoslav citizens for acts considered political offenses under
 Yugoslav law, even when they are committed abroad and are not
 crimes in the country in which they take place. Such cases
 are often based on the expression of views hostile to the
 Yugoslav regime or association with anti-Yugoslav emigre
 groups. In 1986 three such cases involved U.S.-Yugoslav dual
 nationals.
 There were no reports of the practice of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although ordinary criminal trials are almost always open to
 the public, not all political trials are. Yugoslav political
 authorities usually do not actively interfere in judicial
 proceedings concerning political cases. However, substantial
 evidence exists that in some cases Federal, Republic, and
 Provincial authorities have sought to orchestrate the trials
 of those charged with political crimes. Some human rights
 organizations believe that the outcome in political cases in
 Yugoslavia is predetermined. Other observers, including
 critics of the Government, hold that the courts have
 considerable independence, particularly in determining the
 length and type of sentences, if not innocence or guilt.
 Many persons accused of political offenses are able to find
 capable, energetic counsel, but in the past government
 authorities have sometimes intimidated or chastised attorneys
 who took political cases.
 The precise number of current political prisoners is difficult
 to determine. Official figures are hard to obtain and
 frequently contradictory or incomplete. The number of
 political prisoners countrywide was estimated by the Lawyers'
 Committee for Human Rights in 1985 to be between 600 and
 1,000. Official figures show that in 1985 charges were
 brought against 451 persons in political cases (compared to
 466 in 1984). Close to 90 percent (389) of those involved
 so-called verbal crimes, that is, charges arising from
 something the accused said or wrote. Also among those charged
 and convicted in political cases may have been persons
 involved in hostile organizations responsible for committing
 crimes of violence, who did not themselves advocate or engage
 in violence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Yugoslav authorities are widely believed to interfere on
 occasion in the private lives of citizens. Allegations of
 such interference are most common from those citizens actively
 engaged in nonofficial political activity. Although the
 judicial system provides elaborate safeguards concerning
 procedures for conducting searches, these safeguards are
 sometimes ignored. Many Yugoslavs also believe that
 authorities eavesdrop on conversations, read mail, and tap
 telephones.
 
 
 1085
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Yugoslav citizens are generally free to receive and read
 foreign publications. Infrequently, the import or sale of a
 particular issue of a foreign publication will be banned,
 usually because the issue contains a story which the
 authorities believe presents false or hostile information
 about the regime. The publications of certain Yugoslav emigre
 groups, particularly those that advocate the dissolution of
 the Yugoslav Federation or redrawing of its internal political
 boundaries, are considered hostile in themselves, and their
 importation, possession, or sale is sufficient grounds for
 bringing criminal charges.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Yugoslavia has continued its slow and sometimes halting
 movement toward greater openness and freedom of speech and
 press. In theory, both the Yugoslav Constitution and Yugoslav
 law affirm these freedoms.
 The Government grants some latitude in what it considers
 nonnationalist and nonthreatening oral expressions of
 disagreement with government policy. For example, in July
 6,500 shipyard workers in Split addressed a letter of
 complaint to local, Republic, and Federal authorities, about
 the general state of affairs. The Government also tolerates
 considerable commentary and criticism in academic and some
 quasi-official public forums. Nonetheless, a few topics
 remain sensitive, such as the status of the Autonomous
 Province of Kosovo and tendentious interpretation of the
 history of and relations between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
 With wide variations in local practice, the authorities
 periodically seek to punish those who make allegedly
 derogatory or inflammatory ethnic statements. Such "hostile"
 oral statements and other forms of personal expression (e.g.,
 painting slogans or singing "nationalist" songs) may be
 grounds for criminal prosecution. During 1986 discussion
 continued in the press and public about the desirability of
 eliminating legal provisions against such so-called verbal
 crimes, but it appears that such reform will not occur soon.
 Although both Yugoslav law and practice impose some
 restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom to publish,
 press autonomy has increased markedly in recent years.
 Neither the print nor broadcast media are censored prior to
 dissemination. Press criticism of government policies and
 proposals concerning domestic political and economic issues is
 frequent and often sharp enough to spark government charges of
 "irresponsibility." There is also ample criticism of the
 Federal Cabinet and of the League of Communists at all levels,
 but criticism of the State Presidency is rarer.
 Government oversight of the media is through publication
 boards, which include ranking party officials, and through
 editorial staffs' use of self-censorship. This type of
 control, however, is incomplete and varies from republic to
 republic. Despite government pressure not to do so, for
 instance, two Yugoslav publications carried portions of
 official files detailing Kurt Waldheim's wartime activities in
 southern Yugoslavia. The Slovenian youth press has attracted
 criticism from other republics for its open coverage of issues
 that are anathema to most senior party and government
 
 
 1086
 YUGOSLAVIA
 officials, such as civilian alternatives to military service
 and historical "reconciliation" among anti-Nazi resistance
 forces during World War II.
 There has been extensive press coverage of disagreement
 between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. A prominent example
 was a long article in a Slovenian periodical featuring an
 interview with a senior Serbian activist who protested
 "oppression" of the Slavic minority in Kosovo by Provincial
 authorities, as well as a rebuttal by an ethnic Albanian
 government official from Kosovo. At the same time, however, a
 draft document drawn up in the fall of 1986 by the Serbian
 Academy of Arts and Sciences was denounced by Serbian party
 authorities for its "nationalist" content and alleged attack
 on Tito. Overall, publications on these themes have attracted
 considerable official criticism but virtually no legal
 action.
 Public prosecutors have the power to ban the publication and
 sale of books or periodicals if authorities deem their content
 "hostile." This power is rarely used, and few publications
 are actually banned in a given year. It is difficult to judge
 the degree to which the threat of a ban or of possible
 reprisals against a publisher may discourage the publication
 of controversial literature. Banning of publications is often
 a local option, and standards of what is acceptable vary
 throughout Yugoslavia.
 In book publishing, the authorities generally provide only
 loose political oversight. Police and prosecutors rarely
 intervene. The works of Soviet and other Eastern European
 dissidents are published in large press runs and sold widely.
 Although works by some authors, such as Milovan Djilas, have
 long been banned, many writers and publishers have been
 testing the limits of the permissible. This has resulted in
 occasional clashes with the authorities. Several books were
 banned in 1986, including: an anthology of poetry by a group
 of Kosovo professors, "Fourteen Authors," because of its
 "nationalist" character; "Hunting Down of Heretics" by
 Vojislav Seselj, because of its treatment of the leadership of
 Bosnia and Hercegovina; and "The Allies and Yugoslav War
 Drama" by Veselin Djuretic, for its favorable portrayal of the
 World War II Cetnik movement.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are permitted only by official
 organizations and generally only in support of government
 policies. Others are usually, but not always, suppressed.
 Public gatherings and meetings of private organizations are
 permitted but must be registered with the authorities.
 Unauthorized mass marches were allowed to proceed in Belgrade
 in February (involving about 150 people), April (500-600
 participants), and November (about 150 participants). In
 these manifestations, disgruntled ethnic Serbs and
 Montenegrins from Kosovo Province came to Belgrade to air
 complaints of alleged abuses by the ethnic Albanian majority
 in that Province. The marchers met at length with government
 and party officials. An attempted march in June (on the eve
 of the party congress) was broken up in Kosovo by the police,
 forcibly but with little violence.
 A nascent antinuclear energy movement has enjoyed broad media
 coverage and has used petition campaigns and public roundtable
 
 
 1087
 YUGOSLAVIA
 discussions to promote its views. In the aftermath of the
 Chernobyl incident in the Soviet Union, the Government pledged
 a public debate on nuclear power before making a decision on
 construction of Yugoslavia's second nuclear power plant.
 The Socialist Youth Alliance of Slovenia has been actively
 promoting the concept of civilian alternatives to military
 service, and public debate on that issue is spreading. In
 April, after the U.S. military attack on Libya because of its
 involvement in terrorism, the Slovenian Peace Movement
 organized three gatherings in that Republic, criticizing both
 the U.S. and Libyan acts of "aggression/terrorism" as well as
 Yugoslav policy on these issues.
 The Committee for the Defense of Freedom of Thought and
 Expression, of which the well-known Serbian writer Dobrica
 Cosic and other prominent Yugoslav intellectuals are members,
 continues to speak out occasionally on human rights and
 political issues. In October it wrote to the Federal Assembly
 calling for a number of reforms in the political and legal
 system, including elimination of the "hostile propaganda"
 provision of the Criminal Code. The jailing in February of
 university professor Dragoljub Petrovic for his "offensive
 statements" in a journal article prompted a number of protest
 meetings on his behalf. During the summer a fund (initiated
 by some 200 Yugoslav authors, professors, and journalists) was
 set up to aid those who lost their jobs due to their political
 opinions. The Serbian Writers Union held several meetings in
 1986 to discuss the politically sensitive situation in
 Kosovo. In November the Belgrade section of that organization,
 through its Committee for Protection of Artistic Freedom,
 issued a statement criticizing the 1984-85 trial of the
 so-called Belgrade Six and calling for the release from prison
 of Belgrade Six defendant Miodrag Milic.
 Trade unions are organized geographically by republic and
 province, and by trade within these boundaries. At the
 Federal level, the trade union organization almost invariably
 supports government policies while pleading that any negative
 effects on workers be minimized. In practice, responding to
 Yugoslavia's persistent economic difficulties, union leaders
 are becoming more active in advocating worker interests on
 such matters as the impact of inflation, standard of living,
 and wage policies. Under Yugoslavia's system of
 self-management, however, unions generally play a relatively
 minor role in representing worker interests in the management
 of enterprises, including distribution and levels of income,
 determination of working conditions, and settlement of
 disputes.
 Strikes, usually referred to as "work stoppages," are neither
 explicitly legal nor illegal. Most strikes involve either the
 amount or distribution of personal incomes among the work
 force of a particular enterprise. Although most are brief--
 4 to 8 hours--some have lasted for several days.
 The number of strikes continued to increase in 1986, primarily
 in the more developed Republics of Croatia and Slovenia.
 During the first 6 months, 383 work stoppages took place (12.3
 percent more than during the same period in 1985), involving
 more than 38,000 workers (53 percent more than during the same
 period in 1985). Both publicly and within the Government and
 the party, the question of legalizing or regulating strikes
 and of the role of the trade unions in strike situations is
 
 
 1088
 YUGOSLAVIA
 being discussed. The apparent anomaly of labor strikes in a
 worker self-management system is central to the discussion.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Yugoslavia is a multireligious state. Most Yugoslav believers
 are adherents of the Roman Catholic Church, the Serbian or
 Macedonian Orthodox Churches, or the Islamic faith. Since
 World War II, the Jewish community has numbered only several
 thousand persons. There is a small Protestant community which
 includes fundamentalist denominations. There is no official
 or favored religion; the Government officially encourages
 atheism.
 Although freedom to practice religion is guaranteed under the
 Constitution, public proselytizing, either through electronic
 media or personal witnessing, is forbidden. The latter is
 sometimes done anyway, particularly by Jehovah's Witnesses.
 The religious communities have vigorous publishing programs,
 although they do not have their own printing facilities.
 Their publications are normally sold only through subscription
 or at places of worship. As in 1985, religious groups were
 able to distribute materials at the Belgrade International
 Bookfair. Bibles and Korans are readily available. Contacts
 with coreligionists abroad are extensive and unhindered.
 The construction of new churches and mosques requires the
 consent of local government authorities. Nearly all religious
 groups have built or are building new facilities: ground was
 broken in April for reconstruction of the Serbian Orthodox St.
 Sava Cathedral in Belgrade; an estimated eight new mosques
 were opened and the Zagreb mosque, the largest in Yugoslavia,
 may be open soon; new Protestant churches began services in
 Pristina, Pec, and Mostar; and authorities in Belgrade have
 granted permission for a new Pentecostal Church in the heart
 of the city.
 Several large religious gatherings occurred without incident.
 For example, some 60,000 people, including Federal, Republic,
 and local authorities, gathered in May at the Serbian Orthodox
 Studenica Monastery in southern Serbia to celebrate its 800th
 anniversary. A crowd of about 10,000 in Hercegnovi celebrated
 the second anniversary of the canonization of Croatian
 Catholic Saint Leopold Mandic. Macedonian authorities
 participated in "enthronement" ceremonies of the new
 Macedonian Orthodox Church leader. Authorities continued to
 tolerate large-scale pilgrimages by domestic and foreign
 Catholics to Medjugorje, a village in Bosnia-Hercegovnia where
 the Virgin Mary is said to appear regularly to several young
 people, and relaxed earlier restrictions on building public
 facilities at Medjugorje.
 Religious believers of all faiths face possible discrimination.
 For example, a party member who is a religious believer and
 takes part publicly in the sacraments of the church risks
 disciplinary action or expulsion from the party. Constraints
 on occasional attendance at services and the religious
 instruction of children vary from region to region. Primary
 education outside the state system is not permitted in
 Yugoslavia, but religious education at the secondary and
 university level is allowed and exists for all major faiths.
 Yugoslav religious communities also make vigorous efforts to
 provide religious instruction outside of school for children
 and young people.
 
 
 1089
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Conflicts between the State and Yugoslav religious communities
 develop if the latter engage in what authorities consider
 .nationalist" or political activities. The authorities
 frequently criticize the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia for
 alleged support of Croatian nationalism and political
 activism, and also have criticized the Serbian Orthodox Church
 for alleged Serbian nationalism.
 Occasionally, arrests are made on nonpolitical charges. For
 example, the Serbian Orthodox priest Sava Nedeljkovic was
 sentenced to a short prison term for allegedly hearing
 confession and giving last rites in a private home without the
 allegedly required advance permission. In that case, the
 Yugoslav Catholic press and the Belgrade news magazine NIN
 joined Serbian Orthodox spokesmen in publicly accusing the
 authorities of having gone too far.
 Yugoslav authorities regard ties between Yugoslav Muslim and
 Islamic fundamentalist groups abroad with suspicion, although
 those ties are weak. Despite Yugoslavia's lack of diplomatic
 relations with Israel, Jews--including rabbis--travel between
 the two countries, as do ordinary Yugoslav tourists and
 journalists.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and permitted in practice. However, someone who
 wishes to move permanently from Kosovo now requires
 permission. There is a prevalent belief among non-Albanians
 that the outmigration of ethnic Serbs from Kosovo Province is
 the result of anti-Serbian behavior (including personal
 threats, vandalism, and occasional violent acts) on the part
 of the ethnic Albanian majority. Serious efforts have been
 undertaken at all levels of government to stem Serbian
 emigration from Kosovo, or at least to ensure that ethnic
 pressures are not to blame. Nonetheless, the emigration
 persists and remains a significant political problem.
 Almost all Yugoslavs are able to emigrate and seek employment
 abroad. Half of the country's population possesses valid
 passports, and no exit permits are required to visit the more
 than 135 countries with which Yugoslavia has diplomatic or
 consular relations. A very small number of Yugoslavs are
 denied passports either temporarily or permanently on national
 security, political, or criminal grounds. Over 600,000
 Yugoslav workers, some with family members, are employed as
 "guest workers" in Western Europe.
 The law on the entry of foreigners to Yugoslavia notes the
 right of permanent asylum and provides for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. In addition,
 Yugoslavia extends temporary asylum to refugees who, with the
 assistance of the Belgrade office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), seek permanent resettlement
 in third countries. At present, there are about 900 such
 refugees in Yugoslavia. There were no known cases in which a
 refugee under UNHCR protection was forcibly repatriated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The 2-million-member League of Communists of Yugoslavia
 maintains a monopoly on political power, but its authority is
 
 
 1090
 YUGOSLAVIA
 dispersed and diluted because the party is decentralized to
 the level of the six republics and two provinces. Yugoslav
 politicians and the press regularly note that the country's
 eight regional party organizations hold widely differing views
 on key political issues.
 Governmental bodies are responsible for administering and
 drawing up specific policies, especially economic policies.
 At the top of the government structure are the collective
 State Presidency (Chief of State), the Federal Executive
 Council (Cabinet), and the Federal Assembly (Parliament). The
 Presidency is responsible for overall policy direction. The
 Federal Executive Council, headed by a chairman who is the
 Prime Minister, is responsible for running the governmental
 machinery and proposing specific legislation. Virtually all
 government offices mandate a rotation of officials once every
 year or 2 years, usually with the possibility of extension for
 one additional term.
 The Federal Assembly is responsible for enacting legislation.
 It operates sometimes by majority vote and sometimes by
 consensus among delegations representing the country's six
 republics and two autonomous provinces. In recent years it
 has been quite active and contentious. It has several times
 rejected or drastically altered proposals endorsed by the
 Federal Presidency and Cabinet, and it is often the scene of
 sharp debates which are generally reported fully in the
 media.
 Federal laws must also be adopted separately by Republic and
 Provincial Assemblies before they can be implemented, and thus
 these local assemblies wield considerable power, amounting at
 times to an actual veto of Federal authority. In certain
 cases, delegates to the Federal Assembly must have authorizing
 instructions from their Republic or Provincial Assemblies
 before engaging in negotiation or compromise on Federal
 legislative measures.
 Selection to Communist party bodies is accomplished by the
 party bodies themselves. Methods range from secret ballot and
 majority vote to virtual appointment. Selection to government
 bodies occurs via a delegate system. Nominations originate in
 the various sociopolitical organizations which are members of
 the mass umbrella organization, the Socialist Alliance of the
 Working People. This includes the trade unions, the League of
 Socialist Youth, and the Union of Veterans. On the local
 level, ordinary workers can and do play an active role in the
 selection process.
 In the spring of 1986, elections were held throughout
 Yugoslavia for local government and party offices. There was
 a concerted effort to offer multiple candidates for each
 opening, but this goal was not uniformly met. In some
 instances, those running unopposed failed to draw the minimum
 number of votes required for election.
 At its 13th Congress in June, the League of Communists of
 Yugoslavia approved new party rules, requiring the congress
 (rather than the Republic and Provincial parties) to elect the
 Central Committee by secret ballot and with a two-thirds
 majority for election. A proposed amendment to require
 multiple candidates in all party elections was turned down.
 Yugoslavia's many ethnic groups generally have equal access to
 political and government positions, especially through their
 
 
 1091
 YUGOSLAVIA
 respective republics and provinces. There are some
 allegations of political discrimination, particularly from
 ethnic Albanians, that Serbs are overrepresented in the party
 and government of Kosovo. However, in terms of percentages
 and visibility, these allegations were not borne out by the
 situation in 1986. Many senior executive government and party
 positions rotate annually or biennially from one nationality
 to another according to a predetermined national "key."
 For a 4-year term until the spring of 1986, the Federal Prime
 Minister was a woman. Several high-ranking positions in the
 current government are held by women, as is the presidency of
 the Trade Union Federation. However, there are still
 allegations that women cannot participate fully in government
 and political life. While full and unimpeded oportunities for
 women are mandated by law, women are underrepresented at
 higher levels, reflecting longstanding social attitudes and
 customs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to Western charges of human rights
 violations within Yugoslavia; often it attempts to dismiss
 such charges as efforts to bring pressure on Yugoslavia to
 alter its social, economic, or political system. In the past,
 government officials sometimes refused to meet with
 representatives of international human rights groups. In
 1986, however, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation from the
 United States visited Yugoslavia and had access to a wide
 range of Yugoslav officials, including at high levels. A
 representative of the International Human Rights Law Group was
 also well received, as was a Western parliamentary group
 interested in the Yugoslav judicial system.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex, and there is no racial discrimination as
 such. Despite government efforts, however, some social
 discrimination continues, particularly against ethnic
 Albanians and Gypsies. As noted above, in the Autonomous
 Province of Kosovo there have been growing complaints by the
 Serbian minority of discriminatory practices on the part of
 the Albanian majority.
 The Government has taken steps to improve the status of
 women. Maternity leave for employed women is very liberal and
 is routinely granted for periods between 9 and 12 months.
 Depending on the republic, working mothers are given day-care
 allowances based on their salaries and the number of children
 to be cared for. Also, a working mother may take sick leave
 when her child is ill for up to 2 years after its birth, and
 the father may do so when the mother is ill.
 The role of women in Yugoslavia's work force has slowly
 improved as a result of increased education and urbanization.
 According to statistics for 1984, 37.3 percent of the work
 force in the socialized sector was composed of women, as
 opposed to 34.5 percent in 1974. However, women still hold
 relatively low and poorly paid positions in their respective
 fields of employment.
 
 
 1092
 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Constitution charges government authorities at all levels
 with protection of the cultural rights of all the peoples of
 Yugoslavia. The use of the major local language is required
 in official communications between Belgrade and the various
 republics, and local languages are used in the schools,
 courts, and local media. The various nationality groups have
 the right to use their own flags, with some restrictions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Factories are owned in theory by society as a whole, with
 their assets administered by their workers, organized in
 enterprise-level workers' councils. In practice, the
 influence of workers' councils varies, but they are actively
 involved in determining workers incomes, fringe benefits, and
 working conditions. Through their trade union organizations,
 workers participate in decisions affecting housing,
 transportation, continuing education, and other living and
 working conditions.
 Working conditions and safety are regulated by Republic and
 Provincial laws. The standard workweek is 42 hours. Common
 practice is to work five 8-hour days per week and one Saturday
 per month. Most workers have the right to 1 month's paid
 vacation per year, as well as extensive sick leave.
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 16 years.
 Of the unemployed in Yugoslavia, 78 percent are under the age
 of 30, and, in practice, young people usually wait a long time
 for their first job.
