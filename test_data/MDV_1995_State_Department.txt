 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives comprises 1,190 islands scattered across an area 500
 miles long by 75 miles wide in the Indian Ocean. The population is about 245,000
 persons. The Maldives has a parliamentary form of government with a strong execu-
 tive. The President appoints the Cabinet, members of the judiciary, and one-sixth
 of the Parliament. The President derives additional influence from his constitutional
 
 
 1322
 role as the protector of Islam. Political parties are officially discouraged, and can-
 didates for the unicameral legislature, the Citizens' Majlis, run as individuals. The
 Majlis selects a single residential nominee who is approved or rejected in a na-
 tional referendum. The Majlis must approve all legislation and can enact legislation
 without presidentia, approval. Civil law is subordinate to Islamic law, but civil law
 is generaliy applied in criminal and civil cases.
 The National Security Service (NISS) performs its duties under effective civilian
 control. The NSS includes the armed forces and polie, and its members serve in
 both polie and miitary ca p acities during their careers. The police division inves-
 tigates crimes, collects intelligence, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest.
 -Fishing, small-scale agriculture, and tourism provide employment for over one-
 half the work force. Tourism accounts for over one-quarter of government revenues
 and roughly 40 per cent of foreign exchange receipts. Manufacturing accounts for
 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
 The Government restricts human rights in several areas, but the political process
 has become more open in recent years. Political groupings at odds with the Govern-
 ment have emerged in the Majlis, which plays a more active political role. However,
 the President's power to appoint a significant portion of the Parliament still con-
 strains citizens' ability to change their government. An easing of government re-
 strictions and creation of a Press Council has allowed a greater diversity of views
 in the media, but the media engaged in considerable self-censorship in the belief
 that the Government has limited tolerance for criticism. The Government limits
 freedom of assembly and association. In addition, important restrictions continued
 on the freedom of religion, and women and workers faced continuing restraints on
 the full exercise of their rights. Some of these restrictions are linked to the Govern-
 ment's observance of Shari'a (Islamic law) and other Islamic customs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Derading Treatment or Punlshment.-
 There were no reports of beatings or other mistreatment of persons in police cus-
 tody. Convicted criminals may be flogged under judicial supervision when this pun-
 ishment is prescribed by Islamic law. However, there were no reported floggings.
 Punishments are usually confined to fines, compensatory payment, house arrest, im-
 prisonment, or banishment to a remote atoll. The Government generally permits
 those who are banished to receive visits by family members.
 Prison conditions, including food and prisoner housing, are adequate. Prisoners
 are allowed to work in prison and given opportunity for regular exercise and recre-
 ation. Spouses are allowed privacy during visits with incarcerated partners. The
 Government has permitted prison visits by foreign diplomats.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution states that no person
 shall be apprehended, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or civil law. Police
 initiate investigations basedon suspicion of criminal activity or in response to writ-
 ten complaints from citizens, police officers, or government officials. They are not
 required to obtain warrants for arrests. Based on the results of police investigations,
 the Attorney Goneral refers cases to the appropriate court. The authorities generally
 keep the details of a case onfidential until they are onfident that the charges will
 be upheld.
 Depending on the charges, a suspect may remain free, detained in prison, or
 under house arrest for 15 days during investigations. The President may extend pre-
 trial detention for an additional 30 days, but in most cases the suspect is released
 if not brought to trial within 15 days. Those who are released pending trial may
 not leave a specific atoll. The law, however, permits indeimite detention without
 charge for suspects accused of drug abuse, terrorism, or attempted overthrow of the
 Government. There is no right to legal counsel during police interrogation. Nor is
 there any provision for bail.
 The Government may prohibit access to a telephone and nonfamily visits to those
 under house arrest. While there have been no reported cases of incommunicado de-
 tention in recent years, the law does not provide safeguards against this abuse.
 The Government detained three individuals in April who in October remained
 under house arrest without charge. One of the individuals had previously been ar-
 rested, charged, and convicted for his writings in the subsequently banned Magazine
 Sangu. The Government has offered no reasons for their detention, noting only that
 the case is under investigation. It is widely believed, however, that their detention
 
 
 1323
 is the result of political differences with the Government rather than due to any
 threat that the men-all of whom are elderly and well known figures-pose to na-
 tional security.
 There were no reports of external exile. However, the Government sometimes ban-
 ishes citizens to remote atolls.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution does not provide for an inde-
 pendent judiciary. The judiciary is subject to executive influence. In addition to his
 authority to review High Court decisions, the President influences the judiciary
 through his power to appoint and dismiss judges, all of whom serve at this pleasure
 and are not subject to confirmation b  the  ajlis. The President has nevertheless
 removed only two judges since 1987. Both dismissals followed the recommendation
 of the Justice Ministry which found the judges' professional qualifications to be
 below standard. The President may also grant pardons and amnesties.
 There are four summary courts, falling under the Ministry of Justice, on the cap-
 ital island, Male'. These summary courts adjudicate specialized cases, such as debt,
 theft, or property claims. There is also a High Court on Male', which is independent
 of the Justice Ministry and which handles a wide range of cases, including politi-
 cally sensitive ones, and acts as a court of appeal. Under a 1995 presidential decree,
 High Court rulings can be reviewed by a 5-member advisory council appointed by
 the President. The President also has authority to affirm judgments of the High
 Court, order a second hearing, or overturn the court's decision. In addition to the
 Male' courts, there are 204 general courts on the islands.
 There are no jury trials. Most trials are public and are conducted by judges and
 magistrates trained in Islamic, civil, and criminal law. Cases on outer islands are
 usually adjudicated by magistrates, but when more complex legal questions are in-
 vlved, the Justice Ministry will send more experienced judges to handle the case.
 During a trial, the accused may defend himself, call witnesses, and be assisted
 by a lawyer. Courts do not provide lawyers to indigent defendants. Judges question
 the concerned parties and attempt to establish the facts of a case.
 Civil law is subordinate to Islamic law, or Shari'a. Shari'a is applied in situations
 not covered by civil law as well as in certain acts such as divorce and adultery.
 Courts adjudicating matrimonial and criminal cases generally do not allow legal
 counsel in court because, according to a local interpretation of Shari'a, all answers
 and submissions should come directly from the parties involved. However, the High
 Court allows legal counsel in all cases, including those in which the right to counsel
 was denied in the lower court. Under Islamic practice, the testimony of two women
 is required to equal that of one man in matters involving finance and inheritance.
 In otrer cases the testimony of men and women are equal.
 There are some political prisoners, most of whom were associated with ilyas
 Ibrahim, the President's chief rival for the 1993 presidential nomination. Eight ]Dyas
 supporters were charged with involvement in the antistate activities for which
 Ibrahim was convicted in absentia in 1993. They were brought to trial in early 1994,
 were convicted, and sentenced to 7 years' banishment. The sentence was reduced to
 1 year on appeal and most had reportedly completed their sentences and been re-
 leased by year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits security officials from opening or reading letters, telegrams,
 and wireless messages or monitoring telephone conversations "except in accordance
 with the specific provisions of the law." The NSS may open the mail of private citi-
 zens and monitor telephone conversations if authorized in the course of a criminal
 investigation.
 Although the Constitution requires the authorities to respect private premises and
 dwellings, there is no legal requirement for search or arrest warrants. The Attorney
 General or a commanding officer of the police must approve the search of private
 residences.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Citizens enjoyed greater freedom of speech and
 expression in 1995. However, Law 4J/68 of 1968 still prohibits public statements
 that are cohtrary to Islam, threaten the public order, or are libelous. In September
 1994, a court sentenced one person to 6 months imprisonment for making false
 statements about the Government. The Penal Code prohibits inciting the people
 against the Government. However, a 1990 amendment to the Penal Code decrimi-
 nalized "any true account of any act of commission or omission past or present by
 the Government in a lawfully registered newspaper or magazine, so as to reveal dis-
 satisfaction or to effect its reform."
 The Press Council established by the Government in 1994 is composed of govern-
 ment and private media representatives, lawyers, and government officials. It con-
 
 
 1324
 
 tinues to oversee the press and protect the rights of journalists. The Council has
 deferred efforts to draft a code of ethics for journalistic activity, leaving that effort
 to the journalists themselves. The Government has not amended regulations that
 make publishers responsible for the content of the material they publish, despite re-
 ports in 1994 that the regulations were under review and a change was likely.
 During the year there were no reports of government censorship of either the
 print or electronic media, nor were there closures of any publications or reports of
 arrests or intimidation of journalists. Journalists, however, are widely believed to
 engage in self-censorship, particularly on political topics, for fear that the Govern-
 ment will retaliate against them.
 Television news and public affairs programming routinely discussed topics of cur-
 rent concern and freely criticized government performance. Regular press con-
 ferences are conducted by government ministers.
 The Government owns and operates the only television and radio station. It does
 not interfere with foreign broadcasts or the sale of satellite receivers. Reports drawn
 from foreign newscasts are aired on the government television station. Cable News
 Network is shown, uncensored, daily on local television.
 Seventy-six newspapers and periodicals, 13 of which are government-published,
 are registered with the Government. Aafathis, a morning daily, is published by the
 brother of the President's principal political rival, Ilyas Ibrahim, and is often critical
 of government policy. An evening daily, Haveer, is published by one of the Presi-
 dent's supporters.
 There are no legal prohibitions on the import of foreign publications except those
 containing pornography or material otherwise deemed objectionable to Islamic val-
 ues. No seizures of foreign publications were reported this year. There are no re-
 ported restrictions on academic freedom, nor any governmental censorship or control
 over classroom materials. Some teachers are reportedly vocal in their criticism of
 the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assembly, as long as the law or the Islamic code of behavior are upheld.
 The Home Ministry permits public political meetings during electoral campaigns but
 limits them to small gatherings on private premises. The Government registers
 clubs and other private associations if they do not contravene Islamic or civil law.
 While not forbidden by law, political parties are officially discouraged by the Presi-
 dent on the grounds that they are inappropriate to the homogeneous nature of soci-
 ety. However, there is an active and outspoken opposition group within the Majlis
 that has stimulated closer parliamentary examination of government policy.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The Con-
 stitution designates Islam as the official religion and requires all citizens to be Mus-
 lims. The practice of any religion other than Islam is prohibited by law. However,
 foreign residents are allowed to practice their religion if they do so privately.
 There are no places of worship for adherents of other religions. The Government
 prohibits the importation of icons and religious statues. It also prohibits non-Muslim
 clergy and missionaries from proselytizing and conducting public worship services.
 Conversion of a Muslim to another faith is a violation of Shari'a and may result in
 a loss of the convert's citizenship, although law enforcement authorities say this pro-
 vision has never been applied.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 p atriation.-Citizens are free to travel at home and abroad, emigrate, and return.
 ecause of overcrowding, the Government discourages migration into the capital is-
 land of Male' or its surrounding atoll. There were no reports of forced expulsion of
 those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens' ability to change their government is constrained, as a strong executive
 exerts significant influence over both the legislature and the judiciary. The Majlis
 chooses a single presidential nominee who must be a Sunni Muslim male. The can-
 didate is not permitted to campaign for the nomination and is confirmed or rejected
 b secret ballot in a nationwide referendum. In 1993 President Gayoom was re-
 elected to a fourth 5-year term.
 The elected members of the Majlis serve 5-year terms. All citizens over 21 years
 of age may vote. Of the body's 48 members, 40 are elected-2 from each of the 19
 inhabited atolls and 2 from Male'-and the President appoints 8 members. Individ-
 uals or groups are free to approach members of the Majlis with grievances or opin-
 ions on proposed legislatioi, and any member may introduce legislation.
 The office of the President is the most powerful political institution. The Constitu-
 tion gives Islamic law preeminence over civil law and designates the President as
 
 
 1325
 the protector of Islam. The President's authority to appoint one-sixth of the Majlis
 members, which is one-third of the total needed for nominating the President, pro-
 vides the President with a power base and strong political leverage.
 Relations between the Government and Majlis have been constructive. The Gov-
 ernment may introduce legislation, but may not enact a bill into law without the
 Majlis' approval. However, the Mals may enact legislation into law without presi-
 dential assent if the President fails to act on the proposal within 30 days or if a
 bill is repassed with a two-thirds majority. In recent years, the Majlis has become
 increasingly independent, rejecting 8 government bills since 1990 and sending 28
 bills to committee for review.
 In 1993 the Majlis introduced a question time in which members may question
 government ministers about publicolicy. Debate on the floor has since become in-
 creasingly sharp and more open. The last Majls election was held in December
 1994. A cording to South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation observers, the
 elections were generally free and fair. Irregularities were observed and repelling re-
 quired in one of 29 constituencies. Over 200 candidates campaigned freely for 40
 seats.
 Women are not eligible to become president but may hold other government posts.
 For reasons of tradition and culture, few women seek or are selected for public of-
 fice. In 1994 two women served in the Majlis and one in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no active local human rights groups. The Government has been respon-
 sive to at least one foreign government's interest in examining human rights issues.
 The Government also facilitated the visit of a team of South Asian Association for
 Regional Cooperation election observers in 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution declares all Maldivians equal before the law. Women, however,
 have traditionally been disadvantaged in Maldivian society, particularly in terms of
 education and the application of Islamic law to matters such as divorce, inheritance
 and testimony in leg  proceedings.
 Womnen.-There are no firm data on the extent of violence against women because
 of the value attached to privacy in this conservative society. Police officials report
 that they receive few complaints of assaults against women. Maldivian women's
 rights advocates agree that wife beating and other forms of violence are not wide-
 spread. Rape and other violent crimes against women are rare.
 Women traditionally have played a subordinate role in society, although they now
 participate in public ife in growing numbers and gradually at higher levels. Well-
 educated women maintain that cultural norms, not the law, inhibit women's edu-
 cation and career choices. In many instances, education for girls is curtailed after
 the seventh grade, largely because parents do not allow girls to leave their home
 island for one having a secondary school. Due largely to orthodox Islamic training,
 there is a strong strain of conservative sentiment-especially among small business-
 men and residents of the outer islands-whih opposes an active role for women out-
 side the home.
 Under Islamic practice, husbands may divorce their wives more easily than vice
 versa, absent any mutual agreement to divorce. Islamic law also governs inherit-
 ance, granting male heirs twice the share of female heirs. A woman's testimony is
 equal to only one-half of that of a man in matters involving finance and inheritance
 (see Section i.e.). Women who work for wages receive pay equal to that of men in
 the same positions. About 10 per cent of uniformed NSS personnel are women.
 Children.-:The Government does not have a program of compulsory education.
 The Government is committed to protection of children's rights and welfare. Govern-
 ment policy provides for equal access to educational and health programs for both
 male and female children. Laws protecting children's rights apply with equal force
 to children of either sex.
 Children's rights are incorporated into law, which specifically protects children
 from both physical and psychological abuse, including at the hands of teachers or
 parents. The Ministry of Home Affairs has the authority to enforce this law, takes
 its responsibility seriously, and has received strong popular support for its efforts.
 There is no reported pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no law that specifically addresses the rights
 of the physically or mentally disabled. However, the Government has established
 programs and provided services for the disabled. There is no legislated or mandated
 accessibility for the disabled.
 
 
 1326
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-While the Government does not expressly prohibit
 unions, it recognizes neither the right to form them nor the right to strike. There
 were no reports of efforts to either form unions or to strike this year.
 The work force consists of approximately 57,000 persons, about 20 per cent of
 whom are employed in fishing. About 17,000 foreigners work in Maldives. Many are
 from Sri Lanka and India and work in resort hotels so that Maldivian nationals
 may avoid serving liquor. Many factory workers are also foreign laborers; others are
 engaged in construction projects. The great majority of workers are employed out-
 side the wage sector. The Government estimates that the manufacturing sector em-
 ploys about 15 per cent of the labor force and tourism another 10 per cent.
 In 1995 the U.S. Government suspended Maldives' eligibility for tariff preferences
 under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences because the Government failed
 to take steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to Maldivian work-
 ers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law neither prohibits nor
 protects workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. Wages in the private
 sector are set by contract between employers and employees and are usually based
 on the rates for similar work in the public sector. There are no laws specifically pro-
 hibiting antiunion discrimination by employers against union members or organiz-
 ers. The Government has exerted pressure in the past to discourage seamen from
 joining foreign seamen's unions as a means to secure higher wages. During the year
 there were no reported complaints alleging such discrimination. In addition, there
 were no reports of government interference with workers' attempts to join unions.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 prohibited by law. However, there were no reports that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no compulsory education
 law. A 1992 law bars children under 14 years of age from "places of waged works
 and from work that is not suitable for that child's age, health, or physical ability
 or that might obstruct the education or adversely affect the mentality or behavior
 of the child." An earlier law prohibits government employment of children under the
 age of 16. There are no reports of children being employed in the small industrial
 sector, although children do work in family fishing, agricultural, and commercial ac-
 tivities. The hours of work of young workers are not specifically limited by statute.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1994 the Government promulgated its first
 set of regulations for employer-employee relations. The regulations specify the terms
 that must be incorporated into employment contracts and address such issues as
 training, work hours, safety, remuneration, leave, fines, termination, etc. There is
 no national minimum wage for the private sector, although the Government has es-
 tablished wage floors for certain kinds of work. Given the severe shortage of labor,
 em loyers must offer competitive pay and conditions to attract skilled workers.
 There are no statutory provisions for hours of work, but the regulations require
 that a work ontact specy the normal work and overtime hours on a weedy or
 monthly basis. In the public sector, a 6-hour day and a 6-day workweek have been
 established through administrative circulars from the President's office. Overtime
 pay for working more than 6 hours a day was instituted in the public sector in 1990.
 Employees are authorized 20 days of annual leave, 30 days of medical leave, mater-
 nity leave of 45 days, and special annual leave of 10 days for extraordinary cir-
 cumstanoes. There are no laws governing health and safety conditions; however,
 there are regulatory requirements that employers provide a safe working environ-
 ment and ensure the observance of safety measures.
