 ARMENIA
 Armenia has a Constitution that provides for the separation of powers; however,
 the directly elected President has extensive powers of appointment and decree that
 are not balanced by a legitimate legislature or an independent judiciary. The Presi-
 dent appoints the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the Cabinet. Robert
 Kocharian was elected President in a multicandidate election in March after former
 President Levon Ter-Petrossian was forced to resign in February by his former polit-
 ical allies in the Defense and Internal Affairs and National Security Ministries. Ter-
 Petrossian's reelection in 1996 was flawed by numerous irregularities and serious
 breaches.of the election law. In an interview in December, the former Interior Min-
 ister admitted that Ter-Petrossian avoided a runoff against a strong opponent in the
 1996 presidential elections by falsifying the results of the first round. The March
 elections were an improvement with respect to the ability of a number of candidates
 to campaign more freely, with access to the media; however, the voting and counting
 process revealed numerous irregularities, including bloc voting by the military and
 a turnout inflated at least 10 percent by ballot box stuffing and other fraud. Al-
 though the Parliament is no longer as docile as in previous years, the current par-
 liamentary majority usually votes in support of the executive branch, and does not
 represent effectively either the views of the population or existing political party
 composition. Armenian National Movement (ANM) members won 88 percent of the
 seats in a transitional National Assembly elected in 1995 in elections that local and
 international observers characterized as "generally free but not fair;" however, most
 of the ANM members had deserted the party by February. The current Parliament
 showed increasing independence late in the year, as it tried to distance itself from
 unpopular government reform measures before the scheduled May 1999 parliamen-
 tary elections. The legislature approves new laws, must confirm the Prime Min-
 ister's program, and can remove the Prime Minister by a vote of no confidence. Both
 the Government and the legislature can propose legislation. The Constitution pro-
 vides for an independent judiciary; however, in practice, judges are subject to pres-
 sure from the executive branch and frequently corrupt.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security is responsible for domestic
 security, intelligence activities, border control, and the national police force. Mem-
 bers of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The transition from a centralized, controlled economy to a market.economy contin-
 ues to move forward, despite the collapse of the industrial sector. Industrial output
 remains low. About 50 percent of the population is unemployed or underemployed,
 and there is a high degree of income inequality. Most small and medium enterprises
 have been privatized, as has most agricultural land. About 75 percent of landowners
 now have secure title to their land. Gross domestic product (GDP) increased about
 6 percent during the year, to about $600 per capita. Inflation, fell to under 5 percent
 for the year. Foreign assistance and remittances from Armenians abroad play a
 major role in sustaining the economy.
 The Constitution provides for broad human rights protections, but human rights
 problems persist in several important areas. Substantial intervention by local power
 structures in the March presidential election continued -to -restrict citizens' ability
 to change their government peacefully- Members of the security forces routinely beat
 detainees during arrest and interrogation, made arbitrary arrests and detentions
 without warrants, and did not respect constitutional protections regarding privacy
 and due process. Prison conditions remained poor. The judiciary is subject to politi-
 cal pressure and does not enforce constitutional protections effectively. There are
 some limits on press freedom; journalists practice self-censorship. State television,
 which refrains from criticizing government policy, remains the major source of news
 for most of the population, but independent television and newspapers, along with
 private radio stations, offered substantial competition. The nongovernmental media
 
 
 1116
 
 often criticize the country's leadership and policies. Burdensome.registration re-
 quirements hinder freedom of association. The law places some restrictions on reli-
 gious freedom, including a prohibition on proselytizing by religions other than the
 Armenian Apostolic Church. Registration requirements for religious groups kept Je-
 hovah's Witnesses from being able to operate legally, and seven Jehovah's Witnesses
 are in jail for refusing military service. The Government places some restrictions on
 freedom of movement. Discrimination against women, minorities, and the disabled
 remains a problem.
 After his election, President Kocharian appointed an opposition presidential can-
 didate to head two presidential commissions charged with improving human rights
 and reforming the Constitution to create a more even balance of power among exec-
 utive, legislative, and judicial branches. One of Kocharian's first actions was to le-
 galize the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF/Dashnaktsutyun) and to pres-
 sure successfully the judiciary to secure the release of many persons convicted in
 politically linked trials. At the new President's urging, the Supreme Court quickly
 reviewed and set aside the convictions of Dashnak and other figures convicted for
 political reasons in the "Dro" and "31" trials in 1996 and 1997.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 Shortly after midnight on December 10, Deputy Minister of Defense Vahram
 Khorkhoruni was shot and killed at the entrance to the apartment building in
 Yerevan where he lived. The Ministry of Defense posted a $100,000 reward for infor-
 mation on the killing, but at year's end there was no information available on the
 status of the investigation.
 There were a number of deaths of military servicemen reportedly due to mistreat-
 ment (see Section 1.c.).
 There were a number of deaths in custody due to poor prison conditions and inad-
 equate medical treatment (see Section 1.c.).
 Charges against five police officers for a 1993 death, a case repeatedly remanded
 for investigation by the Supreme Court, were never pressed despite assurances by
 a previous Prosecutor General.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and the law prohibit torture. However, the practice of security per-
 sonnel beating pretrial detainees during arrest and interrogation remains a routine
 part of criminal investigations. Most cases of police brutality go unreported. Pros-
 ecutors rely on confessions to secure convictions. Although defense lawyers may
 present evidence of torture in an effort to overturn improperly obtained confessions,
 and according to law all such charges must be investigated, judges and prosecutors
 routinely ignore such complaints even when the abuser can be identified. No one
 has been charged or disciplined for the beatings of opposition figures following the
 September 1996 postelection disturbances.
 The Government has not conducted investigations of abuse by security services
 except in rare cases in which death has resulted. The legal system responded with
 mixed results to the August 1997 death in police custody of a youth in Gyumri. Of
 four police officers arrested for abuse of authority in connection with that death, in
 August one was sentenced to 6 years' imprisonment and two to suspended sen-
 tences. The appeals court sent one of the suspended sentences back for reinvestiga-
 tion, recommending a more severe penalty. A fourth defendant, released from pre-
 trial detention after high-level intervention, failed to appear for his trial, but report-
 edly could be found if authorities so chose.
 Under pressure from human rights groups, the military took some steps to im-
 prove the investigation of peacetime deaths of servicemen due to mistreatment. A
 human rights group alleged that in 1997 as many as one soldier a day died of non-
 combat causes, but noted that such deaths declined in 1998. According to the mili-
 tary prosecutor, stricter control on military units led to a 33 percent reduction in
 military deaths in 1997, and a further 25 percent reduction in such deaths in the
 first 6 months of 1998, but he provided no figures. Military officers are held account-
 able for widespread abuse of troops under their authority only in rare cases, gen-
 erally when death or serious injury has provoked a significant reaction from rel-
 atives and human rights organizations. A military murder-suicide in February led
 to lengthy prison sentences in October for soldiers and officers implicated in serious
 mistreatment of conscripts.
 
 
 1117
 
 Prison conditions are poor. Facilities are often overcrowded, and food is inad-
 equate to preserve health unless supplemented by assistance from families. Medical
 and sanitary facilities in prisons are inadequate. Tuberculosis and other commu-
 nicable diseases are common and there were a number of deaths during the year.
 Although agreement in principle has been reached to transfer responsibility for pris-
 ons to the Ministry of ustice from the Ministry of Internal and National Security
 Affairs with a goal of improved oversight, no formal action to that effect was taken
 by year's end.
 On March 8, persons alleged to be associated with the Yerkrapah faction violently
 broke up an election rally in Ararat by the National Democratic Union (NDU). Eight
 NDU members were hospitalized as a result of the attack, including Filaret
 Berikyan, the NDU representative to the Central Election Committee. The police
 chief of Ararat was fired for failure to maintain order. Four of the alleged attackers
 were arrested, convicted, and sentenced in June by the Ararat court to 2 years in
 prison for interfering in the electoral process. The sentence was suspended and the
 four were placed on probation.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) enjoyed unimpeded access
 to detention facilities run by the Ministry of Interior and National Security. ICRC
 representatives are able to visit any prisoner in whom they have an interest wheth-
 er in prisons or local police stations. The ICRC continues to visit the remaining Dro
 prisoners (see Section i.e.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Authorities continued to arrest and de-
 tain criminal suspects without legal warrants, often on the pretext of being a mate-
 rial witness. Those arrested frequently are brought to prison without notification of
 family members. It often is several days before family members obtain information
 of an arrest and the person's location. Access by lawyers and family members to
 prisoners is often restricted until the preliminary investigation phase is complete,
 a process that can last weeks.
 The transitional provisions of the Constitution provide that the Soviet-era proce-
 dures for searches and arrests are to be maintained until the new Criminal Code
 and Criminal Procedure Code come into effect in January 1999. A suspect may be
 jailed for no more than 12 months pending trial, after which the suspect must be
 released or tried. However, this latter provision is not always enforced. There is no
 provision for bail, although detainees may sign a document and remain at liberty
 under their own recognizance pending trial.
 The ICRC reported that civilian and military personnel on all sides of the
 Nagorno Karabakh conflict occasionally engage in cross-border hostage taking, usu-
 ally to win release of a friend or relative held on the other side, but sometimes for
 financial gain. The ICRC successfully assured a number of prisoner exchanges but
 has no access to undeclared hostages.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution nominally provides for
 an independent judiciary, its provisions do not appear designed to insulate the
 courts from political pressure. Other legal and constitutional provisions make judges
 and prosecutors dependent on the executive branch for their employment. In prac-
 tice courts are subject to political pressure and corruption. The inherited Soviet sys-
 tem views the court largely as a rubber stamp for the prosecutor and not a defender
 of citizens' rights. Prosecutors still greatly overshadow defense lawyers and judges
 during trials. Under the Constitution, the Justice Council, headed by the President,
 the Prosecutor General, and the Justice Minister, appoints and disciplines judges
 for the tribunal courts of first instance, review courts, and the Court of Appeals. The
 President appoints the other 14 members of the Justice Council and 4 of the 9 Con-
 stitutional Court judges. This authority gives the President dominant influence in
 appointing and dismissing judges at all levels. This executive branch predominance
 was apparent in March when then Acting President and presidential candidate
 Kocharian used his authority to dismiss a regional prosecutor involved in investigat-
 ing election law violations. Judges are subject to review by the President through
 the Council of Justice after 3 years. Thereupon, their tenure is permanent until they
 reach the age of 65.
 According to the transitional provisions of the Constitution, the existing courts re-
 tain their powers until the new judicial system begins to function on January 12,
 1999. District courts try most cases, with a right of appeal to regional courts and
 then to the Supreme Court. In 1999 the Supreme Court and regional courts are to
 be replaced by review courts and a court of appeals as required by the Constitution.
 The Constitutional Court rules on the conformity of legislation with the Constitu-
 tion, approves international agreements, and decides election-related legal ques-
 tions. It can accept only those cases proposed by the President, one-third of all Na-
 tional Assembly deputies, or election-related cases brought by candidates for par-
 
 
 1118
 
 liament or the presidency. Unless the Constitution is amended, the Constitutional
 Court is not an effective guarantor of constitutional human rights safeguards.
 The judicial system continued its transition. As part of the package of judicial re-
 form legislation mandated by the Constitution, both judges and prosecutors began
 a process of retraining and recertification in order to retain their positions. In De-
 cember sitting and prospective judges took a multiple choice test based on pre-
 viously published questions and answers regarding the new legal codes to determine
 their fitness to be judges under the new system. At year's end, the Justice Minister
 was interviewing those who scored in the top half of the examination prior to formal
 selection by the Judicial Council. The executive branch continued to have a domi-
 nant role in judicial selection.
 The revised civil and criminal codes that are scheduled to be introduced in Janu-
 ary 1999 are designed to clarify contradictory provisions of the law and create a
 more unitary, modern, and workable legal system. However, prosecutors are ex-
 F ected to continue to have more influence than judges. President Kocharian estab-
 ished in June a constitutional reform commission, one of whose goals is to strength-
 en the independence of the judiciary and to give the courts more authority in safe-
 guarding human rights. It was unclear at year's end whether these constitutional
 revisions would pass the National Assembly, after which they would require ratifica-
 tion by a referendum in 1999. In addition to the proposed reforms, increased judicial
 independence and a balance among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches
 are critical to the success of judicial reform.
 The military tribunal operates essentially as it did in the Soviet era. Military
 prosecutors perform the same functions as their civilian counterparts, operating in
 accordance with the Soviet-era legal code. In mid-year the military prosecutor abol-
 ished military ranks for the prosecutors in his service.
 Trials are public except when government secrets are at issue. Defendants are re-
 quired to attend their trials unless they have been accused of a minor crime not
 punishable by imprisonment. Defendants have access to a lawyer of their own choos-
 ing. The court appoints an attorney for any defendant who needs one. Defendants
 may confront witnesses and present evidence. The Constitution provides that those
 accused of crimes shall be informed of charges against them. However, the constitu-
 tionally-mandated presumption of innocence is ineffective, and acquittals are rare
 once a case comes to trial. Defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal.
 Opposition parties and some human rights groups charged that some of the de-
 fendants in 1997 trials were political prisoners.
 After the resignation of President Ter-Petrossian in February, then Acting Presi-
 dent Kbcharian intervened to pressure the judiciary to secure the release from pris-
 on of many of the persons convicted in the politically linked trials of the "Dro" and
 "31" groups. On March 31, the judicial panel of the Supreme Court struck down the
 verdicts against 27 of the "31" defendants. The court cited the "changed political sit-
 uation" in closing the cases against these 27 persons. The court upheld the verdict
 against four defendants found guilty of the murder of two policemen. All but one,
 who was sentenced to death for murder, later were released. Subsequently 6 of the
 11 "Dro" case defendants also were released. In both cases, defendants involved in
 serious crimes such as terrorism and murder had been tried along with senior ARF
 members whose real or alleged crimes were fundamentally political in nature. ARF
 leader Vahan Hovhannsian was released from prison in Februar and appointed a
 presidential advisor in April. Those convicted of premeditated murder and other se-
 rious crimes remained in jail, including three persons condemned to death. Ar-me-
 nian law lacks an adequate test (for example, "clear and present danger") for defin-
 ing the difference between protected free speech and illegal calls to overthrow the
 Government by violent means. Without the safeguard of a strong, independent judi-
 ciary, the former administration was free to misuse the law for political reasons to
 cripple the ARF, while the interim administration of President Kocharian likewise
 intervened, thereby gaining the political support of the ARF for the election cam-
 paig.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--The
 Constitution prohibits unauthorized searches and preserves citizens' rights to pri-
 vacy and coni denti ty of correspondence, conversations, and other messages. Pro-
 cedurally, the security ministriesmust petition the prosecutor's office for permission
 to wiretap a telephone or intercept correspondence. The prosecutor's office purport-
 edly must find a compelling need for the wiretap before granting the agency permis-
 sion to proceed. No evidence of illegal wiretapping came to public attention during
 the year.
 The law requires security forces to obtain a search warrant from a prosecutor be-
 fore conducting. a search; in practice, searches continue to be made without a war-
 rant. The Constitution provides that the judiciary must exclude evidence obtained
 
 
 1119
 without a warrant. Legislation passed in 1997 to improve security of bank deposits
 has been enforced.
 Promised new quarters by the mayor after the site originally offered (two rooms
 in a children's library) had been forcibly reclaimed in July 1997 by local Yerkrapah
 officials at the behest of the children's librarian, a human rights library in Vanadzor
 was still seeking resources at year's end to make the replacement quarters usable.
 No charges were ever filed against the persons who forced the lock on the human
 rights library.
 There continued to be violations of the right to privacy during army conscription
 drives. Armed forces recruiters sometimes take hostages to compel the surrender of
 draft-evading or deserting relatives. There are credible reports of improper conscrip-
 tion of refugees from Azerbaijan. There were no reported cases of punitive conscrip-
 tion of males who offended local officials, and sweep operations for draft-age men
 were less evident than in previous years.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. The Government generally respects freedom of speech. There are
 some limits on freedom of the press. There is no official censorship, publications
 present a variety of views, and the opposition press regularly criticizes government
 policies and leaders, including the President, on sensitive issues such as the
 agorno Karabakh peace process.
 However, to avoid retribution experienced in years past on the part of powerful
 officials and other individuals, journalists practice self-censorship, particularly in re-
 porting on major corruption or national security issues. There were no reported inci-
 dents of retribution during the year, but journalists remain cautious in their report-
 ing and the range of subjects considered sensitive for national security is relatively
 large.
 Newspapers, with the exception of Hayastani Hanrapetutyun and Respublica Ar-
 menia (both joint ventures between Parliament and their staffs), are privately
 owned. The state printing house and distribution agency both now function as com-
 mercial enterprises, with no visible government intervention.
 In September Parliament dismissed Editor in Chief Lisa Chagaryan, of the par-
 liament-funded newspaper Hayastani Hanrapetutyun for "perpetual distortion and
 incorrect coverage of the activities of Parliament, lowering its prestige." After brief
 protests by the staff, which asserted its right to participate in management deci-
 sions, publication resumed under a new editor.
 Newspapers operate with extremely limited resources, and none are completely
 independent of patronage from economic or political interest groups or individuals.
 Total newspaper circulation is small, about one copy per 100 persons. During the
 year, the state-owned newspaper printing and distribution companies were
 privatized, except for a small government stake. There were no complaints of gov-
 ernment pressure on news media.
 During the year, the state institutions that had tended previously to exert control
 over the media lost most of their functions. The Department of Information, created
 in 1997 to replace the disbanded Ministry of Information, continued to exist, but
 with no clear purpose beyond allocating small government subsidies to newspapers
 and occasionally interceding with the state-owned newspaper distribution agency to
 forward a share of its receipts to the newspapers. A board created in late 1997 with
 representatives from the President's Office, Government, and Parliament, to super-
 vise the transformation into commercial enterprises of the state-owned press agen-
 cy, printing and newspaper distribution was not active during the year. However,
 the President's Office continued to influence state television news coverage.
 The ARF newspaper Yerkir, which the Government shut down in 1994, reopened.
 The Dashnaks also print Hayots Ashkhar and other smaller periodicals. They are
 not restricted from opening other media.
 The two most widely available television channels belong to state television and
 take policy guidance from the Government; presenting mostly factual reporting, they
 avoid editorial commentary or criticism of official actions. During the March elec-
 tions, they showed substantial bias in favor of Acting President Kocharian. The
 state television news service was reorganized extensively and renamed in October
 after complaints about poor quality programming. In Yerevan and major regional
 media markets, private television stations now offer independent news coverage of
 good technical quality. Most radio stations are private. Opposition parties and politi-
 cians received adequate news coverage and access on these channels. Legislation
 has not been passed yet to regulate the current arbitrary and nontransparent proc-
 ess of license issuance. Draft broadcast and media laws, the subject of intensive dis-
 cussion among journalists, were revised extensively but had not been discussed by
 
 
 1120
 the full Parliament at year's end. One new measure announced in the fall, a dou-
 bling in licensing fees for television broadcasters, was expected to have a serious ef-
 fect on struggling private stations; these stations appealed for the measure's can-
 cellation. The few international newspapers and magazines imported are not
 censored. There are no restrictions on reception of satellite television and other for-
 eign media and this material is not censored.
 The Government partially respects academic freedom. There are more than 50 pri-
 -vate institutions of higher education. The Ministry of Education must approve the
 curriculum of all schools that grant degrees recognized by the State, seriously limit-
 ing the freedom of individual schools and teachers in their choice of textbooks and
 course material.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice with some important exceptions. There are
 cumbersome registration requirements for all parties, associations, and organiza-
 tions. The process of registering an organization is time consuming, and some
 human rights or political organizations have been compelled by the Government to
 revise their bylaws several times in order to have their registration accepted. A
 dozen new political parties registered with one sent back to revise its bylaws. The
 ARF party was allowed to reregister in 1998, and is once again a legal political
 party, following a 3-year ban.
 Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that the Minister of Justice refused to reg-
 ister some nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), including human rights groups
 that attempted to register. According to HRW, the Ministry refused to provide a
 written acknowledgement that a registration request had been made or to provide
 an explanation for the denial.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, the law specifies some restrictions on the religious freedom of adherents of
 faiths other than the Armenian Apostolic Church.
 The 1991 Law on Freedom of Conscience establishes the separation of church and
 state, but grants the Armenian Apostolic Church special status. The law forbids
 "proselytizing" (undefined in the law) except by the Apostolic Church, and requires
 all religious denominations and organizations to register with the State Council on
 Religious Affairs. Petitioning organizations must "be free from materialism and of
 a purely spiritual nature," and must subscribe to a doctrine based on "historically
 recognized holy scriptures."
 A presidential decree issued in 1993 supplemented the 1991 law and strengthened
 the position of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The decree enjoins the Council on
 Religious Affairs to investigate the activities of the representatives of registered reli-
 gious organizations and to ban missionaries who engage in activities contrary to
 their status. No action -was taken against missionaries during the year.
 In 1997 Parliament passed legislation tightening registration requirements by
 raising the minimum number required for registration from 50 to 200 adult mem-
 bers. It banned funding for foreign-based churches from centers outside the country.
 The legislation also mandated that religious organizations except the Apostolic
 Church need prior permission-from the State Council on Religious Affairs to engage
 in religious activities in public places, to travel abroad, or to invite foreign guests
 to the country. Despite these mandated restrictions, in practice there is no restric-
 tion on travel by religious personnel of any denomination.
 As of year's end, established religious groups had reported no adverse con-
 sequences from the new law. The ban on foreign funding has not been enforced and
 is considered unenforceable by the Council on Religious Affairs. No registered reli-
 gious group was denied registration under the amended law. All existing denomina-
 tions reregistered except the Hare Krishnas, who reportedly dropped below even the
 previous 50-member threshold and hence did not seek to reregister. A few new orga-
 nizations registered, in some instances groups created after splits in previous orga-
 nizations. One new religious group registered, Pentacostals, bringing the number of
 registered religious organizations to 44. However, the Council continued to deny reg-
 istration to Jehovah's Witnesses, no longer on the grounds that the group does not
 permit military service, but because illegal proselytism is allegedly integral to its
 activity. The President's Human Rights Commission declined to intervene, rec-
 ommending that Jehovah's Witnesses challenge their nonregistration through the
 courts, as provided by law. At year's end, six members of Jehovah's Witnesses were
 in detention and a seventh was free on probation. They were charged with draft
 evasion or, if forcibly drafted, with desertion. Another 20 were reportedly in hiding
 from the draft. Alternative nonmilitary service is sometimes available for persons
 
 
 1121
 willing to act as teachers in remote villages, an option not offered to members of
 Jehovah's Witnesses. No religious literature was seized, unlike in 1997.
 According to the law, a religious organization refused registration cannot publish
 a newspaper or magazine, rent a meeting place, have its own program on television
 or radio, or officially sponsor the visas of visitors. Jehovah's Witnesses have prob-
 lems renting meeting places; lack of official visa sponsorship means that Jehovah's
 Witnesses' visitors must pay for a tourist visa.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country,
 foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, but the Government places restrictions
 on some of these rights. The Government may deny passports to persons possessing
 state secrets, to those subject to military service, and to those whose relatives have
 made financial claims against them. Men of military age must overcome substantial
 bureaucratic obstacles to international travel. The Government does not restrict in-
 ternal movement, and citizens have the right to change freely their residence or
 workplace; however, they must negotiate with a corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy
 to register these changes. Nonetheless, this practice is now more a nuisance than
 an impediment. In addition registration of a residence is a difficult process, particu-
 larly or those who live in a rented dwelling.
 After the Nagorno Karabakh conflict erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan in
 1988, ethnic minorities on both sides were subject to discrimination and intimida-
 tion, often accompanied by violence intended to drive them from the country. Almost
 all of the ethnic Azeris living in Armenia at the time, some 185,000 persons, fled
 to Azerbaijan. Of the 400,000 ethnic Armenians then living in Azerbaijan, 330,000
 fled to and were granted refugee status in Armenia. The majority of the rest took
 refuge in Russia, with small numbers remaining in Azerbaijan.
 The National Assembly passed a law on citizenship in 1996 that provides for refu-
 gees of Armenian ethnicity to gain citizenship, provided they are stateless and have
 resided in the country for the past 3 years. During the year, the Government imple-
 mented regulations for the law and began new efforts to encourage refugees to ac-
 cept Armenian citizenship. Although a few thousand have become citizens, most ref-
 ugees are reluctant to do so, fearing the loss of housing, military exemptions, and
 other benefits accorded refugees.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ethnic Arme-
 nian refugees.
 There are no provisions in law for granting refugee/asylee status in accordance
 with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and Its 1967 Pro-
 tocol.
 Armenia respects the right of first asylum in principle, but in the absence of a
 law specifying procedures for formal recognition of political asylum, the small num-
 ber of Sudanese and other migrants not of Armenian ethnicity only rarely are grant-
 ed residence permits, and their legal status remains unclear. Border officials have
 no training in asylum issues. In some cases, persons denied permission for legal res-
 idence are subject to fines for illegal residence when they attempt to depart the
 country. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where
 they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Serious flaws in the March presidential election continued to restrict the constitu-
 tional ability of citizens to change their government peacefully, as had the previous
 Government's manipulation of the 1996 presidential election. Serious breaches of
 the election law and numerous irregularities in the 1995 parliamentary elections,
 and the 1996 and 1998 presidential elections resulted in a lack of public confidence
 in the integrity of the overall election process.
 In an interview in December, the former Interior Minister admitted that Ter-
 Petrossian avoided a runoff against a strong opponent in the 1996 presidential elec-
 tions by falsifying the results of the first round.
 In both rounds of the presidential elections in March, Organization for Security
 and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observers witnessed very substantial irregular-
 ities and concluded that the elections seriously challenged international democratic
 norms in regard to most key criteria. There were unusually high voter turnouts in
 certain areas, particularly in the second round, and these increases corresponded di-
 rectly to high vote percentages for then Acting President Kocharian. Based on de-
 tailed analysis of the results tracked by observer reports in certain districts, it ap-
 pears that ballot box stuffing, discrepancies in vote counts, a large number of unau-
 thorized persons in polling stations, and other fraud perpetrated by local power
 
 
 1122
 structures inflated the number of votes for Kocharian by well over 100,000 votes in
 the second round, which he won by approximately 290,000 votes. Some military
 units were compelled to vote without exception for Kocharian, and officials used
 pressure to encourage a large turnout for the "official" candidate. Voters enjoyed a
 full spectrum of choices among candidates; all presidential candidates were provided
 opportunities to present themselves to the electorate through the provision of free
 and paid access to state media. However, state television, the most influential single
 source of information, provided coverage biased heavily in favor of the acting presi-
 dent. The electoral process fell far short of the authorities' commitments to their
 citizens. In September the Election Commission set aside the results of a seriously
 flawed municipal by-election in the city of Artashat.
 There were no legal consequences for electoral fraud. The Government pursued
 only minor violations and no penalties were announced. There was no criminal in-
 vestigation of the amply documented ballot box stuffing.
 A universal electoral code, which must be completed before the May 1999 par-
 liamentary elections, remained the subject of extensive debate in the National As-
 sembly. Parliament discussed several competing drafts, which, after a year of meet-
 ings and conferences with political party representatives, local NGO's, and inter-
 national experts, for the most part reflected international standards. At year's end,
 Parliament had not yet completed action. Key issues still outstanding were the
 question of proportional versus majoritarian representation and creation of bal-
 anced, effective, and impartial electoral commissions. The Government's decision to
 postpone a national census until 2001 for budgetary reasons raised political sus-
 picions about the process of creating new electoral districts, since existing voter rolls
 and other population records are out-of-date and seriously flawed.
 Under the Constitution, the President appoints the Prime Minister and has con-
 siderable influence in appointing judges. The Constitution provides for independent
 legislative and judicial branches, but in practice these branches are not insulated
 from political pressure from the executive branch.
 The Government appoints the 10 regional governors (marzpets). The Constitution
 gives local communities the right t elect local authorities. However, local elected
 officials have limited powers and are overshadowed in practice by the appointed gov-
 ernors, who can remove them from office.
 The National Assembly continued to operate as a part-time institution for the du-
 ration of its first term. Regular sessions are held twice a year: the first from mid-
 September to mid-December; and the second from early February until mid-June.
 Approximately one-third of the parliamentarians have been designated full-time
 deputies. Given the press of legislative business connected with the total reform of
 the legal system, special sessions frequently are called, but may not last more than
 6 days.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in
 government and politics. However, due to traditional social attitudes, both are
 underrepresented in all branches of government. There are no female cabinet min-
 isters. Only 11 of the 190 deputies in the Parliament are women. There are no mi-
 nority representatives in the Cabinet or in the Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several human rights NGO's that are active and operate openly, criti-
 cize abuses publicly, and publish their findings on government human rights viola-
 tions. In general public access to information on human rights cases improved some-
 what, with extensive private media coverage of significant court cases, and more
 openness by civilian and military prosecutors.
 The Government has permitted monitoring of human rights by the Council of Eu-
 rope and the ICRC, which had full access to civilian detention facilities for the first
 time during the year.
 The Government invited an OSCE election observer mission to observe the entire
 course of the 1998 presidential elections and provided international observers with
 unimpeded countrywide access. Current electoral law allows local observer organiza-
 tions to monitor parliamentary elections but not the presidential polls.
 An office created by the Prosecutor General in 1997 to communicate with inter-
 national observers was responsive to requests for information, although information
 about criminal cases remained relatively general and incomplete.
 In April President Kocharian appointed a prominent opposition politician to head
 a new human rights commission based in the President's Office. This new commis-
 sion has no formal legal powers but has had a modest impact in getting authorities
 to review official actions on issues ranging from apartment allocations to police be-
 havior, in some cases winning official reconsideration.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status
 is prohibited by the Constitution. However, cultural and economic factors prevent
 women, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with disabilities from partici-
 pating fully in public life, and the religion law discriminates against some religious
 groups.   ,
 Women.-There is no specific law banning violence against women. Few cases of
 rape, spousal abuse, or other violence against women were reported in this conserv-
 ative, patriarchal society; however, their number is likely higher than the statistics
 indicate. In the first 11 months of the year, the Prosecutor's Office registered 25
 cases of rape. There are no separate statistics for other instances of violence against
 women. The law (the old Soviet code) cites specific punishments for rape, forced
 abortion, forbidding a woman from marrying, and discrimination in hiring due to
 pregnancy.
 In view of the phenomenon of Armenian women working as prostitutes in the
 Middle East, it is likely that trafficking in women and girls is more of a problem
 than the Government and women's organizations have recognized.
 In the workplace, women receive equal pay for equal work, but generally are not
 afforded the same professional opportunities given to men and often are relegated
 to more menial or low-skill jobs. The 1992 Law on Employment prohibits discrimi-
 nation in employment, but the extremely high unemployment rate makes it difficult
 to gauge how effectively the law has been implemented to prevent discrimination.
 According to a women's group, women make up 69 percent of those officially reg-
 istered as unemployed.
 Currently there are more women receiving university and postgraduate education
 than men.
 Children.-The Government does not have the economic means to provide fully
 for the welfare of children. Education is free, universal, and compulsory through age
 16, but facilities are poor and teachers are forced to tutor pupils privately to sur-
 vive. Free children's health care is available, but of poor quality, with an increasing
 trend toward overt or concealed payment of fees for service. Girls and boys receive
 equal educational opportunities. The Government focuses its efforts on children's
 rights and welfare with measures to insulate large families-those with four or
 more children-from the effects of the country's current difficult circumstances. The
 Government similarly directs foreign humanitarian aid programs toward large fami-
 lies. Despite social programs, the problem of street children remains significant. The
 family tradition is strong, and child abuse does not appear to be a serious problem.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides for the right to social secu-
 rity in the event of disability. The 1993 Law on Invalids provides for the social, po-
 litical, and individual rights of the disabled but does not mandate the provision of
 accessibility for the disabled. In its current economic circumstances, the Government
 has difficulty fulfilling its commitments in this area. The Government's enforcement
 of the rights of the disabled remains rudimentary. Legal safeguards for those with
 psychiatric problems are inadequate to protect patients' rights. There is societal dis-
 crimination against the disabled. Hospitals, residential care, and other facilities for
 the seriously disabled do not meet international norms. The Health Ministry and
 the U.N. Children's Fund hosted a conference on disabilities in August that brought
 useful new attention to the subject from various international organizations.
 Religious Minorities.-There was no reported violence against minority religious
 groups. However, newer religious organizations are viewed with suspicion. Six mem-
 bers of Jehovah's Witnesses were in detention at year's end, and a seventh was free
 on probation. They were charged with draft evasion or, if forcibly drafted, with de-
 sertion. Another 20 were reportedly in hiding from the draft. Alternative non-
 military service is sometimes available for persons willing to act as teachers in re-
 mote villages, an option not offered to members of Jehovah's Witnesses. A leading
 Armenian Apostolic Church cleric published a virulent press attack on Jehovah's
 Witnesses in September, calling them servants of the Anti-Christ. Some other reli-
 gious groups previously have been accused of proselytism, including using material
 inducements or offers of emigration to entice converts. A relatively high percentage
 of members of some of these religious groups, particularly Hare Krishnas but evan-
 gelical Christians as well, joined the wave of emigration from the country, for social,
 economic, and philosophical reasons. Despite the previous Government's pledge to
 apprehend those alleged "Yerkrapah" members, who staged a series of destructive
 attacks against a dozen religious groups in 1995, the authorities took no steps dur-
 ing the year to bring the perpetrators to justice
 National/Racial/Ethnic   Minorities.-In  his  inaugural  address, President
 Kocharian made special mention of the rights of the country's national minorities.
 
 
 1124
 The Government does not discriminate against the small, officially recognized, "na-
 tional" communities, though their economic and social situation has deteriorated
 substantially since independence in 1991. Groups that the Government includes in
 this category are Russians, Jews, Kurds, Yezidis, Georgians, Greeks, and Assyrians.
 Following the protracted Nagorno Karabakh conflict (see Section 2.d.), there is no
 significant Azeri minority. The several hundred Azeris or persons of mixed Azeri
 heritage still living in the country maintain a low profile in the face of societal dis-
 crimination.
 The Constitution grants national minorities the right to preserve their cultural
 traditions and language, and the 1992 law on language provides linguistic minori-
 ties with the right to publish and study in their native language. There are token
 publications in minority languages, but the Government has devoted minimal re-
 sources to maintaining minority language schools. The large network of Russian-
 language schools has been reduced greatly in recent years. In practice virtually all
 students, including members of the Yezidi and Greek communities, now attend Ar-
 menian-language schools with very limited classes in their mother tongue. In the
 Yezidi community, a high percentage of pupils do not attend school, partly for family
 economic reasons and partly because of discrimination from ethnic Armenian school-
 mates and teachers.
 Yezidi leaders met with the new Government and the President's human rights
 commission in July to repeat long-standing complaints that their community (which
 speaks a Kurdish dialect and practices a traditional non-Christian, non-Muslim reli-
 gion) is subject to discrimination by police and local authorities. They cited numer-
 ous incidents of unfair adjudication of land, water, and grazing disputes; nonreceipt
 of privatized agricultural land; and lack of police response to even serious crimes
 committed against Yezidis. The Yezidi complaints likely reflect societal discrimina-
 tion as well as the general problem of pooriy functioning local governing bodies. The
 Commission reaffirmed the Government's commitment to improving the situation
 but took no specific steps.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides employees with the right
 to form and join trade unions and the right to strike. The Constitution stipulates
 that the right to form associations-including poitical parties and trade unions--
 may be limited with respect to persons serving in the armed services and law en-
 forcement agencies. A 1993 presidential decree prohibits the Government and other
 employers from retaliating against strikers and labor leaders, but workers have no
 confidence in this protection. In practice labor organization remains weak due to
 high unemployment and the weak economy. Workers have neither the financial re-
 sources to maintain a strike nor enforceable legal protection against retaliation, and
 the existing unions play a relatively passive role. However, there were no reports
 of retaliation against strikers or labor leaders. The purportedly independent labor
 federation created in December 1997 took no action during the year.
 The absence of real unions and accurate employment data precludes a reliable es-
 timate of the percentage of the workforce that is unionized.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations. 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is not
 practiced. The Constitution provides all citizens with the right to a just wage no
 lower than the minimum set by the Government. Although the 1992 Law on Em-
 loyment provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively, voluntary and
 irect negotiations do not take place between unions and employers without the par-
 ticipation of the Government because most large employers remain under state con-
 trol. The near collapse of major industrial production has undercut the organization
 of labor unions.
 The Government encourages profitable factories to establish their own pay scales.
 Factory directorates generally set the pay scales without consultation with employ-
 ees. Wage and other labor disputes are adjudicated through the Arbitration Court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-The Constitution and the 1992
 Law on Employment prohibit forced and bonded labor, including that by children,
 and it is not known to occur. This provision is enforced by the local councils of depu-
 ties, unemployment offices, and, as a final board of appeal, the Arbitration Commis-
 sion.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-According
 to the 1992 Law on Employment, 16 years is the minimum age for employment.
 Children may work from the age of 14 with the permission of a medical commission
 and the relevant labor union board. The Law on Employment is enforced by the
 local councils of deputies, unemployment offices, and, as a final board of appeal, the
 
 
 1125
 
 Arbitration Commission. Forced or bonded labor by children is prohibited, and it is
 not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets the minimum wage by
 decree. In October Parliament quintupled the national minimum wage to $10 (5,000
 drams) per month; however, the minimum wage is insufficient to support an individ-
 ual.
 The majority of the population lives below the officially recognized poverty level
 as a result of the economic dislocations caused by the breakup of the Soviet Union,
 the 1988 earthquake, the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh, and the resulting blockade
 and disruptions in trade. The majority of enterprises are either idle or operating at
 a fraction of their capacity. Some furloughed workers still are receiving minimal
 partial compensation from their enterprises, but most are no longer receiving any
 payment if they are not working. The standard legal workweek is 41 hours; many
 persons work multiple jobs.
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to clean and safe work places,
 but Soviet-era occupational and safety standards remain in force. Labor legislation
 from 1988 places responsibility on the employer and the management of each firm
 to ensure "healthy and normal" labor conditions for employees, but it provides no
 definition of healthy and normal. The employment situation is such that workers
 are unlikely to attempt to remove themselves from hazardous working conditions
 due to the risk of losing their jobs.
