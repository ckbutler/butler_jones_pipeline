 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania, a parliamentary democracy, regained its independence in 1991 after
 more than 50 years of forced annexation by the Soviet Union. The Constitution,
 adopted by referendum in 1992, established a 141-member unicameral legislature,
 the Seimas; a directly elected President, who functions as Head of State; and a Gov-
 ernment formed by a Prime Minister and other ministers, appointed by the Presi-
 dent and a pproved by the Seimas. The Government exercises authority with the ap-
 proval of the Seimas and the President. In fair elections in 1992, the Lithuanian
 Democratic Labor Party (LDDP)-the successor to the Communist Party of Lithua-
 nia, which in 1989 broke away from the Soviet Communist Party-won a majority
 of parliamentary seats and formed the Government. In 1993 voters elected Algirdas
 Brazauskas, the then Chairman of the LDDP, as President.
 A unified national police force under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry is
 responsible for law enforcement. The State Security Department is responsible for
 internal security and reports to Parliament and the President. The police committed
 a number of human rights abuses in 1994.
 Since independence, Lithuania has made steady progress in developing a market
 economy. Over 40 percent of state property, including most housing and small busi-
 nesses, has been privatized. Trade is diversifying, with a gradual shift to Western
 markets. Industry employs 42 percent of the labor force, and agriculture 18 percent.
 Major exports include electronic goods, food, and chemical and petroleum products.
 The Government generally respects basic freedoms and civil liberties. It enacted
 the Preventive Detention Law as a temporary measure in 1993 but extended it for
 an additional year. The law, part of the Government's efforts to combat violent orga-
 nized crime, extended the permissible period of detention for criminal suspects to
 2 months. Some opposition members of Parliament and the Lithuanian Lawyers' As-
 sociation expressed concern that the Government might abuse its provisions (see
 Section 1.d.).
 Police reportedly beat detainees and, in one instance, caused a young man's death.
 Police surveillance allegedly occurs not only in the battle against organized crime
 but also in other circumstances; no one has attempted thus far to challenge its legal-
 it. News publications and journalists expressed concern about a draft press law
 which would restrict freedom of the press; an impartial committee is reviewing the
 draft law. Abuse of women is reportedly common, but the Government has not de-
 veloped an effective mechanism for dealing with it.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. In one well-publicized case, however, police officers in the town
 of Visaginas arrested a young man for disorderly conduct in October and beat him
 to death. The prosecutor initiated proceedings against the police officer suspected
 of killing the young man. At year's end, the case was still pending.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports that Lithuanian officials engaged in or condoned torture.
 However, police sometimes beat or otherwise physically mistreated detainees. The
 local press reported that incidents of police brutality were becoming more common.
 In many instances, the victims reportedly are reluctant to bring charges against po-
 lice officers out of fear of reprisals. The Ministry of the Interior generally has been
 unwilling to publicize statistics on reported cases of police brutality. In the first 9
 months of 1994, 65 cases of reported police brutality were investigated, of which 18
 resulted in convictions of the police officers concerned.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Except in cases that come under the pro-
 visions of the Preventive Detention Law (described below), police may detain a per-
 son for up to 72 hours, based upon reliable evidence of criminal activity. At the end
 of that period, police must decide whether or not to make a formal arrest, and a
 magistrate must approve an arrest warrant. The authorities have a total of 10 days
 to present supporting evidence. Once a suspect is formally charged, prosecutors may
 keep the suspect under investigative arrest for up to 2 months before taking the
 suspect to court. In exceptional cases, investigative arrest may be extended by a fur-
 ther 6 to 9 months with the written approval of the Procurator General. The Con-
 stitution provides for the right to an attorney from the moment of detention.
 In an effort to cope with the rise in violent organized crime, Parliament in 1993
 passed the Preventive Detention Law pertaining to persons suspected of being vio-
 lent criminals. The Law, which was passed as a temporary measure, allowed police,
 but not internal security and armed forces, to detain suspected violent criminals up
 to 2 months rather than only for the standard 72-hour period. The effect of the Law
 is to give prosecutors and investigators additional time to conduct an investigation
 and file formal criminal charges against the detainee. Those apprehended must be
 released after 2 months if an investigation does not lead to formal charges. Local
 police commissioners must obtain the Procurator General's approval of each arrest
 carried out under the provisions of this law.
 Parliament voted in December 1993 to extend the temporary law for an additional
 year, but with several new provisions. Checks on prosecutorial abuse are provided
 by the requirements that a detainee (1) must be informed within 3 hours following
 arrest about the length of preventive detention being considered (not to exceed 2
 months) and (2) must be brought before a court within 48 hours of arrest for a rul-
 ing on the legality of detention. Furthermore, a detainee has the legal right to con-
 sult with an attorney during the period of detention. The law gives law enforcement
 officials wide latitude in making arrest decisions and may be open to abuse. Police
 detained over 400 suspected members of criminal gangs under the provisions of this
 law. In several well-publicized cases, the law helped to convict and sentence dan-
 gerous criminals to lengthy prison terms. In many other instances, however, the
 suspects were freed without charge after expiration of the maximum detention pe-
 nloa
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Wal.-Legal reform efforts departing from the former So-
 viet model continued in 1994, with Parliament's passage of new civil and criminal
 procedure codes as well as a Court Reform Law. The judicial system presently con-
 sists of a two-tier structure of district courts and a Supreme Court, which is an ap-
 pellate court. There is also a Constitutional Court. Court decisions are arrived at
 independently. The Procurator General exercises an oversight responsibility through
 a network of district prosecutors who work with police investigators--employed by
 the Ministry of the Interior-in preparing the prosecution's eviaence for the courts.
 The institution of lay assessors was abolished at the end of the year.
 Under the provisions of the Court Reform Law, to be implemented starting in
 January 1995, two new kinds of courts will be created. Local district courts will be
 set up below the present district courts to handle cases at the municipal level, while
 a new appellate court level will hear appeals arising from district court decisions,
 thereb reducing the case load of the overburdened Supreme Court. In addition, as
 a result of Lithuania's accession to the Council of Europe, the Ministry of Justice
 has begun a thorough review of Lithuania's laws with a view towards bringing them
 into accord with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the right to counsel. In practice, the
 right to legal counsel is abridged by the shortage of trained advocates who find it
 difficult to cope with the burgeoning numbers of criminal cases brought before the
 courts. Outside observers have recommended the establishment of a public defender
 :sstem to regularize procedures for provision of legal assistance to indigent persons
 carged in criminal cases. By law, defense advocates have access to government evi-
 dence and may present evidence and witnesses. The courts and law enforcement
 agencies generally honor routine, written requests for evidence. There were no polit-
 ical trials.
 Government rehabilitation of over 50,000 persons charged with anti-Soviet crimes
 during the Stalinist era led to reports in 1991 that some people alleged to have been
 involved in crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation had benefited from
 this rehabilitation. A special judicial procedure was established to examine each
 case in which an individual or organization raised an objection that a rehabilitated
 person may have committed a crime against humanity. In 1994 the Supreme Court
 overturned the rehabilitation of three persons whose cases were pending from 1993.

 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The au-
 thorities do not engage in indiscriminate or widespread monitoring of the cor-
 respondence or communications of citizens. With the written authorization of a proc-
 urator or judge, however, police and the security service may engage in surveillance
 and monitoring activities on grounds of nationa security. Except in cases of hot pur-
 suit or the danger of disappearance of evidence, police must obtain a search warrant
 si led by a prosecutor before they may enter premises.
 I is widly assumed, however, that law enforcement agencies have increased the
 use of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the expansion of organized
 crime. There is some question as to the legal basis of this  lice surveillance, but
 there are no known legal cases challenging the le ality o   e surveillance. The
 former president of the Lithuanian National Bank, who charged that eavesdropping
 devices were found in his office in 1993, publicly called on the Procurator General
 to investigate the incident. The press reported that although the devices were in
 fact found and are in the possession of the new bank management, the authorities
 failed to pursue investigation of the incident.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is widely respected. Prior re-
 straint over either print or broadcast media and restrictions on disclosure are pro-
 hibited, unless the Government determines that national security is involved.
 Nevertheless, oumalists working for the state-owned electronic media complained
 about pressure by superiors to avoid criticism of government policies in their tele-
 vision and radio reporting. Most independent news publications and many promi-
 nent journalists protested in September against the previsions of a draft press law,
 which they thought severely restricted freedom of the press. The ruling party an-
 nounced the formation of an impartial committee to review the proposed press law
 and the previsions which prompted the protests.
 Many investigative journalists covering organized crime were harassed by and re-
 ceived death threats from these groups. A copublisher and editor of a widely read
 daily, who wrote extensively on organized crime, was murdered in October 1993. In
 October 1994, the Supreme Court convicted four persons with criminal backgrounds
 of murder in the case. One person received a death sentence, which will be subject
 to court review in early 1995.
 Five private radio stations, including one broadcasting in Polish, are on the air.
 Two private television stations also broadcast reglar programming to a wide audi-
 ence. On February 17, virtualloy all of these private radio and television stations
 broadcast a simultaneous public appeal for suppot against the Government's al-
 leged attempts to monopolize the electronic meda. Representatives of the private
 electronic media have complained for some time about the unfair broadcasting rates
 that the Government sets which allegedly favor the state radio and television sta-
 tions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are no laws that pro-
 hibit public gatherings. During 1994 a large number of public meetings and dem-
 onstrations took place.
 The Constitution provides for, and the authorities respect, the right of citizens to
 associate freely, requiring only that they inform local government authorities of
 planned demonstrations.
 The Communist Party of Lithuania and other organizations associated with the
 Soviet regime continue to be banned.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The authorities did not restrict the exercise of the con-
 stitutional right to religious freedom in 1994.
 During the year, representatives of some Protestant denominations and smaller
 religious communities continued to protest against a pending draft law on religion
 that classifies religions according to whether they are considered "established" or
 "unestablished."
 A small Jewish community exists, largely in the main cities. Jewish leaders called
 on officials to provide better police protection for Jewish cemeteries in Kaunas,
 Vilnius, and Kalvaria which have been subject to increasing vandalism and pilfer-
 ing. The city government of Kaunas established an ad hoc committee, including po-
 lice officials and Jewish community representatives, to look for ways to improve se-
 curity at the Jewish cemeteries. Kaunas officials said they would try to increase
 funding for the upkeep and protection of the cemeteries.
 The Prime Minister on September 22 publicly deplored the Nazi-initiated killing
 of 200,000 Lithuanian Jews during World War IL He apologized to the Jewish peo-
 ple for the fact that several hundred Lithuanians actively assisted the Nazis in car-
 rying out their genocidal aims and pledged to prosecute suspected Nazi war crimi-
 nals who are deported back to Lithuania. Toward year's end, the Jewish community
 
 
 881
 became apprehensive regarding anti-Semitic articles in a leading independent news-
 paper and sent an open letter to the President, asking that he condemn these arti-
 cles. Jewish representatives noted that the President had met them to discuss the
 issues raised in the letter, but by year's end he had not publicly condemned the arti-
 cles in question.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the law, citizens and permanent residents are permitted free
 movement within, and return to, their country. There are no restrictions on foreign
 travel.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy. The election law provides for a secret
 ballot in parliamentary elections. Of 141 parliamentary seats, 71 are elected directly
 and 70 through proportional representation. A party must draw a minimum 4 per-
 cent of the national vote in order to gain a seat through proportional representation.
 National minority slates are exempt from this rule. Two of the four Union of Poles
 representatives won their seats on a proportional basis, even though the union slate
 captured only 2 percent of the nationwide proportional vote.
 The Citizenship Law, adopted in December 1991, is generally inclusive with re-
 gard to the country's ethnic minorities. The Law provides citizenship to persons who
 were born within the borders of the Republic; w o were citizens of Lithuania prior
 to 1940 and their descendants; and who became citizens under previous lega au-
 thority. Over 90 percent of Lithuania's ethnic Russian, Polish; Belarusian, and
 Ukrainian inhabitants received citizenship. Qualification for naturalization of per-
 sons not covered by the above-mentionedcategories requires 10-year residency, a
 permanent job or source of income, knowledge of the Constitution, renunciation of
 any other citizenship, and proficiency in Lithuanian. Well over 90 percent of ethnic
 Poes, Russians Belarusians, and Ukrainians residing in Lithuania in 1991 were
 granted citizenship.
 While there are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics or gov-
 ernment, they are underrepresented inpolitical leadership positions. There are only
 10 female deputies in the 141-member Seimas, and no female ministers serve in the
 current Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Lithuania is an umbrella or-
 ganization for several small human rights groups which operate without govern-
 ment restriction. In October the Government established the Department of Inter-
 national and Human Rights within the Justice Ministry, which is to monitor Lithua-
 nian laws and legal practice to determine whether these are in accord with Lithua-
 nia's international obligations. The authorities actively encouraged international
 and nongovernmental human rights groups to visit Lithuania.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 or ethnic background.
 Women.-The Constitution provides equal rights for men and women, and official
 policy specifies equal pay for equal work. Generally, men and women receive the
 same pay for comparable work, but women are largely underrepresented in some
 professions and in the managerial sector as a whole. Nonetheless, significant in-
 equalities in Lithuanian society based on gender continue. Lithuanian society still
 has very conservative views about the role of women in society. The fact that wom-
 en's enrollment now exceeds that of men in some university faculties has prompted
 university administrations to introduce preferential entrance criteria for men to re-
 dress what is perceived as an abnormal state of affairs. Parliamentary deputies
 speaking about female deputies in public sometimes make unflattering comments
 based on gender stereotypes, without eliciting any unusual public reaction.
 Abuse of women in the home is reportedly common, especially in connection with
 alcohol abuse by husbands, but institutional mechanisms for coping with this prob-
 lem are only now being started. One private women's organization is attempting to
 establish a shelter for abused women. According to a recent sociological survey, 20
 percent of women report experiencing an attempted rape, while another 33 percent
 report having been beaten at least once in their lives. Official statistics on the inci-
 dence of abuse of women in the home are not filed separately from other categories
 of assault. Women's groups report some resistance among law enforcement officials
 
 
 882
 to collecting and releasing such statistics. Persons convicted of rape generally re-
 ceive sentences of from 3 to 5 years in prison.
 Children.-The Ministries of Social Protection and of the Interior shared official
 responsibility for the protection of children's rights and welfare in 1994. Starting in
 1994, the Children's Rights Service of the Ministry of Social Protection took on
 many of the functions formerly handled by the Interior Ministry and its subordinate
 police officers throughout the country, thereby focusing more attention on the social
 welfare needs of children. Press reporting on crime throughout the year noted a
 number of instances of severe beatings of children by parents that resulted in hos-
 pitalization or even death. Social welfare workers believe that child abuse in connec-
 tion with alcohol abuse by parents is a serious problem. The prevalence of authori-
 tarian values in family upbringing, however, has discouraged more active measures
 against child abuse. The latest statistics available indicate that 5 children between
 1 and 14 years of age were murdered in 1994, while 61 were subject to varying
 kinds of abuse.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Non-Lithuanian ethnic groups, including
 Russians Poles, Belarusians, Ukrainians, and Jews, comprise roughly 20 percent of
 the population.
 Non-Lithuanians, especially Poles, have expressed concerns about the possibility
 of job discrimination arising from implementation of the language law. Many public
 sector employees were required to attain a functional knowledge of Lithuanian with-
 in several years, although the authorities have been granting liberal extensions of
 the time frame in which this is to be achieved. During the  t half of 1994, lan-
 guage-testing committees tested 7,299 people for whom Lithuanian is not a native
 guage. Of those examined, 6,394 were certified as language qualified. There is
 no documented evidence of dismissals based on application of this law. Lithuanian
 authorities have indicated that the intent of the law is to apply moral incentives
 to learn Lithuanian as the official language of the State; theyhave asserted that
 no one would be dismissed solely because of an inability to meet the language re-
 quirement.
 People With Disabilities.-The Law on Integrating Disabled People, passed in
 1991, provides for a broad category of rights and government benefits to which dis-
 abled people are legally entitled. However, given severe budgetary constraints, the
 Government has been able to allocate only modest sums towards implementation of
 the law. The equivalent of $3.25 million was disbursed in 1994. A considerable por-
 tion of this sum was channeled through a number of social organizations represent-
 ing the disabled. Government funds, for example, were provided to groups that
 drated labor contracts for disabled workers in different sectors of the national econ-
 omy.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Law on Trade Unions and the Constitution
 recognize the right of workers and employees to form and join trade unions. The
 Law on Trade Unions formally extends this right to employees of the police and the
 armed forces, although the Collective Agreements Law of 1991 does not allow collec-
 tive bargaining by government employees involved in law enforcement and security-
 related work.
 In 1990 the Lithuanian branch of the USS.R.'s All-Union Central Council of
 Trade Unions, grouping 23 of 25 trade unions, renamed itself the Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions C       and began asserting increased independence from its So-
 viet parent. In 1993 the CFTU joined eight other unions that also had been a part
 of the All-Union Central Council to form the Lithuanian Trade Union Center
 (LTUC).
 The Lithuanian Workers Union (LWU) was formed in 1990 as an alternative to
 the CFTU. Unlike the CFTU/LTUC, the LWU was an early supporter of Lithuanian
 independence from the Soviet Union and actively sought Western free trade union
 contacts. The LWU now claims a dues-paying membership of 50,000 organized in
 35 regional groupings.
 There are no restrictions on unions affiliating with international trade unions.
 The Law on Trade Unions and the Constitution provide for the right to strike,
 although public officials providing essential services may not strike. There were
 fewer strikes in 1994 than in 1993.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The Collective Agreements
 Law provides for collective bargaining and the right of unions to organize employ-
 ees, although several provisions reportedly hinder the establishment of new union
 organizations. According to the Law, unions, in order to be registered, must have
 at least 30 founding menbers in large enterprises or have a membership of one-fifth
 of all employees in small enterprises. Difficulties commonly arise in state enter-
 
 
 883
 prises in which employees are represented by more than one union. LWU officials
 charge that managers in some state enterprises discriminate against LWYU organiz-
 ers and have on occasion dismissed employees in retribution for their trade union
 activities. The LWU also charges that the judicial system is slow to respond to LWU
 grievances regarding dismissals from work. LWU representatives charge that state
 managers sometimes prefer the CFTU/LTUC over the LWU unions as collective bar-
 gaining partners.
 In general, trade union spokesmen say that managers often determine wages
 without regard to trade union wishes, except in larger factories with well-organized
 trade unions. The Government issues periodic decrees that serve as guidelines for
 state enterprise management in setting wage scales. The LWVU and the LTUC en-
 gage in direct collective bargaining over wages at the workplace level. Wage deci-
 sions are increasingly being made at the enterprise level, although government min-
 istries still retain some control over this sphere in state-owned enterprises. The
 LWU reports that it supplements its bargaining efforts with active lobbying in gov-
 ernment ministries that own enterprises. During the first 10 months of 1994, wage
 increases appear to have been greater than price rises.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, and this prohibition is observed in practice.
 4. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment of children without parental consent is 16 years. The legal minimum age
 with the written consent of parents is 14 Free trade union representatives assert
 that the mechanisms for monitoring minimum age legislation are rudimentary.
 Complaints about infringements of child labor regulations generally are referred to
 local prosecutors who investigate the charges and take legal action to stop viola-
 tions. Available evidence suggests that child labor is rare.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage is $13 (52 litai) per
 month, while the average wage in the state industrial sector is $93 (372 litai) per
 month. The Council of Ministers and the Ministry of Social Protection periodically
 set the minimum wage. Every 3 months these two government bodies must submit
 their minimum wage proposals to the Parliament, which has the right to approve
 or revise the minimum wage level. Enforcement of the minimum wage is almost
 nonexistent, in part because the Government does not want to exacerbate the cur-
 rent unemployment problem. The 40-hour workweek is standard, with a provision
 for at least one 24-hour rest period.
 The Constitution provides that workers have the right to safe and healthy work-
 ing conditions. In 1993 a Labor Safety Law went into effect, setting down the rights
 of workers confronted with hazardous conditions and providing legal protection for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. The State Labor Inspection Serv-
 ice, which the Law established, is charged with implementing the Labor Safety Law.
 Regional labor inspection offices, each of which is staffed by only two or three offi-
 cials, are severely understaffed. They closed 2,756 enterprises or departments of en-
 terprises found to be in violation of safety regulations during the first 9 months of
 1994. Some 270 persons were fined, and 114 cases were referred to local prosecutors'
 offices. Unsafe conditions caused by worn, outdated industrial technologies are re-
 portedly widespread, and 108 work-related deaths were recorded in the first 9
 months of 1994.
