 INDONESIA
 Soeharto's "New Order" Government, which came to power in 1966
 in the wake of an abortive Communist coup, is a limited
 representative government in which the military plays a
 dominant role. Soeharto's Government has organized three of
 the four national elections held since independence. Soeharto
 won indirect election to his fourth five-year term as president
 in March 1983.
 The world's fifth most populous nation, Indonesia contains a
 wide diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic and religious
 groups. The national social and political ideology,
 "pancasila," emphasizes decisionmaking through a process of
 consultation and consensus, a process growing out of a long
 tradition of personalized rule and considered by most
 Indonesians to be more appropriate than Western-style liberal
 democracy to a pluralistic and economically developing
 society. Under "pancasila democracy" most political power is
 vested in the President and in government departments under his
 authority. Parliament, the political parties, the press, and
 social organizations have a limited ability to influence
 government policy.
 Indonesia's national ideology and five-year economic plans
 stress improved social welfare for all without discrimination,
 a goal incorporated in many Government economic development
 programs. Indonesia experienced an economic growth rate of
 about three percent in 1983 despite a continuing downturn in
 demand and prices for oil and other export commodities, its
 major foreign exchange earners.
 The most significant human rights problem in Indonesia during
 1983 was a countrywide campaign of covert, summary executions
 of criminals, euphemistically called "mysterious killings."
 Undertaken in response to burgeoning and increasingly violent
 crime, especially in Indonesia's urban centers, the "mysterious
 killings" during the year took the lives of large numbers of
 criminals with records of violent crime. Although there is no
 verifiable figure on the number of victims, Indonesian human
 rights groups have estimated that up to 4,000 may have been
 killed. Indonesian officials have offered conflicting accounts
 of the Government's involvement in this campaign, some
 acknowledging and others denying that security forces were
 responsible. Despite a sharp, temporary drop in the publicity
 accorded the campaign by the Indonesian media, there continued
 to be reports of killings throughout the year. Several
 friendly governments have expressed their concern over this
 issue to the Indonesian Government.
 In East Timor, an ongoing focus of international human rights
 attention, there was a de facto ceasefire for much of the first
 half of the year. During that period, access for international
 organizations, journalists, diplomats, and others improved.
 In addition, nearly 200 persons were permitted to leave the
 territory for Portugal and Australia under repatriation and
 family reunification programs. This was the largest legal
 emigration from East Timor since Indonesia incorporated the
 territory in 1976. In the second half of the year, however,
 the security situation in East Timor deteriorated after
 proindependence Fretilin elements broke the ceasefire.
 Officials stated that a new military campaign against the
 Fretilin insurgency would be undertaken. As a result, access
 
 (775)
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 50
 
 
 776
 to the territory for outside observers was again restricted by
 the Indonesian Government.
 In addition during 1983, there were reports of the arrest and
 detention without trial of some persons alleged to have been
 involved in subversive or separatist activities, and in March
 the Government shut down a Jakarta newspaper, apparently for
 political reasons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 In response to a marked increase in the number and violence of
 crimes and the failure of the courts and police to take
 effective action, beginning in late 1982 and continuing through
 much of 1983 an anticrime campaign was carried out, which
 included covert summary executions of criminals with records of
 violent crime. Because those carrying out the killings were
 initially not openly identified, the executions were labelled
 "mysterious killings" by the media and other observers.
 At first confined to the island of Java, the killings spread to
 other parts of Indonesia. Media and other reports indicated
 that the campaign was most intense on Java and Sumatra. In
 early August, the Government banned further press reporting of
 the killings, and there were reports that the campaign had been
 ordered halted. Though the number of reported killings dropped
 off thereafter, there continued to be reports of executions
 throughout the year. There is no verifiable estimate of the
 total number of victims. In public statements, Government
 officials have indicated that "hundreds" were killed. Human
 rights groups which monitored the campaign claimed that there
 were up to 4,000 victims during 1983. Almost all those killed
 were persons who had themselves committed crimes; human rights
 groups remarked that political and opposition figures were not
 targeted. A very few cases of the killing of the "wrong"
 persons due to mistaken identity were reported. There was only
 limited public concern expressed over the anti-crime campaign;
 this concern was largely confined to the human rights
 organizations and to certain editors, academics, and government
 officials. As the campaign continued, however, there were
 increasing expressions of concern that it might get out of
 control.
 In the course of the campaign, it became general knowledge that
 those killed were included on lists of criminals maintained by
 government security forces. In some instances spokesmen for
 the military and police alleged that criminals were shot while
 attempting to escape or while resisting arrest, and others
 allegedly were killed by angry crowds. Newspaper photos and
 other reports, however, indicated that many victims were shot
 at close range. While a number of Indonesian officials denied
 any government involvement, others acknowledged that security
 forces were responsible. In separate statements in July, for
 example, the Chairman of the Indonesian Parliament, the
 Director of its civilian intelligence agency, and a Deputy
 Chairman of the Government's Supreme Advisory Council defended
 
 
 777
 the campaign of killings and stated or implied that it was
 being carried out by security forces. Foreign governments have
 expressed strong concern to the Indonesian Government about the
 killings.
 Groups outside Indonesia hostile to the 1976 takeover of East
 Timor charged in September that approximately 200 Timorese
 villagers were killed near the town of Viqueque, in retaliation
 for an August 8 Fretilin attack which killed 16 Indonesian Army
 engineers engaged in civic action work in Timor. Indonesian
 Government figures denied there had been any retaliatory
 killings.
 In addition to waging military attacks on government forces,
 Fretilin insurgents in the past have murdered government
 officials or individuals loyal to the Indonesian Government.
 Because of the extended de facto ceasefire in 1983, there
 reportedly were few, if any, such killings up to the breakdown
 of the ceasefire in August.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of the disappearance of political
 opposition figures during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Government officials say they discourage torture and cruel
 punishment of prisoners, but cases of cruel treatment of
 prisoners are reported sporadically in the press. Where cases
 come to light, offending police and other authorities usually
 are disciplined. In an effort to reduce such incidents, top
 government security officials have pledged to institute a
 longterm program of more effective recruitment and training of
 better educated personnel. Courses taught at the National
 Police Academy now emphasize the need to be sensitive to
 prisoners' rights.
 In July TAPOL, a London-based organization which is a strong
 critic of the Indonesian Government, published what was
 purported to be a "torture manual" prepared by military units
 serving in East Timor, containing instuctions for dealing with
 the Fretilin insurgency and references to third-degree
 interrogation methods. Indonesian officials denied the
 authenticity of the document, suggesting it was a forgery
 designed to sway international opinion about East Timor. There
 is no evidence of the authenticity of the document.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The December 1981 Criminal Procedures Code contains protections
 against arbitrary arrest and detention and specifies the right
 of prisoners to legal counsel and notification of family
 members. The provisions of the Criminal Procedures Code,
 however, are honored more often in urban areas than in small
 towns or remote provinces, in large part because of a shortage
 of trained trial lawyers and the weakness or absence of legal
 and human rights associations in remote areas. Press reports
 that many judges and prosecutors had failed to familiarize
 themselves with the Code led the Minister of Justice in late
 
 
 778
 1983 to exhort them to study and follow Code requirements or
 face disciplinary action.
 Nevertheless, human rights and lawyers groups believe the Code
 has had a salutary effect. Implementing regulations issued in
 September established for the first time the right to
 substantial compensation for false arrest or imprisonment, and
 in the first case of its kind, lawyers won release of a client
 in October after legal authorities failed to adhere to the
 stipulation of the Code concerning prolongation of detention.
 Martial law, declared in 1957, has not been lifted. Under
 special emergency provisions instituted in 1966, military
 authorities have wide powers to arrest and hold persons thought
 to endanger national security. These persons, usually accused
 of subversion, do not enjoy the protections offered under the
 Criminal Procedures Code.
 According to reports from the press and human rights groups,
 during 1983 military authorities continued to arrest some
 individuals believed to be involved in subversion or separatist
 activities. In some cases persons detained are not allowed to
 contact their families or lawyers. They usually are permitted
 to communicate after a period of days or weeks.
 Most of those detained for subversion are suspected Muslim
 extremists believed to have instigated or participated in
 illegal antigovernment acts. Human rights groups believe the
 number of such persons detained by military authorities rose
 just before the March reelection of President Soeharto.
 Afterwards, the number is believed to have decreased. The most
 recent estimate from human rights observers is that
 approximately 400 suspected Muslim extremists are detained
 throughout Indonesia, most in the provinces of Aceh, East Java,
 and Central Java.
 Members of separatist groups are also subject to detention
 without trial. Although precise estimates are unavailable,
 several dozen separatists are currently thought to be held
 without trial, especially in the province of Irian Jaya.
 In East Timor, as of mid-1983, 14 persons were detained without
 trial in the Comarca Prison. Some international groups believe
 there are other detainees in military jails around East Timor
 and perhaps in Bali, but the allegation are unconfirmed. Since
 military operations commenced in September in response to
 Fretilin's breaking of the de facto ceasefire, groups outside
 East Timor say that many additional Fretilin supporters have
 been detained. Again, the charge is unproved.
 Since 1981, Indonesian authorities have used Atauro Island off
 the coast of mainland East Timor as a detention facility for
 Timorese suspected of supporting or of having family members
 fighting with Fretilin. The number of Timorese detained on
 Atauro Island peaked at about 4,000 in the second half of
 1982. In late 1982, working with the Indonesian Red Cross and
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the
 provincial government began to resettle detainees on the
 mainland. The number of detainees on Atauro dropped to around
 2,800 by August 1983, when the resumption of fighting in East
 Timor brought what the Government says is a temporary halt to
 
 
 779
 the resettlement program. There are some reports that
 additional numbers of people have been detained on Atauro as a
 result of the renewed fighting in Timor. Nonetheless,
 Indonesian officials claim they are committed to closing the
 Atauro island facility and that they intend to permit all
 detainees to return to their homes at the earliest possible
 occasion.
 At least one human rights group in Indonesia regards persons
 held for subversion as political prisoners, including those
 sentenced to prison through trial procedures. They believe the
 military organization responsible for detection and arrest of
 subversives and separatists, the Command for the Restoration of
 Security and Order (KOPKAMTIB), is extraconstitutional and
 therefore has no legal powers of arrest or the right to hand
 persons over for trial. Some of the detained persons clearly
 participated in acts of violence; others have been convicted
 for expressions of antigovernment or separatist sentiment.
 Although the Government has not announced data on the number of
 persons convicted and serving sentences for subversion, one
 estimate suggests there may be several hundred such prisoners.
 Amnesty International contends that persons tried and convicted
 for participating in the abortive 1965 Communist coup and
 associating with the Indonesian Communist Party failed to
 receive fair trials and should be considered "political
 prisoners." There are about 250 such prisoners. Indonesian
 authorities have permitted visits to these prisoners by the
 ICRC, which normally urges that they be assured rights accorded
 other prisoners, including the right of appeal and routine
 remission of sentences.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Indonesia's criminal justice system lacks the number of courts,
 judges, prosecutors, and police needed to cope with the
 increase in crime in recent years and to assure every accused a
 speedy trial. Under Indonesian legal practice, the police are
 responsible for making arrests and conducting initial
 investigations. Information gained by the police is then
 turned over to a public prosecutor's office, where a
 determination is made whether to go to trial. Trials are
 conducted by a three-judge panel which hears evidence, decides
 guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. Although the
 right of appeal is not absolute, it is observed in most cases;
 most court sessions are open and most defendants have access to
 counsel.
 On occasion, there is either political interference in or
 corruption of the legal system. In criminal proceedings,
 defendants are sometimes able to buy their way out of
 prosecution at every stage of proceedings. In civil
 proceedings, court decisions are sometimes influenced by the
 payment of bribes. In response to these abuses, the Attorney
 General and Minister of Justice claim they are taking
 disciplinary action against some officials involved in corrupt
 activities and seeking to increase salaries and benefits for
 judicial officials, thereby reducing the incentive for
 corruption.
 
 
 780
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Judicial warrants for searches are required except for
 suspected subversion, economic crimes, and corruption. In some
 instances forced or surreptitious entry by security agencies
 has been alleged. Both local and international phone calls by
 some individuals are probably monitored by government security
 agencies. Although in general correspondence is not monitored,
 all letter mail to and from East Timor is subject to censorship.
 Permits are required for the import of foreign publications.
 Some foreign newspapers and magazines, especially from
 Australia, cannot be imported, and Communist or pornographic
 literature is prohibited. Foreign publications which do enter
 Indonesia are frequently censored.
 Excepting one quasi-official daily newspaper which uses Chinese
 characters and claims a circulation of 120,000, Chinese
 language publications can neither be imported nor produced
 domestically. Chinese characters are routinely blotted out of
 foreign news photos and advertising. There are no laws against
 speaking Chinese, but the Government lays heavy stress on the
 learning and use of the national language, Bahasa Indonesia, to
 promote national unity. All school classes and most radio and
 television broadcasts employ Bahasa Indonesia.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Indonesia's Constitution leaves to Parliament the authority to
 prescribe limits on freedom of speech and press. In recent
 years, Parliament has helped create a body of law delimiting
 the rights of individuals and of the Governmnt. However,
 government agencies continue to exercise considerable
 discretionary authority in this area both through tradition and
 because of the absence of specific law protecting individual
 rights.
 Opposition groups are generally free to meet and formulate
 views, but they often have difficulty disseminating their views
 publically because of media reluctance to risk official
 disapproval or because of informal government instructions not
 to publish the opinions of or news about prominent opposition
 figures. Nevertheless, there is a lively exchange of
 monographs, pamphlets, tape recordings, and other
 communications containing these views. Some prominent
 opposition figures claim harassment by government agencies
 (telephones rendered out of order, electricity cut, difficulty
 obtaining access to other government-provided services) and
 restrictions on their economic activities (e.g., refusal by
 government agencies to accept bids from companies in which they
 have an interest and pressure on private concerns not to do
 business with them).
 Restrictions are sometimes imposed on academic inquiry during
 politically sensitive periods. School faculties sometimes
 refrain from producing materials, including dissertations,
 which they believe might provoke government displeasure.
 Informal restrictions on public universities' hiring of
 qualified young people who had participated in dissident
 student activities in the past were eased after the new Cabinet
 
 
 781
 was named in March 1983. In addition, several academics who
 had not been permitted to travel outside Indonesia to
 participate in professional meetings were once again allowed to
 travel in 1983.
 The press in Indonesia is largely privately owned. While
 espousing a "free" press, the Government also expects the media
 to be "responsible" by supporting national economic development
 goals and domestic stability. Publishers and journalists,
 honoring what they perceive as the limits of permissibility,
 often exercise considerable "self-censorship." At the same
 time, the media is closely monitored, and editors routinely
 receive oral instructions from government officials about news
 which cannot be reported. Despite these limitations, the press
 can be lively and informative. Editorials frequently address
 sensitive issues, albeit gingerly, and news reports use
 allusion to provide information about events which are not
 supposed to be reported.
 Many journalists welcomed the passage by Parliament in 1982 of
 a new press law, expected to reduce the likelihood of
 Government interference, including suspension of publication
 permits. Implementing regulations spelling out the rights and
 responsibilities of the press under the new law have not yet
 appeared, however, and the old law remains in effect. The new
 Minister of Information has hinted that even under the new
 press law, the Government will use the threat of closure to
 assure "responsible" reporting.
 In addition, in March 1983 the security organization,
 KOPKAMTIB, ordered the suspension of publication of a Jakarta
 daily economic newspaper, which suspension remained in effect
 through the remainder of 1983. The suspension appears to have
 been motivated by political reasons.
 The Government is sensitive to foreign press reports of
 internal Indonesian developments, particularly those related to
 security and East Timor. As a result, it is selective in
 permitting foreign journalists to live and work in Indonesia.
 Following the visit of Australian Prime Minister Hawke to
 Jakarta in June, the Indonesian Government permitted a
 representative of the Australian Associated Press to reside in
 Jakarta, thereby reversing a year-long prohibition against the
 fulltime presence of Australian journalists. During the first
 half of 1983 newsmen from Portugal, Australia, and Norway
 visited East Timor, but military operations against Fretilin
 elements prevented further journalistic travel to East Timor.
 The Government occasionally stops publication or distribution
 of books regarded as critical of the government or on sensitive
 subjects. For instance, the 1982 Report on Human Rights
 Practices in Indonesia prepared by a local human rights
 organization, the Legal Aid Institute, has not been published
 because both the publisher and later a government agency
 considered it too critical.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is freely permitted for social and ceremonial
 occasions and, as long as there is no perceived risk of
 violence, for political activities approved by the Government.
 Restrictions on assembly are sometimes tightened during periods
 
 
 782
 of higher political tension. Regional and national meetings or
 virtually all organizations were not authorized in the month
 before the reelection of President Soeharto. In 1983, the
 Minister of State for Youth and Sports established a new
 requirement that all youth organizations must agree to adopt the
 national ideology "pancasila" as their sole basic principle
 before they would be permitted to hold their national congresses.
 Indonesian labor is organized in a national federation (FBSI)
 composed of 21 national industrial unions, with a total
 membership of some three million out of a workforce of 65
 million. FBSI is the only trade union body legally permitted in
 Indonesia. It is not permitted to organize civil servants or
 workers in government-owned enterprises and major sectors of the
 economy, although some professional organizations, such as those
 for teachers, do act as unions in some respects. Restrictions on
 FBSI's autonomy include the imposition of government-appointees
 in many of its positions, the requirement that its senior
 officials be active members of GOLKAR (the government party),
 extensive government intervention in labor-management relations,
 a government subsidy at the federation level, and strenuous
 government opposition to strikes.  However, FBSI is slowly
 becoming more effective in representing its members, continually
 probing the limits of government tolerance as it does so.
 The law requires government permission for strikes, which as a
 matter of practice is never given. Nevertheless, localized,
 small-scale strikes frequently occur. The Government has
 sometimes threatened but seldom carried out physical repression
 of strikes. The Ministry of Manpower has also threatened in the
 past year to make strikes formally illegal.
 In 1983 the Government became more involved in collective
 bargaining and labor agreements. High level officials have
 stated that the Government is taking steps to insure that
 Indonesian labor organizations adhere to Indonesian values and do
 not act like unions in developed "liberal democratic" countries.
 Indonesia has signed and ratified a number of International Labor
 Organization conventions including the convention on the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. Government officials have
 made clear, however, that Indonesia's obligations under these
 conventions will not be allowed to interfere with "pancasila"
 labor relations. The Government believes that FBSI membership in
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU)
 would violate Indonesia's nonaligned foreign policy, but FBSIs'
 general chairman participates in the ICFTU in his personal
 capacity, and its national industrial unions and a few
 professional groups have close relations with ICFTU's
 International Trade Secretariats.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution. Although
 the Indonesian population is overwhelmingly Muslim, no overt
 discrimination is directed against those of other faiths. The
 first tenet of "pancasila" specifies belief in the supreme being,
 so atheism is forbidden. Some animists in remote parts of
 Indonesia reportedly have been pressured to convert to Islam or
 Christianity in order to fulfill the requirement to believe in
 the supreme being. However, mystic sects and beliefs are
 followed by many in the Indonesian elite.
 
 
 783
 In October 1983, a small Muslim religious sect was banned by
 the Department of Religious Affairs because its teachings were
 regarded as having the potential to disrupt public order. The
 sect specifically rejected the validity of the "traditions"
 historically held to stem from the Prophet Mohammad.
 There are no legal bars to religious conversion, and conversions
 between faiths are common. Proselytizing, though, is seen as
 potentially disruptive and is discouraged. For this reason,
 informal restrictions on the activities of foreign missionaries
 such as diffiulty in obtaining or renewing visas have been
 increasing in recent years. Official holidays include
 Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist as well as Muslim holy days.
 Indonesian Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists maintain active
 links with coreligionists outside Indonesia. Travel to
 religious gatherings is not discouraged, and Muslims undertake
 the "haj" to Mecca without restriction. Foreign religious
 figures are welcomed, including the Dalai Lama in late 1982.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 Movement within Indonesia is unrestricted, although there are
 exceptions. The Government requires permits to change
 residence in certain areas, primarily to control the further
 shift of population from rural to urban locations. Since
 1958-59, ethnic Chinese have been denied the right to live in
 rural areas of Java (although the practical impact of the
 regulation is mitigated by the fact that no such rural area is
 more than 15 miles from a major town). Travel to certain
 areas, including most of eastern Indonesia, requires a special
 permit. There are also restrictions on movement to and within
 East Timor. Former political detainees associated with the
 abortive 1965 coup attempt are required to notify authorities
 of travel away from their homes.
 Citizens who leave the country are guaranteed the right to
 return. The only exception is ethnic Chinese without
 citizenship documents who departed Indonesia before 1965.
 Emigration is unrestricted except that, since the 1976
 integration of East Timor into Indonesia, authorities have
 closely controlled emigration and repatriation of former
 Portuguese subjects. Despite agreements with the Australian
 Government and the ICRC, up to the end of 1982 only limited
 numbers of East Timorese left Indonesia legally. Many who did
 so had to pay substantial bribes. In 1983, however, officially
 sanctioned emigration from East Timor increased markedly.
 Through September, 109 persons were repatriated to Portugal
 under ICRC auspices, while an additional 79 persons left for
 Australia under a government-to-government family reunification
 program. These departures substantially reduced the number of
 persons who had previously indicated a desire to leave
 Indonesia permanently.
 A few Indonesians remain in Communist countries where they
 chose to stay after the 1965 upheaval. The Government must
 give permission for them to return; such permission is
 determined on a case-by-case basis.
 Under its humane refugee policy, Indonesia has given first
 
 
 184
 asylum to over 80,000 Indochinese refugees since 1975. In
 cooperation with the UNHCR, the Indonesian Government has also
 provided one of the region's two refugee processing centers,
 where Indochinese refugees from camps in Indonesia or other
 first asylum countries are given training to prepare them for
 permanent resettlement in other countries. Indonesia has not
 accepted any Indochinese refugees for permanent resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Indonesia has a limited representative government, with
 dominant political power held by active duty and retired
 military officers. President Soeharto is the decisive
 political figure. The Parliament and the political parties
 have limited ability to influence government decisions.
 The Parliament is elected by all adult citizens except active
 duty members of the armed forces and convicted criminals
 serving in prison. Because the military is not permitted to
 vote, 96 out of 460 seats in Parliament are reserved for
 appointed members to represent its interests. Elections for
 Parliament are held every five years.
 The President is elected by the People's Consultative Assembly
 (MPR), which consists of the Parliament plus an equal number of
 appointed members and sits in a single special session once
 every five years. In March 1983, the MPR by acclamation
 selected President Soeharto for a fourth five-year term.
 Soeharto was nominated by all three political parties and there
 were no other candidates, although in theory any member of the
 MPR could have nominated anyone meeting the constitutional
 requirements for the presidency.
 A 1975 law limits the number of political parties to three: a
 Muslim party made up of four former Muslim political parties;
 an association of former nationalist and Christian parties; and
 the government-sponsored party or "functional group" (GOLKAR).
 In three national elections since 1971, GOLKAR has won each
 time with more than 60 percent of the vote. Civil servants and
 their families are expected to vote for GOLKAR, and support for
 GOLKAR at the local level often results in additional
 government resources being devoted to development projects in
 the area.
 Critics of the political system complain that the 1975 law on
 political parties substantially reduced freedom of association
 by forcing previously competitive political groupings into the
 Muslim and nationalist/Christian parties. They also contend
 that the leaderships of these parties are now more responsive
 to government interests than to the interests of their
 supporters. In his August 16, 1983, National Day address to
 Parliament, Soeharto acknowledged that the political parties
 are not expected to play adversary roles but to provide
 constructive suggestions to enhance government programs. The
 Speaker of Parliament stated on several occasions in 1983 that
 "liberal democracy" is inappropriate in the Indonesian setting.
 The two political parties and GOLKAR are prohibited from
 organizing and operating below the district level except during
 election campaigns. Critics contend this system gives GOLKAR
 an advantage, since its civil service members have constant
 
 
 785
 access to small towns and villages because of their official
 duties.  The Indonesian Communist Party and a formerly powerful
 Muslim party linked with separatist rebellions in the later 1950's
 are specifically banned. Members of the former and many leaders
 of the latter are not allowed to run for office or play active
 political roles.
 An informal opposition group formed in 1980 and known as the
 Group of 50, consisting of retired military officers, some
 prominent Muslims, and former student activists, continues its
 efforts to exert political influence by circulating "statements
 of concern" critical of government leadership and policies.
 The Javanese ethnic group has a preeminent role in the country's
 political leadership, as a result of its size (45 percent of the
 population) and historic and cultural factors. Other ethnic
 groups are represented at the highest levels of government, but
 non-Javanese ethnic groups are generally under-represented in the
 middle and lower levels of the military and bureaucracy.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged
 violations of human rights to be interference in its internal
 affairs. Amnesty International representatives, for example,
 are refused official access to Indonesia because of the
 organization's past criticism of Government and the Government's
 belief that it is biased. There is no local chapter of Amnesty
 International, although individual citizens have memberships. In
 its 1983 report convering 1982, Amnesty International expressed
 concern on a number of points. These include the continued
 imprisonment of prisoners in connection with the alleged coup of
 October 1965, the length of prison terms imposed after unfair
 trials, the detention of other alleged political opponents of the
 Government, and reports of the detention without trial of
 increasing numbers of East Timorese and information corrobrating
 earlier of arbitary killings and "disappearances."
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a resi-
 dent representative in Jakarta. In addition to visits to prisons
 and detention centers throughout Indonesia, the ICRC in conjunction
 with the Indonesian Red Cross engaged in a range of programs in
 East Timor. These include tracing, delivery of family messages,
 repatriation, a nutrition and health services program for displaced
 persons on Atauro Island, and relief for persons returning to the
 mainland from Atauro. Many of the ICRC activities in East Timor
 were suspended in August after the security situation deteriorated
 there, though some of those activities have now resumed.
 During the first half of 1983, other international groups (Catholic
 Relief Services, CRS, and the UN International Children's Emergency
 Fund, UNICEF) also had regular access to carry out programs in East
 Timor. In addition, the Government permitted greatly increased
 access by foreign journalists, diplomats, foreign government
 officials, and others. With the deterioration of the security
 situation after August, access of all groups became more difficult,
 although the government continued to allow limited access and
 indicated that it would lift restrictions when it is able to assure
 the security of visitors.
 
 
 786
 In late September, the United Nations postponed for one year
 consideration of any new General Assembly resolution on East
 Timor. (In 1982, the U.N. had adopted by a four-vote margin
 its seventh annual resolution expressing concern over the
 situation in East Timor and reaffirming the right of the people
 there to self-determination.)
 Indonesia has a growing number of domestic organizations
 concerned with human rights. The Department of Justice has an
 agency charged with the drafting of legal codes to replace the
 colonial laws still in effect. This agency also has
 responsibility for the establishment of legal documentation
 facilities and for programs to inform citizens of their legal
 rights. In 1983, both judges and prosecutors paid visits to
 remote areas and villages to provide information about legal
 procedures. Also, there is a legal aid group associated with
 the government-backed political organization GOLKAR.
 In addition to these government-related activities, private
 groups associated with mosques and churches are involved in
 providing legal counseling services. The Trial Lawyers
 Association, "Peradin," provides some legal services free to
 the disadvantaged.
 Since 1973 the private, Jakarta-based Legal Aid Institute has
 contested human rights violations by defending or representing
 aggrieved parties in court and by stimulating press attention
 and discussion. In 1983, the Institute spoke out against the
 "mysterious shootings" of criminals. It also protested the
 seizure without due process or adequate compensation of land in
 Central Java near the Borobudur Temple, to be used for a public
 park and tourist hotel. It also expressed support for the
 indigenous peoples of Irian Jaya, whose traditional concept of
 land use rights it said had been ignored in efforts to develop
 the region and exploit its resources. The Institute has
 established offices in many larger Indonesian cities, and it
 continues to draft annual reports on human rights, although the
 1982 report, which is critical of the Government in parts,
 still has not been published. Freedom House described
 Indonesia as "partly free" in its 1983 report.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The fifth principle of the national ideology, "pancasila," is
 social justice, which is interpreted to mean that the basic
 human needs of all Indonesians should be satisfied without
 discrimination. In addition, the three "pillars" of President
 Soeharto's "New Order" government have been economic
 development, stability, and equity.
 The worldwide economic downturn began to affect Indonesia
 significantly in the second half of 1982 and throughout 1983
 with the prospect for a relatively long period of slower growth
 rates than were registered in the previous decade. The
 Government's countermeasures--including an austerity Government
 budget, currency devaluation and dramatic slowdown in
 implementation of some major industrial projects--will have at
 least short term, adverse consequences for such important
 government programs as health and education. In the 1984-89
 Five Year Plan, Government planners stress small-scale, labor
 intensive projects and nonoil exports, aimed among other things
 at creating additional employment for swelling ranks of job
 seekers and thereby improving equity in income distribution.

 Per capita Gross National Product was estimated by the World
 Bank to be $519 in 1981. Following the March 1983 devaluation
 of the rupiah, per capita income figures fell below $500.
 The largest nation in Southeast Asia, Indonesia had an
 estimated population in 1983 of 160,932,000. Population
 pressures are especially great on the islands of Java, Bali,
 and Madura, even though the population growth rate has dropped
 below two percent according to Indonesian Government figures
 and stands at 2.1 percent according to World Bank statistics.
 Infant mortality rates improved to 92.7 per 1,000 live births
 in 1983. Likewise, life expectancy at birth rose to 53.08 in
 year 1980.
 Indonesian women are important income earners for their
 families, and legislation guarantees them equal treatment.
 However, they still are not prominently represented in the
 national decisionmaking process. The Cabinet named in 1983
 included two women, the Minister for Social Affairs and the
 Minister of State for Women's Affairs. Women's groups are
 active in development projects involving nutrition, family
 planning, and home economics. Indonesia's labor legislation
 has provisions protecting female wage earners, but women seldom
 receive equal pay for equal work.
 Most ethnic Chinese have taken Indonesian citizenship, but they
 are resented by many other Indonesians because of their
 disproportionately prominent role in the economy. This
 resentment leads to some racial tension and periodic outbreaks
 of anti-Chinese violence. To help redress the economic
 imbalance between Chinese and indigenous entrepreneurs, the
 Government has followed programs discriminating in favor of the
 latter.
 Ethnic Chinese are pressured to adopt Indonesian customs and
 take Indonesian names. While they are also encouraged to
 become citizens, some Chinese find legal avenues to citizenship
 blocked or are discouraged by the time-consuming and expensive
 task of obtaining citizenship documents. Government
 regulations prohibit the operation of all-Chinese schools and
 institutions of higher learning, teaching in Chinese languages,
 the formation of exclusively Chinese cultural groups and trade
 associations, and the use of Chinese characters on sign boards
 or in publications. Social and religious groups which are, in
 effect, all-Chinese, however, are not proscribed and do exist.
 Some largely Chinese organizations have had considerable
 influence in government affairs growing out of the informal
 ties of members to senior Government officials.
 In 1978, 94 percent of all primary school-age children
 (virtually all males and 89 percent of females) were enrolled
 in schools. In 1984, the Government plans to make education
 compulsory up to the eighth grade. The World Bank estimated
 that as of 1971 total adult literacy stood at 56.6 percent
 (69.5 percent of men and 44.6 percent of women; 76.7 percent of
 urban dwellers and 52.2 percent of rural dwellers). According
 to the 1980 Government census, 72 percent of the population
 over 10 years of age could read and write (78.8 percent of men
 and 61.4 percent of women; 83.8 percent of the urban population
 and 65.7 percent of the rural population).
 Agricultural output has increased significantly in recent
 years, about 3.8 percent per annum. Partly as a result, the
 percentage of caloric supply available for consumption relative
 to nutritional requirements rose to 101.71 in 1977.
 Community health standards remain low. Tuberculosis and
 mosquito-borne diseases, includin9 malaria, are endemic. In
 1976, only 12 percent of the population (35 percent in urban
 areas and six percent in rural areas) had access to safe water.
