 GEORGIA
 Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Following
 multiparty parliamentary elections in 1992, Parliament chose Eduard Shevardnadze
 as its Chairman in an uncontested election and named him Head of State. The Head
 of State appoints the Prime Minister and the members of the Council of Ministers
 (Cabinet) who, with other executive officials, report to him.
 At the end of 1993, Georgia agreed to a U.N.-brokered cease-fire with Abkhazian
 separatists, who had forcibly taken control of the entire Autonomous Republic of
 Abkhazia in 1993. In April Abkhazian, Georgian, Russian, and United Nations rep-
 resentatives signed an agreement on the resettlement of internally displaced per-
 sons (IDP's); a peacekeeping force, drawn nominally from the Commonwealth of
 Independent States (CIS)but comprised entirely of Russian forces, was deployed
 along the Inguri River which separates Abkhazia from the rest of Georgia. The role
 of the UNOMIG (United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia), already deployed in
 Georgia, was enlarged to include monitoring the actions of the peacekeeping force.
 Abkhazia declared its independence from Georgia in November.
 Attempts to reform the police, security services, armed forces, and paramilitary
 forces were only partly successful in 1994. The Government's anticrime campaign
 reduced much of the random violent crime in Thiisi, the capital, and curbed some
 of the abuses conmmitted by these forces. However, corruption on the part of law en-
 forcement officials and police brutality are pervasive. Police routinely heat and oth-
 erwise mistreated detainees during pretrial detention.
 Internal conflicts and the disruption of trade links with other republics of the
 former Soviet Union have left Georgia's economy  ins. Dependent on imported
 fuels for which the Government could not pay, Georgia has endured an acute energy
 crisis, including the complete stoppage of natural gas deliveries from Turkmenistan
 
 
 815
 between mid-November and early December. Water, electricity, and natural gas are
 frequently unavailable, even in Tbilisi, the capital. With industry functioning at 20
 percent of capacity and inflation as high as .0 percent per month, the stanard of
 Iivin of the population dropped further, making the country dependent on humani-
 tarian grain sipnmeats from abroad.
 A further buren on the Government's limited resources is the contribution by the
 Government to the 250,000 people displaced from Abkhazia and a lesser number
 from South Ossetia. The refugees and DP's are housed at government expense in
 reassigned public buildings and receive small support stipends. Surveys undertaken
 jointly by nongovernmental organizations and the Government indicated that the
 displaced and refugees were satisfied with the level of financial support, although
 they remain critical of slow progress in repatriation efforts. CIS peacekeepers were
 unable to create a safe environment in Abkhazia for the return of IDls, stating that
 police functions were not part of their mandate. The Abkhazian authorities alowed
 only a few hundred ethnic Georgians to return and, just prior to the first
 resettlements razed 4 Georgian =villages killing 20 persons, after unknown assail-
 ants had killed 4 Abkhazian police. Akhazian authorities called for ethnically
 cleansing Abkhazia of all Georgians by September 27 and were credibly reported to
 have tortured, raped, killed, expelled, and imprisoned hundreds of Georgians and
 other non-Abkhaz.
 In South Ossetia, a 2-year-old cease-fire, monitored by CIS peacekeepers and the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), partially succeeded in
 curbing human rights abuses in that region.
 Human rights abuses continued in the rest of Georgia, including apparent
 extrajudicial killings, hostage-taking or kidnaping, police beatings of detainees and
 demonstrators, arbitrary detention, denial of fair public trial, and arbitrary inter-
 ference with privacy and home. There were no known summary executions in 1994,
 although the state of emergency decree that permitted the practice was not lifted
 until October. Freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association were signifi-
 cantly less restricted, although some instances of abuse still occurred.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajutdicial Killing.-In the fall of 1993, during the state
 of emergency, the Minister of Internal Affairs reportedly personally shot and killed
 at least one of nine youths in Zugdidi who were accused of looting. The Minister
 appears so far to have evaded repeated calls for an investigation into his role in the
 su mmary executions which occurred in Zugdidi in 1993.
 It is often difficult to distinguish between criminal activity and political killin.
 For example, the assassination of the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs in Ma
 in which individual lice officers were implicated, appears to have been the work
 of mafia elements. The bombing of the ArmenianTheater in Tbilisi in June, which
 resulted in one death, may have been the work of Azerbaijani sympathizers as an
 outgrowth of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The attempted bombing of a Moscow-
 bound passenger plane carrying a former Georgian defense minister, who is also a
 crime world figure, may have been either politically motivated or the work of crimi-
 nal elements. The paramilitary organization Mkhedrioni, also called the Georgia
 Rescue Corps, remains actively involved in widespread criminal activity. Since sev-
 eral small factions feud among themselves, it is unclear whether recent assassina-
 tions of Mkhedrioni members were the result of factional disputes, vendettas, or po-
 litical motivation.
 The State Committee on Human Rights and Interethnic Relations (SCHR), in a
 report issued in 1994 claimed that 50 detainees died, and many others required
 hospitalization, while being incarcerated at the Tbilisi interrogation cell in 1993.
 The head of the Abkhazian parliament reportedly has claimed that the Abkhazian
 authorities have made good-faith attempts to bring to trial 40 people associated with
 political killings and other atrocities carried out against Georgian civilians during
 the war. However, independent observers have not verified that claim.
 b. Disppearance.-The fate of many Georgians and Abkhaz who have dis-
 appeared since 1992 as a result of the Abkhazian conflict is still unknown. Over
 1,000 Georgians are still reported missing, according to the SCHR, which maintains
 a current list. Some are thought to have been executed, and rumors persist that the
 Abkhaz are holding others in secret forced labor camps within Abkhazia.
 Amnesty International appealed to the Government in 1994 to investigate the sta-
 tus of seven ethnic Abkhaz who reportedly were detained by government forces in
 Sukhumi in October 1992. Amnesty International listed these persons as "dis-
 appeared."
 
 
 816
 The Government considers these individuals missing but reported that it had no
 information about their alleged detention and, without access to Abkhazia, asserted
 it was unable to investigate the matter.
 Among the many persons who disappeared during the Abkhazian conflict are 46
 Georgians whom Abkhazian forces, according to the Government, seized in Septem-
 ber 1993 in Sukhuni, along with the former chairman of the council of ministers
 of Abkhazia. The Abkhaz executed the former chairman, despite Russian assurances
 of safe conduct out of the region, but the fate of 27 of his staff members and 19
 soldiers is unknown. The Government has repeatedly appealed to international
 human rights groups to investigate this case.
 The 1994 SORB reprt charged that peacekeeping contingents in South Ossetia
 engaged in hostage-taking in 1993.
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 High government officials admit that law enforcement personnel routinely beat de-
 tainees. Officials often resort to physical and psychological abuse to extract informa-
 tion and confessions. Most of the abuse reportedly occurs during pretrial detention.
 Physical abuse also occurs, though apparently less frequently, during the trial pe-
 riod of a criminal defendant's incarceration. The press reported that Viktor
 Domukhovski, I of 19 defendants in a well-known trial of alleged terrorists, claimed
 that prison officials beat him for refusing to relinquish his &ary (see Section I.e.).
 Domukhovski's wife reported that he was again beaten on December 11, this time
 by fellow prisoners, but with the complicity of at least one prison official.
 Nongovernmental human rights groups reported significantly fewer abuses by the
 Georgian security services during 1994. In some instances, however, the security
 services reportedly resorted to threatening, intimidating tactics during interroga-
 tions.
 In general, prison conditions deteriorated parallel with the economic situation.
 Prison officials could not provide adequate food and medicines for inmates, who in
 turn relied on their families and friends to supplement the meager supplies.
 Prison infirmaries lacked medicine to treat diseases like tuberulosis and dys-
 entery, which are prevalent in the prisons. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) was permitted visitation rights to all regular prisoners but was not
 allowed unrestricted access to the extradited former military commander, Lote
 Kobalia, who served under deposed Prime Minister Zviad Gamsakhurdia and was
 being held virtually incommunicado by the security service.
 The SCHR reported that prisons were overcrowded, with 12 to 15 inmates fre-
 quently sharing cells designed for 3 to 4 persons and with 2 persons sharing individ-
 ual bunks. Interrogation cells are extremely cramped and unsanitary, and prisoners
 are not protected from violence and brutal treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Government nullified rel-
 evant Soviet-era legislation, Parliament still had not finished drafting new laws gov-
 erning arrest and detention procedures. While some law enforcement officials con-
 tinued to abide by Soviet-era law, the consequent legal vacuum opened the door to
 significant abuse.
 Under the former Soviet-era law, prosecutors issued warrants for arrests and
 searches. Persons caught in the act of committing a crime could be legally arrested
 without a warrant and be detained for up to 72 hours. After this time, police were
 required to request and receive permission from the prosecutor for continued deten-
 tion. The law requires the prosecutor to file charges within 72 hours, but criminal
 suspects are often held in pretrial detention for over a year before prosecutors file
 formal charges against them.
 A detainee has the right to demand immediate access to a lawyer and to refuse
 to make a statement in the absence of counsel. The detaining officer must inform
 the detainee of these rights and must notify the detainee's family of his location as
 soon as possible. A suspect has the right to demand the presence of counsel during
 all questioning. The presence of an attorney is mandatory during the interrogation
 of a minor or of an individual accused of a capital crime. The presence of a teacher
 or a parent is also obligatory during questioning of a minor. However, these rights
 are frequently violated.
 Police may administratively detain a person without a warrant for several viola-
 tions, incudingparticipating in an illegal demonstration, but a senior Internal Af-
 fairs Ministry official or an administrative judge must approve the detention within
 3 hours. A judge, who may sentence the defendant for up to 15 days' imprisonment
 must then decide the case within 24 hours. Authorities frequently ignore these legal
 requirements.
 In mid-September, Abkhazian authorities arrested and detained nine ethnic Geor-
 gians fishing off the Abkhazian coast, claiming that the detainees were fishing in
 Abhazian territorial waters. Although the Abkhazian authorities want to exchange
 
 
 817
 the nine for all Abkhaz currently being held in Georgian prisons, the Government
 maintains that all Abkhazian prisoners were transferred to Russian prisons 2 years
 ago. A few Abkhaz, however, may have been imprisoned since the war in western
 The SCHR reportedly successfully negotiated a prisoner swap with Abkhazian au-
 thorities in Octbber. Abkhazian authorities released a Georgian held since 1991 in
 exchange for several ethnic Abkhaz who had previously been transferred to Russian
 prisons.
 There were no exiles.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Continuing political instability and legislative dis-
 array stymied any serious attempts at effecting the rule of law in Georgia. The
 criminal justice system is governed by a welter of conflicting laws from Georgia's
 brief period of pre-Soviet independence, the Soviet era, the Gamsakhurdia presi-
 dency (1990 to January 1992), and the current State Council period, which result
 in uneven and haphazard justice.
 Courts of general jurisdiction are undifferentiated as to function; judges may hear
 criminal, civil, and juvenile cases. All courts may act as the court of first instance
 depending on the nature and seriousness of the crime, and there are no clear rules
 to determine which court first hears a case.
 Prosecutors, ultimately responsible to the Procurator General who is appointed by
 Parliament, are more powerful than either judges or defense attorneys. Prosecutors
 direct all criminal investigations conducted by the Internal Affairs Ministry, exer-
 cise certain supervisory rights over the judiciary's functions, and can request that
 the Supreme Court review one of its own decisions. In contrast, the judiciary has
 little influence over prosecutors. Such a system leaves the judiciary valnerable to
 political and other forms of persuasion, particularly at the local level.
 The defendant is presumed innocent and by law is supposed to enjoy various due
 process rights. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions back to
 the prosecutor for additional investigation." Such cases may then be dropped or
 closed, occasionally without informing the court or the defendant.
 In practice, fair public trials are the exception rather than the no  due largely
 to the incompetence and corruption of the judicial branch, which is pcked with So
 yiet-era appointees. Proceedings are not conducted in an adversarial manner. Many
 judges reportedly accept bribes and take instructions from powerful individuals hoth
 inside and outside the Government.
 The trial of 19 people implicated in the 1992 attempted assassination by car bomb
 of Mkhedrioni leader Jaba Joseliani which killed 5 people, including a child, pro-
 vides the most striking examples of the denial of due process. Authorities refused
 to provide legal counsel to one of the defendants, Zurab Bardzimashvili, for several
 months following his arrest. Following the appointment of an attorney not of his
 choosing, in April they denied his request to change counsel. When he suffered an
 apparent heart attack on August 4, the court did not immediately permit him to
 be taken to a hospital. Defendant Zaza Tsiklauri was also denied counsel of his
 choosing and was assigned the same attorney as Bardzimashvili. This attorney was
 threatened with disbarment after she complained of being assigned against the de-
 fendants! wishes. The judge repeatedly denied the requests of defense attorneys for
 Tsiklauri and Gedevan Gelbakhiaini to allow their clients full access to the docu-
 ments in the case.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Intel-
 ligence agencies, including both Georgian and Russian services, are credibly re-
 ported to monitor private telephone conversations. Prior to his assassination, Gia
 Chanturia, the head of the National Democratic Party, complained publicly that his
 office was electronically monitored.
 Both paramilitary and law enforcement representatives enter homes without legal
 sanction. However, most Soviet-era forms of interference diminished.
 Telephone communications with Abkhazia and South Ossetia are almost impos-
 sible because local authorities exercise control over them.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Internal conflict abated in Georgia during 1994. Cease-fires are in place in
 Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the Government has reestablished tenuous control
 over the western region of the country. However, in Abkhazia and the cease-fire
 zone around Gali, Abkhaz committed egregious human rights abuses against the re-
 maining Geoans despite the presence of Russian peacekeepers. Armed indigenous
 gerrillas in the so-clled Svanetian-Georgian region of Abkhazia and renegade
 Georgians in the Gali region also committed abuses sporadically. Confirmed evi-
 dence of human rights violations is difficult to obtain because of the lack of access
 to the region and the fear of reprisal among the victims.
 
 
 818
 Abkhazian separatists reportedly executed as many as 800 Georgians and other
 non-Abkhaz who remained in the Gali region of Abkhazia. From January through
 April, the following executions reportedly took place: 32 in Ganathleba; 40 in
 Giudara; 11 in Muhuri- 14 in Muhurchi; 9 in Tsarchushi; 55 in Okami; 16 in Perveli
 Gali; and 17 in Nabaevi. The Abkhaz   lice reportedly shot some victims. The
 also allegedly tortured some victims before burning them to death. Rape, which
 often took place in front of the victim's family, was so common that there were no
 attempts to keep statistics. Many of those executed allegedly were the elderly and
 women.
 Abkhazian police officers on November 15 seized an elderly ethnic Mingrelian
 man in Kokhoria, attached wires to the man's legs, and doused him with diesel fuel.
 They then attached the wires to a battery and repeatedly shocked the man. The
 man's relatives found him alive but unconscious. They alerted the police com-
 mander, who beat and arrested the officers responsible.
 Despite international law which provides that IDP's have the right to free, safe,
 and dignified return to their homes, the 250,000 Georgians who fledAbkhazia dur-
 ing the 1993 ethnic cleansing campaign were officially allowed to begin returning
 only in October. By years end, fewer than 300 had returned. Unofficially, severa
 thousand IDP's spontaneously returned, but only at great personal risk. Until the
 Russian peacekeeping operation took over in mid-November, Abkhazian forces were
 in charge of providing security in the Gall security zone. Days prior to the first offi-
 cial returnoflDPs in October, 200 Abkhazian police, reportedly in the presence of
 the Abkhazian minister of the interior razed 4 Georgian villages in the Gal area,
 killing 20 persons, after unknown assalants killed 4 Abkhazian police officers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-In practice, freedom of the press in 1994 was
 almost universal. The authorities did not attempt to reimpose censorship of the
 antigovernment press. Virtually all newspapers that had been closed in the past re-
 opened, some under new names.
 Opposition leaders also obtained uncensored access to television and radio broad-
 cast time, although they frequently complained that they did not receive enough air
 time. Adjarian parliament chairman Aslan Abashidze accused the Georgian Govern-
 ment of denying Adjar television 10 minutes a day to broadcast on Georgian tele-
 vision. However, the energy crisis, damage from a fire in October at the Tbilisi radio
 and television tower, and paper shortages limited all media.
 Journalists covering demonstrations were subject to police beatings through most
 of the year, as well as to harassment by political forces opposing their views. On
 average, police beat one or two journalists per month, including a local Reuters re-
 porter on June 14 and another journalist during the October visit of the U.N. Sec-
 retary General.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government was more tol-
 erant of antigovernment demonstrations during 1994 than in previous years. How-
 ever, law enforcement troops continued to disperse unsanctioned rallies, sometimes
 forcibly. In practice, the Government allowed demonstrations anywhere except along
 the main thoroughfare, Rustaveli Avenue, provided the organizers requested permis-
 sion in advance. Opposition groups aarently did not always seek permission and
 then complained that police harassed them while dispersing unsanctioned rallies.
 Fuently, the Gover     ent preemptively deployed special police (OMON) units,
 whose chilling presence intimidated would-be demonstrators.
 On frequent occasions, police briefly detained opposition leaders who organized
 unsanctioned demonstrations. On July 9, police and OMON units forcibly broke up
 a demonstration organized by several opposition parties, and police detained at least
 one of the radical opposition leaders.
 c. Freedom of Rehlgion.-The Government took no actions to restrict freedom of
 religion.
 d Freedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foreign Travel, Emrn ation, and Re-
 patriation.-The old Soviet system of registerngresien  sill remains in place, al-
 though enforcement is uneven. Both foreign and internal travel, as well as emigra-
 tion, are unrestricted. There are, however, practical problems with travel in the
 areas of former conflict (see Section v.g.).
 Citizens generally enjoy the right to return, but there is continuing controversy
 over the desire of former, primarily Muslim,residents of the Mskheti region, de-
 ported from Georgia by Stalin in 1944 to return to that area. Approximtely-270,000
 Mskhetians now living in Russia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Kazakbstan, and other parts
 of Central Asia face significant popular oppsition to their return. The Cabinet is-
 sued a decree on August 23 that wouldpermit the Mskhetians to return; Par-
 liament, however, has not yet passed the legislation to implement it. In November,
 
 
 819
 150 Mskhetians attempted to return via Tskhinvali in South Ossetia, but Russian
 peacekeepers and Georgian police reportedly stopped them. However, the Govern-
 ment has established a repatriation service, which currently subsidizes the study of
 100 young Mskhetians in Georgia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 225-member Parliament and its chairman, Eduard Shevardnadze, were elect-
 ed in nationwide multiparty elections in 1992, which international observers judged
 to be generally ree and fair despite widespread technical violations. Parliament is
 drafting a new election law to govern the next elections, scheduled for October 1995.
 In the Adjar Autonomous Republic, Asian Abashidze was elected chairman of the
 Supreme Council in free and fair elections in 1991. The next parliamentary elections
 are scheduled for October 1995.
 Women and minorities are less well represented in Parliament than they were
 during the Soviet or Gamsakhurdia eras. The participation of women in politics is
 generally limited, partly as a result of longstanding cultural traditions and partly
 as a baclash to the Gamsakhurdia era, when women were perceived to be among
 the ex-president's most ardent supporters. There are only 11 women deputies in the
 Parliament, and there are no women serving in ministerial posts. The lack of sup-
 port for minority candidates may reflect some resonance for Gamsakhurdia's
 proetbnic Georgian policies and the resulting conflicts.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not prevent nongovernmental organizations from inves-
 tigating human rights violations. There are several organizations which profess to
 be human rights monitors, but they often are composedof political opponents of the
 current Government and have largely political, rather than human rights, agendas.
 The members of the All-Georgian A.ssocziation of Human Rights, the Helsinkli Union
 of Georgia, and the Historical Justice League predominantly were supporters of
 former president Gamsakhurdia.
 In October President Shevardnadze issued a decree that charged the SCHR with
 inspecting the conditions of detainees and inmates, offering written appeals to the
 appropriate officials to eliminate such abuses, and insctig the conitions of de-
 tainees and prisoners. It issued a report on human rights in Georgia, highiighting
 M v a r i e t   ou a u s e s   c i te   aiov e .
 Seion 4  u Governmente   with international human rights organizations. It as-
 sistd Human Rights Watch/Helsinki in visiting 19 persons on trial for terrorism
 and other crimes (see Section i.e.) who claimed their human rights were violated,
 as well as in other investigations. However, no organization has yet obtained access
 to Lte Kobalia (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disabilit Language, or So-
 cia     a Status
 There are no legal or constitutional prohibitions against discrimination.
 Women-overnment concern, as well as the concern of society at large, about
 discrimination against women is limited. Although in 1994 Geoa signed the Con-
 vention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, there
 is no distinct women's movement, nor are there academic programs in women  a
 studies. The dominant stereotype th te majority of Gamsakhourdia's supporters
 were somewhat irrational women has significantly weakened women's involvement
 in politics (see Section 3).
 Women's access to education resources is unimpeded, but women are found mostly
 in so-called traditional occupations, such as the arts, languages, and social sciences.
 Careers that involve technical skills, applied sciences, or supposedly "more complex"
 reasoning are heavily male-dominated. Women's labor is geney low paid and
 often, part-time, although government positions reportedl  are  ad on an equal
 basis. In a growing trend, women engaged in  cottage industries" are becoming the
 primary breadwinners.
 Credible statistics on violence against women are difficult to obtain. In July the
 Ministry of Interior stated that, during the first half of 1994, reports of rape had
 declined by 10 percent. Sociologists and domestic spcialists claim instances of raet
 and domestic vio lenc are rare; however, the lack of statistics could reflect victims'
 fear of reporting such crimes as well as lack of confidence in law enforcement and
 judicial organs.
 Children.-vThe economic crisis which continued to grip Georgia in 1994 prevented
 government expenditures on the welfare of children adequate to meet their needs.
 The severe economic conditions have resulted in children being left without homes
 
 
 820
 or being forced to beg. In September a children's adv   u   p was established,
 and in 1994 Georgia signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
 National/RacidlIEthni Minorities.-Neither the 1921 Constitution, supposedly
 reinstated in 1992, nor Georgian legislation contains antidiscrimination provisions.
 With the exception of the situation in the former conflict zones, the Government
 generally respects the rights of ethnic minorities, although information on areas out-
 side the capital is scarce, and some ethnic Azeris from southern Georgia came to
 Tbilisi in September to protest against what they claim is unfair treatment. Local
 police and officials sometimes discriminate against non-Georgians, but the central
 authorities usually try to resolve complaints.
 The Government provides funds for ethnic schools, and the teaching of non-Geor-
 gian lages is permitted. In Azeri-populated areas, where Georgian is not the
 prima    an  age, the poor quality of Georgian-language instruction and the wider
 availability of Azeri-language schools produce graduates with limited professional
 opportunities in Georgia.
 Religious Minoritle.-Freedom of religion is widely respected in Georgia (see Sec-
 tion 2.c.). The Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, however, is wary of pros-
 elytism and has exhibited an intolerant attitude toward the growing Protestant
 movement. The Salvation Army publicly complained of hostile articles regarding the
 resident Salvation Army mission and of the Georgian Orthodox Church a negative
 disposition. The Catholic Church has also complained of the delay in the return of
 six churches, closed during the Soviet era and later given to the Georgian Orthodox
 Church.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislative or otherwise mandated provision
 requiring accessibility for the disabled. The law on labor has a section which in-
 cludes the provision of numerous special discounts and favorable social policies for
 those with disabilities, especially disabled veterans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Soviet-era Labor Code still in effect in Georgia
 allows workers freely to form unions and associations. These unions and associa-
 tions must register with the Ministry of Justice. A single Confederation of Trade
 Unions, made up of about 30 sectoral unions, is active in Georgia. Membership in
 labor unions has fallen as the economy collapsed and interest in the labor movement
 declined.
 Strikes are permitted, except during a state of emergency. Because of the extreme
 economic crisis, however, there were few strikes in 1994.
 There are no legal prohibitions against affiliation and participation in inter-
 national organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code allows work-
 ers to organize and bargain collectively, and this right is widely respected. The
 Labor Code also prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members. Employers may be prosecuted for antiunion discrimination and, if found
 guilty, would be required to reinstate the employees and pay them back wages. The
 Ministry of Labor investigates complaints but is not sufficiently staffed to conduct
 effective investigations.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code _prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and provides for sanctions against violators; violations are rare.
 The Ministry of Labor enforces the law.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to the Labor Code, the
 minimum age for employment of children is 14 years. Children between 14 and 16
 years may not work more than 30 hours per week. Reportedly, the minimum age
 is widely respected. Because of the Ministry's inadequate resources, unions them-
 selves are often left to enforce the minimum age law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions for Work.-A nationally mandated minimum wage ap-
 plies only to the government sector. In December 1994, the Government raised the
 minimum wage to about $0.50 (1.5 million coupons) a month. There is no state-man-
 dated minimum wage for private sector workers, who are free to bargain for any
 wage.
 The law provides for a 40-hour workweek, including a 24-hour rest period, al-
 though the Government adopted a 35-hour workweek for the winter period from No-
 vember 15, 1994, through February 15, 1995. The energy crisis in mid-November
 further prompted the Government to permit government workers at their discretion
 to reduce their workweek to 30 hours.
 The Labor Code permits higher wages for hazardous work and permits a worker
 in such a field to refuse duties that could endanger his life. The Government has
 not addressed further safeguards for workers.
