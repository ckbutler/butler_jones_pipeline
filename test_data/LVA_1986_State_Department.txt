 LATVIA*
 An independent Baltic state between the two World Wars, Latvia
 was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as a constituent
 republic of the U.S.S.R. The United States does not recognize
 the forcible incorporation of Latvia into the U.S.S.R.
 Latvia is subjected to the same centralized rule, the same
 Constitution and judicial system, the same restrictions on
 civil and political liberties, and the same police controls as
 the republics in the Soviet Union. Moreover, Soviet policy
 toward the Latvian nation arouses great concern because the
 process of Russification threatens its survival as a distinct
 ethnic group. The influx of Slavic migrants has reduced the
 proportion of Latvians in Latvia to only 53 percent of the
 total population. In Riga, the capital of Latvia, Latvians
 comprise 41 percent of the total population.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia is regarded as
 economically better off than most areas of the Soviet Union.
 This is beginning to change, however, as the central
 authorities divert scarce resources to less developed areas.
 Human rights violations by the authorities continued in 1986.
 Expressions of national consciousness were harshly repressed.
 The state of religious liberty continued to deteriorate as the
 authorities harassed the clergy and lay leaders of several
 faiths. Latvians active in human rights issues continued to
 face persecution and arrest.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Several Latvian activists have died in Soviet custody in
 recent years, although no deaths were reported in 1986.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture or Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Throughout the Soviet system, cruel and inhuman treatment of
 political prisoners occurs during both interrogation and
 confinement to labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric hospitals.
 Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners is common, as is
 detention under extremely unhealthy or otherwise onerous
 conditions. For example, Zakhar Zunshain was beaten so badly
 upon arrival at the Irkutsk labor camp that he suffered broken
 ribs and damage to his kidneys.
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Latvia, the
 systemic human rights abuses described in the report on the
 U.S.S.R. apply also to Latvia. This report discusses only
 instances of repression specific to Latvia.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet legal provisions are written and interpreted so broadly
 that Latvians may be arrested and convicted for exercising
 basic human rights.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party subverts
 constitutional guarantees of the objectivity and independence
 of the judicial process in political cases. The self-
 determined compelling needs of the State override the rights
 of a defendant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through the use of informers, mail censorship, electronic
 monitoring of telephones, and other devices, government
 authorities have the ability, widely exercised, to interfere
 in every aspect of personal life. Constitutional guarantees
 to the contrary, Soviet investigative agencies do not abstain
 from forced entry and illegal searches.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties as long as their exercise accords with the
 strengthening and security of the "Socialist" system. In
 practice, the authorities do not tolerate freedom of speech
 and press or any dissident behavior.
 In September 1986, Latvians in and near Riga received
 unprecedented exposure to differing points of view on
 Soviet-American relations and related issues.  For 6 days,
 the Soviet Friendship Society was host to the bilaterally
 sponsored "Chautauqua" Conference in the coastal city of
 Yurmala, near Riga. Latvian television, also received in
 Estonia and Lithuania, provided an hour or more every night
 from the conference discussions and broadcast five concerts by
 American performers as well. However, highly selective
 reporting of sensitive issues by the central television and
 press, together with warnings to local inhabitants against
 contact with conference delegates, reflected continued Soviet
 denial of the right to receive other than officially approved
 information.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 but the authorities strictly control all associations and
 organizations. Latvians peacefully celebrating Latvian
 independence day are subject to arrest. Foreigners visiting
 their Latvian relatives are frequently interrogated and
 harassed.
 As noted previously, Soviet authorities made repeated and
 concerted efforts to control contacts between American
 Chautauqua delegates and unofficial Latvians. These attempts
 largely failed, however, due to the high profile of the
 conference and Soviet unwillingness to take dramatic
 restrictive actions which would have spoiled the conference's
 atmosphere.

 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Latvia.
 Although the Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right independently of state-sponsored and controlled
 unions have been brutally repressed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional guarantees, religious activity is the
 subject of systematic official harassment. Latvians were
 among the Soviet Pentecostalists who signed a 1986 appeal,
 sent to General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan,
 against constant harassment and continued refusal of exit
 visas. Members of the Roman Catholic, Baptist, and
 Seventh-Day Adventist churches also appear to have encountered
 more difficulties with the authorities than the larger
 Lutheran church, perhaps because of their outspokenness. One
 Lutheran pastor was reportedly released this year after
 serving only 1 year of a 5-year sentence for "anti-Soviet
 agitation and propaganda." The release followed his public
 renunciation of his "subversive" views. On the other hand,
 Lidija Doronina-Lasmane, a Baptist, remains in a prison camp
 in Mordovia.
 Although Latvian Jews suffer marginally less harassment than
 other Jewish communities in the Soviet Union, the community
 remains widely restricted in its ability to practice Judaism
 and to educate its youth. One Jewish refusenik activist,
 Zakhar Zunshain, was sentenced to a labor camp in March 1984
 for "slander of the Soviet State." Although his health has
 deteriorated markedly, prison authorities have reportedly
 threatened to invoke a recently implemented law to extend his
 sentence indefinitely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Soviet authorities do not respect the right of emigration.
 The granting of permission to emigrate from Latvia is
 arbitrary and subject to increasing restrictions. The
 authorities harass Latvians whose desire to emigrate is known
 by denying them work in their specialty, by excluding them
 from educational institutions, and by other punitive measures.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As in other areas under Soviet control, political activity
 outside the Communist Party is not tolerated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government rejects any foreign criticism of its
 human rights record, maintaining that all internationally
 recognized human rights are fully protected. Its attitude
 toward investigation of the human rights situation in Latvia
 is uncompromisingly negative.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Since its annexation, Latvia, with its population of about
 2.5 million, has become an industrial workshop and trading

 center for the Soviet Union. The process of industrialization
 was accompanied by a large influx of Slavic workers from
 elsewhere in the Soviet Union because of Latvia's small labor
 force and low birth rate.
 The large proportion (about 47 per cent) of non-Latvians in
 the population has placed the Latvian language and culture in
 jeopardy. Lacking an internal rallying point, such as the
 Roman Catholic Church provides for Lithuanians, Latvians face
 poor prospects in their efforts to preserve their cultural
 traditions.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men. An
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 enable women to obtain and retain employment outside the
 home. However, women generally hold less remunerative
 positions in most professions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The statutory minimum age for the employment of children in
 1986 was 16, and the standard workweek was 40 hours. The
 minimum wage was set at $112 per month at the official rate of
 exchange. According to the latest official data, the average
 wage is about $272 per month. Soviet law requires, in general
 terms, healthy and safe working conditions, but they usually
 fall short of Western standards.
