 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is governed by President Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African
 National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) which has dominated the legislative and
 executive branches of government since independence in 1980. The Constitution al-
 lows for multiple parties; in addition to ZANU-PF, there are a large number of
 smaller parties. However they are poorly organized, poorly financed, and subject to
 periodic intimidation by the ruling party and government security forces.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) are responsible for maintaining law and
 order. The Police Internal Security and Intelligence (PISI) Unit, a branch of the
 ZRP, and the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) under the Ministry of State
 Security are responsible for internal and external security. The Zimbabwean Na-
 tional Army and Air Force also have intelligence staff structures, which perform a
 variety of intelligence and security functions. Since 1991, the 110 and PISI have
 not been permitted to arrest or detain suspects in internal security cases. The CIO
 and PISI were accused of human rights abuses in the past, including the use of tor-
 ture, and still periodically harass opposition political parties. There were no new re-
 ports of other human rights abuses committed by the 0I0 or the PISI. There was
 one instance of wrngfu use of lethal fire in 1994, and there wer e  reports
 that police sometimes beat suspected criminals. A significant number of police offi-
 cers were tried and punished for such abuses. ZRP authorities cooperated with local
 human rights groups to incorporate a legal and human rights curriculum into regu-
 lar police training.
 Zimbabwe's economy has strong agricultural and mining sectors, a diversified
 manufacturing base, and a growing services sector. The country is 4 years into its
 Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP), which has led to a host of
 changes and dislocations, such as the removal of subsidies for staple foods, that
 have caused living standards to falL. The unemployment rate remains above 45 per-
 cent, and both domestic and foreign investment are well below what is needed to
 spur solid economic growth and job creation. The p ace of Zimbabwe's land acquisi-
 tion program, which was used in the past to punish political opponents of the Gov-
 ernment, slowed in late 1994 as the Government concentrated on resettlement and
 land tenure issues.
 The human rights climate in Zimbabwe generally improv     ed by several Su-
 preme Court rings that bolstered the rights of women, free assembly, freedom of
 the press, and due process. The Government took some steps to address continuing
 problems of harsh prison conditions and sought to improve police performance
 trough training and prosecuting offiers responsible for abuses.-However, the Gov-
 ernment took no action to investigate and prosecute those responsille for atrocities
 committed during the 1982-87 "Matabeleland Dissident Cryisis The ruling party
 continued to domnatd the political arena, in part because opposition parties were
 
 
 298
 unable to qualify for public funds disbursed under the 1992 Political Parties Finance
 Act. President Mugabe's pardon in January of a CIO agent and a ruling party offi-
 cial convicted of the 1990 attempted murder of an opposition candidate for Par-
 liament sent a negative signal that human rights abuses and violence committed
 on behalf of the ruling party would be tolerated. Although the small independent
 press was increasingly open and critical of the Government, the more influential
 electronic media remained government controlled. Domestic violence against women
 remained widespread, and traditional, often illegal, discrimination against women
 and the disabled continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government security forces, but the police killed one person in a shooting
 incident. The ZRP launched its own investigations of approximately 10 lethal fire
 incidents in 1993. The Government prosecuted or disciplined well over a third of po-
 lice officers involved in shooting incidents.
 The inquest into the 1990 death in police custody of 15-year-old Happy Dhlakama
 was inconclusive. The presiding magistrate ruled that Dblakama ha been beaten
 by polie special onstables but was unable to determine whether or not he had died
 ohis iuries. The inquest revealed problems with the handling of medical treat-
 ment and records in questionable deaths. The Catholic Commission for Justice and
 Peace (CCJP) is now pursuing compensation for Dhlakama's family in civil court.
 The Government refused to reopen investigations of the 1988 death of Captain
 Edwin Nyela and the 1991 death of Lieutenant Shepard Chisango, despite contin-
 ued calls from Zimbabwean and international human rights gr.ups for inquests. The
 Government's handling of these cases will likely inhibit military officers from de-
 nouncing corruption in the armed forces in the future.
 There was no progress in the Simplicius Chihambakwe Commission's investiga-
 tion into atrocities committed during the 1982-87 Matabeleland Crisis. The informa-
 tion collected in 2 days of interviews in mid-1993 was reportedly so damaging that
 the investigation was indefinitely suspended. Human rights groups continued to col-
 lect information on reports of deaths and disappearances, but many relatives of the
 victims are too frightened to come forward with information. However, the newly
 enacted Births and Deaths Registration Amendment Act of 1994 will make it easier
 for relatives of the victims ofthe Matabeland Crisis to obtain relatives' death certifi-
 cates and thereby enroll children in school, obtain identity and travel documents for
 children, and settle estates.
 Despite President Mugabe's 1992 assertion that no compensation would be paid
 to victims of the Matabeleland Crisis because atrocities were committed 'during a
 state of war," two cases in 1994 set an important precedent for victims. In May the
 Ministry of Home Affairs and the ZRP agreed to pay compensation to the widow
 of Gibson Sibanda, whom police arrested and later murdered for political reasons
 in 1985. In late 1993, the Government admitted liability for the wrongful arrest and
 loss of property and income stemming from Lloyd Kudzai's detention by the CIO
 from 1983-1987. Kudzai's High Court testimony included allegations of torture and
 ill-treatment of prisoners at Ross Camp in Bulawayo.
 The CCJP believes that the mass graves discovered at Antelope Mine near Kezi
 in 1992 contained the remains of victims of extrajudicial killings committed by the
 army between 1983 and 85. The CCJP has called for a full-scale investigation. How-
 ever, the Government has taken no action to investigate the site and also failed to
 respond to the Catholic Bishop of Bulawayo's request that a "service of reconcili-
 ation" be held at the mine to commemorate the dead.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances in 1994. The case of
 Rashiwe Guzha, who disappeared in 1990, has not been reopened despite calls from
 the CCJP and the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS) for a new
 investigation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no credible reports of torture in 1994. The Government has not actively
 pursued allegations that torture was used in the past and did not prosecute CIO
 or ZRP officials for such abuses in 1994. Despite improved ZRP training, the beating
 of criminal suspects and detainees by the ZRP remained a problem in 1994, particu-
 larly among low-ranking police and poorly trained parapolice called special con-
 stables.
 Prison conditions have not improved since the CCJP issued its 1993 report de-
 scribing extreme overcrowding, shortages of clothing, and poor sanitary conditions.
 Over 22,000 prisoners are incarcerated in a prison system built to accommodate
 
 
 299
 16,000. In some prisons, prisoners are allowed about one-half square meter per per-
 son. Overcrowding and poor sanitation aggravated outbreaks of cholera, diarrhea,
 and AIDS-related illnesses. According to the Zimbabwean Ffison Service, an aver-
 age of 25 prisoners a month died in custody, 18 from AflDS-related illnesses. (The
 HIV-positive rate of the general Zimbabwean population is roughly 10 percent; the
 rate is likely much higher in the prison population, most of whom are i the most
 affected 19- to 49-year-old-age bracket.) The Supreme Court ruled in August that
 restrictions limiting prisoners to one letter per month were excessive.
 In response to the problems, the Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary A-
 fairs and the Zimbabiwean Prison Service, in conjunction with the Legal Resources
 Foundation (LRF), a human rights group that focuses on legal rights, have under-
 taken a program in human rights training for prison service employees in the hopes
 of improving their treatment of prisoners. Prison Service officials who violate prison
 rules and mistreat prisoners are routinely punished.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-;The )lice must by law inform an ar-
 rested person of the charges against him before  e is taken into custody. Although
 a preliminary hearing is required before a magistrate within 48 hours (or 96 hours
 over a weekend), the law is often disre arded if a person does not have legal rep-
 resentation. A 1992 amendment to the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act sub-
 stantially reduced the power of magistrates to grant bail without the consent of the
 Attorney General or his agents. Although the rule has been decried by legal practi-
 tioners and magistrates, in practice a circular issued by the Attorney General giving
 a general authority to rant bail has lessened the negative impact of the rule. High
 Court judges grant bal-independently.
 The Government may still apply a wide range of leg1 powers under the Official
 Secrets Act (OSA) or the Law and Order (MaintenancefAct (LOMA). Originally pro-
 mulgated 30 years ago and widely used in the past to prosecute political opponents
 of the government in power, the LOMA gives extensive powers to the police, the
 Minister of Home Affairs, and the President to address political and security crimes
 that are not clearly defined. The Government has not invoked the LOMA frequently,
 fearing that its oppressive provisions might be declared unconstitutional. However
 in February several leaders of the telecommunications union strike were detained
 briefly under the LOMA.
 Pretrial detainees spend an average of 3 months in prison before their trials be-
 cause of a critical shortage of magistrates and court interpreters. Zimbabwean law
 lacks provisions to allow judges to take time spent in pretrial detention into account
 in sentencing. Overall, 20 percent of detainees in Zimbabwean jails in 1994 had not
 yet been tried, down from 22 percent in 1993. In August the Supreme Court oi'dered
 a detainee's release after ruling that long pretrial incarceration violated his right
 to a spedy trial. However, Daniel Macha , whose murder trial has been delayed
 for more than 7 years, remained in custody. To reduce pretrial detention, the Gev-
 ernment appointed additional High Court judges and expanded the magistrates
 courts.
 The Government held no political detainees at year's end. Exile is not used as a
 means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Customary Law and Local Courts Act of 1990
 created a unitary court system, consisting of headmen's courts, chiefs' courts, mag-
 istrates' courts, the High Court, and the Supreme Court. With this restructuring,
 civil customary law cases may be heard at all levels of the judiciary, including the
 Supreme Court. The reactivation of chiefs' and headmen's courts made the legal sys-
 tem much more accessible to people in remote areas who had had little contact with
 the formal court system. The Government implemented training programs for pre-
 siding officers in chiefs' and headmens' courts to help eliminate traditional but ille-
 gal practices such as the custom of forcing a widow to marry her late husband's
 rother.
 Zimbabwe's judiciary has a well-deserved reputation for independence. Judges
 serve life terms and can be removed from the bench only for gross misconduct. They
 are not discharged or transferred for political reasons. However, magistrates, who
 are part of the civil service rather than the judiciary, hear the vast majority of cases
 in Zimbabwe and are sometimes subject to political pressure.
 The Government generally abides by court decisions even when it is strongly op-
 posed to the rulings. However, in the past, the Government passed a series of con-
 stitutional amendments which undermined major Supreme Court rulings. For exam-
 ple, Amendment 11 changed the Constitution to allow corporal punishment of mi-
 nors after the Supreme Court ruled that caning of minors constituted cruel and in-
 human punishment; the Government also asserted that death by hanging was not
 cruel and inhuman, in anticipation of a CCJP test case challenging hanging as a
 method of execution. Similarly, Amendment 13, passed just weeks after the Su-
 
 
 300
 preme Court ruled that long incarceration on death row constituted cruel and inhu-
 man punishment, declared that neither treatment of prisoners nor delays in carry-
 ing out sentences entitled prisoners to a stay or remission of sentence (see Section
 1.c.).
 The Magistrates Court found the CIO and ZANU-PF officers who shot opposition
 party candidate Patrick Kombayi during the 1990 campaign guilty of attempted
 murder. President Mugabe granted the two a remission of sentence within 48 hours
 of the Supreme Court's ruling upholding their conviction. The pardon sent a nega-
 tive signal to the Zimbabwean public that abuses on behalf of the ruling party
 would be tolerated, as did the subsequent appointment of one of the two men to the
 ZANUJ-PF Central Committee. Further investigations of the part Vice President
 Simon Muzenda's driver and bodyguard may have had in the shooting have not
 been carried out.
 Every defendant has the right to a lawyer of his or her choosing. However, well
 over 90 percent of defendants in magistrates courts go unrepresented. In criminal
 cases an indigent may apply to have the Government supply an attorney, but this
 type of representation is rarely applied for and rarely granted. In capital cases the
 Government will provide an attorney for all defendants unable to afford one. How-
 ever, human rights groups have highlighted the poor quality of some of the rep-
 resentation provided to indigents, particularly in capital cases. Litigants in civil
 cases can request legal assistance from the LRF or the Ministry of Justice's Citizens
 Advice Bureau. All litigants are represented in the High Court.
 The Supreme Court has instructed magistrates to ensure that unrepresented de-
 fendants fully understand their rights and to weigh any mitigating circumstances
 in criminal cases, whether or not the accused presents them as part of his defense.
 The right to appeal exists in all cases and is automatic in cases in which the death
 penalty is imposed. Trials are open to the public except in certain security cases.
 The legal system does not discriminate against women or minorities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects citizens from arbitrary search or entry, and since the lifting
 of the State of Emergency (SOE) in June 1990, these protections have been gen-
 erally respected. It is widely known, however, that the Government monitors private
 correspondence and telephones, particularly international communications.
 Although the need for land reform in Zibabwe is almost universally accepted,
 pursuant to the 1992 Land Acquisition Act farmers whose lands have been des-
 ignated for acquisition may only appeal the amount of compensation in administra-
 tive courts, not the decision to acquire their farms.
 The Act has been implemented largely along racial lines; the Government stated
 that black-owned commercial farms would not be subject to designation. In some
 cases, land has been designated for acquisition to achieve political goals. The des-
 ignation of former Member of Parliament (M.P.) Henry Ellsworth's home farm for
 acquisition, highlighted in the 1993 Human Rights Report as an example of the
 Land Acquisition Act's use as a political tool, has been revoked. However, opposition
 party leader Ndabaningi Sithole is still fighting the Government's acquisition of his
 Churu farm. After the Government's late 1993 attempt to evict more than 2,500
 families living on the property, several thousand Churn farm residents were reset-
 tled on a holding farm where several died as the result of abysmal sanitary condi-
 tions. The situation at Chur farm remained at a standoff until October 1994, when
 the ZRP evicted the remaining 1,600 residents and resettled them at a camp for-
 merly used by Mozambican refugees.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion but allows for legislation to limit this freedom in the "interest of defense, public
 safety, public order, state economic interests, public morality, and public health.*
 Zimbabwe's major print media (seven English-language newspapers and one ver-
 nacular broadsheet) belong to the Mass Media Trust, a holding company heavily in-
 fluenced by the Government and ruling party. The Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News
 Agency (ZIANA Wire Service) is controlled ly the Ministry of Information. The Gov-
 ernment influences mainstream media through indirect ownership, editorial ap-
 pointments, directives to editors, and removal of wayward editors. There is no real
 opposition press, but a small independent press, consisting primarily of a daily that
 ceased publication for financial reasons on December 25, an economic weekly, two
 Sunday tabloids, and three monthly magazines, carefully monitors government poli-
 cies and opens its pages to opposition critics. Other minor indepndent publications
 exist, mostly monthlies, with circulations under 3,000. The independent prss has
 been increasingly critical of the Government and the ruling party. Despite its harsh
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 public attacks on many of the independent publications, the Government has taken
 no overt punitive measures against them.
 There is a high degree of self-censorship in both the government-influenced and
 independent press, aggravated by antidefamation laws Which make no distinction
 between public and private persons and an extremely broad OSA. In February the
 authorities brought a Daily Gazette reporter and his editor to court and questioned
 them for alleged contravention of the OSA after the Gazette published a story about
 income tax evasion by state-owned enterprises. The Act, based on the first British
 OSA, makes it a crime to divulge "any information acquired in the course of official
 duties.:
 In March a High Court judge ruled that a reporter may keep his sources confiden-
 tial if he uncovers the commission of a crime or the existence of corruption because
 revelation of sources would make future informants reluctant to come forward and
 would therefore be detrimental to the public interest.
 Radio and television are entirely government owned and controlled. The Broad-
 casting Act gives the Zimbabwe Broadcast Corporation monopoly status. The Gov-
 ernment has repeatedly refused to license independent radio and television stations.
 Journalists report that ZANU-PF Secretary for Information (and Foreign Minister)
 Nathan Shamuyarira is often involved in determining what news is broadcast. Op-
 position party rallies and press conferences receive only limited television or radio
 coverage.
 The University of Zimbabwe Amendment Act and the National Council for Higher
 Education Act greatly restrict the independence of universities, making them sub-
 ject to government influence and extending the disciplinary powers of the university
 authorities against staff and students, thus curtailing academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly and association for political and nonpolitical organizations, in-
 cluding a broad spectrum of economic, social, professional, and recreational activi-
 ties.
 Organizations are generally free of governmental interference as long as their ac-
 tivities are viewed as nonpolitical. In March, as part of the trial of six trade union-
 ists arrested under the LOMA for participating in a prohibited demonstration in
 June 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that Section 6 of the LOMA (requiring police
 authorization for demonstrations) was unconstitutional because it interfered with
 the right to free speech. There are many active unions, political parties, and human
 rights organizations. The formation of unions and political parties is not restricted.
 In law and in practice, however, serious obstacles prevent the full exercise of this
 right particularly in the case of political associations (see Section 3).
 c. lreedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is respected in Zimbabwe. There is
 no state religion. Denominations are permitted to worship openly, pursue social and
 charitable activities, and maintain ties with affiliates and coreligionists abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foreign Travel, Xmigration, and Re-
 patriaton.-There were no reports of restrictions on domestic or international travel
 in 1994. Zimbabwean citizens do not have automatic right of return.
 In June the Supreme Court ruled that the practice of allowing only Zimbabwean
 men, not women, to confer citizenship or permanent residence status on their
 spouses and children was discriminatory. However, at year's end, the Immigration
 Service had not received implementing regulations to institute the change. The new
 Zimbabwean Citizenship and Immigration bill, presented to Parliament in mid-1994
 but not yet law, tightens prohibitions against dual citizenship and reduces the pe-
 riod a person can be out of the country without losing his Zimbabwean citizenship
 from 7 to 5 years. Zimbabwean human rights groups are concerned that these provi-
 sions will affect white Zimbabweans, many of whom hold dual citizenship, more di-
 rectly than black Zimbabweans and will interfere with citizens' right of return.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in
 1994 the registered refugee population went from over 100,000 to approximately
 750, mostly Mozambicans. Prior to Mozambique's elections, the Government and the
 UNHCR repatriated nearly 5,000 refugees per week. The Government permitted
 UNHCR officials unrestricted access to refugee camps. There were no reported in-
 stances of forced repatriation to a country where a refugee fears persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the legal right to change their government through democratic
 means, but the last general election in March 1990, which was marked by intimida-
 tion by the security forces, lopsided media coverage, inaccuracies in the voters' rolls
 and voting irregularities in some constituencies, called into question the ability of
 citizens to exercise that right. The ruling party captured 117 of the 120 seats in
 
 
 302
 those elections. The 10 chiefs who sit as M.P.'s are elected by their peers. The Presi-
 dent has the power further to appoint 8 provincial governors, who sit as M.P.'s, and
 12 nonconstituency M.P.'s; as a result, there is no effective parliamentary opposi-
 tion.
 President Mugabe and his Cabinet are the preeminent political figures, and the
 ruling party, ZANU-PF, is the dominant political organization in the country. Fol-
 lowing the amendment of the Constitution in 1987 to create a strong executive pres-
 idency, Robert Mugbe, who previously served as Prime Minister, became in 1988
 both the Head of State and the Head of Government. The Executive President was
 elected in 1990 to a term of 6 years. The President appoints both vice presidents
 and the rest of the Cabinet, who serve at his pleasure.
 There are many small political parties. However, the Political Parties Finance Act
 inhibits their growth by providing government fundming only to those parties that
 have more than 15 parliamentary seats, effectively giving a public funding to the
 ruling party. The 1994-95 budget provided $4.2 million for ZANU-PF.
 The net result of several constitutional amendments has been to consolidate the
 power of the executive branch and limit the M.P.s' ability to go against the party
 line. However, there was a small group of backbenchers in Parliament who vigor-
 ously confronted the Government on a number of issues ranging from corruption to
 government spending.
 The Electoral Supervisory Commission (ESC) ruled that both the July and Decem-
 ber parliamentary by-elections were free and fair. However, the July by-elections
 were marred by various unfair practices. There were credible reports that CIO
 agents intimidated would-be voters in Gwanda North by warning that the infamous
 "Fifth Brigade" (which left a trail of murder and torture there from 1982 to 1987)
 would return if they did not vote for ZANU-PF. Rural dwellers reported that govern-
 ment agents warned that they would not be eligible to receive food aid if they sup-
 ported opposition candidates. There were credible reports that people in several dis-
 tricts in Manicaland were denied food aid unless they could prove that they had reg-
 istered to vote, or, in at least one case, could produce a ZANU-PF card.
 The CIO occasionally harassed and threatened opposition party members. In May
 ZANU-PF Youth League and Women's League supporters attacked the site of a
 Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUM) rally, burned a trailer, and beat up 10 ZUM sup-
 porters guarding the rally ground. The ruling party provided transportation for the
 perpetrators to the rally site. After ZANU-PF supporters interfered in a ZANU-
 Ndonga rally in June supporters of both groups hurled stones and bottles at each
 other, and a ZANU-14F member was wounded by an arrow. In July several opposi-
 tion party leaders called on their supporters to arm themselves. Zimbabwean human
 rights groups expressed concern that President Mugabe's call for a youth league
 "door-to-door campaign" would lead to a repeat of 1985 campaign violence when
 gangs of youths went from house to house demanding that residents produce their
 party cards. In several incidents in the Midlands andMasvingo, the police fined in-
 dividuals who threatened oppositionists.
 In preparation for 1995 parliamentary elections, the Reg    General's office
 continued to update the voter rolls which were "in a shamlles," according to the
 Ministry of Home Affairs. Members of Parliament and opposition party members
 complained that copies of the voter rolls were not made available to them. In early
 1994, the Registrar General refused to allow opposition parties to distribute voter
 registration forms at their meetings, saying voters needed to come individually to
 the Registrar General's office or other registration points to register. Opposition par-
 ties and human rights groups also cmpained that some of the ESC's five members,
 tasked with overseeing the conduct of the campaign and the general election, have
 not renounced their ties to ZANU-PF. The ECcurrently lacks the institutional ca-
 pacity to supervise the campaign or oversee Zimbabwe's more than 2,000 polling
 stations. The reJP noted that during the 1990 elections the ESC acted promptly
 to deal with irregularities.
 Women participat in politics without legal restriction. However, Zimbabwean
 women's groups assert that husbands, particularly in rural areas, commonly force
 their wives to vote for their candidates. One female Minister of State and three fe-
 male deputy ministers (none of whom actually sits in the Cabinet) serve at the cabi-
 net level, but of the 150 M.P.'s, only 17 are women. In addition, some critics charge
 that the existence of women's wings in political parties, notably the ruling party,
 marginalzes women from mainstream political activities.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 tolocal civic and human i.                           hts groups to operate
 in Zimbabwe, it monitors oeir activities closely, in particular the CCJPand
 
 
 303
 ZIMRIGHTS. Other groups that promote human rights include the LRF, the South-
 ern African Federation of the Disabled, and the Southern African Human Rights
 Foundation.
 The Government permits the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 to operate a regional office in Harare, and it cooperates with the UNHCR and the
 ICRC to assist Mozambican, South African, and other refugees. The Government
 does not discourage representatives from international human rights groups from
 visiting Zimbabwe.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that "every person in Zimbabwe' is entitled to fun-
 damental rights whatever his race, tribe, place of origin, political opinions, color,
 creed, or sex. However, the Constitution's section on discrimination does not specifi-
 cally refer to the rights of women.
 Women.-Since independence the Government has enacted major laws aimed at
 enhancing women's rights and countering certain traditional practices that discrimi-
 nate against women. The Legal Age of Majority Act and the Matrimonial Causes
 Act recognize the capacity of women to act independently of their husbands or fa-
 thers to own property. However, while unmarried women may own property in their
 own names, married women (married under customary not general law) are not al-
 lowed to own property jointly with their husbands. In an August speech, President
 Mugabe labeled joint ownershi of roperty "un-African." Inheritance laws remain
 unfavorable to widows, especially urban black women who were married under cus-
 tomary law. Although the Government has circulated a draft inheritance law that
 would address the issue of unfair and unequal distribution of inherited assets, as
 of year's end no legislative action had been taken on the draft. Divorce and mainte-
 nance laws are more favorable toward women, but women generally lack awareness
 of their rights under the law.
 Many women remain disadvantaged in Zimbabwean society. Illiteracy, economic
 dependen, and prevailing social norms prevent rural women in particular from
 combating societal discrimination. Despite legal prohibitions, women are still vul-
 nerable to entrenched customary practices. Among these persistent practices are
 k-uzvarira,' the ptractice of pledging a young woman to marriage with a partner not
 of her choosing,  nhaka," the custom of forcing a widow to mar her late husband's
 brother, "lobo a," the customary obigation of a groom to pay a bride price to the
 parents of a would-be wife; and ngozi," the customary practice of offering a young
 girl as compensatory payment in intrfamily disputes. In August Parliament
 criminalized the common practice of refusing to bury a woman until lobola is paid,
 equating the crime to extortion. Many doctors and hospitals routinely require the
 husband's consent for women seeking long-termcontraception.
 Although labor legislation prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of
 gender, women are concentrated n the lower echelons of the work force and com-
 monly face sexual harassment in the workplace.
 Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is common and crosses
 all racial and economic lines in Zimbabwe.Women's groups have noted that every
 plie station in Zimbabwe has handled at least one case of a woman killed by her
 husban                 e 1992, 4,437 official complaints of wife battering were fied. The Musasa
 Project, which specializes in research and counseling on domestic violence, said cul-
 tural attitudes are changing, and that wife beatng  is  rsinegly considered so-
 cialy unacceptable.
 There were 964 reports of rape (the majority involving girls under 14) in 1992,
 the last year for which police statistics are available.
 Several active women's rights groups in Zimbabwe, including Women in Law in
 Southern Africa, the Musasa Project, Women in Law and Development, and the
 Women's Action Group, concentrate on improving women's knowledge of their legal
 rights, economic empowerment of women, and combating domestic violence.
 Chiddren.-The Government enacted the Children's Protection and Adoption Act,
 the Guardianship of Minors Act, and the Deceased Personcs Maintenance Act, to
 protect the legal rights of minor children. The criminal justice system has special
 provisions for dealing with juveniles, although there is no juvenile court. While
 there is no compulsory education, Zimbabwe has made considerable progress inpr-
 viding education for girls, and overall primary school attendance has increased by
 more than 400 percent since independence. However, with the reintroduction of
 school fees in urban schools and rural secondary schools, enrollment has declined.
 Incest, long taboo in Zimbabwean societyhis increasing. Child abuse, as such, does
 provisionspor tbe widespread, although there are increasing reports of infanticide
 aschld fe   ubandonment.
 
 
 304
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) has been condemned by international health ex-
 perts as danaing to both physical and psychological health, and it is rarely per-
 formed in Zimbabwe. However, according to press reports these initiation rites are
 still practiced on young girls by the small Remba ethnic group and include
 infibulation, the most extreme form of FGM.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Shona ethnic group comprises 77 per-
 cent of the population, Ndebele 14 percent, Kalanga 5 percent, whites 1 percent, and
 other ethnic groups 3 percent. Government services are provided on a nondiscrim-
 inatory basis and the Government has sought to expand and improve the previously
 "whites onlys infrastructure in urban areas to provide health and social services to
 all citizens. Nevertheless, in social terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified
 country despite legal prohibitions against official discrimination. While schools and
 churches are all integrated, social interaction among racial groups is still limited.
 In 1994 Ndebele leaders complained that Matabeleland Nort and South have not
 received an adequate share of national development resources for tribal reasons. In
 addition, the disproportionate number of Shona-speaking teachers and headmasters
 in Matabeleland schools remained a sensitive issue.
 People With Disabilities.-The Disabled Persons Act of 1992 specifically prohibits
 discrimination against people with disabilities in employment admission to public
 places, or provision of services and is viewed by advocates of the disabled as model
 legislation. In practice, however, the lack of resources for training and education se-
 verely hampers the ability of disabled people to compete for scarce jobs. Although
 the Act stipulates that access for disabled persons should be provided in government
 buildings, few government buildings have been adjusted for the disabled. Disabled
 people ace particularly harsh customary discrimination. According to traditional be-
 ief, people with disabilities are consi ered bewitched and reports of handicapped
 chiladren be  hidden when visitors arrive are common. A disability board was ap-
 pointed by P   ident Mugabe in 1992 to spearhead equitable distribution of re-
 sources to the disabled but met only twice before the Ministry of Public Service,
 Labor and Social Welfare cut off its funding.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Relations Act (LRA) provides private sec-
 tor workers freedom of association, the right to elect their own representatives, pub-
 lish newsletters, and set programs and policies which reflect the political and eco-
 nomic interests of labor. Workers are free to form or join unions without prior au-
 thorization. The LRA allows for the existence of multiple unions per industry pro-
 vided that each is registered with the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Scial
 Welfare (MPSLSW). While the Government may deregister individual unions,
 Zimbabwe's High Court has ruled that the LRA does not give the Minister the
 power to suspend or deregister the national umbrella labor confederation, the
 Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
 Less than 20 percent of the salaried work force belongs to the 35 unions that form
 the ZCTU. ZCTU officers are elected by the delegates of affiliated trade unions at
 congresses held every 5 years. While the Government encouraged the ZCTU's forma-
 tion, anticipating that it would form the labor arm of ZANU-PF, it no longer directly
 influences Z    actions. The Government and the ZCTU clash on political and eco-
 nomic issues with increasing frequency as workers feel the effects of the economic
 structural adjustment program. Although the LRA allows for the formation of mul-
 tiple national federations, none but the ZCTU exists. Almost all unions are affiliated
 with the ZCTU; some affiliates, due to internal differences, have withheld their
 membership fees and are considered in bad standing.
 Public servants and their associations, the Public Service Association (PSA), the
 Zimbabwe Teachers Association, and the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, are not cov-
 ered by the provisions of the LRA (according to Section 3 of the Act) since their con-
 ditions of employment are provided for uncder the Constitution. They are thus con-
 stitutionally barred from forming unions, and their associations are likewise forbid-
 den from affiliating with the ZCTU.
 However, all three organizations have signed memorandums of understanding
 with the ZCTU to coordinate on areas of mutual interest, which include reform of
 the IA to include the public sector. After the passage of the Labor Relations
 Amendment Act (LRAA) in 1992, the Government circulated copies of a new Labor
 Act drafted by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The draft is intended to
 streamline provisions of the LRA while extending its coverage to the public sector.
 After the third draft, however, the Government shelved any further movement on
 joining the public and private sectors under one LRA.
 The LRA specifies that workers may establish independent worker committees,
 which exist side by side with unions, in each plant. Worker committees must also
 
 
 305
 be reistered with the MPSLSW, which is free to refuse registration. Trade union
 officials and others hold that the existence of worker committees, which were
 strengthened by the 1992 amendments, dilutes union authority. Nonetheless, the
 ZCTU grew stronger in 1994 as it responded to the formation of these committees
 by increasing its organizational efforts on the shop floor. This strengthened its hand
 in the 1994 collective bargaining cycle, and the Government has appeared less in-
 clined to challenge its authoority directl.
 The International Conference of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has criticized
 Zimbabwean labor legislation for giving "wide scope to the authorities to declare
 that a given enterprise or industry constitutes an essential service, and then impose
 a ban on it. Workers in sectors deemed "nonessential" have the right to strike pro-
 vided the union advises the Government 2 weeks in advance of its intention to do
 so (though in practice this administrative requirement is rarely met).
 More strikes and work actions occurred in 1994 than in any other year since inde-
 pendence.
 The ZCTU and its officials are free to associate with international labor organiza-
 tions and do so actively. The ZCTU is affiliated with the ICFTU and the Southern
 African Trade Union Coordinating Council. The African American Labor Center
 maintains a regional office based in Harare.
 b. The Rght to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The LRA provides workers
 with the rigt to organize. As orignally enacted, the Act was silent on the right
 to bargain collectively. However, 1992 amendments permit worker committees to
 perform functions normally reserved for trade unions, e.g, negotiating collective
 agreements and codes of conduct. The worker committees, which are by law not or-
 ganically part of the unions or the ZCTU, are empowered to negotiate with the man-
 agement of a particular plant the conditions of labor in the workplace, except for
 wage.
 Wage negotiations take place on an industry-wide basis between the relevant
 union and employer organizations sitting on joint employment boards or councils.
 These bodies submit their agreements to the registrar in the MPSLSW for approval.
 The Government retains the power to veto agreements it believes would harm the
 economy. However, it did not directly involve itself in labor negotiations unless re-
 quested to do so by one of the two parties.
 When no trade union represents a specific sector, representatives of the organized
 workers, i.e., the professional associations, meet with the employer associations,
 under the mediation of labor officers from the MPSLSW. Public sector wages are
 determined by the Salary Service Department of the MPSLSW, subject to the ap-
 prvalof the Public Service Commission (PSC). Each year, representatives of the
 P80 (employers) and the PSA (employees) hold consultations on wages and benefits.
 These consultations result in a recommendation which is forwarded to the
 MPSLSW. The Minister is not required by law to accept the recommendation and,
 in fact, in both 1993 and 1994 granted wage increases significantly lower than PSC/
 PSA recommendations.
 Employees designated as being in manaerial positions are excluded from union
 membership and thus from the collective bargaining process. The presence of the
 ZCTU or specific national unions in individual shop floor negotiations is not man-
 dated.
 The LRA prohibits antiunion discimiaioi by mployers against union members.
 Complaints of such discrimination are referred to labor relations officers and may
 subsequently be adjudicated by the Labor Relations Tribunal (LRT). Such com-
 plaints are handled under the mechanism for resolving cases involving "unfair labor
 practices: The determining authority may direct that workers fired due to
 antiunion discrimination should be reinstated though this has yet to be tested in
 practice.
 The LRAA streamlined the procedure for adjudicating disputes by strengthening
 the LET. Now, labor relations officers hear a dispute; their decision ma be ap-
 pealed to regional labor relations officers, at which pointthe LRT may hear the
 case. Ultimately, it may be appaled to the Supreme Court. In 1993 the Government
 filled long vacant positions on the LET, but at present the LET bards are still not
 fully sed and face a substantial backlog.
 Parliament passed the Export Processing Zones Act in October. The Act rovides
 thst the LEA shal not a ply to workers in export processing zones. The ZTU pro-
 tested this prvision to President Mugabe, who promised to investigate. At year's
 end. no export processing zones had been established.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is prohibited by
 law, and there are no reports that it ispracticed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Zimbabwean law affords little pro-
 tection to working children. There is no specific legal prohibition of child labor, the
 
 
 306
 LRA only states that contracts of employment shall not be enforceable against any
 person under the age of 16. While child labor is most prevalent in the agricultural
 sector, an increasing number of children can be found working in the urban infor-
 mal sector. There have also been reports of children mining chromium, tin, or gold,
 either for independent operators or through subcontractors. In the manufacturing
 sector, minimum age requirements are generally enforced by the MPSISW. Recent
 ILO investigations to review progress in this area indicated that these conditions
 still hold true.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The maximum legal workweek is 54 hours, and
 the law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest period per week. Workmig condi-
 tions are regulated by the Government according to industry. The Constitution em-
 powers the PSC to set conditions of employment in the public sector. Government
 regulations for each of the 22 industrial sectors specify minimum wages, hours, holi-
 days, and required safety measures.
 In recent years, as part of its effort to opt out of the wage bargaining system, the
 Government mandated wage parameters and specified minimum wage increases
 only for domestics and gardeners. Due to an ineffective monitoring system, however,
 many such workers are remunerated below the minimum wage.
 The minimum monthly wage for domestics and gardeners of $25 (Z$202.41) is the
 de facto minimum wage for Zimbabwe. The employer often provides housing and
 food to workers or allowances for such. On commercial farms, the employer may pro-
 vide schooling for workers' children. The minimum wage is not sufficient to sustain
 a decent standard of living, and workers in those sectors covered under collective
 bargaining agreements received 1994 wage increases averaging only two-thirds of
 the 25-percent inflation rate. Minimum monthly wage rates for 1994 ranged from
 $30 (Z$241.50) in the agricultural sector to $62 to 75 (Z$500-Z$600) in the various
 manufacturing sectors. In theory, labor relations officers from the M]PSLSW are as-
 signed to monitor developments in each plant to assure that government minimum
 wage policy and occupational health and safety regulations are observed.
 Safety in the workplace is a continuing problem, exacerbated by an inadequate
 number of government safety inspectors. Furthermore, many of the basic legal pro-
 tections do not apply to the vast majority of farm, mine, and domestic workers.
 Unions charge that there are no general standards for the work environment, such
 as threshold limits for manually lifted weights or conditions for pregnant workers.
 Health and safety standards are determined only on an industry-specific basis. The
 Government intervenes on a selected basis (and often seemingly in response to the
 most recent accident) and sets standards by regulation in some industries. In the-
 ory, workers have a legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situa-
 tions withoutrjeopardy to continued employment; in practice, they risk the loss of
 their livelihood
