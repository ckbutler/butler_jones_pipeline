 GHANiA
 Ghana is governed by the Provisional National Defense Council
 (PNDC) under the chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant Jerry John
 Rawlings, who seized power from an elected government on
 December 31, 1981, and abolished the constitution, which has
 not been replaced. Under the Establishment Proclamation of
 January 11, 1982, the PNDC exercises "all powers of
 government." In practice, government policy is developed by
 Chairman Rawlings, assisted by a number of close advisers,
 both inside and outside the Government. In addition to
 Chairman Rawlings, the PNDC consists of eight members, of whom
 two are serving military officers and six are civilians. The
 executive consists of ministries headed by secretaries, most
 of whom are subordinate to a PNDC member responsible for that
 particular area of government. There is no national
 legislature or lawmaking body. All national, regional, and
 many district officials are appointed by the PNDC.
 The several security organizations which exist in Ghana report
 to various departments of government, but all come under the
 control of the PNDC. Most security cases of a political
 nature are handled by the Bureau of National Investigation
 (BNI), which reports to the PNDC member responsible for
 security issues.
 Starting in 1983, the Government adopted an Economic Recovery
 Program (ERP) to redress a quarter century of economic
 mismanigement and political instability which caused Ghana to
 decline from one of Africa's most promising economies to near
 collapse. Conducted in concert with the International
 Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and a consultative group of
 bilateral donors, the recovery program has had a positive
 impact. While economic growth has averaged 5 percent since
 the inceptidn of the ERP, and inflation has fallen far below
 the triple-digit rates of earlier years, the austerity of the
 recovery program has been a heavy burden for large segments of
 the population.
 Although the Rawlings regime has largely restored order
 following the 18-month period of revolutionary excess in 1982
 and 1983, there continue to be significant human rights
 problems in Ghana. These include restrictions on such basic
 rights as freedom of speech, press, and assembly, the right of
 citizens to change their government, and legal due process.
 In June 1989, the Government established regulations for
 registering all religious organizations; it "froze" the assets
 of four churches, expelling the expatriate missionaries of two
 of them, the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons. Summary
 arrest and detention were continuing problems with instances
 of incarceration without formal charges.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated disappearances were reported in 1989.
 
 
 138
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have been occasional credible allegations of torture and
 beatings in recent years, although there were none in 1989.
 Prisons in Ghana are antiquated and overcrowded; conditions
 are harsh. Within the past few years, two American citizens
 with medical problems died in Ghanaian prisons, and a third
 stated he had been physically mistreated. The Government is
 aware of unsafe and overcrowded prison conditions and has
 established a commission to look into reform of the prisons
 and the parole system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In routine criminal cases, arrests generally conform to the
 legal pr6cedures set forth in the criminal code. This code
 requires that an arrested person be brought before a court
 within 48 hours to be charged. However, the court can refuse
 to release a detainee on bail and instead remand him without
 charges for an indefinite period of time, subject to weekly
 review as a case is investigated. Habeas corpus is limited by
 a 1984 law which prevents any court from inquiring into the
 grounds for the detention of any Ghanaian under PNDC Law 4
 (Preventive Custody Law of 1982).
 PNDC Law 4 provides for indefinite detention without trial if
 the PNDC determines it is in the interest of national
 security. Ghanaian security forces occasionally take persons
 into custody, with or without a warrant, and hold them
 incommunicado for extended periods of time, as in the
 1987-1988 case of the journalist Ben Ephson. The threat of
 such treatment serves as a deterrent to activities Ceemed
 unacceptable by the State. PNDC Law 4 has been used against a
 wide variety of persons, including trade union officials like
 Akwasi Adu-Amankwah and student leaders like Tony Akoto-Ampaw,
 both of whom were released in 1989.
 In late June, the PNDC detained without charge the President
 and the Secretary General of the Ghana Bar Association for
 more than a week after the Association announced its intention
 to hold a seminar commemorating the murder of three judges by
 soldiers in 1982, shortly after Chairman Rawlings took power.
 Following a decision by the Bar Association to cancel the
 semiuar, the President and Secretary General were released.
 There are also reliable reports that Lebanese businessmen
 suspected of illegal activities are often simply arrested and
 incarcerated as a means of intimidating others.
 In recent years, a number of American citizens have been
 arrested and held without charge for lengthy periods without
 the U.S. Embassy being notified or provided access as
 stipulated in international conventions and in a bilateral
 treaty. In 1989 the Government seized members of a religious
 group--the Black Hebrews--who are American citizens and
 long-time residents of Ghana. They were held several days
 before appropriate officials at the American Embassy were
 informed of their imprisonment. The Department of State
 renewed its August 1988 travel advisory warning American
 visitors and potential travelers of continuing problems with
 Ghanaian authorities.
 The number of political detainees/prisoners at the end of 1989
 was unknown, but the most reliable estimates were around 200.
 The Government claims the actual number is smaller. In
 
 
 139
 September 1989, Major Courage Quashigah, two other military
 officers (one of whom reportedly committed suicide while in
 detention), and two civilians were arrested for alleged
 involvement in a coup plot. They-had not been tried by the end
 of 1989.
 The Government does not practice forced exile. In 1988 the
 Government continued quietly to encourage Ghanaian exilees with
 valuable skills to return home, offering them amnesty. A few
 officials of the former government have returned and resumed
 careers outside politics, apparently without difficulties.
 Others have remained abroad, particularly in the United Kingdom
 and other parts of Western Europe, in order to conduct active
 opposition to the PNDC or out of fear of political persecution.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are two court systems in Ghana. In the regular
 "prerevolutionary" court system, traditional legal safeguards
 are based on British legal practices. Trials are public, and
 defendants have a right to be present, to be represented by an
 attorney, and to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
 This system includes high courts, appeal courts, and a supreme
 court headed by a chief justice. There are limitations,
 however, to the independence of the regular courts. In April
 1986, the PNDC summarily dismissed 16 judges, alleging that
 they were guilty of malfeasance. By this action, the PNDC put
 judges in the regular courts on notice that they serve at its
 sufferance. The independent Ghana Bar Association has urged
 the reestablishment of a judicial council to protect judges
 from arbitrary dismissal and preserve judicial independence.
 A separate public tribunals system at the national and regional
 levels was set up'by the PNDC in 1982 to bypass the regular
 court system and speed up the judicial process by deemphasizing
 legal "technicalities." This system includes the Office of
 Revenue Commissioners, the National Investigations Committee
 (which, established by PNDC Law 2, has the power to investigate
 virtually any allegation referred to it by the PNDC), the
 Special Military Tribunal, and the Public Tribunals Board.
 Most sensitive political cases and those involving security
 issues and capital punishment are heard by public tribunals.
 No appeals were permitted until 1985, when the National Appeals
 Tribunal was created.
 The public tribunals depend largely on judges with little or no
 legal experience, and they shortcut legal safeguards and due
 process to provide "rough and ready" justice. Presiding judges
 are more often laymen than lawyers; there are no published
 guidelines concerning the admissibility of evidence; and
 conviction is by majority vote of the panel trying a case.
 Critics also contend that meaningful appeals are impossible
 because no adequate record is kept of initial hearings before
 tribunals.' Judges on the appeals panel are drawn from the same
 pool of "lay judges" who hear initial cases. In the course of
 a September conference for tribunal officials, government
 officials proposed the establishment of .regional appeal
 tribunals and the publication of tribunal judgments. The Ghana
 Bar Association, citing such shortcomings, has elected not to
 practice before the public tribunals. However, a number of
 lawyers have ignored the Bar Association's decision and will
 defend clients before the public tribunals.

 GHANA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Citizens not engaged in activity objectionable to the
 Government are generally free from interference with regard to
 private conduct, although some critics characterize the local
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR) as
 "neighborhood watch committees." Monitoring of telephones and
 mail occurs, and forced entry into homes has been reported in
 connection with security investigations. The State supports
 family planning, but there has been no interference with the
 right to marry or have children as one chooses.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and the press are restricted. Chairman
 Rawlings has frequently encouraged people to speak out on
 local community concerns, though not on government policy.
 However, informers are said to exist, and some Ghanaians
 hesitate to speak frankly at public gatherings or to attend
 certain functions.
 In September the Ghana Bar Association was to host the
 biennial meeting of the African Bar Association with the
 conference theme to be "Human Rights in Africa." The
 Government had been involved in the planning for almost a
 year, but, shortly before the conference was scheduled to
 open, the Government withdrew its financial and logistical
 support. Faced with this official oppositon, the Bar
 Association canceled the meeting. The Government also
 confiscated the passport of the Ghana Bar Association
 President amidst allegations in a government-owned newspaper
 that he had planned to use the conference to destabilize the
 Government.
 The Government owns the radio and television stations and the
 two principal daily newspapers. Reporting in government-owned
 media accentuates positive aspects of government policies but
 also covers selected instances of corruption and mismanagement
 in government agencies and state-owned enterprises. In
 general, media criticism of government policies or of Chairman
 Rawlings and PNDC members, as well as of foreign and domestic
 policies, is not tolerated. Journalists are subject to
 discipline or dismissal by the Government for running articles
 deemed unacceptable. The editor of the government-owned
 weekly The Mirror was dismissed in August 1988.
 On occasion, the few remaining privately owned newspapers have
 tried to be relatively bold in reporting selected issues,
 including editorials and articles criticizing Ghana's foreign
 policy and the Economic Recovery Program (ERP). However,
 several privately owned newspapers have closed down in recent
 years, and in December 1985 the Government banned publication
 of the Catholic Standard; it remained banned in 1989, although
 Chairman Rawlings has said publicly that the ban is being
 reconsidered.
 A few foreign periodicals such as West Africa, Time, and
 Newsweek are sold freely in Accra and other major cities, and
 even issues critical of Ghana are allowed to circulate. Most
 Western journalists are now routinely accorded visas and press
 credentials as opposed to the practices of a few years ago.
 
 
 141
 GHANA
 Academic freedom is respected within the confines gf the
 campus. The National Union of Ghanaian Students, one of the
 more vocal critics of the PNDC, is tolerated and allowed to
 organize and hold meetings. Several political organizations,
 including the June Fourth Movement and the New Democratic
 Movement (NDM), were founded by faculty and students at the
 University of Ghana. The ND14 is viewed with particular
 suspicion by the PNDC. Just prior to examinations in May
 1988, university students demonstrated over campus issues and
 forced the closing of all three universities; they reopened in
 December. During 1989 the Government made a concerted effort
 to improve its relations with the university students. Senior
 government officials and students discussed PNDC programs in a
 serious but nonconfrontational manner, and Chairman Rawlings
 addressed the graduation ceremonies at the three major
 institutions without incident.
 Critics have charged, and the PNDC Chairman has publicly
 admitted, that fear of government reaction has led to the
 creation of a "culture of silence" in Ghana. Senior officials
 deplore this and ask people to speak out on issues, but
 instances such as the detention of the President and the
 Secretary General of the Ghana Bar Association in June
 demonstrate that to do so can be dangerous and that the
 boundaries of permissible discussion are still vague.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are also restricted.
 Individuals generally are free to join together formally or
 informally to promote benevolent or nonpolitical causes, but
 permits are required for public meetings or demonstrations,
 and these are seldom granted for political purposes,
 particularly if the applicant's views are at odds with those
 of the Government. Political parties and political meetings
 are prohibited. The Government barred persons with close ties
 to the old parties from running as candidates for election to
 the district assemblies.
 Ghana has many private religious, social, and cultural
 organizations which are allowed to organize and gather with a
 minimum of legal or informal restrictions.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion. Ghanaians are
 predominantly Christian, and many senior government officials
 are practicing members of various Protestant sects or Roman
 Catholicism, with no particular advantages or disadvantages
 attached to membership.
 PNDC efforts to urge the major religious communities to
 support its economic and social policies has created tension
 between them and the Government. Chairman Rawlings publicly
 criticized the Roman Catholic Church's prohibition on its
 priests participating in the district assemblies. The PNDC
 has also been sensitive to criticism of Ghana's human rights
 record by leaders of various denominations. Chairman Rawlings
 has not renewed his 1987 charge that worldwide church and
 Christian organizations may be havens for foreign spy networks.
 In June 1989, the Government laid down guidelines for the
 registration of all religious organizations and made it clear
 
 
 142
 that any organization whose actions, it concluded, would lead
 to social disruption or would offend the morals of the people
 would not be registered, and thus not tolerated. The
 Government requires full information about the property and
 financial assets of the churches and makes the boards of
 governors personally liable for contraventions.
 Subsequently, the Government "froze" the assets of four
 churches, two indigenous Christian churches, plus the
 Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of
 Latter-Day Saints (Mormons). The expatriate personnel of the
 Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons were expelled with 7 days'
 notice. The Government alleged that the Jehovah's Witnesses
 refused to recognize Ghana's symbols of authority and that the
 Mormons advocated racism. Ghanaian members of the Mormon
 church have not been further harassed, but expatriate Mormons
 have not been allowed to resume their missionary activities in
 Ghana. At present, these four churches have not been allowed
 to apply for registration.
 Other foreign missionary groups have generally operated
 throughout the country with a minimum of formal restrictions,
 but some foreign missionaries find obtaining visas is becoming
 more. difficult. At least one missionary was denied entry in
 1989 despite possessing a valid visa.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Ghanaians and foreigners are free to move throughout Ghana
 without special permission. Police checkpoints exist
 countrywide, allegedly for the prevention of smuggling, but
 are less obtrusive than in the 1982-84 period. Roadblocks and
 car searches are still a normal part of nighttime travel in
 Accra.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States
 (ECOWAS), Ghanaians may travel without visas for up to 90 days
 in member states. Ghanaians are generally free to exercise
 this right, and nationals of other member states are free to
 travel to Ghana. In August-September 1989, longtime Ghanaian
 residents of Liberia and longtime Liberian residents of Ghana
 abruptly returned to their "home" countries amidst press
 allegations that they had been deported. Both Governments
 officially denied their citizens had been deported. Ghanaians
 are also free to emigrate or to be repatriated from other
 countries. If a person is considered a security threat,
 special permission to travel outside Ghana must be obtained.
 There is no forced resettlement of populations. The
 Government has not established policies to deal with the
 roughly 150 refugees registered with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees. Many unregistered refugees from
 the Sahelian drought in neighboring countries remain in Ghana,
 and efforts to settle or move these basically nomadic peoples
 have had only limited success.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is no procedure by which citizens can freely and
 peacefully change their laws, officials, or form of
 government. Chairman Rawlings and the PNDC exercise total
 executive, legislative, judicial, and administrative power.
 The National Commission for Democracy (NCD) was established in
 
 
 143
 GHANA
 1984 to design new "democratic" structures which would help
 establish the legitimacy of the PNDC.
 In December 1988, and in January and February 1989, the first
 elections of any kind since 1979 were held in Ghana to
 establish district assemblies in 10 regions. An estimated
 58.9 percent of the electorate, higher in the rural areas than
 in the urban areas, turned out for the elections which were
 generally peaceful and unaccompanied by fraud. The contests
 revolved around the candidates' probity and competence. These
 local assemblies have limited authority, and the PNDC has
 emphasized that the first priority of the assemblies is to
 establish local development programs. The Government names
 one-third of the members of each assembly, which conduct
 meetinbs and formulate development programs within guidelines
 laid down by the Regional Coordinating Councils (RCC)
 established in August 1989. The RCCs are dominated by
 government-appointed officials.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known locally organized human rights groups
 currently dealing with Ghanaian human rights matters. Several
 other organizations--most notably the Ghana Bar
 Association--have attempted to address human rights issues
 from time to time. The Government's reactions to these
 efforts have ranged from indifference to active
 discouragement. The Government does permit the International
 Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisons. In September
 1988, Ghana hosted a meeting of the International Federation
 of Women Lawyers, which addressed human rights in Ghana, but
 in 1989 it blocked the African Bar Association meeting. A
 representative of Amnesty International applied to visit Ghana
 in 1989 but was denied a visa.
 The Government is sensitive to charges of abuse of human
 rights and stoutly defends its practices. The PNDC is
 particularly critical of charges from human rights groups in
 the West that it lacks a democratic structure. It ins.sts
 that "participatory democracy" through people's involvement in
 mass organizations such as the Committees for the Defense of
 the Revolution end the 31st December Women's Movement has
 "grassroots" support and is more broadly democratic than
 previous Ghanaian governments. Ghana is a member of the U.N.
 Human Riehtp Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although ethnic differences are intentionally downplayed by
 the Government, occasional charges are aired that the PNDC and
 the political leadership are dominated by the Ewe ethnic group
 from eastern Ghana. Chairman Rawlings and a number of his
 close advisors are Ewe.
 The Government has made a concerted effort to raise the status
 of women in Ghana. In 1985 it promulgated four laws which
 overturned many of the customary, traditional, and colonial
 laws which discriminated against women. These concerned
 family accountability, intestate succession, customary diorce
 registrations, and the administration of estates. Women in
 urban centers and those who have entered the modern sector
 encounter little overt bias, but resistance to women in
 
 
 144
 GHANA
 nontraditional roles persists. Women in the rural
 agriceltural sector remain subject to traditional male
 dominance. Women do have a significant economic role as
 market trade-rs.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but,
 as there are no statistics or studies available, the extent of
 the problem is unknown. Police do not normally intervene in
 domestic disputes, and such cases seldom come before the
 courts. Female mutilation (e.g., clitoridectomy) is practiced
 only in the far northeast and northwest parts of the country.
 The Government discourages the practice, although it has not
 made it illegal. The 31st December Women's Movement, led by
 Chairman Rawlings' wife Nana Komadu Agyeman-Rawlings,
 prominently promotes the economic and social development of
 women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The PNDC has not interfered with the right of workers to
 associate in labor unions. Trade unions in Ghana and their
 activities are still governed b: the Industrial Relations Act
 (IRA) of 1958, as amended in 1965 and 1972. The independent
 Trades Union Congress (TUC), established in 1958, represents
 organized labor in Ghana. It consists of-a national
 headquarters and 16 affiliated unions, representing a claimed
 total membership of about 700,000 workers in skilled and
 semiskilled trades. Union members elect their own leaders,
 and representatives of the affiliated unions elect the TUC
 leadership at quadrennial conferences, the most recent having
 been in March 1988. The TUC publishes its own newspaper. It
 is independent of government subventions and has publicly
 criticized the Government at times for its economic policies
 as well as its failure adequately to consult the trade union
 movement.
 The right to strike is recognized in law and in practice,
 although the Government has on occasion taken strong action to
 end strikes, especially those which threaten interests it
 perceives as vital. Under the IRA, the Government has
 established a system under which it seeks first to conciliate,
 then arbitrate, disputes. Discussions have been under way for
 some time to replace this system with labor tribunals to
 arbitrate industrial disputes certified as deadlocked. The
 Government has declared that establishment of labor tribunals
 must be part of-&-new, consolidated industrial relations act,
 which cannot be implemented piecemeal.
 For several years the International Labor Orgtnization (ILO)
 Committeo of ExpertT4COE> has criticized var:us aspects of
 Ghanaian legislation pertaining to freedom of -ssociation.
 The COE, again in 1989, expressed the hope that measures would
 be taken to bring G&s1- laws int conftTmity with ILO      -
 Convention 87 which Ghana ratified in 1967.

 145
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize is generally respected. Civil servants,
 however, are prohibited by law from joining or organizing a
 trade union. The TUC is a large, well-established union
 organization whose membership has shown little growth in
 recent years. Ghana's trade unions engage in collective
 bargaining for wages and benefits with both private and
 state-owned enterprises, though in the latter category the
 threat of detention (a common practice in the early 19801s)
 hangs over union leaders to force agreement on issues. At the
 end of 1989, no union leaders were under detention for
 union-related activities. Akwasi Adu-Amankwa, a union leader
 detained at the end of 1988 for activities not related to his
 union responsibilities, was released and allowed to enter a
 training program offered in the Netherlands.
 There are no functioning export processing zones in Ghana, and
 labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Ghanaian law prohibits forced labor, and it is not known to be
 practiced. For a number of years, however, the ILO's COE has
 urged the Government to revise various legal provisions which
 permit imprisonment with an obligation to perform labor for
 offenses which are not countenanced under ILO Convention 105,
 ratified by Ghana in 1958.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor legislation in Ghana sets a minimum employment age of 15
 and prohibits night work and certain types of hazardous labor
 for those under 18. In practice, child labor is prevalent,
 and young children of school age can often be found during the
 day performing menial tasks in the market or collecting fares
 on local buses. Enforcement of minimum age laws is uneven,
 especially since local custom and economic circumstances favor
 children working to help their families. Violators of
 regulations prohibiting heavy labor and night work for
 children are occasionally punished.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work,
 Minimum standards for wages and working conditions are
 established through a tripartite committee composed of
 representatives of government, labor, and employees. It
 establishes a minimum wage rate, and other salaries are
 adjusted accordingly. Effective January 1987, the minimum
 wage was increased 25 percent to $0.50 per working day at
 current exchange rates. In early 1988, the TUC called for a
 "meaningful" national wage of not less than $4.00 per day.
 The current "living wage"--consisting of the actual wage and
 customary benefits such as transportation and food
 allowances--is about $1.00 per working day; the TUC estimates
 the daily living costs of a family of four at $5.00. Thus,
 the existing minimum wage is insufficient for a single wage
 earner to support a family. In most cases, however,
 households are supported by multiple wage earners, some family
 farming, and other family-based commercial activities. An
 upward adjustment in the living wage may be a major
 labor/management issue in 1990. The basic workweek in Ghana
 is 40 hours. Occupational safety and health regulations are
 in effect, and sanctions are occasionally applied to violators.
