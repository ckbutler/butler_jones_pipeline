 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) is a democratic society
 with a modern parliamentary system. Its advanced
 industrialized economy provides one of the highest standards
 of living in the world.
 On the national level, power is divided among executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches. There is also division of
 governmental authority between national and state governments.
 The latter retain significant autonomy, especially in matters
 relating to law enforcement and the courts, culture and
 education, the environment, and social assistance. The head
 of the Federal Government, the Chancellor, is elected by the
 Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament. The powers of the
 Chancellor and of the Parliament, which are substantial, are
 set down in the Basic Law (constitution). The Bundestag is
 elected through a mixture of direct constituency candidates
 and party lists. Members of the upper house of Parliament,
 the Bundesrat, are appointed by the state governments.
 The Federal Republic has been ruled since its creation by a
 number of governments headed by one of the two major parties,
 the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) or the Social Democratic
 Party (SPD). The current Government is led by a coalition of
 the Christian Democratic Union, joined by its Bavarian sister
 party, the Christian Social Union, and the Free Democratic
 Party (FDP). The SPD and the Greens, a party represented in
 the Bundestag since the elections of March 1983, comprise the
 opposition.
 Organized essentially at the state (Land) level and operating
 under the direction of state governments, the police are well
 trained, disciplined, and scrupulously respect citizens'
 rights. In dealing with hostile elements, including
 terrorists, special care is taken to respect the rights of the
 accused. The Government is considering legislation that would
 provide for stricter measures against violent demonstrators
 without eroding basic civil liberties.
 The foundation of the Basic Law, adopted in 1949, rests firmly
 on the principles of liberty, equality, and the free exercise
 of individual rights. These human rights are scrupulously
 protected in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Terrorist groups on the far left (the Red Army Fraktion--RAF)
 and the far right (neo-Nazi groups) and Middle Eastern
 terrorists continue to engage in political violence. In
 November two policemen were shot to death when a demonstration
 by groups protesting the building of the "Runway West" at
 Frankfurt International Airport turned violent. Politically
 motivated killing by the Government or by constitutional
 political organizations is unknown.
 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or police authorities do not abduct, secretly
 arrest, or otherwise illegally detain persons. There have
 
 
 923
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 been no kidnapings by political terrorist groups for several
 years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police authorities do not physically or mentally torture
 prisoners, nor do they engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment short of torture. Prison conditions are adequate.
 In its 1987 Report covering 1986, Amnesty International
 expressed concern about allegations of beatings of prisoners
 and whether prisoners should be allowed access to doctors of
 their own choosing.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 No person may be arrested in the Federal Republic except on
 the basis of an arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial
 authority. Any person detained by the police must be brought
 before a judge and charged no later than the end of the day
 following the day of apprehension. There is no preventive
 detention except that a prisoner may be held in custody no
 longer than 24 hours while awaiting a formal charge if there
 is evidence that he might seek to flee the country to avoid
 prosecution. The right of free access to legal counsel has
 been restricted only in the cases of some terrorists who have
 used contacts with lawyers to promote and continue terrorist
 activity even while in prison. Only judges may decide on the
 admissibility or continuation of any deprivation of liberty.
 Bail bond exists in the Federal Republic but is seldom
 employed. There is no exile or forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due process and
 prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both
 government interference and intimidation by terrorists. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by the Basic Law and
 fully respected in practice. Prior to forcible entry by police
 into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in an
 emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance or
 monitoring of mail may be undertaken only after authorization
 by a court order.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The provisions of the Basic Law, an independent press, an
 effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political
 system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press.
 Criticism of the Government is unrestricted. The media and
 artistic works are not censored. Academic freedom is
 complete. There is no censorship of foreign or domestic books.
 Newspapers and magazines are privately owned. Radio and
 television networks and stations function, for the most part,
 as corporations under special public laws. They are governed
 .by independent boards made up of representatives of churches,

 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 political parties, and other organizations. A few
 experimental private television cable stations and local
 television cable networks have been set up. Legislation has
 been enacted in all states except Bremen and Hesse to
 facilitate and encourage private television stations using
 cable, satellites, and other "new" media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are fully respected, as
 is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain police permits beforehand
 and may be asked to pay a deposit to cover the repair of any
 damage to public facilities. When demonstrators have not
 obtained the required permits, police have exercised
 considerable restraint, showing concern ultimately only for
 the continued functioning of public facilities and for the
 safety of the general public.
 Membership in nongovernmental organizations of all types,
 including political parties, is entirely open. Parties found
 to be "fundamentally antidemocratic" can be outlawed. Under
 this constitutionally based provision, the Federal
 Constitutional Court, in the 1950's, declared both a neo-Nazi
 and a Communist party to be illegal.
 The right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively is
 recognized and exercised freely in the Federal Republic. The
 country has a long-established and highly organized labor
 movement, with about 42 percent of the eligible work force
 unionized. The German Trade Union Federation represents over
 83 percent of organized workers. Reborn in the wake of World
 War II, the unions are particularly conscious of their
 historic role as the protector of workers' rights and a
 bulwark of the democratic system. They actively participate
 in the International Labor Organization (ILO) and in
 international and European trade union organizations.
 Following a complaint lodged by the World Federation of Trade
 Unions (WFTU) about the FRG practice of excluding political
 extremists from employment in the civil service, an
 ILO-appointed Commission of Inquiry decided against the
 Federal Republic in February 1987. Specifically, the WFTU
 charged that the FRG blanket exclusion of extremists--with no
 differentiation between the respective duties they would be
 carrying out--was in violation of ILO Convention III. The
 German practice is based on the special oath of allegiance of
 civil servants actively to defend the State, its institutions,
 and laws and stems from a 1972 joint resolution by the Federal
 and state governments. Although the Federal Republic has
 acknowledged the ILO's findings, it has done nothing to change
 its practice. A suit on this issue brought before the
 European Court of Human Rights was decided in favor of the
 Federal Republic in August 1986.
 c.' Freedom of Religion
 The full practice of religion is allowed. Major religious
 groups benefit from a state-administered church tax system.
 The Government subsidizes church-affiliated schools. Personal
 religious affiliation today plays an insignificant role in
 politics and in other walks of life. Members of all religions
 can be found in all political parties.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country
 and to leave and return at any time. Germans who arrive in
 the Federal Republic from the German Democratic Republic are
 treated as German citizens and therefore may take up residence
 without restrictions. In 1986, 42,788 ethnic Germans
 resettled in the Federal Republic, a figure three times higher
 than in the early 1980's. From January to August 1987, 43,324
 ethnic Germans moved to the Federal Republic. This dramatic
 increase is due in large part to the new Soviet entry and exit
 act. Effective January 1, 1987, ethnic Germans living in the
 Soviet Union with first degree relatives in the Federal
 Republic were given exit visas on a priority basis.
 The right of asylum is guaranteed by the Basic Law and
 respected in practice. In 1986 asylum status was granted to
 8,853 foreigners, with the largest numbers coming from
 Afghanistan, Iran, and Poland. Once formally granted asylum
 status and to a lesser extent while being processed, asylees
 have essentially the same access to social welfare benefits as
 German citizens. Short of the right to vote, they also enjoy
 complete civil rights.
 The explosion of asylum seekers since 1979 has threatened to
 overwhelm the capacity of the system for processing and
 adjudicating requests and prompted enactment of the Asylum
 Procedural Law in November 1986. Under the provisions of this
 law, the Federal Office for the Recognition of Foreign
 Refugees was granted authority to establish branches in the
 respective states and hire additional staff. The new law also
 included provisions to discourage emigration to the Federal
 Republic on the part of so-called economic refugees--fully 80
 percent of all who apply. Work prohibitions for asylum
 seekers were extended from 3 to 5 years, and a $1,000 penalty
 was instituted for airlines bringing in foreigners without
 valid entry visas.
 Denial of political asylum does not automatically result in
 deportation. Eighty percent of those whose petitions are
 denied are typically allowed to remain in the country for
 other, humanitarian reasons. Peisons from Eastern European
 countries are normally allowed to remain whether or not
 official asylum status is granted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the parliamentary democracy established by the Basic
 Law, the Federal Republic is ruled by a government chosen by
 the people through orderly elections based on universal
 suffrage. Around 87 percent of voters normally participate in
 national elections, but local contests attract significantly
 lower participation. Candidates for public office are usually
 members of political parties but are not required to be. The
 Basic Law and the state constitutions contain provisions that
 only parties achieving at least 5 percent of the vote can be
 represented in the Federal and state parliaments. New
 political parties are free to form and enter the political
 process. Although party discipline plays an important role,
 voting on issues in the Bundestag is ultimately a matter of
 individual decision.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The International Society for Human Rights, Amnesty
 International, and other smaller human rights organizations
 freely conduct their activities in the Federal Republic. The
 Government considers the international promotion of human
 rights one of its highest priorities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no discrimination in the availability of shelter,
 health care, and education to all inhabitants, regardless of
 race, religion, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or
 citizenship.
 Since the passage of an equal employment rights law in 1982,
 women are guaranteed equal employment in the workplace. They
 play significant roles in all political parties and are
 increasingly rising to management and leadership positions in
 the private and public sectors. In organized labor, about 26
 percent of union members are women, and a woman has served as
 president of the second largest trade union since 1982.
 Most women do not work outside the home. The rate of
 participation of women in the labor force, about 38 percent,
 is below the average in the European Economic Community, and
 most working women are employed in traditional fields.
 Moreover, protective legislation bars women from working in
 certain heavy industrial occupations and also generally bans
 night work. Young women experience difficulties in gaining
 access to training in some traditionally male fields. Recent
 court rulings and government pilot programs, however, have
 helped break down some of these attitudinal and institutional
 barriers.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Federal law generally prohibits the employment of children
 under age 15 with a few exceptions: children aged 13 and 14
 may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day or may deliver
 newspapers for up to 2 hours per day; children aged 3 through
 14 may take part in cultural events under stringent conditions
 with regard to number of hours, time of day, and form of
 activity. In the absence of minimum wage legislation, wages
 generally conform to the pattern set in collective bargaining.
 Federal legislation governs the hours of day young persons may
 work and sets occupational safety and health standards.
 Due to increased unemployment, the Government has pursued a
 three-pronged policy with regard to foreign workers:
 integration of longtime residents, limitation of further
 entries, and repatriation aid for those willing to return to
 their home countries. The foreign population stood at 4.6
 million in 1986. Of this, 1.43 million are Turkish citizens,
 and 1.36 million are citizens of EC countries. Over 1 million
 are under the age of 16 years. Foreign workers totalled 1.6
 million or 7.7 percent of the work force, and 36 percent were
 organized in trade unions. A national debate has been under
 way over whether the rights of these workers should be
 broadened to permit unlimited residence and the right to vote
 or reduced by limiting the right of entry for dependent
 children.
