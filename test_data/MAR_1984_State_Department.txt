 MOROCCO*
 The King is both temporal head of state of Morocco and
 religious leader of its Muslim community, encompassing
 virtually the entire population. As the leader of the
 Alaouite dynasty which began in 1649, King Hassan II has a
 unique role. While decisions on foreign affairs are made by
 the King, policy on many matters is drawn up by the Government
 and requires the approval of Parliament. The Government is
 named by the King, who takes into account the relative weights
 of the political parties in choosing his Cabinet.
 Morocco describes itself as a developing democracy and the
 nation's leaders, including the King, have repeatedly stated
 their commitment to democratic institutions. In practice,
 however, the King remains a monarch with great power.
 Traditional political institutions and practices coexist with
 modern parliamentary-style practices. The high level of
 illiteracy (72 percent) and widespread poverty also limit the
 extent to which the population is able to exercise political
 rights.
 The fourth Parliament since Moroccan independence was elected
 in 1984 by an orderly process described as one of the fairest
 in the country's history. However, 1984 was also a year of
 testing for human rights as economic austerity and a declining
 standard of living resulted in challenges to public order. In
 January, disturbances in several cities over a variety of
 socio-economic-political grievances left, according to
 official figures, 29 dead; other observers place the death
 toll at over 100, with 114 injured. Following the unrest,
 nearly 2,000 individuals were detained, most of whom have
 since been brought to trial or released. Publication of
 several opposition press organs, including the daily newspaper
 of the Communist Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS), was
 halted for several weeks following the disturbances.
 The Government also moved during 1984 to control the
 activities of Islamic fundamentalists suspected of being
 behind the January disturbances. A trial of 71 leading
 fundamentalists resulted in death sentences for 13 and lengthy
 prison terms for others. The Government exercised close
 control over the activities of other minority groups suspected
 of proselytizing, including members of the small Baha'i and
 evangelical Christian communities. Morocco's tolerance and
 support of its indigenous Jewish population was highlighted by
 a May Congress of Jewish Communities held in Morocco and
 attended by Jewish leaders from Europe, North America, and
 Israel. An institutional relationship with the Catholic
 Cnurch was also developed during 1984.
 On August 30, a popular referendum ratified Morocco's union
 with Libya, raising some concern about the possible
 implications of this development for human rights in Morocco.
 Private investment and private property play a large role in
 the economy, although certain key industries are government
 operated or regulated. Morocco remains a predominately rural
 nation with over 55 percent of the population living outside
 *A separate section on the Western Sahara is appended to this
 report.

 MOROCCO
 the cities. The Government continues to place high priority
 on job creation and continuing development of the agricultural
 sector to reduce social and economic disparities between the
 urbanized coastal plains and the interior, as well as to
 upgrade nutrition and food production.
 The security apparatus, comprising several overlapping police
 and paramilitary organizations, has an important impact on the
 human rights situation and is for practical purposes under the
 King's control. In 1984 the armed forces also helped maintain
 public order when regular army troops were used to control
 riots in a number of Moroccan cities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1984 there were no known instances of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances during 1984. Amnesty
 International, however, continues to protest the cases of
 approximately 80 individuals reportedly taken into custody by
 Moroccan forces in connection with the war in the Western
 Sahara as far back as 1976 and who reportedly have disappeared.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 A number of Moroccan political organizations have charged
 that, while questioning individuals detained following the
 January disturbances, authorities engaged in cruel and inhuman
 treatment, including physical beating. There was not,
 however, a clear nationwide pattern to such charges. There is
 no indication that such treatment was ordered by the
 Government. Charges of cruel treatment were rarely brought
 before the courts, and no charges of torture or cruel
 treatment were upheld by judicial authorities. Rumors of more
 systematic torture during military interrogations continue to
 circulate.
 Amnesty International has continued to focus on the conditions
 of detention of approximately 100 military prisoners arrested
 following the 1971 and 1972 attempts on the life of King
 Hassan. It reported in 1984 that the individuals had been
 held since 1973 in 'windowless, filthy and unventilated cells,
 (exposed to) extremes of temperature, solitary confinement,
 arbitrary punishments and beatings, inadequate food, and
 complete lack of. medical care.' Amnesty International
 indicated that it had received reports 'that approximately 20
 of the prisoners may already have died, many at least in part
 because of the very bad conditions.'
 A number of Moroccan detainees, especially those in the
 political prisoner category, are allowed to receive Moroccan
 newspapers, to have access to radio and television, and to
 pursue studies while in prison. Political prisoners and other
 detainees are allowed family visits, and family members
 frequently are permitted to bring food to supplement the
 prison diet. A number of the prisoners convicted of
 
 
 1333
 MOROCCO
 involvement in the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts continue to be
 held without family visitation rights and without the right to
 reply to mail received.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Several political organizations have asserted that arbitrary
 arrest of individuals suspected of past trouble-making was a
 common tactic used by authorities following the January
 unrest. A number of political parties charged openly that
 many of those detained were held for weeks without being
 informed of charges against them, and were not released on
 bail. Most of the detainees were eventually charged with
 "threatening public order" and 'vandalism.' When cases of
 several of those arrested in January came to trial, judicial
 authorities threw out the charges.
 Denial of access to some of those arrested in January, as well
 as to others sentenced for fundamentalist activity, led a
 number of detainees to launch hunger strikes to dramatize
 their requests. Twenty-nine detainees in Essaquira,
 Marrakech, and Safi launched a hunger strike on July 4. One
 of the strikers died from a heart attack on July 18 and two
 others from hunger on August 28 and 29. The remainder
 desisted following reported assurances that authorities would
 investigate their requests and partly meet their demands. The
 26 remaining hunger strikers intermittently renewed the strike
 in September and October because of the alleged failure by the
 authorities to keep their word. In addition, 35 individuals
 in the Province of Oujda, serving sentences for Islamic
 fundamentalist activities, began intermittent hunger strikes
 in August to obtain status as political prisoners.
 Under a separate military code of justice, a number of
 military personnel accused of corruption have in the past been
 detained without warrants or announcement of a trial.
 In its report Torture in the Eighties, Amnesty International
 expressed concern that certain aspects of Moroccan legal
 provisions and practice, particularly those related to
 incommunicado detention, create the preconditions for torture
 and ill-treatment.
 There are no known instances of political activists exiled
 from Morocco, although some activists have preferred to remain
 in voluntary exile, where they are often active in leading
 opposition groups. Twenty of 71 defendants in the trial of
 Islamic fundamentalists in Casablanca in the summer of 1984
 are in the latter category.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered fair and
 is independent of political control. Cases are brought before
 an initial review court, which can call for a hearing. At
 this juncture the detainee is informed of the charges against
 him. The court questions the detainee to decide if the
 cnarges have merit. If not, or if the infraction is minor,
 the court can release the detainee or impose light
 punishment. If a lengthy investigation is required, the court
 may release the detainee on his own recognizance. In cases
 involving serious crimes, the courts generally move quickly to
 bring the case to trial. If convicted by the court of first
 instance, the accused has the right of appeal.
 
 
 1334
 MOROCCO
 Although most cases are handled by civilian/secular courts
 based largely on French legal practice, Morocco has a parallel
 judicial system using Islamic law or Shari'a to deal with
 marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance for Muslim
 Moroccans. While safeguards to human rights applicable to the
 civilian court system do not apply in the Shari'a courts,
 Koranic principles and the limited scope of the cases
 considered reduce possibilities of abuse.
 Estimates of the number arrested and tried in connection with
 the disturbances in January vary. Ranking government
 officials told a visiting delegation of the International
 Federation of Human Rights in March that 1,800 individuals had
 been detained, with about 1,200 brought to trial by late
 March. Other sources, including the foreign press, reported
 that as many as 1,500 had been brought to trial; at least half
 the defendants are believed to have been convicted, although
 not all were incarcerated.
 Prisoners serving sentences for political activities fall into
 two categories: some 110 prisoners held for political
 activities dating back as far as the early 1970's and
 sentenced to prison terms of up to 30 years; 75-100 prisoners
 detained for Islamic fundamentalist activities, although some
 sources estimate that in the spring of 1984 the number reached
 200-300.
 According to the Moroccan Government, 60 political prisoners
 were included in the King's August 20 pardon which commuted or
 reduced sentences of 154 prisoners. Human rights
 organizations have confirmed the release of 47 prisoners,
 including both long-time prisoners and others convicted after
 January 1984.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, the Government does not interfere excessively in
 the private lives of its citizens. The Constitution states
 that the nome is inviolable, and that no search or
 investigation can be made without a judicial warrant. This
 stricture is reportedly not always observed. It is widely
 believed that the Government selectively monitors certain
 individuals, including their telephone conversations. After
 the January disturbances, it was alleged that police and
 security forces searched offices and homes without warrants
 for evidence of subversive activity.
 To control the spread of Islamic fundamentalism, the
 Government instituted in May a program to train Interior
 Ministry officials to observe and monitor teachings and
 discussions in mosques and elsewhere on "religious' subjects.
 Tnere is inspection of correspondence to and from prisoners in
 Moroccan jails. There was no evidence or public charges in
 1984 of government interference or tampering with public mails.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, including
 freedom of the press, as long as no criticism is made of the
 Monarcn, the Crown, or Islam. All newspapers and journals are
 
 
 1335
 MOROCCO
 privately owned, although some are subsidized by the
 Government. Most are controlled by political parties or by
 private groups and associations. Criticism of the Government,
 other public institutions, and social conditions is frequent,
 although constraints exist.
 During the January disturbances, no newspaper mentioned the
 widespread unrest directly. When the Communist Party of
 Progress and Socialism newspaper Al Bayane was reportedly
 preparing to comment on the unrest, 12 days after it had
 begun, publication was suspended for 2 months. Subsequently,
 the editors alleged in their newspaper that the journal was
 subject to prior review by government authorities.
 Many foreign journals are available in Morocco; seven have
 local editions there. All publications, whether printed in
 Morocco or imported from abroad, require government approval
 before they can be sold. Foreign publications are usually
 seized when they refer negatively t6 Morocco. Some Spanish
 papers--in particular, Cambio 16--have been unavailable
 following alleged sensationalist reporting of the January
 disturbances.
 The Government controls television and radio, which generally
 reflect official views.
 In the campaign for parliamentary elections, opposition
 viewpoints were freely expressed, and there were only isolated
 instances of government interference. Academic freedom is
 generally respected, although there are strictures against the
 investigation and discussion of the monarchy and Islam.
 o. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are constitutional guarantees of freedom of peaceful
 assembly and association. Private associations are permitted,
 after registering with the Government, and professional,
 business, and religious associations flourish.
 Three major trade union federations operate: the Union
 Marocains du Travail (UMT); the Confederation Democratique du
 Travail (CDT); and the Union Generale des Travailleurs
 Marocains (UGTM). The UMT is the largest with over 60 percent
 of the somewhat less than 1 million organized workers that are
 directly or indirectly affiliated with a trade union. Union
 strength is largely in the industrial and commercial sectors.
 Relatively few agricultural workers are organized. The UMT
 annually represents Moroccan workers at the International
 Labor Organization (ILO). The CDT and UGTM are also active
 internationally and both participated in the June 1984
 International Labor Conference.
 Although a number of small-scale strikes occurred in 1984,
 there were no major strikes. This may have been due to the
 depressed economy or fear of adverse government reaction. A
 number of trade unionists were arrested in connection with the
 January disturbances, but there was no evidence of arrests or
 arbitrary detention for trade union activity. No known union
 figures are serving sentences for union activity.
 The UMT has presented a number of complaints to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) in the last two years
 relating to infractions of ILO conventions on freedom of
 association and collective bargaining. The cases primarily
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 85
 
 
 1336
 MOROCCO
 concern allegations that firms dismissed workers because of
 their roles in trade union activities. In some cases, full or
 partial settlement has been reached, usually after strikes and
 protracted negotiations. In others, employers have chosen to
 ignore ILO recommendations that the workers be reinstated.
 The Constitution also guarantees representation of workers in
 Parliament. Of 10 seats reserved for trade union
 organizations in the current 306-member Parliament, the UMT
 elected 5, the CDT 3, and the UGTM 2 members in the 1984
 elections. The UMT is nonpartisan, whereas the CDT and UGTM
 are closely allied with two of the largest political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is over 99 percent Muslim, and Islam is the
 official state religion. The King bears the title of
 'Commander of The Faithful" as the religious as well as
 secular leader of the Moroccan population.
 Two non-Islamic religions have a significant presence in
 Morocco, Judaism and Christianity. There are some 11,000 to
 14,000 Jews, living mainly in the major cities. The Jewish
 community operates schools and social institutions, as well as
 2U mdjor synagogues. Publications in Hebrew are permitted and
 rabbis serving the Jewish community are trained in Morocco.
 Tne Jewish community has close ties to communities in other
 nations, including Israel, and in 1984 a congress was held in
 Rabat attended by Jewish leaders from Israel, including the
 Knesset, as well as from France, Belgium, Canada, and the U.S.
 Tnere are also institutional links between the Moroccan
 Government and the Roman Catholic Church. In December 1983
 Morocco pledged in a letter to Pope John Paul II to guarantee
 the right of the Catholic Church to conduct its activities,
 both religious and charitable. The letter also formally
 recognized the work of the Catholic clergy, who come
 exclusively from abroad, in ministering to some 100,000
 foreign residents, with parishes in most major cities.
 The Constitution provides guarantees for freedom of worship,
 although proselytizing is punishable. While conversion to
 another faith is not banned in the civil code, the Islamic
 faith strongly discourages it. Between December 1983 and May
 1984, 18 members of the small Baha'i community were arrested
 and, in separate trials, 17 were accused of forming an illegal
 association which had failed to register with the authorities,
 attempting to convert Muslims to their faith, and constituting
 a threat to public order. In January and February 1984, the
 courts handed down convictions and 3-year sentences to 16 of
 the defendants and in June another defendant also received a
 conviction and 3-year sentence. On August 13, the Appeals
 Court in Casablanca dismissed convictions of 3 defendants and
 reduced sentences in 13 others to 10 months. The Appeals
 Court in Tetouan confirmed one of the three-year sentences.
 The convictions were appealed to the Supreme Court during
 October. Some see the Government's charges of proselytizing
 as merely a pretext for an effort to suppress the Baha'is'
 religious liberty and induce them to stop practicing their
 faith.
 Official concern over proselytism also led to government
 action in May against some Protestant Christians. Beginning
 on May 1, several Protestants were called in for police
 
 
 1337
 MOROCCO
 questioning on their religious activities. The bookstore of a
 Protestant minister in Fes, which carried a limited number of
 Bibles and Christian literature, was closed in May. Those
 called in for questioning were soon released, although some
 were later called back for questioning.
 Throughout 1984, the Government moved to counteract the growth
 of Islamic fundamentalism, especially after reports of
 fundamentalist involvement in the January disturbances. In
 December 1983, leading Moroccan fundamentalist scholar
 Abdeslam Yassine was arrested for printing an illegal
 newspaper and for trying to form an Islamic fundamentalist
 political party. He was sentenced in May to two years in
 prison. During his prolonged trial, the Government briefly
 imprisoned a number of Yassine supporters. In late April,
 five other fundamentalists, who were attempting to publish a
 fundamentalist tract, were also picked up, although most were
 released. In June, 71 Islamic fundamentalists were brought to
 trial in Casablanca. Twenty defendants were charged with
 incitement to rebellion, attacks on the internal security of
 the state, and plotting against the regime. On July 30, the
 court handed down death sentences for 13 of the 71, including
 7 in absentia. By late 1984, these sentences had neither been
 carried out nor commuted. Thirty-four others, including 13 in
 exile, were sentenced to life terms, and the remaining were
 sentenced to varying terms.
 In June, King Hassan announced a program under the Interior
 Ministry to oversee teaching in the mosques. Interior
 Ministry personnel are to monitor and report teachings which
 deviate from orthodox Islam. Government spokesmen and the
 King have also counseled the population against extremist
 religious philosophies and admonished religious scholars to
 hew to orthodoxy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco. As an
 administering authority in the Western Sahara, the Moroccan
 Government restricts movement in areas of the territory which
 are militarily contested. There were no reported cases of
 restrictions on foreign travel for political reasons in 1984
 and there are no formal restrictions on emigration. A woman
 is obliged to have the permission of her father or, if
 married, her husband, to obtain a passport. A divorced woman
 must receive her father's permission for a passport, and if
 she has custody of children, she must obtain the former
 husband's permission for their passports. Citizens who have
 left the country are guaranteed the right to return, and there
 were no known instances of the Government refusing reentry in
 1984. Morocco specifically encourages voluntary repatriation
 for members of the Jewish community who emigrated to Israel or
 elsewhere. It also encourages the return of Saharans who have
 opposed Morocco in the conflict over the Western Sahara.
 Former Polisario members returning to Morocco have been
 reintegrated into either civilian or military life.
 Adhering to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of
 Refugees, Morocco currently hosts 500 to 1,000 refugees,
 mainly from African countries. As rapprochement between
 Morocco and Libya continued over the past year, the size of
 the Libyan exile community is believed to have dropped. In
 August and September there were press reports that three
 
 
 1338
 MOROCCO
 Libyan dissidents were forcibly repatriated to Libya.
 Moroccan authorities deny the charge.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Executive power is vested in the King. The King also
 exercised legislative functions of the Government from October
 1983 to October 1984, after the term of the previous
 Parliament had expired. The King proposed in July 1983, and
 all political parties agreed, to postpone new elections. In
 the interim, the King exercised legislative authority by
 virtue of Article 19 of the Constitution.
 In direct elections on September 14, 12 parties participated,
 with an average of 6 to 7 candidates for each of 204 seats.
 All parties were offered free time on government television
 and radio. In the election, 67 percent of eligible voters
 cast ballots, according to official figures. The vote was
 followed by some charges of fraud and government interference,
 and the 67 percent participation rate is widely questioned.
 Nevertheless, the vote was considered to be among the fairest
 in modern Moroccan history. Thus far, few if any results have
 been challenged in court.
 On June 10, 1983, voters elected nearly 15,500 representatives
 for municipal elections. Local government is generally
 accepted as representative, although results of the 1983
 municipal elections were widely challenged.
 Morocco also employs the direct referendum on major questions
 which affect the Constitution and the structure of the state.
 In 1984, a nationwide referendum on the Moroccan-Libya Treaty
 of Oujda, signed on August 13, was conducted. The Government
 announced that 97 percent of those voting cast ballots for the
 union.
 No group dominates the political spectrum and virtually all
 points of view are represented in the Parliament. Ethnic and
 tribal distinctions remain, as the mountainous terrain has
 fostered relative isolation and separate regional identities.
 Although Berber spokesmen claim that Moroccan institutions do
 not reflect the Berber character of the population and that
 the Berber identity is insufficiently maintained, Berbers
 continue to have a significant role in national and local
 affairs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 9
 There have been no instances in recent years where Morocco has
 refused to allow international or non-governmental
 investigation of its human rights situation.
 In March Morocco was visited by a Commission from the Paris-
 oased International Federation of Human Rights. The
 Commission met with groups and individuals to investigate the
 human rights situation following the January disturbances.
 The delegation also met with senior government officials and
 was provided with data and reports, which generally
 corresponded with independent estimates, of the numbers of
 those arrested, charged, and brought to trial.
 
 
 1339
 MOROCCO
 During hunger strikes by prisoners from July through October,
 the Government, after some delay, allowed Moroccan jurists and
 representatives of local human rights associations to meet
 with the hunger strikers and their families. The Government
 also received appeals from foreign groups on behalf of the
 hunger strikers, in some cases through Moroccan embassies and
 consulates abroad where the ambassador or senior officials
 accepted petitions. The Government was also petitioned by
 concerned individuals, mainly Moroccan but also some foreign
 groups, who traveled to the country to attempt to intervene on
 behalf of the hunger strikers.
 In its 1984 report, as well as in its May 1982 Special Report
 on Morocco, Amnesty International expressed concern about
 prisoners of conscience, the length of pretrial detention,
 disappearances, and the alleged deaths of some detainees and
 prisoners. Freedom House calls Morocco 'partly free."
 Amnesty International's report Torture in the Eighties and
 most of its other reports have not been publicized in the
 Moroccan press, although international commentary on the human
 rights situation in Morocco is occasionally reported and
 debated in the local media.
 Two major human rights associations function in Morocco: the
 Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) and the League
 for the Defense of Human Rights (LDDH). The LDDH is closely
 affiliated with the Istiqlal Party (the major political party
 at the time of Morocco's independence), while the AMDH has
 less clearly defined links with left-wing political parties.
 Tne LDDH generally focuses on international causes such as
 Palestinian rights. The AMDH concentrates almost exclusively
 on internal human rights questions. Both groups publish
 documents and periodic reports. They occasionally intercede
 with the Government and the courts on behalf of individuals
 without retaliation. Most newspapers, however, refuse to
 carry communiques for the associations. The AMDH played an
 important role in efforts to resolve a hunger strike by
 prisoners during the second half of 1984.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population is 23 million and is growing at the rate of 2.9
 percent. Per capita gross national product is $872.
 Beginning in 1983 and through 1984, the economy entered a
 period of severe retrenchment. In September 1983 Morocco
 signed a standby agreement with the International Monetary
 Fund through March 1985 designed to bridge the balance of
 payments gap while the Government undertakes necessary reforms
 for medium and long-term structural adjustment. Morocco also
 rescheduled its foreign debt through 1984. Given the size of
 its debt (some 85 percent of its gross domestic product), high
 debt service ratios, and continued drought conditions, Morocco
 faces continuing austerity. Government spending cuts have
 resulted in a postponement of health, education, and housing
 projects which serve the country's poorest citizens. Life
 expectancy at birth is 54 years and the infant mortality rate
 is 124 per 1,000 live births.
 The education budget takes 30 percent of the overall
 government operating budget and the 160,000 teachers under the
 Education Ministry constitute half of public sector
 employment. The Government is trying to reform the
 educational system.
 
 
 1340
 MOROCCO
 The Constitution reaffirms the legal equality of all Moroccans
 and provides that 'men and women enjoy equal political
 rights.' Women occupy government positions of responsibility,
 including at the ministerial staff level, as well as in the
 legal, medical, and teaching professions. Progress in
 professional fields has not always been matched in society at
 large. There are areas where traditional standards prevail,
 especially in the area of private law. Divorce is permitted,
 but a husband can repudiate his wife while she cannot
 repudiate him. A male can take four wives according to
 Islamic tradition, although such multiple marriages are
 increasingly rare. Segregation of sexes is common, especially
 in social settings. However, in urban areas and among the
 urban poor, as well as increasingly among middle and upper
 class families, women are employed outside the home and
 contribute to family income.
 The role of Moroccan women in public life remains restricted.
 No women hold seats in the 300-member Parliament, although 12
 women were unsuccessful candidates. Of 15,500 city council
 persons in Morocco, 17 are women. There are women serving on
 the Saharan Consultative Council, a body created in 1981 to
 advise the King on Western Saharan issues. Ten percent of
 Moroccan air force personnel are women. The Government
 actively supports labor and family planning projects designed
 to improve the conditions of women and has organized
 employment programs for them. Religious and political
 resistance to such efforts remains.
 Female school enrollment is growing faster than that of males,
 and females comprise 38 percent of all primary students, more
 than 40 percent of all secondary students, and 25 percent of
 university enrollees. Only in rural areas is the enrollment
 of women in schools unusually low, attributable to traditional
 attitudes of the Berber population and economic necessity.
