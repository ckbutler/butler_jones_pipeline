 MALTA
 Malta   is  a  constitutional  republic   with  a  parliamentary
 government elected by universal suffrage. The President serves
 as chief   of  state, and   the   Prime  Minister  as  chief  of
 government. Agatha Barbara is chief of state and Labour Party
 leader Dom Mintoff is head of the Government.       As a former
 British colony, Malta is a member of the Commonwealth and
 continues to practice many British traditions.    In a political
 protest, the Nationalist Party boycotted Parliament     from the
 December 1981 election until March 29, 1983.     The Nationalist
 Party won 51 percent of the popular vote in the 1981 election,
 but obtained a minority of the seats in Parliament, alleging
 that the   result was due to redrawing of electoral districts.
 On April 26, 1982, Nationalist Members of Parliament were
 declared unseated by the Speaker of the Maltese House.       The
 Nationalists refused   to  recognize  this  unseating, and   the
 Mintoff  Government   countered  by  proceeding   to  treat  the
 Nationalist Party as an "illegal party," culminating      in an
 attempt to proscribe all contacts between foreign diplomats and
 members of that party. The Nationalists returned to Parliament
 on March   29, 1983, as part of an agreement of        "national
 reconciliation."
 The Maltese Constitution states that every citizen is entitled
 to fundamental individual rights and freedoms regardless of
 race, place of origin, political opinion, color, creed, or sex.
 The  threat   to  these  generally   observed  standards  exists
 primarily  in Malta's intensely partisan political disputes,
 which negatively affect even vital nonpolitical institutions
 such  as   the  judiciary,  the  national  broadcasting  system,
 hospitals, and schools.   Since the last elections, there has
 been a series of boycotts affecting advertising, television, and
 the use of certain products.    In an act of civil disobedience
 inspired by   the opposition on June 29, 1982, thousands of
 Maltese did not go to work for a day.       The response of the
 Government was to label this an "illegal strike," and to deprive
 many of those who had participated of the right to return to
 work.   In   some  cases, businesses   were  closed  completely.
 Service  station owners, for    example, were   not  allowed  to
 purchase gasoline.   On August 8, the Prime Minister decided
 that, "as an act of mercy," he would allow most of those who had
 participated in this act of civil disobedience to return to
 work, after six weeks of unemployment.       There has been no
 subsequent repetition of such civil disobedience.
 The status of human rights in Malta did not change significantly
 during the course of 1983.    The Government's arbitrary use of
 broadcast  media was   at  least  partially  counterbalanced  by
 continued demonstrations of the independence of the judiciary,
 an independence that manifested itself in several decisions in
 favor  of  freedom   of  speech,  assembly,  etc.,  and  against
 government attempts to restrict those freedoms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no known incidents of unlawful or arbitrary
 deprivation of life in Malta during the past year.
 
 (1043)
 
 
 1044
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of disappearances have been noted.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Maltese Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading
 punishment, and torture is not practiced by the Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and respected in practice. There are no known
 political prisoners or persons in political exile, with the
 possible exception of one foreigner who appears to be held at
 least partially in an effort to influence Malta's difficult
 dealings with another state. On the other hand, people can be,
 and often are, held by the police for 48 hours of "questioning"
 without being charged. On several occasions during the past few
 years, and on at least one occasion during the past year,
 prominent  opposition   figures  have   been  held   under  this
 provision, then released and rearrested seconds after leaving
 the police station.    Although this process could, in theory,
 continue indefinitely, the total time of detention in practice
 has not exceeded three or four days. The right of habeas corpus
 is also guaranteed by the Constitution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial before an impartial court is guaranteed in
 the Constitution and respected in practice. The judicial system
 is independent and includes an appeals court.      Although the
 Court Reform Act passed in 1981 limits the jurisdiction of
 courts in the area of oversight of administrative actions by the
 Government, the   courts  are   largely  free  from governmental
 interference.  On at least three occasions in 1983, the courts
 have reached significant decisions which have not pleased the
 Government, but which were enforced nonetheless.
 f. Arbitrary interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of the home is guaranteed in the
 Constitution and is respected in practice.       Police searches
 require warrants which are issued only after proper
 administrative reviews.  The Postmaster General is empowered to
 open any mail which he suspects or "has reason to believe" might
 contain threats, pornography, seditious material, etc.       The
 Postmaster  General  employs   several  people  to  ensure  that
 postcards, periodicals, and other publications which might be
 regarded as pornographic are confiscated and destroyed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution.      They are
 also  respected   in  practice,  with   the  single  and  highly
 significant exception of radio and televison broadcasting.   The
 broadcast media are completely controlled by the Government and
 make no pretense of evenhanded coverage of the opposition. The
 
 
 1045
 Mintoff Government has gone so far as to seek to apply this
 policy extraterritorially by insisting that the Italian
 Government close down a Nationalist Party station broadcasting
 from nearby Sicily. The issue of evenhandedness in broadcasting
 is probably the single most divisive issue in Malta today. It
 is responsible for much of the political tension which
 characterizes this island. For example, a recent court decision
 banned the broadcast of a speech made by the Deputy Prime
 Minister on the grounds that such a broadcast would not give
 evenhanded treatment to the opposition.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is guaranteed by law and fully
 exercised in practice. Trade unionists and other interest
 groups freely exercise the right to set up associations. There
 have been complaints from the opposition that the Government has
 been slow in granting permits which could allow the
 establishment of new Nationalist Party clubs; this may be due to
 bureaucratic inefficiency rather than to any concerted attempt
 to restrict these freedoms.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice in Malta is
 constitutionally guaranteed. The overwhelmingly dominant
 religion (99.9 percent) is Roman Catholicism, although there are
 small groups of Protestants, Muslims, and Jews. The current
 Government, however, has a pronounced anticlerical bias. It is
 engaged in a continuous battle with the Catholic Church over the
 latter's property and accounts, and, as part of its campaign to
 provide free education for all Maltese children, the Government
 is even attempting to close down Church schools. If the
 Government prevails in its confrontation with the Church, the
 future of religion in Malta would be profoundly affected. The
 anticlerical bias of the ruling party can be seen in many small
 ways: its ministers rarely attend mass in Malta, where they
 might be seen, although many do so frequently when abroad; Labor
 Party clubs often schedule raucous rallies in front of parish
 churches during Sunday morning mass; and the government-
 controlled press indulges in vitriolic antichurch diatribes,
 often directing ad hominem attacks at the Archbishop of Malta.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither domestic nor foreign travel is circumscribed. Freedom
 of movement, foreign travel, emigration are guaranteed and that
 guarantee is respected in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 There is a high degree of participation in the political process
 in Malta. In the last parliamentary elections (1981), more than
 95 percent of registered voters actually voted. Almost everyone
 is "politicized," including young school children who often come
 home chanting the slogans of one party or another. The 1981
 elections were genuinely free. Since those elections, there has
 been a harsh and continuing dispute centering on allegations of
 significant redistricting before them, on the fact that there
 were large discrepancies between census figures and numbers of
 
 
 1046
 registered voters, and on procedures for counting the ballots.
 Through all of these disputes, the Labour Party has never
 claimed to have received more than 49 percent of the popular
 vote. Nonetheless, the Maltese system allows a party to control
 a majority of parliamentary seats without having obtained a
 majority of the popular vote.    In addition, under the Maltese
 system, a party can control the majority of seats in Parliament
 without having obtained a majority of the popular vote, and the
 Labor Party has controlled the Parliament in recent years.
 Since Labor members are usually required to vote consistently
 with  the   wishes  of  their  leader,   that  person  exercises
 considerable  influence despite wide public participation     in
 elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No   requests  are   known  to   have  been   made  for  outside
 investigations of alleged violations of human rights in Malta.
 Amnesty  International  does  not  discuss Malta    in  its  1983
 report.   Freedom House, citing the restrictions the Mintoff
 Government has placed upon television and radio and calling that
 Government "increasingly anti-democratic," rates Malta "partly
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Constitution declares that availability to all citizens of
 the  highest   levels  of  education   and  social  welfare  are
 fundamental aims of government.    Both the Government and the
 opposition state their commitment to the pursuit of these aims
 and to the support of the basic rights to own property, to work
 with just conditions and remuneration, to maintain a standard of
 living  adequate for health    and well-being, and to receive
 universal education.   In 1982, per capita income was $3,824,
 with a population of 332,000. Maltese public education is free
 and open to all.   The literacy rate is nearly 90 percent, and
 education is compulsory to age 16. General standards of health
 care in Malta are high.   In 1982, life expectancy at birth was
 69.1 years for males and 74.0 years for females.      Government
 programs   in  health   care  have   concentrated  on  providing
 inexpensive health care services to the largest possible segment
 of the population. Infant mortality is only' 11.0 per 1,000 live
 births .  A prolonged labor dispute between the Government and
 the medical association has led to many Maltese doctors leaving
 the country. The Government also withdrew financial support for
 the   remaining  church-run   private   hospitals,   which  were
 consequently forced to close.
 Women participate   freely  in  social and political life and
 continue  to  expand their economic    role, although   they are
 underrepresented in the professions and management.    There are
 traditional legal limitations on women's property rights within
 marriage, which derive from traditional Maltese social values.
 Limitations on public-sector employment of married women were
 removed in 1981. Strong private-sector demand for female labor
 has ensured a very low level of unemployment among women. Women
 constitute about 27 percent of the labor force. Public economic
 and social services are extended on a nondiscriminatory basis.
