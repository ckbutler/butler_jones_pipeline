 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is governed by President Robert Mugabe and his
 Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF)
 which has dominated the legislative and executive branches of
 government since independence. Zimbabwe's Constitution allows
 multiple parties and four other parties fielded candidates in
 the last election. In 1987 Mugabe signed a unity accord with
 Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) leader Joshua Nkomo
 intended to merge the two parties and end the violence and
 human rights abuses that took place during the Matabeleland
 crisis of 1982-87. In December 1989, the united ZANU held its
 first congress in preparation for the March 1990 elections.
 The newly unified party won 117 of the 120 contested
 parliamentary seats, and Mugabe won 83 percent of the
 presidential vote, easily defeating his former aide, Zimbabwe
 Unity Movement (ZUM) founder Edgar Tekere. The election
 campaign, however, was not fully free and fair and was marked
 by the harassment, intimidation, and arrest of opposition
 party members and supporters.
 The armed forces, which number about 50,000, are primarily
 deployed to combat Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO)
 incursions into villages along the eastern border and protect
 various transportation corridors in Mozambique. The Zimbabwe
 Republic Police (ZRP) is responsible for maintaining law and
 order. The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) and the
 Police Internal Security and Intelligence (PISI) units,
 attached to the President's office, have police powers and can
 arrest, detain, and interrogate suspects in internal security
 cases. The CIO has often been accused of human rights abuses,
 including the use of torture.
 Zimbabwe's economy has strong agricultural and mining sectors
 and a diversified industrial base. Despite frequent droughts,
 unstable commodity prices, high taxes, price controls,
 restrictive labor laws and a chronic shortage of foreign
 exchange, economic growth has generally matched the rate of
 population growth. However, new investment has been
 inadequate to generate jobs for the large number of secondary
 school graduates, and unemployment is well over 25 percent.
 The Government recently embarked on a 5-year economic reform
 program designed to reduce controls over the economy,
 stimulate investment, and increase exports.
 While there are still serious human rights abuses in Zimbabwe,
 the overall human rights situation improved in 1990 with the
 lifting of the 25-year-old State of Emergency (SOE), a general
 amnesty granted to over 1,400 prisoners, and the appointment
 of independent judges to the Supreme Court. In September the
 160 member ZANU-PF Central Committee decided that the
 Government would not legislate a one-party state but instead
 would "organize and mobilize the people" to support the idea.
 The Government moved toward free collective bargaining and
 removed wage parameter restrictions from labor negotiations.
 At the same time, human rights problems surfaced in 1990,
 notably the election campaign's irregularities, restrictions
 on freedom of speech and press, assembly and association, and
 the traditional, often illegal, discrimination against women.
 Security personnel used excessive force, especially against
 suspected RENA24O sympathizers, and in the Government's
 continuing forced repatriation of Mozambican refugees. There
 were five major strikes in 1990, and, in the case of striking
 teachers, the Government used the SOE and other powers to jail

 ZIMBABWE
 and fire teachers. However, most of the striking teachers
 were rehired after judicial intervention and a large public
 outcry against the Government's action.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of.political killings or summary
 executions by government security forces in 1990.
 RENAMO forces operating across the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border
 continued to commit atrocities, including arbitrary killings
 of innocent civilians in both Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In
 December President Mugabe reported that RENAMO cadres had
 killed 81 Zimbabweans in the previous 11 months. Father
 Michael Lapsley, an Anglican priest working with the African
 National Congress (ANC), lost both hands and an eye in an
 April mail bomb attack that many in Zimbabwe attribute to a
 South African rightwing organization.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights observers in both Harare and Bulawayo reported
 that in 1990 there were no new cases of disappearance
 attributable to the Government. There has been, however, no
 progress in locating any of the people, almost all of whom
 were from Ndebele ethnic regions, who disappeared in
 1982-1995. Estimates of the number of disappeared ranged from
 at least 80 to as many as 400. The Government has never made
 a serious effort to account for these missing persons. Human
 rights organizations have pointed out that the ZANU-ZAPU unity
 accord has meant that the Government has not been called to
 account for past abuses.
 The Ministry of Home Affairs reported that 102 Zimbabweans
 were abducted by RENAMO from the eastern border areas in the
 first 9 months of 1990. Many of these people never return
 from Mozambique, where it is believed they were killed or
 forced to work for RENAMO.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture has long been a serious problem in Zimbabwe. Under
 the SOE, detainees in security cases were often held
 incommunicado in the initial stage by CIO officials, and it is
 at this point that torture most often occurred, according to
 human rights observers. Firsthand reports in 1990 indicated
 that torture continued to be employed in some security cases,
 especially cases involving suspected South African and RENAMO
 agents. Senior government officials strongly deny that
 torture is condoned but admit that isolated, unauthorized
 instances have occurred. No CIO officials were prosecuted for
 such abuses in 1990. Local human rights officials claimed
 that security officers on a routine basis physically abused
 displaced Mozambicans suspected of being RENAMO supporters.
 Police brutality in political and ordinary criminal cases is
 also a problem. In September Senior Assistant Commissioner
 Ndava announced that the ZRP had paid over $25,000 in the past
 12 months in compensation for unlawful detentions and arrests
 
 
 474
 ZIMBABWE
 in Harare alone. In an effort to instill discipline into the
 police force, the ZRP hierarchy has decided to deduct all
 damages for illegal arrests and physical abuse from the
 salaries of the offending officers.
 In July police raided a squatter settlement in Harare's
 Eastlea suburb. The "street people's" shacks were burned to
 the ground in an attack by some 200 policemen, including riot
 police, and about 150 people, including children, were taken
 to Chikurubi prison. An eyewitness described how police set
 fire to the squatters' shacks and refused to allow the people
 to retrieve their meager belongings, in some cases beating
 those who protested. The eviction was ordered by the Harare
 City Council. Following the public outcry, the squatters were
 released from jail and moved to a farm outside Harare. In
 1990 the Harare Legal Resources Foundation conducted three
 seminars for police officers which were intended to help the
 ZRP learn to act within the framework of the law.
 There were seven reported cases of rape of Zimbabwean women by
 RENAMO forces in the first 9 months of 1990. As all of these
 rapes occurred in remote areas along the eastern border where
 few means of modern communication exist, the actual incidence
 of rape was probably much higher. Several former members of
 South African national liberation movements were badly beaten
 by CIO officials who suspected them of working for the South
 African Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The police must by law inform an arrested person of the
 charges against him before he is taken into custody. After
 completion of police questioning, the accused may be asked to
 sign a statement which lists his replies to all queries. The
 accused has the right to answer all questions in the presence
 of an attorney but only if he can afford to engage one. The
 magistrate must then decide if the accused should be released
 on bail or on his own recognizance. Pretrial rights are
 generally respected, but occasionally inexperienced
 magistrates and overzealous police officers do not inform
 defendants of their rights.
 Zimbabwean criminal law requires that a person arrested on a
 criminal charge must have a preliminary hearing before a
 magistrate within 96 hours, but the law is often disregarded
 if a person is not legally represented. At the hearing the
 magistrate decides whether the arrested person should be
 released on bail or held in custody until trial. However, in
 cases involving the SOE, the Minister of Home Affairs had the
 power to issue a certificate which denied bail to a person
 under arrest even if the court approved it. Under the SOE the
 Government often used this prerogative in cases involving
 national security or exchange control violations.
 The Government allowed the SOE to expire on July 25 after
 nearly 25 years inforce. It gave the Government extensive
 detention authority in political and security cases,
 permitting indefinite detention without trial "in the
 interests of public safety or public order." The Minister of
 Home Affairs had broad powers under the SOE and presented a
 motion every 6 months calling for its extension. Under the
 SOE implementing legislation, the Emergency Powers Act (EPA),
 persons could be detained without an arrest warrant, and the
 authorities only had to supply the detainee with the reasons
 for the arrest within 7 days.
 
 
 475
 ZIMBABWE
 The most common reasons for detention under the EPA were
 suspected dissident activity and spying for South Africa.
 Leslie Lesia, a black South African employed by the South
 African security apparatus, was the last detainee held under
 the SOE and was released in July. Lesia was detained in 1987
 after the death of a Zimbabwean woman who was killed when a
 television set he allegedly booby-trapped exploded in her
 Harare apartment. In 1990 four ZUM officials were arrested on
 charges of spying for South Africa. Six elderly members of
 the ZANU-NDONGA party (a splinter party not associated with
 ZANU-PF) were arrested on charges of recruiting youths for
 RENAMO. They were all released when the Government failed to
 produce any evidence linking them with the South African
 Government or RENAMO_
 In October 1989 the Government accused the General Secretary
 of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, Morgan Tsvangirai,
 of being a South African agent and used its emergency powers
 to keep him in detention, despite High Court intervention on
 two occasions ordering his release. He was first arrested
 immediately after he had criticized the Government's use of
 emergency powers as indicative of rising state oppression and
 for its action in closing the University of Zimbabwe in the
 wake of student protests. He had also been critical of
 restrictions on the right to strike. He was finally released
 unconditionally in November 1-989 when his detention was again
 to be challenged in the Supreme Court.
 It is still possible without the SOE for the Government to
 apply a wide range of legal powers to deal with almost any
 situation that may arise, thanks to Zimbabwe's Rhodesian
 inheritance. Emergency powers were mainly useful in ensuring
 that investigations proceeded without having to bring
 detainees before the courts. Those detained could be held
 indefinitely without trial or brought to trial later under the
 Official Secrets Act or the Law and Order Maintenance Act
 (LOMA). Although originally promulgated 30 years ago and
 widely used to prosecute political opponents, many of whom are
 in the Government today, the LOMA has not been repealed since
 independence. The Act has extremely wide and vague sections
 on subversion and gives extensive powers to the police and to
 the Minister of Home Affairs and the Chief Executive. It also
 has numerous other sweeping provisions dealing with all
 aspects of Zimbabwean political, social, and economic life
 and, if applied vigorously, could make it virtually impossible
 for anyone to exercise their constitutional right to free
 speech and assembly. Under the Act, freedom of assembly as
 understood internationally and in the Zimbabwean Constitution
 does not exist. However, it will be difficult for the
 Government legally to use the oppressive provisions of the
 LOMA now that the SOE has been lifted because it would
 contravene Zimbabwe's Constitution, which incorporates a bill
 of rights. The Government did not invoke the LOMA after July
 1990.
 No information is available on the number of persons being
 detained by military forces in the conflict with RENAMO.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Zimbabwe's legal system is based on a mixture of Roman-Dutch
 and English common law practices and procedures, and consists
 of magisterial courts, the High Court, and the Supreme Court.
 Every defendant has the right to select a lawyer of his or her
 choosing. In most instances, defendants must retain their own
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 legal counsel because there id a limited provision for public
 defenders.
 Defense counsel can present evidence and confront witnesses.
 Approximately 90 percent of defendants are not represented by
 counsel. The right to appeal exists in all cases and is
 automatic in cases where the death penalty is imposed. All
 trials are open to the public, except in rare cases in which
 the Government orders the proceedings be held in camera, e.g.,
 in certain security cases involving alleged South African
 agents. In 1990 the Supreme Court handed down a decision that
 made it illegal to place anyone in solitary confinement. The
 Court declared that solitary confinement was a violation of
 human rights reminiscent of the dark ages.
 Parliament passed the Customary Law and Local Courts Act of
 1990 without objection on February 8. This bill created a
 unitary court system. Previously, only village and community
 courts could hear customary law cases, but, with the
 restructuring of the courts, customary law cases can be heard
 at all levels of the judiciary, including the Supreme Court.
 The judiciary is generally independent, and persons brought to
 trial can be assured of a fair public hearing. Although there
 are at present 500 lawyers in Zimbabwe, there is a shortage of
 experienced magistrates. Zimbabwe's judicial system is hard
 pressed to cope with ordinary criminal cases. The 3-year lag
 in case and law reporting ended in 1990 as the Harare Legal
 Resources Foundation received a government contract and
 brought the cases up to date. However, the production of
 records for review and appeal remains a problem.
 The Government generally abides by court decisions even when
 it is strongly opposed to the ruling, but it also finds ways
 to circumvent some court decisions as in the Tsvangirai case
 (see Section l.d.). In the case of the May-June 1990 teachers
 strike, a High Court justice ruled that the Government's
 dismissal of over 1,000 striking teachers was illegal. The
 power to dismiss civil servants is solely vested in the
 independent Public Service Commission and not the Ministry of
 Public Service, according to the High Court judge. President
 Mugabe and Minister of Public Service Eddison Zvobgo accepted
 the ruling, but then proceeded to suspend the teachers. The
 Government later rehired all but eight of the teachers. In
 July President Mugabe announced a general amnesty for 1,400
 prisoners, including those convicted of dissent-related
 activities and infanticide and former ZAPU political
 fugitives. He also granted a general remission. The amnesty,
 the second to be granted by President Mugabe since 1987, was
 ordered to consolidate reconciliation and unity among the
 Zimbabwean people.
 The following received pardons: dissidents and their
 collaborators (involved in the 1982-87 Matabeleland crisis)
 convicted prior to June 30, 1988; former ZAPU political
 fugitives who remained outside Zimbabwe and committed acts in
 good faith before June 30, 1988, for the purpose of promoting
 or furthering the objectives of ZAPU; members of the security
 forces (military, police, CIO) who committed offenses in good
 faith for the purpose of restoring order during the years of
 antidissident activity; every woman convicted of infanticide
 as of July 1990; criminals who, in April 1990, had 12 months
 or less of their sentences to serve, except those convicted of
 murder, robbery, rape, drug smuggling, or the selling or
 poaching of endangered species; and all persons convicted of
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 politically motivated offenses committed with the purpose of
 promoting or furthering the interests of any political party
 from February to July 1990.
 In late July the Minister of Home Affairs announced that no
 political detainees or prisoners remained in Zimbabwe; human
 rights organizations agreed.
 The amnesty ended the investigation into the shooting of
 Patrick Kombayi, the former Gweru mayor and ZUM parliamentary
 candidate, who was shot six times in the groin and knees in
 March in the midst of a bitter election battle with Vice
 President Simon Muzenda.' President Mugabe said Kombayi, who
 was once his student, initiated the violence, but
 international and local human rights observers met with
 eyewitnesses who alleged that ZANU cadres and security
 officials were ordered to attack Kombayi and his supporters by
 high-ranking government officials. Kombayi was never charged
 with any crime and had a costly and difficult recuperation in
 the United Kingdom. He returned to Zimbabwe in 1990 and has
 not been harassed by government security personnel.
 The Government justified the amnesty on grounds of political
 balance, arguing that security force members had to be
 amnestied in a parallel move to assuage discontent in the
 ranks of the armed forces and ruling ZANU party. However, the
 parallel is not persuasive. Security officials and ZANU Youth
 League members were found guilty in a court of law, whereas
 some of the dissidents were not; more importantly, the former
 were officers with a responsibility for protecting the human
 rights of all Zimbabwean citizens. Respected independent
 human rights officials have argued that the pardon of the ZANU
 youths convicted in attacking a Catholic Commission for
 Justice and Peace (CCJP) member in March and the preempting of
 the trials of other ZANU Youth and Women's League members
 proved that the amnesty primarily benefited ZANU members.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution formally protects citizens from arbitrary
 search or entry, but under emergency regulations a police
 officer had virtually unlimited powers to stop and search any
 person or enter any area without a warrant. Since the lifting
 of the SOE, police must have warrants when arresting or
 searching all persons or entering all premises.
 It is widely believed that the Government monitors private
 correspondence and telephones, particularly international
 communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression but allows
 for legislation limiting this freedom when the "interest of
 defense, public safety, public order, state economic
 interests, public morality and public health" are involved.
 In practice, the Government interprets broadly its power to
 discourage free speech, and at public events it is generally
 assumed that speakers are under surveillance and may be
 subject to follow-up questioning by the CIO if the remarks are
 judged too controversial. While the LOMA provides for
 
 
 478
 ZIMBABWE
 prosecution of persons who make racially inflammatory remarks,
 it was not invoked for any such cases in 1990.
 Zimbabwe's major print media (five English-language newspapers
 and one vernacular broadsheet) belong to the Mass Media Trust,
 a holding company heavily influenced by the Government and
 ruling party. There is no opposition press per se, but a
 small independent press, consisting of a widely read economic-
 political weekly and two monthly magazines, carefully monitors
 government policies and opens its pages to opposition
 critics. Despite its displeasure with these publications, the
 Government has taken no punitive measures against them.
 Television and radio are entirely government owned.
 Government control of the mainstream media is maintained
 through direct and indirect ownership, editorial appointments,
 directives to editors, and removal of wayward editors.
 Progovernment media officials hew to the government and party
 line, avoid discussing controversial issues that challenge
 government policies, and exercise overall self-censorship in
 favor of the Government and the party.
 In 1990 the ruling party, ZANU-PF, established its own weekly
 newspaper under the editorship of Charles Ndlovu. The paper
 quickly led a smear campaign against the Catholic Commission
 for Justice and Peace (CCJP) and its executive director, Nick
 Ndebele, for CCJP's stands against electoral and human rights
 abuses by the Government and ruling party.
 The progovernment media was used by the Government and ZANU-PF
 to smear the opposition ZUM and intimidate pro-ZUM voters
 during the 1990 presidential and general elections. The
 Government allowed the opposition only nominal access to the
 print and broadcast media. In particular, Zimbabwe
 Broadcasting Corporation coverage was heavily slanted in the
 Government's favor.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution formally provides for the right of assembly
 and association for political and nonpolitical organizations,
 including a broad spectrum of economic, social, professional
 and recreational activities. In practice, there are serious
 obstacles to the full exercise of this right, particularly in
 the case of political associations, but since the lifting of
 the SOE the Government has not used the LOMA to prevent
 freedom of association or assembly.
 Under the LOMA, police permits are required for public
 meetings and political rallies. Organizations must pay the
 town council (usually controlled by ZANU) to use civic centers
 and stadiums. Reliable reports indicate that on many
 occasions town council members changed the rules for renting
 public places to ZUM members wanting to hold election rallies
 after police granted permission to hold the rallies. In late
 March, a ZUM rally that was scheduled to be addressed by Edgar
 Tekere in Karoi was canceled because the stadium was locked.
 A police contingent in riot gear patrolled the area and a
 police spokesperson said authority to hold the meeting had not
 been given by the ZRP. An Africa Watch report in March stated
 that opposition parties were prevented from holding public
 rallies. ZUM was able to hold rallies in Tekere s home city
 of Mutare and in the former ZAPU stronghold of Buiawayo
 However. the party was denied permission to hold ra:iies in
 Harare. the capital city. or any of its densely popuiated
 
 
 479
 ZIMBABWE
 suburbs. With the lifting of the SOE, the LOMA only requires
 that the police be given 7 days' prior notice before a meeting
 is held. The police no longer have the power to approve or
 deny meetings, and in Matabeleland ZUM officials have held
 meetings without police or town council interference.
 There are numerous nonpolitical business and employers'
 organizations, professional associations, and recreational and
 sports clubs. These are generally free of governmental
 interference as long as their activities are viewed as
 nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Zimbabwe. There is no
 state religion. Denominations are permitted to worship
 openly, pursue social and charitable activities, and maintain
 ties with affiliates and coreligionists abroad. Religious
 belief is neither a handicap nor an advantage in terms of
 professional or political advancement. Many government
 leaders received their education in mission schools, and a
 number of senior ZANU officials are, in fact, clergymen.
 Elective courses in religious studies- are part of the
 secondary school curriculum.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel at home and abroad is not generally subject to official
 restrictions, although restrictions have been occasionally
 applied against those whom it believed might criticize the
 Government before foreign audiences. This practice does not
 appear to be widespread, and in 199a former Rhodesian Prime
 Minister Ian Smith repeatedly traveled abroad criticizing the
 Government, as did Edgar Tekere, who publicly opposed
 government policies during several trips to South Africa, In
 uly, Minister of Home Affairs Moven Mahachi said the
 Government would monitor the movements of Edgar Tekere and
 would take action against him if necessary. Mahachi said
 Tekere's trips to South Africa illustrated that the man had
 decided to destroy the revolution he had fought for and was
 working for foreigners whose interests were to destabilize
 Zimbabwe. A far more serious practical obstacle to foreign
 travel is currency control, which severely limits the amount
 of foreign currency Zimbabwean nationals may take out of the
 country.
 Immigration is not restricted, although persons who have left
 the country are not guaranteed the right to return if they
 were not born in Zimbabwe. Applicants must be able to
 demonstrate proof of livelihood. Repatriates from South
 Africa are always suspected by the Government of being in the
 employment of the South African intelligence services.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), at the end of 1990 the registered refugee population
 was estimated at 90,000; 89,000 were Mozambicans located in
 five rural camps along the eastern border. The remainder,
 mainly South Africans, were located in Harare and Bulawayo.
 An estimated 100,000 Mozambicans, many of them migrant
 farmers, are self-settled in rural areas in the east. Adult
 males of military age (18-35) among this population are being
 relocated into the official camps. Senior government
 officials have said publicly that RENAMO guerrillas infiltrate
 Zimbabwe in the guise of these Mozambican refugees and have
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 declared their intention to repatriate most of them. In 1990
 Zimbabwe sought to keep its border closed to new refugees,
 thus seriously constricting the right of first asylum. Firm
 figures are not available, but in 1990 an estimated 2,500
 refugees were forcibly repatriated to Mozambique, the object
 of government suspicion as RENAMO sympathizers.
 The Government cooperates with the UNHCR to assist Mozambican,
 South African, and other refugees and, in a change from past
 practices, has permitted UNHCR officials unrestricted access
 to Mozambican refugee camps. The Ministry of Labor, Manpower
 Planning, and Social Welfare is responsible for refugee
 affairs.   Within the Ministry, a Commissioner for Refugees
 oversees the administration of the camps and coordinates
 international and other assistance activities. Using the
 Zimbabwe Refugee Act of 1983 as the legal basis for the
 determination of eligibility for refugee status, a Zimbabwe
 Refugee Committee interviews applicants for asylum. A
 negative decision is final. This formal process applies to
 persons mainly in Harare rather than along the border.
 Mozambicans intercepted at the border are first interviewed by
 security forces; neither Refugee Committee officials nor the
 UNHCR participate in the initial screening process. In 1990
 Zimbabwe refused to grant refugee status to several former
 African National Congress and Pan African Congress members,
 forcing them to seek refuge in other countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Zimbabwe is officially a pluralist parliamentary democracy
 with a popularly elected House of Assembly. Citizens
 theoretically have the right to change their government
 through democratic means, but the result of the March
 elections called into question the ability to exercise that
 right. In those elections, 274 candidates from 5 parties (and
 11 independent candidates) were duly nominated for the 120
 contestable seats. However,-with the conclusion of the
 ZANU-ZAPU unity agreement and the ruling party's capture of
 117 of 120 parliamentary seats, Zimbabwe had become a de facto
 one-party state. in September the 160 member ZANU-PF Central
 Committee decided the Government would not legislate a
 one-party state but would "organize and mobilize the people"
 to support the idea instead.
 The Mugabe presidency was further strengthened through a
 series of constitutional amendments which, inter alia, allows
 the President to appoint both Vice Presidents and gives the
 party the power to expel Members of Parliament under certain
 circumstances, thus increasing the subordination of the
 Parliament to the President.
 Most independent observers agreed that, in the presidential
 contest and most parliamentary elections, the will of the
 people to retain ZANU-PF in power was made clear. However,
 there were widespread irregularities in the elections. There
 were credible reports of harassment, intimidation, and
 interparty violence, especially between some elements of ZUM
 and ZANU-PF. Police and ZANU-PF supporters regularly
 prevented ZUM from holding rallies, arrested and detained its
 supporters, and censored news favorable to the party. In
 Gweru, Midlands province, ZUM organizing secretary and former
 Gweru mayor Patrick Kombayi was badly wounded in an attack
 perpetrated by ZANU-PF youths and reportedly CIO operatives,
 allegedly acting on orders from senior ZANU-PF officials.
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 Several ZUM candidates in Harare's high-density suburbs were
 badly beaten by ZANU youth gangs. A medical doctor in
 Bindura, who was also a ZUM candidate, was the victim of a
 beating.
 The violence continued after the elections. In the town of
 Chegutu and in Harare's largest township, Chitungwiza, the
 ZANU-PF Women's League marched to the workplaces of four
 defeated ZUM parliamentary candidates and demanded that they
 be fired. In July ZANU-PF announced that it would pay the
 fine imposed on a member of its Youth League convicted of an
 election-related assault, on a member of the Catholic
 Commission for Justice and Peace in Karoi. Three other
 Karoi-based Youth League members were in jail awaiting trial
 on related charges when they were released under President
 Mugabe's general pardon. Immediately following their release,
 two of the youths attacked a ZUM member and were rearrested.
 They are currently awaiting trial on assault charges.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permits private local human rights groups to
 operate in Zimbabwe. However, it monitors these activities
 closely, in particular, those of the CCJP, which investigates
 complaints from private persons about human rights abuses in
 Zimbabwe-and conveys its findings to the Government. CCJP
 officials were harassed during and after the election campaign
 by the CIO, ZANU-PF youths, and the ZANU-PF-owned People's
 Voice newspaper. In 1990 two new regional groups were formed
 to promote human rights: the Southern African Human Rights
 Foundation (SAHRF) and the Central and Southern African Legal
 Assistance Foundation (CASALAF). Other groups include the
 Bulawayo-based Legal Projects Center, the Masvingo-based Legal
 Projects Center, and the Harare-based Legal Resources
 Foundation which operate libraries and information centers and
 train lawyers in humanitarian law. The Legal Projects Centers
 also provide a legal aid clinic which handles matters ranging
 from locating missing detainees to domestic disputes.
 The Government has been critical of nongovernmental
 organizations. For example, the Minister of Home Affairs, in
 response to the 1989 Africa Watch report on Zimbabwe, warned
 the organization to "avoid meddling in our internal affairs."
 In 1986 the Government declared Amnesty International (AI) an
 "enemy of the people" and threatened that anyone who supplied
 that organization with information would be detained. AI is
 still not permitted to operate in Zimbabwe.
 The Government is sensitive to charges by international
 nongovernmental organizations of human rights abuses in
 Zimbabwe. The Government permits the ICRC to maintain a
 regional office in Harare. It cooperates with the UNHCR to
 assist Mozambican, South African, and other refugees and, in a
 change from past practice, accords the UNHCR regular,
 unrestricted access to Mozambican refugee camps. Admonitions
 to the security forces to provide refugee protection have
 fallen on deaf ears.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government services in Zimbabwe are provided on a
 nondiscriminatory basis, and the Government has been able to

 ZIMBABWE
 work with the previously "whites only" infrastructure in urban
 areas to provide health and social services to all citizens.
 In many rural areas, however, the neglect of the
 preindependence period still leaves the Government struggling
 to provide minimum care. Blacks on most commercial farms are
 still mainly dependent on white farmers to meet basic health
 care and educational needs.
 In social terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified
 country despite legal prohibitions against official
 discrimination. While schools, churches, and clubs are all
 integrated, there is limited social interaction among racial
 groups. The mixed race community has complained of
 discrimination in the allocation of civil service jobs and in
 the purchase of government-controlled housing which are
 exclusively reserved for blacks by the Harare City Council.
 There are, however, two mixed race ministerial-level
 appointees.
 The actual status of women in Zimbabwe contrasts with their
 legal status. Since independence the Government has enacted
 major laws aimed at enhancing women's rights and countering
 certain traditional practices, some of which are based on the
 view of women as dependents or minors. For example, the Legal
 Age of Majority Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act recognize
 the capacity of women to act independently of their husbands
 or fathers to own property. Judges on the high courts have
 adjudicated cases upholding women's rights, including the
 right of women to inherit property. In 1981 the Ministry of
 Cooperative and Community Development and Women's Affairs was
 established to facilitate the involvement of women in national
 development.
 Nevertheless, many women remain disadvantaged in Zimbabwean
 society. Ignorance of reforms, illiteracy, economic
 dependency, and prevailing social norms prevent rural women in
 particular from benefiting equally from these changes. Women
 are still vulnerable to customary practices that operate
 against their personal rights. Zimbabwean law prohibits
 "kuzvarira," the practice of pledging a young woman to
 marriage with a partner not of her choosing. However, unless
 a woman is well educated and outspoken, marriages based on
 "kuzvarira" still take place. The Matrimonial Causes Act has
 removed the customary obligation of a groom to pay "lobola" (a
 bride price) to the parents of a would-be wife, but the
 practice of "lobola" continues to be widespread. The Child
 Protection Society of Zimbabwe has challenged the customary
 practice of offering a young girl as compensatory payment in
 interfamily disputes, but it persists.
 A considerable expansion of the nation's education system has
 resulted in an increase in the absolute number of girls being
 educated but has not altered the pattern of male domination of
 higher levels of education. Though legislation prohibits
 discrimination in employment on the basis of gender, women are
 concentrated in the lower echelons of the work force.
 Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is
 believed to be prevalent in Zimbabwe. In fact, Community and
 Cooperative Affairs Minister Joyce Mujuru estimated that in 8
 out of 10 homes in Zimbabwe women are subject to violence from
 wife beating to major assaults. For young women (aged 16-25),
 "babydumping" is often the solution to unwanted pregnancies.
 If apprehended and charged with murder, a woman can face up to
 9 years' imprisonment with hard labor. The law only
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 recognizes the guilt of the mother, not the father, in
 infanticide cases. However, in July President Mugabe pardoned
 all women who had been convicted of baby dumping. Female
 genital mutilation does not exist in Zimbabwe; it was never
 practiced by any of the indigenous ethnic groups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the Labor Relations Act, workers enjoy freedom of
 association, have the right to elect their own
 representatives, publish newsletters, and set programs and
 policies.which reflect the political and economic interests of
 labor. The Act specifies that workers may constitute workers'
 committees, which exist side by side with unions, in each
 plant and a trade union in each industrial sector and elect
 appropriate officers. The Act specifies further that workers'
 committees and trade unions must be registered with the
 Ministry of Labor, but it also seeks to protect workers'
 organizations from arbitrary government interference. The
 Government does not control or restrict labor, but it has
 powerful levets affecting labor, notably in the handling of
 strikes and the setting of wages.
 About 17 percent of the salaried work force is organized in 22
 trade unions which are members of the Zimbabwe Congress of
 Trade Unions (ZCTU), the umbrella confederation of the trade
 union movement. ZCTU officers are elected by the delegates of
 affiliated trade unions at biennial conventions, most recently
 in September. While the ZCTU was created by the Government
 shortly after independence to unite the fragmented unions that
 previously existed, neither the Government nor any political
 party has a preponderant influence in the trade union movement
 today. Most trade unions suffer from meager budgets which
 prevent them from conducting a greater range of organizing and
 educational activities.
 Workers have the right to strike providing the union advises
 the Government 2 weeks in advance of its intention to do so.
 Until the lifting of the State of Emergency (SOE) on July 25,
 the right to strike was further limited by the right of the
 Government to declare a specific industry to be essential and
 therefore not subject to strike action. In practice, the
 Government employed a broad interpretation of what constituted
 essential industries. However, there was a spate of strikes
 and work slowdowns by civil seryants (including nurses) who
 were promised raises by ZANU-PF politicians during the March
 election campaign. To halt the strikes and increase
 productivity in the public sector, the Government made a
 political decision which may harm its new economic recovery
 and trade liberalization programs: to raise public sector
 salaries.
 In May thousands of Zimbabwe's schoolteachers engaged in a
 wildcat strike over low salaries and inadequate leave
 conditions. The Government invoked state of emergency powers,
 declared teaching an essential service, and ordered the
 teachers to return to work. In June over 1,000 teachers
 defied the return to work order and were fired by the
 Government. In July, the High Court decided the Government
 had improperly fired the teachers, and in September the
 Government agreed to rehire all of them, except for eight
 strike leaders whose cases are under investigation.

 ZIMBABWE
 The ZCTU and its officials are active in the international
 labor movement and are affiliated with the Southern African
 Trade Union Coordinating Council and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity. The ZCTU has friendly relations
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 its affiliates (including the American Federation of Labor and
 Congress of Industrial Organizations), as well as with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Government does not promote or support antiunion
 discrimination, which is prohibited by law and regulation, by
 employers against union members and organizers. In fact,
 perceiving that workers are at a disadvantage in negotiations
 with better financed and better educated managers, the
 Government believes it is responsible for assisting workers
 with legislation and intervention with employers. The Labor
 Relations Act provides considerable job security for workers.
 Under the Act, a worker may not be fired without the Labor
 Ministry's concurrence. Labor relations officers are
 authorized to handle worker grievances within the plant.
 Their decision may be appealed to the regional hearing officer
 of the Ministry of Labor, and finally to a special labor
 relations tribunal over which the Chief Justice presides.
 The Labor Relations Act also ensures workers have the right to
 organize, but is silent on the right to collective
 bargaining. Workers' committees are empowered to negotiate
 with the management of a particular plant the conditions of
 labor in the workplace. Wage negotiations take place on an
 industrywide basis but are effectively limited by the
 Government's minimum wage system. In the case of a
 union-organized industry, the employers' association meets
 directly with a particular trade union. Unions and
 professional associations represent different groups of
 workers in Zimbabwe, but the Government does not recognize all
 of them. In certain cases, when there is no trade union
 representing a specific industry, representatives of the
 organized workers, i.e., the professional associations, meet
 with the employers' association under the mediation of labor
 officers from the Ministry of Labor.
 As part of its economic recovery program, in February the
 Government announced the commencement of free collective
 bargaining between workers and employers. The Government
 pledged to withdraw from the practice of using Ministry of
 Labor-appointed employment boards to recommend conditions of
 service and wage structures. In 1990 for the first time
 boards were chosen by the employers and the unions for wages
 and salary increments. The Government announced that its past
 rigid controls on salary and wage determination had served
 their purpose and that the Ministry's role in collective
 bargaining is only to monitor, vet, and register agreements.
 However, the Government maintains the power to stipulate
 minimum wage increases, which were set at 10 percent in 1990.
 Proposed amendments to the Labor Relations Act will make it
 easier to hire and fire employees.
 There are no export processing zones in Zimbabwe.
 c. Prohibitions of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is prohibited by law in Zimbabwe and is not
 practiced.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor regulations stipulate the minimum age for employment
 in the formal sector at 18 years of age, but it is possible to
 begin an apprenticeship at age 16. In this sector, minimum
 age regulations are generally enforced by the Ministry of
 Labor. However, the Government does not attempt to enforce
 these regulations for children employed in household
 enterprises, such as family farms. In 1990 there were
 credible newspaper reports that preadolescent children were
 being employed in increasing numbers as domestics and were
 being paid an average wage of $40 per month. The minimum wage
 for adult domestics is $52 per month.
 e. 'Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Conditions of labor are regulated by the Government according
 to industry. The Government publishes labor regulations for
 each of the 22 industrial sectors. These regulations specify
 wages, hours, holidays, and required safety measures. In 1990
 the Government set a minimum wage increase of 10 percent.
 Private sector employers and employees then bargained
 collectively to determine whether wage increases would exceed
 the government-imposed minimum. On average the unions and
 employers agreed on an 18 percent increase. The maximum legal
 workweek is 54 hours, and the law prescribes a minimum of one
 24-hour rest period per week. The minimum wage for the
 agricultural sector is $48 per month. The employer also
 usually provides housing, food, and medical care to workers.
 On commercial farms, the employer may provide schooling for
 the workers' children. The minimum wage is not generally
 sufficient to sustain a decent standard of living. In many
 instances, workers must rely on second jobs, extended family
 help, or some subsistence farming to meet a minimum standard
 of living.
 Labor relations officers from the Ministry of Labor are
 assigned to monitor developments in each plant to ensure that
 government minimum wage policy and occupational health and
 safety regulations are being observed. Safety in the
 workplace is a major problem, however, due primarily to too
 few inspectors and the fact that many of the basic legal
 protections do not apply to the vast majority of the farm,
 mine, and domesticworkers.
