 BRAZIL
 Brazil is a constitutional federal republic with a president,
 a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary.
 President Fernando Collor took office on March 15, 1990, the
 first directly elected President in 29 years, bringing to a
 successful conclusion Brazil's long transition from military
 rule to democracy.
 Internal security is provided by federal, state, and local
 police. State police, who bear the greatest responsibility
 for law enforcement affecting most citizens, consist of both
 uniformed police and plainclothes civil police. The armed
 forces have traditionally considered external threats to be
 their principal responsibility, but they also have a
 constitutional responsibility to guarantee domestic law and
 order. Some local and state police officers continue to
 engage in human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killing
 and mistreatment of detainees.
 President Collor's economic program moved Brazil sharply toward
 free market forces to control near hyperinflation and to break
 out of the economic stagnation resulting from years of a
 statist, import-substitution approach to development.
 Inflation by year's end was around 18 percent monthly, and the
 Government forecast a drop in gross domestic product of 3
 percent in 1990. Income distribution continued to be marked
 by wide disparities; the World Bank in September reported that
 Brazil's income distribution was the third most skewed in the
 world. Government spending on social programs remained
 constrained by a tight fiscal policy. Nevertheless, the
 Collor administration called for major improvements in health
 and education.
 The principal human rights concern continues to be the
 extrajudicial killing of squatters, labor organizers, Indians,
 common criminals, and street children by landowners, hired
 thugs, and police. In reaction, President Collor has publicly
 stated that the "new Brazil" would not tolerate violence or
 accept any violations of human rights. The Collor Government
 passed new legislation for the protection of minors and
 launched social and educational programs for minors and
 Indians. Statistics of government and Indian organizations
 indicate that the number of violent deaths of Indians during
 1990 was about the same as in 1989, while the number of deaths
 due to disease increased as demarcated lands were threatened
 by settlers, miners, and lumber companies. Reports of
 killings of peasants and union organizers involved in land
 disputes remained the same as in 1989, while the number of
 confrontations involving the landless
 appeared to increase. Despite high-level assurances to make
 human rights a leading priority, the record of forceful action
 to investigate and prosecute persons for human rights
 violations was spotty. In 1990, despite growing evidence of
 murder and other violence against members of these groups by
 state and local police officers and hired hoodlums, there were
 few successful investigations and convictions. The conviction
 of the murderers of rubber tapper and environmental leader
 Chico Mendes in late 1990 was the most notable exception.
 
 
 BRAZIL
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Extrajudicial killings are Brazil's most serious human rights
 problem. Several hundred Brazilians died at the hands of
 landowners, hired thugs, vigilante groups and policemen in
 urban gang wars and in land conflicts. Brazilian and
 international human rights organizations made credible charges
 that state and local policemen and hired gunmen kill persons
 suspected of common crimes, including street youths and
 children. They charge that federal, statd, and local
 authorities frequently fail to take legal action against those
 responsible for such killings. They affirm that police often
 fail to conduct complete investigations, sometimes because
 they cooperated with the hired gunmen or their employers to
 carry out the crimes. A 1989 Amnesty International (AI)
 report states that out of more than 1,000 killings related to
 land disputes during the 1980's, only 5 had come to trial by
 the end of 1989.
 Conflicts between rural landholders and the landless continued
 in 1990. Approximately 75 persons died in land conflicts in
 1990. The victims included labor leaders, clergy, attorneys,
 and other activists helping to organize agricultural worker
 unions, as well as law enforcement officials and landowners.
 According to the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) of the National
 Conference of Brazilian Bishops, there was no decrease in the
 number of killings in 1990 following a 63-percent decrease in
 1989. Members of the landless movement expressed concern that
 growing assertiveness by rural workers has led to the increased
 violence, such as the killing of the son of an estate owner in
 a confrontation with landless farmers in Santa Catarina state
 on June 1. During a confrontation on August 8 between landless
 workers and police in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, a
 policeman was killed and more than 70 people were injured. In
 1990 seven policemen, hired gunmen, and landowners were killed
 by land invaders. Confrontations have become more frequent in
 Pernambuco, Maranhao, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina,
 where rural unions are best organized and most active.
 A number of prominent labor and peasant leaders were killed in
 199G. In January Ricardo Jose dos Santos, a rural leader and
 councilman, was killed in Inhapi, Alagoas state, and Jose
 Brito, a rubber tapper, was killed in Xapuri, Acre. In April
 Raimundo Nonato Sousa, a rural labor leader was killed in Mato
 Grosso do Sul, and Wanderlin Torres Pinheiro, an attorney
 involved in defending members of the landless movement, was
 killed in Nova Xavantina, Mato Grosso. In that same month,
 Jose Canuto de Oliveira and his brother, Paulo Canuto de
 Oliveira, members of the Rural Trade Union of Rio Maria, were
 both killed, while a third brother, Orlando Canuto de
 Oliveira, was wounded and managed to escape. In May Ezequiel
 Alves Ramos, a labor leader, was killed in Tailandia, Para.
 In July Macuxi Indians Mario Davis and Dakiao Mendes, both
 involved in defending Indian land from invaders, were shot
 near Boa Vista, Roraima   Human rights groups charge that
 landowners are responsible for these crimes
 Shootings, beatings and death threats by iandowners and hired
 thugs against advocates for the landless were common. A rural
 trade union leader, Antonio Ednulo Costa was shot and injured

 BRAZIL
 in Quixeramobim, Ceara. Clergy involved in the landless
 movement such as Dom Pedro Casaldaliga of Sao Felix do
 Araguaia, Mato Grosso, and Padre Ricardo Rezende of Rio Maria,
 Para, as well as union leaders such as Osmarino Amancio
 Rodrigues, leader of the rubber tappers union in Xapuri, Acre,
 routinely receive death threats. The December 1989 killing of
 Padre Gabriel Marie, a French priest involved in the urban
 landless movement, has not been solved. However, the accused
 murderers of union organizer and environmentalist Francisco
 "Chico" Mendes Filho were convicted and sentenced in December
 to 19 years in prison. Earlier, in June, one of the
 defendants in the Chico Mendes trial was also convicted of the
 attempted murder in 1988 of two rubber tappers in Acre state
 and received a 12-year prison sentence.
 The Brazilian Institute of Renewable Natural Resources, the
 Government's environmental agency, published a report in 1990
 citing-several incidents of harassment, threats, beatings, and
 murder of Brazilian government and independent
 environmentalists. Chico Mendes' widow and other rubber
 tapper leaders continued to receive death threats and were the
 targets of assassination attempts, apparently by persons
 acting on behalf of large landowners.
 The rate of violent crime in the major urban centers continued
 to rise during 1990. Vigilante actions to control this crime
 were cited as a major problem by the AI report and by most
 human rights groups in Brazil. Vigilante groups, often
 composed of policemen and hired gunmen, engaged in widespread
 killings of alleged or suspected criminals in working-class
 neighborhoods and shantytowns. An estimated 300 such
 killings, or 20 to 30 percent of all registered homicides,
 occurred in greater Sao Paulo during the first 8 months of
 1990. In Rio, as many as 25 percent of homicides are
 committed by vigilantes. Often the corpses showed signs of
 torture or other brutality. In September in Novo Friburgo,
 Rio de Janeiro state, three policemen received long prison
 sentences for the murders of five youths, and 1 month later
 four other policemen received a total of 77 years' imprisonment
 for the torture deaths of two other youths. In November there
 was a conviction of a former security guard for the murder of
 Sebastiao Lan, a union leader killed in 1988.
 Human rights groups and the international media have detailed
 several cases in which street children were killed by police
 death squads or thugs hired by businessmen. In September AI
 published a report denouncing the deaths of more than 1,000
 children by such killers in the previous 5 years. The report
 charged that death squads, some of them operated secretly by
 the police, were killing children to "clean up the streets."
 According to the Brazilian Institute for Social and Economic
 Analysis, 457 young people were killed in 1989 in Brazil's
 three largest cities; about half of the killings appeared to
 be the work of death squads, and most of the victims were
 black, male, and poor. President Collor said that he was
 "appalled" by the reports and ordered the Ministry of Justice
 to investigate all reports of violence against children. The
 Government also initiated several social and educational
 programs for minors. A Statute for the Child and Adolescent,
 which went into effect on October 16, is designed to improve
 the legal protection of minors.
 Government reformers confront several obstacles in their
 efforts to prevent extrajudicial killings, including
 opposition by senior police officials and public apathy.
 
 
 BRAZIL
 According to local human rights sources, Brazilian citizens do
 not report many extrajudicial killings by police because the
 police tend to protect their own during internal .
 investigations of such killings. The high crime rate, the
 failure to apprehend most criminals, the slowness of the
 judicial system, and the legal requirement to release
 criminals pending trial also contribute to public acquiescence
 in police brutality and extrajudicial killings of criminal
 suspects. Investigations into these incidents are hampered
 because witnesses hesitate to cooperate with authorities for
 fear of retribution or because they and the general public
 sympathize with the actions of vigilantes. Nevertheless, the
 Rio de Janeiro state uniformed police commander reported in
 April that more than 700 uniformed policemen were dismissed in
 the previous 3 years because of brutality and other abuses,
 although only 18 of these officers were criminally indicted
 and only 3 were convicted.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions in
 1990. There were, however, several reports of disappearances
 of persons purportedly involved in common crimes, which
 appeared to be the result of vigilante action.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, which contains
 severe legal penalties for torture and acquiescence in
 torture. However, while some human rights groups have noted a
 reduction in reports of police brutality, there continued to
 be many credible reports of widespread police beatings and
 torture of criminal suspects and landless peasants to extract
 information, confessions, or money, and sometimes to punish.
 Human rights groups in Sao Paulo state that from the time of
 arrest through incarceration police officials show no respect
 for prisoners' rights and view beating and torture as
 legitimate methods of dealing with alleged criminals.
 Most prison facilities are poorly maintained and severely
 overcrowded. Some inmates are kept after the expiration of
 their sentences due to poor record keeping. Torture and
 beating of inmates by guards occurs, and the victims have
 little effective recourse. Facilities housing minor children
 accused of crimes or of vagrancy offer conditions that often
 are no better than those of adult penal institutions. The
 February 1989 case against police officials in Sao Paulo who
 were involved in the suffocation deaths of 18 inmates had not
 been brought to trial by the end of 1990.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution limits arrests to those caught committing a
 crime or those arrested by order of a judicial authority,
 except in cases of soldiers charged with violating military
 rules and regulations or with military crimes as defined by
 law. The constitutional provision for judicial determination
 of the legality of detention is respected.
 In addition to the circumstances cited above, the law permits
 provisional detention for up to 5 days in certain
 circumstances stipulated by law during a police investigation
 or during the prosecution phase of a case. This period may be
 extended until the case comes to trial or until a judge rules
 
 
 528
 BRAZIL
 that reasons for the detention no longer exist. Provisional
 detention is used infrequently.
 In 1990 there were several cases -of illegal and incommunicado
 detention without a judicial order, as well as allegations of
 arbitrary detention of squatters during evictions. Human
 rights groups charge that police detained people, including
 street youths and children, for questioning without probable
 cause, in some cases based on race, vagrancy, or- other
 arbitrary criteria. A goal of the Government's Statute of the
 Child and Adolescent is to improve the observance of the
 rights of children, especially in protecting them against
 arbitrary police detention and other abuses.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is an independent branch of government. The
 judicial system, with the Federal Supreme Court at its apex,
 includes courts of first instance and appeals courts. The
 states organize their own judicial systems but must adhere to
 the basic principles in the Federal Constitution. Brazil also
 has a system of specialized courts dealing with military,
 labor, electoral, juvenile, family, and narcotics matters,
 among others. Under the Constitution, military courts do not
 have jurisdiction over civilians.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and is
 respected in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel and
 must be made fully aware of the charges against them. In
 cases in which a defendant cannot afford an attorney, one must
 be provided at public expense; private attorneys are appointed
 by courts to represent poor defendants when public defenders
 are unavailable. Defendants and their attorneys have the
 right to be informed of the evidence on which charges are
 based. Only cases of willful crimes against life are tried by
 jury; all others are tried by a judge.
 The judicial system continues-to have a serious backlog, and
 many cases are not tried for years. Lynchings of suspected
 criminals by irate citizens, arising primarily out of public
 rage against crime levels and a perceived failure of the
 judicial system to mete out justice, continued to attract
 press coverage in 1990; several human rights sources believe
 there are many more lynchings than are reported.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion
 into the home. There were no reports of illegal entry for
 political reasons, but illegal entry into homes without a
 warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects. Wiretaps
 are unconstitutional except for purposes of criminal
 investigation and prosecution, and then only when authorized
 by a judicial authority in circumstances defined by law. The
 inviolability of private correspondence is respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to free speech and to a free press is provided for
 in the Constitution and is broadly exercised. The press and
 broadcast media routinely discuss controversial social and
 political issues, with opposition viewpoints aired freely.
 
 
 529
 BRAZIL
 Most radio and television stations are privately owned, but
 the Government, through Congress, controls licensing
 authority. Newspapers are also privately owned and are
 vigorous in reporting and commenting on government policies
 and performance. Some media sources privately charge that
 self-censorship is still exercised by many media organizations
 to avoid offending major governmental advertisers and
 creditors, including federal, state, and local governments and
 government-influenced banks. There were a few threats against
 newspapers and journalists, but all cases were resolved during
 the year.
 The 1988 Constitution abolished all forms of censorship.
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil; prior
 review of films, plays, and radio and television programming
 is practiced only to determine an acceptable viewing age.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to assemble
 peacefully, and this right is respected in practice. Permits
 are not required for outdoor political or labor meetings, and
 they occur throughout Brazil with frequency. However, such
 assemblies may not disturb another meeting previously
 scheduled for the same place, and prior written notification
 to government authorities is required.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored or state religion. Most Brazilians belong
 to the Roman Catholic Church, but spiritism has many
 adherents, and Protestantism has been expanding in recent
 years. All faiths are free to establish places of worship,
 train clergy, and proselytize, although the Government
 reserves the right to control entry into Indian lands. The
 National Council of Brazilian Bishops and various missionary
 groups continue to complain-that visas for missionaries and
 other foreign religious personnel are systematically delayed
 by immigration authorities. Many Catholic missionary and
 other religious denominations that were expelled from the
 Yanomami Indian areas in 1988 were allowed to return in 1990
 to assist the Federal Government in administering an emergency
 health plan.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, except
 for the protected Indian areas, nor are there any restrictions
 on emigration or return. Brazil admits few immigrants, does
 not formally accept refugees for resettlement, and is
 selective in granting asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change
 their government through free elections, a right that was
 exercised in a free and fair 1989 presidential election.
 Brazil returned to democratic rule in March 1985, with the
 inauguration of a civilian president after 21 years of
 military governments. Executive and legislative offices
 throughout the country at local, state, and national levels
 are filled through fair and democratic direct elections among
 candidates representing many political parties. Elections for
 
 
 530
 BRAZIL
 state governors and state and federal legislatures were held
 in the fall of 1990.
 Voting is secret and mandatory for all literate Brazilian
 citizens aged 18 to 70, except military conscripts who may not
 vote. It is voluntary for minors aged 16 to 18, for the
 illiterate, and for those 70 and over. Women have full
 political rights under the Constitution, and they are
 increasingly active in politics and government.- Indians were
 given the franchise under the 1988 Constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A number of Brazilian nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)
 actively investigate allegations of human rights violations
 and often initiate legal proceedings. Several international
 NGO's either maintain offices in Brazil or visit
 periodically. Both Brazilian and foreign human rights
 organizations report that elements of the Federal Government
 have been more responsive to human rights investigations, as
 have some state governments. Brazilian human rights groups
 previously concerned with political repression have turned
 their attention to problems involving Indians, police
 brutality, poor prison conditions, urban vigilante groups, the
 plight of abandoned street children, and rural violence.
 In 1990 President Collor promised to make respect for human
 rights one of the Government's priorities. He has made high
 profile commitments to investigating specific abuses, such as
 ordering the investigation of violence against street children
 (see Section l.c.) and has met with human rights groups. Some
 human rights groups reported that state officials appeared to
 have taken President Collor's lead and were more willing to
 meet and discuss human rights concerns.-
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and
 nationality is unconstitutional, and racial discrimination
 --illegal since 1951--is a crime excluded from bail. However,
 de facto racial discrimination exists widely in Brazil, and
 polls show most Brazilians believe that poor, uneducated, and
 darker-skinned Brazilians encounter substantial discrimination.
 The vast majority of the black population is disproportionately
 concentrated in the lowest economic strata, a reflection of
 history and cultural attitudes. For example, while 40 to 60
 percent of Brazil's population is of African or other non-
 European ancestry, few senior officials in the Government and
 few, if any, above the rank of colonel in the armed forces are
 black. Similarly, there are relatively few blacks in senior
 private sector management positions. In 1990 blacks were
 elected governors of three of Braiil's states.
 In 1990, Veja, a Brazilian magazine, published a poll that
 showed that blacks earn 40 percent less than whites in the
 same professions. Black consciousness organizations,
 generally lacking in political influence, challenge the view
 that Brazil is a racial democracy and denounce discrimination
 in housing, education, the workplace, and society at large.
 These organizations complain that blacks are more likely to be
 stopped by police and deprived of their civil rights, and that
 they bear the brunt of police brutality.
 
 
 531
 BRAZIL
 Since the 1988 centennial of Brazil's abolition of slavery,
 black consciousness organizations have been unable to sustain
 broad public interest in the problem of discrimination. In
 1990 black leaders led a movement to challenge the Brazilian
 census system of dividing the population into white, black,
 and mulatto. They seek to limit the categories to only white
 and nonwhite.
 The Constitution specifically addresses the issue of women's
 rights, prohibiting discrimination in employment or salaries
 as well as providing for 120 days of paid maternity leave.
 However, the provision against wage discrimination is rarely
 enforced, and, as a reaction against the maternity leave law,
 some employers reportedly seek sterilization certificates from
 prospective employees or try to fire or avoid hiring women in
 their childbearing years.
 There is a high incidence of physical abuse of women in
 Brazil. Men who commit crimes of passion against women, such
 as assault and even murder, are rarely brought to trial.' The
 women's police precinct in Sao Luis, Maranhao, reported that
 of the over 4,000 complaints registered by women during the
 period 1988-1990, only 300 were forwarded for processing in
 court, and only 2 men were convicted and sent to prison.
 Although there is still a strong cultural bias against the
 filing of complaints by victims of abuse or their families,
 officials note that women are now more willing to make
 official complaints. Special women's police precincts in more
 than 12 major cities now exist. These centers provide
 shelter, assist in bringing actions against offenders, and
 provide general information on women's health.
 Women's organizations, estimated to number 8,000, have been
 active in promoting women's rights and lobbying the Government
 in such areas as combating violence against women, respecting
 the constitutional rights of women, and promoting sensitivity
 to women's issues through courses and seminars, including
 courses for local police. Women's groups are active in
 politics, staging demonstrations and protests to improve
 working conditions and to end discrimination in the workplace.
 The Constitution gives Indians the exclusive use of the riches
 in the soil, rivers, and lakes located on their lands. The
 Federal Government also has the responsibility to demarcate
 and protect Indian lands. The Federal Government has the
 power to exploit Indian lands, but the Indians must receive a
 share of the proceeds from any such exploitation. Brazilian
 Indians may bring suits in court to defend their rights and
 interests, and in such suits they are to be assisted by a
 public prosecutor. In 1989 federal courts initiated two
 actions on behalf of Indians, one calling for the removal of
 miners in Yanomami lands in Roraima and the second demanding
 the revocation of the presidential decree creating a national
 forest in Yanomami lands. As of late 1990, neither of these
 court orders had been fully carried out.
 Indian leaders charge that the Government has systematically
 ignored their needs and promoted settlement or development
 projects at their expense, and that it has used pressure and
 legal subterfuges to avoid the demarcation of traditional
 Indian lands, as required under the 1973 Indian Statute and
 the Constitution. They criticize the Federal Government's
 decision to establish national forests in Indian areas because
 such lands then become more susceptible to colonization and
 economic exploitation by prospectors and other non-Indians.
 
 
 532
 BRAZIL
 Indian groups claim that the federal and state governments are
 more concerned about exploiting mineral and other natural
 resources than attending to the needs and rights of Indians.
 Despite the Government's responsibility under the Constitution
 and the 1973 Indian Statute to protect the indigenous
 population, Indians continue to receive inadequate
 assistance. According to a July 1990 report prepared by a
 citizens' action committee made up of members of Congress,
 attorneys, and human rights activists, the Yanomami Indians
 continue to die in disproportionate numbers because of disease
 and other factors associated with the colonization of nearby
 lands and the influx of miners. According to the National
 Foundation for the Indians (FUNAI), the Committee for the
 Creation of Yanomami Park (CCPY), and other Indian groups,
 several hundred Yanomami probably died in 1990 due to these
 factors. In January 1990, the Federal Government launched an
 emergency medical treatment program for the Yanomami Indians
 and attempted to remove miners located illegally on Indian
 lands. The plan had only limited success due to insufficient
 funding and because conflicting laws had been enacted, e.g.,
 the creation of mining reserves on Yanomami lands made the
 removal of the miners difficult. A later program by the
 Government to destroy illegal airstrips built by miners on
 Yanomami lands was thwarted by the ability of the miners to
 repair them quickly.
 In 1990 violence associated with land disputes between Indian
 tribes and non-Indian settlers increased. According to
 government and other. human rights sources, two Macuxi Indians
 were killed in July in a land conflict in Roraima. In
 September two Yanomamis and four miners were killed when
 miners illegally entered the home of a Yanomami. In another
 incident, a 12-year-old Yanomami was shot and critically
 wounded by miners in Roraima.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Brazil's labor code has long provided for union representation
 of all Brazilian workers. The law imposed a hierarchical,
 unitary system known as "unicidade," which prohibited multiple
 unions of the same professional category in a given geographic
 area  It also stipulated that no union's geographic base
 could be smaller than a municipality. Workers in a union
 whose numbers increased <as when an industry grew) could
 petition the state to split a preexisting union into two or
 more unions. The 1988 Constitution retains both "unicidade"
 and the requirement that no union's geographic base may be
 smaller than a municipality, but it frees workers to organize
 new unions out of old ones without prior authorization from
 government authorities.
 The decision to retain "unicidade" drew opposition both from
 elements of Brazil's labor movement and from the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). In practice,
 however, "unicidade" has proven more formal than real, as
 hundreds of new unions have sprung up across Brazil and
 compete, in many cases, with unions and federations. that had
 already-enjoyed official "recognition." The sole bureaucratic
 requirement for new unions is to register with the Ministry of
 Labor and Social Security which, by judicial decision, is
 bound to receive and record their registration. The new
 Congress elected in October was expected to consider proposed
 
 
 533
 BRAZIL
 legislation that would clarify how the representation question
 is to be resolved when two or more labor entities purport to
 speak for the same groups of workers.
 Organized labor actively participated in the drafting and
 approval of the Constitution during 1987-88. Reacting against
 labor code provisions that made most work stoppages "illegal,"
 the unions lobbied successfully for a constitutional provision
 of the right to strike. Enabling legislation passed in June
 1989 stipulates that essential services remain in operation
 during a strike and that workers notify employers at least 48
 hours before beginning a walkout. The Constitution prohibits
 government interference in labor unions but provides that
 "abuse" of the right to strike (such as not maintaining
 essential services or giving advance notice, denying workers
 not on strike access to their jobs, damaging property) will be
 punishable under the law. During the year, there were several
 strikes in the steel, oil, and banking industries, including a
 violent 50-day strike against automobile manufacturer
 Autolatina.
 Landmark decisions by the Supreme Labor Tribunal (TST) in the
 cases of striking steelworkers at the National Steel Company
 (CSN) in Volta Redonda in July and of electrical workers
 nationwide in August defined what "abuse" would mean in
 practice. In the CSN case the court ruled that, in addition
 to the strikers' procedural violations, it was "abusive" for
 the union to demand exorbitant wage increases from a company
 on the verge of bankruptcy. The TST thereby gave CSN the
 right to deduct wages from strikers for days not worked or to
 fire them. The TST ruling in the electrical workers' case
 found that the strike was abusive because of the failure to
 provide an essential service (electric power) steadily
 throughout the strike, and because the strike occurred months
 before the contract renewal date. Unions reacted to these
 decisions by claiming that the labor courts had turned against
 them and had become instruments of the Government's economic
 austerity plan. The court maintained that it was simply
 interpreting the law.
 Although Brazilian laws do not make any provision for a
 central labor organization, three such groups have emerged--
 the General Workers Central (CGT), the Sole Workers Central
 (CUT), and the Independent Workers Union (USI). The centrals
 do not have legal standing to represent professional
 categories of workers and have been created in Brazil as
 nonprofit civil associations. In September the Government
 abolished the compulsory labor tax which, for almost 50 years,
 had required all Brazilian workers to contribute a day's pay
 per year. Proceeds went to unions, federations, national
 confederations, and to the Labor Ministry.
 Provisions in the founding charters of the two major labor
 centrals, the CGT and the CUT, both mandate cooperation with
 all international labor organizations and affiliation with
 none. Following an April 1989 congress, however, new CGT
 leaders applied for affiliation with the ICFTU. In March
 1990, an ICFTU factfinding delegation visited Brazil and
 decided that more time was needed before acting on the CGT's
 request. The CGT promised to cooperate with the ICFTU and
 looked forward to possible affiliation in 1991, the same year
 in which a CUT national congress is expected to review that
 central's position on affiliation.
 
 
 534
 BRAZIL
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize is provided for by the Constitution, and
 trade unions are legally mandated to represent workers. The
 Government has encouraged labor and management to resolve
 differences through collective bargaining, which has become
 commonplace. Nevertheless, a system of labor courts continues
 to exercise normative powers with regard to the settlement of
 labor disputes, thereby discouraging direct negotiation.
 Existing law charges these same courts (as well as personnel
 linked to the Federal Labor Ministry) with mediation
 responsibility in the preliminary stages of dispute
 settlement. On the other hand, arbitration by neutral,
 professional third parties is unknown.
 The Constitution also incorporates a provision from the labor
 code that prohibits the dismissal of employees who are
 candidates for union leadership positions from the date of the
 registration of candidacy until 1 year after the termination
 of their mandates, if elected, except in the case of serious
 misdeeds, as defined by law. However, laws protecting union
 members from discrimination are erratically enforced.
 Several prominent labor leaders were killed in 1990, probably
 by hired thugs and police working in cooperation with powerful
 landowners (see Section l.a.).
 Labor law applies uniformly throughout Brazil, including the
 free trade zones and export processing zones. In the Manaus
 Industrial Zone--Brazil's only functioning trade zone--unions
 function, go on strike, and collective bargaining takes
 place. However, the unions in the Manaus zone are relatively
 weaker vis-a-vis industry as compared to unions in the major
 industrial cities in the southeast of Brazil.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While the Constitution prohibits forced labor, there have been
 repeated credible charges that it is utilized in Brazil,
 despite federal government assertions that it is taking steps
 to halt the practice and prosecute perpetrators. In 1990 the
 CPT (see Section l.a.) again denounced specific labor
 contractors in certain northeastern and Amazon states for
 maintaining "slave" work forces. The CPT charged that these
 contractors deducted transportation and other inflated
 expenses from the workers' meager salaries and employed armed
 guards to prevent the "indebted" workers from leaving. The
 CPT complained that state and federal authorities have not
 promptly investigated reports of compulsory labor. The
 International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts
 noted in 1990 that the Government, which is a signatory of ILO
 Convention 29 on forced labor, has stepped up labor
 inspections with a view to eliminating all forms of slave
 labor in rural areas.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age under the Constitution is 14, except
 for apprentices, and legal restrictions have been approved to
 protect working minors under age 18. By law, the permission
 of parents or guardians is required for minors to work, and
 provision must be made for them to attend school through the
 primary grades. All minors are barred from night work and
 from work that constitutes a physical strain. Minors are also
 prohibited from employment in unhealthful, dangerous, or

 morally harmful conditions. However, approximately 34 percent
 of all children between the ages of 10 and 14 are working.
 Many, perhaps most, of these working minors are working in
 violation of the law, but accurate statistics are not
 available. Enforcement of these laws is severely limited
 because the Ministry of Labor and Social Security--the
 responsible agency--lacks sufficient resources and accepts a
 general attitude that it is better for these minors to be
 working than to be involved in street crime.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Organized labor demonstrated growing political strength by
 lobbying for and achieving the adoption of significant
 provisions in the 1988 Constitution. A workweek limit was set
 at 44 hours, pay benefits were expanded, and new protections
 were established for agricultural and domestic workers.
 Several of these provisions were conditioned on the passage of
 complementary enabling legislation that proved difficult to
 enact. With the threat of hyperinflation looming, the newly
 inaugurated administration enacted severe economic reform
 measures in mid-March that resulted in complete deindexation
 of wages. Worker purchasing power dropped farther, leaving
 Brazil's 50-year-old minimum wage at an historically low
 level. It is estimated that some 40 percent of those
 economically active, including minors, earn no more than the
 equivalent of one monthly salary at the minimum wage level per
 month. At mid-year, this figure fell just short of $70 (at
 the official exchange rate), which is not sufficient to
 provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 Many Brazilian workers also suffer from unsafe working
 environments. The National Institute for Social Security
 (INSS), a subdivision of the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Security, oversees occupational health and safety. If a
 worker has a problem in the workplace and has trouble getting
 relief directly from his employer, he can file a claim with
 the regional labor court. Labor Ministry figures indicate
 that Brazil ranks first worldwide in the rate of workplace
 accidents. According to the most recent figures gathered by
 the Government's Social Security system in 1987, 17
 workplace-related fatalities occur daily across the country.
 As these figures measure only those incidents involving
 covered workers (some 23 million), they undoubtedly understate
 the extent of the problem (the total work force exceeds 50
 million). There are no reliable statistics available covering
 the incidence of job-related injuries and illness. Unofficial
 estimates, however, link as much as 80 percent of social
 security system payments to workplace factors.
