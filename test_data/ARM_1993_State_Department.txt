 ARMENIA
 Since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia has been
 striving to create a democratic, multiparty republic with a parliamentary system of
 government. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament whose members were
 chosen in 1990 elections, which, in spite of being conducted under Soviet procedures,
 proved relatively free. However, Parliament's continued inability to adopt a new
 constitution has inhibited political and economic reform. Levon Ter-Petrosyan was
 elected President in free and fair, multicandidate elections in 1991. The President
 appoints the Prime Minister, who presides over the Government. Armenia's judici-
 ary is not fully independent of the other branches of government.
 The police are responsible for maintaining order throughout the country and are
 generally subordinate to governmental authority. Like its predecessor, the Commit-
 tee for State Security or KGB, the State Directorate for National Security of the Re-
 public of Armenia is responsible for combating both external and internal threats.
 The ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, an overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian
 enclave within Azerbaijan, has been the most serious territorial dispute in the
 former Soviet Union in terms of casualties and suffering. Since 1988 when the en-
 clave voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia, thousands have died, thou-
 sands more have been injured, and hundreds of thousands made refugees. Armenian
 support for the separatists has led to a crippling Azerbaijani economic embargo
 which strangles landlocked Armenia.
 The conflict itself, the attendant Azerbaijani and Turkish embargoes, and chaos
 in Georgia have exacerbated the Armenian economic crisis produced by the breakup
 of the Soviet Union. Industrial production continued to decline from its already
 minimal 1992 level, although at a slower rate during 1993. Unemployment and in-
 flation rates remained very high. Electricity and fuels continued to be in critically
 short supply, and the health of large segments of the population, particularly the
 very old and the very young, was significantly affected by the difficult living condi-
 tions. The Government has privatized agricultural holdings and is moving to pri-
 vatize the distribution sector, but most other segments of the economy remain under
 state ownership.
 In the absence of a new constitution and the full panoply of laws protecting
 human rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by
 Parliament's 1991 resolution as the supreme law of the land, aims to ensure the
 p..tection of human rights. Armenia also relies on parts of the Soviet Constitution.
 Within this framework Armenia generally respects human rights, although there
 were several reports ot police brutality during the year. The press is free, and a
 wide spectrum of viewpoints is represented. Citizens are free to conduct public
 meetings and demonstrations. The Soviet-era criminal code, however, is still in force
 and allows suspects to be detained for up to 72 hours without charge; and judges
 do not appear to be sufficiently insulated from political pressure. The law on religion
 forbids proselytizing and appears to place restrictions on the kinds of religious orga-
 nizations that may be officially registered. Although citizens are free to emigrate,

 Armenians must still have official invitations if they wish to obtain a passport for
 travel abroad. After the flight of almost all Azeri inhabitants of Armenia to Azer-
 baijan, Armenia's remaining national minorities do not appear to suffer discrimina-
 tion. Deeply ingrained attitudes ensure that women are frequently the objects of dis-
 crimination. Appreciation of the rights of the handicapped remains very rudi-
 mentary.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political or other extrajudicial
 killings are known to have occurred in 1993. However, at least one person died
 while in official custody during the year. The trial of the policemen involved was
 under way at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-No abductions by government or other forces are known to
 have been committed. Hostage-taking by both parties to the Nagorno-Karabakh con-
 flict continues (see the Azerbaijan country report).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In 1993 seven members of Armenia's police forces were officially charged with bru-
 tality. The number of actual beatings or instances of mistreatment may be higher.
 Allegations of police brutality are investigated by the procurator's (attorney gen-
 eral s) office. If investigation reveals evidence to support the allegations, and if there
 is a serious violation of the law, criminal charges are filed. Less serious cases are
 referred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for administrative action. Information on
 prison conditions was not available, but they are believed to be harsh.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Parliament has yet to pass a law on judi-
 cial reform, although a proposal is under consideration. According to the Armenian
 Criminal Code, much of which dates from the Soviet era, suspects may be held with-
 out charge for up to 72 hours. A suspect has the right to be represented by a lawyer,
 and the police must notify the suspect's relatives if requested. After arrest, the sus-
 pect may be jailed for up to 3 months until completion of the investigation, or up
 to 9 months by special order of the procurator. If no charges have been filed after
 9 months, the suspect must be released. There is no provision for bail or for trial
 by jury in Armenian law. Once criminal or civil charges have been filed, the case
 should by law go to trial within 1 month. In practice,due to current difficult condi-
 tions in Armenia, the deadline is often not met.
 In July the former Minister of Civil Aviation and his deputies, who in 1992 had
 allegedly been arbitrarily detained, were released on their own recognizance pend-
 AlVthough the Soviet-era Criminal Code, which allows for the exile of citizens
 under certain circumstances, remains in effect, no one has been exiled since Arme-
 nia became independent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The court system in Armenia comprises a number
 of district courts, a Supreme Court, and a military tribunal. District courts try the
 overwhelming majority of cases. The Ministry of Internal Affairs continues to con-
 duct preliminary investigationsof criminal cases. The Soviet-era Criminal Code and
 procedures still obtain in Armenia.
 The Supreme Court is divided into three separate sections. The first tries espe-
 cially serious cases (murder, rape, and all crimes committed by high-level officials).
 The Presidium of the Supreme Court reviews all cases tried by the first section and
 provides final rulings on any contested verdicts. The second, civil law section hears
 lawsuits, civil appeals, and commercial suits. The third, appellate section of the Su-
 preme Court reviews district court verdicts. The Ministry of Justice nominates Su-
 reme Court judges, whose candidacies are vetted by a panel of their peers before
 eing forwarded to Parliament for approval. Presiding district court judges were
 elected to a 5-year term in 1986. Their tenures have been extended pending the
 adoption of a new constitution. Neither group as yet functions fully independently
 from the other branches of government.
 The military tribunal operates essentially as it did in the Soviet era. A military
 procurator performs the same functions as his civilian counterpart, operating in ac-
 cordance with the Soviet-era legal code.
 Trials are public except when government secrets are at issue. Defendants are re-
 quired to attend their trials unless they have been accused of a minor crime not
 punishable by imprisonment. They may confront witnesses and present evidence.
 Te court appoints an attorney for any defendant who needs one. Defendants have
 the right of appeal.
 There are no known political prisoners in Armenia.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Apart
 from the provisions of the International Covenant, there is no legal protection for
 the privacy of citizens, their communications, and their correspondence. Proce-
 durally, the Directorate of National Security must petition the procurator's office for
 permission to tap a phone or intercept correspondence. The procurator's office pur-
 portedly must find a compelling need for the wiretap before it will grant the agency
 permission to proceed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law on information provides for freedom of
 speech and press. These freedoms were widely exercised.
 The press is generally free and contains a wide variety of political opinion and
 criticism of the Government. All publications must register with the Ministry of Jus-
 tice and state their general subject matter. The Ministry of Justice is required to
 act on a publication's application for registration within 1 month of its receipt.
 There is no prepublication censorship. However, the Government reportedly sup-
 plies all mass media editors with a list of forbidden subjects. It comprises sensitive
 military information in categories such as the draft and army recruitment, informa-
 tion on military structure, civil defense arrangements, finance, communications,
 transport, and science and technology. There were no known prosecutions in 1993
 for violations of this injunction. In an unsettling development, the Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs in November banned correspondents from three opposition media or-
 gans from attending any briefings and meetings sponsored by the Ministry.
 Shortages of paper, fuel, electricity, and other supplies sometimes delayed or re-
 vented the publication or distribution of the print media. There is no indication that
 the Government uses such problems to control or influence the media.
 Broadcasting is entirely controlled by the Government. There are no independent
 radio or television stations, although there are several small independent cable tele-
 vision companies. Several independent radio stations were allotted frequencies and
 are awaiting equipment and final approval from the Ministry of Communications
 before they begin broadcasting.
 Each week, the government broadcaster provided a total of 15 minutes of tele-
 vision air time for all oposition political parties. The state radio company estab-
 lished a similar system. Representatives of opposition parties also appeared regu-
 larly o   in n progr            s. A shortage of electricity limted broadcast
 time for Armenian television to about 5 hours per day.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-In the absence of an Armenian
 law, freedom of peaceful assembly and association is provided for by the Inter-
 national Covenant. Public demonstrations, meetings, and marches occurred fre-
 quently in 1993, without any appaer intedenc by the authorities. The Sviet-
 era law on meetings remains valid and requires those wishing to stage marches or
 demonstrations to obtain a permit from the regional executive committee. The proce-
 dure for obtaining a permit is not onerous, and there were no instances of its arbi-
 trary use.
 The Ministry of Justice registers social and political organizations, but the Gov-
 ernment does not attempt to control the opposition through the registration process.
 Many political parties have been registered, and in 1993 the Ministry of Justice reg-
 istered the three organizations that applied.
 c. Freedom of Reliion.-The 1991 law on religious organizations provides for free-
 dom of conscience and the right to profess ones faith, but there are some restric-
 tions on religious freedom. The law forbids proselytizing and refuses registration to
 organizations whose doctrine is not based on "historically recognized holy scrip-
 tures.' It also requires that petitioning organizations "be free from materialism and
 of a purely spiritual nature" before they may be registered. It establishes the sepa-
 ration of church and state but recognizes the Armenian Apostolic Church, to which
 over 80 percent of the population at least nominally belongs, as the dominant de-
 nomination. A religious organization refused registration cannot publish a news-
 paper or magazine, rent a hallo other meetinghlace, have its own program on tele-
 vision or radio, or officially sponsor the visas of visitors to Armenia.
 The 1991 law was supplemented on December 22 with a presidential decree on
 religious activities which appears to further strengthen the position of the Armenian
 Apostolic Church. The decree enjoins the Council on Religious Affairs to investigat
 the activities of the representatives of registered religious organizations and to ban
 missionaries who engage in activities contrary to their status. It is not yet possible
 to gauge what effect the enforcement of the decree may have on the exercise of free-
 dom of religion in Armenia.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Counti, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict internal or international travel for
 
 
 783
 political reasons. Travel passports are still withheld, however, from Armenians lack-
 ing invitations from the country that they wish to visit, from those possessing state
 secrets, and from those whose relatives have made financial claims against them.
 The Soviet-era Office of Visas and Registrations (OVIR) continues to impede travel
 and emigration through delays and the creation of various bureaucratic obstacles.
 Some 200,000 people, virtually the entire ethnic Azeri population of Armenia prior
 to independence, remain refugees in Azerbaijan. After the 1988-89 anti-Armenian
 ogroms in Azerbaijan  onnected with the   onflict over control of Nagorno-
 Karabakh, these pople were subjected to discrimination and intimidation, often ac-
 companied by violence intended to drive them from the country. Many were forcibly
 deported and the rest fled. It is unclear but increasingly unlikely that these people
 will be able to return, as is also the case for the nearly 400,000 Armenian refugees
 who fled Azerbaijan after the pogroms.
 The Government does not in any way actively hinder emigration. Members of Ar-
 menia's small Jewish and Greek communities continued during 1993 to emigrate at
 a rapid rate.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although democracy is not yet firmly established in Armenia, citizens have exer-
 cised their right to change their government peacefully. The 1990 parliamentary
 elections were relatively free in spite of being conducted according to Soviet election
 procedures. The Armenian National Movement (ANM) defeated the Communist
 Party. As Parliament began to function, its members affiliated themselves with new
 parties being formed. At present, 12 parties and associations are represented in Par-
 iament, andmany others dot the political landscape. The ANM, which supports the
 President, does not have a majority of deputies in Parliament. Because o" frequent
 defections and splits, the relative strength of the other parties in the legislature var-
 ies.
 In 1991 the Armenian electorate chose Levon Ter-Petrosyan as its President in
 a multicandidate election. By law, members of the executive branch, including the
 President himself, may not belong to any political party. The next parliamentary
 and presidential elections are now scheduled for 1995. They may be called earlier
 if a new constitution is ratified.
 In the absence of a new constitution, the Government's legitimacy rests on the
 1990 law on the Presidency and the 1991 law on Parliament. The law on Parliament
 established a multiparty system. The large number of seats won by those occupying
 full-time jobs in local government offices around the country and Armenia's eco-
 nomic problems have frequently made it difficult to muster a quorum and have cor-
 respondingly limited the effectiveness of Parliament. In an effort to enhance inter-
 party comity and increase efficiency, the President has frequently induced members
 of other parties to serve in his Government.
 Largely due to traditional social attitudes, women play a very limited role in gov-
 ernment and politics. The Minister of the Environment is the highest ranking
 woman in government, and there are several women serving as mayors and Mem-
 bers of Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several fledgling human rights organizations in Armenia. The Govern-
 ment does not impede investigations, by either domestic or international human
 rights organizations, into alleged charges of human rights abuse.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination is prohibited by the International Covenant. Since independence,
 laws have been passed to protect against discrimination based on religion or ]an-
 guage. Armenia signed the Convention on the Protection of Women from All Kinds
 of Discrimination on June 9, 1993.
 Women.-Armenia remains a male-dominated society. Women are typically ex-
 eted to do the housework and raise the family even if they have a full-time job.
 In he workplace, they are generally not afforded the opportunities for training and
 advancement given to men. The 1992 law on employment does, however, prohibit
 discrimination in employment. The extremely high unemployment rate makes it dif-
 ficult to gauge how effectively the law has been implemented to prevent discrimina-
 tion.
 In the first quarter of 1993, only six rape cases were tried by Armenian courts.
 It is virtually certain that many more incidents go unreported. In 1993 not one
 charge of spouse abuse was filed or tried by a court in Armenia.
 
 
 Children.-Armenia signed the Convention on Children's Rights on June 1, 1992.
 The Government has taken steps to insulate large families (four children or more)
 from Armenia's current diflicult economic circumstances and foreign humanitarian
 aid programs have been similarly targeted at large famiies. Armenia does not have
 the means, in the current straitened economic environment, to provide fully for the
 welfare of children.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-No laws have been passed since independ-
 ence to protect against discrimination based on race or social status. The small com-
 munities of Russians Jews, Kurds, Yezids, Georgians, Greeks, and Assyrians still
 resident in Armenia do not suffer discrimination. The 1992 law on language guaran-
 tees linguistic minorities the right to publish and study in their native language.
 There are publications in minority languages. In theory, minorities may use their
 native languages in court cases. In practice, virtually everyone presently in Arme-
 nia, including members of its Yezid, Greek, and Jewish communities, speaks Arme-
 nian.
 People with Disabilities.-The Parliament in 1993 passed a law on invalids that
 in pnnciple guarantees the social, political, and individual rights of the handi-
 capped. The law does not mandate the provision of accessibility for the disabled,
 however. Appreciation of the rights of the handicapped remains very rudimentary.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 law on employment guarantees employees
 the right to strike and to form or join unions of their own choosing without previous
 authorization. The vast majority of existing trade unions are holdovers from the So-
 viet period and were not freely chosen by workers. About 80 percent of Armenia's
 work force are formally members of unions. A presidential decree of January 1993
 prohibits the Government and other employers from retaliating against strikers and
 abor leaders. It appears to be enforced. In the summer and all of 1993, teachers
 from some of the country's schools formed a union and struck to press their de-
 mands for improved working conditions and a wage increase. Yerevan subway work-
 ers conducted a 2-hour warning strike in November. The activities of both groups
 did not seem to be hindered in any way by the Government. Unions are free to affil-
 iate with international bodies and to form federations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Law on Employ-
 ment guarantees the right to organize and bargain collectively. Nearly all enter-
 prises, factories, and organizations remain under state control. Therefore, vol-
 untary,direct negotiations cannot take place between unions and employers without
 the participation of the Government. Collective bargaining is not practiced in Arme-
 nia. Wages in industries, which are overwhelmingly owned and controlled by the
 state, are set by the government with reference to the prevailing minimum wage.
 The Government encourages profitable factories to establish their own pay scales.
 They are generally set by the factory's directorate, without consultation with em-
 ployees. Exort processing zones do not exist. Wage and other labor disputes are ad-
 Judicated tughthe Arbitration Court. The Court has acted in the past to force
 the reinstatement of employees fired because of their labor activism.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1992 Law on Employment
 prohibits forced labor, which is not practiced. This provision is enforced by the local
 councils of deputies, unemployment offices, and, as a final board of appeal, the Arbi-
 tration Commission.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to the 1992 Law on Em-
 ployment, 16 is the minimum age for employment. Children may work from age 14
 with the permission of a medical commission and the relevant labor union board.
 Child labor is not practiced. The Law on Employment is enforced by the local coun-
 cils of deputies, unemployment offices, and, as a final board of appeal, the Arbitra-
 tion Commission.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is set by governmental de-
 cree and was increased periodically during 1993. The minimum wage in December
 1993 was about $0.50 per month. Employees paid the minimum wage cannot sup-
 port either themselves or their families on this pay. The vast majority of enterprises
 are either idle or operating at only a fraction of their capacity. Those still on the
 payrolls of idle enterprises continue to receive two-thirds of their base salary. As
 a result of the economic dislocations caused by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the
 1988 earthquake, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the resultant disruption in
 Armenia's trade, the overwhelming majority of Armenians are thought to live below
 the officially recognized poverty level. The standard legal workweek is 41 hours.
 Soviet-era occupational and safety standards remain in force. Labor legislation
 from 1988 places responsibility on the employer and the management of each firm
 to ensure "healthy and normal" labor conditions for employees, but it provides no
 
 
 785
 definition of "healthy and normal." A law that would improve safety conditions at
 the workplace has been drafted and has been discussed in committee.
