 KUWAIT
 Kuwait is ruled by the Al Sabah family. Kuwait's amirs have
 traditionally governed in consultation with members of several
 commercially powerful families and other influential
 community leaders. The 1962 Constitution, written after
 Kuwait gained independence from the United Kingdom, contains
 detailed provisions on the powers and relationships of the
 branches of government and on the rights of citizens.
 Kuwait's National Assembly institutionalizes a degree of
 consultation with the ruling family and serves as an outlet
 for popular expression, including criticism of the
 Government. The current Assembly has 50 members, elected from
 a narrow electorate of males who can trace their Kuwaiti
 nationality through the male line to 1920. Political activity
 is also restricted by the ban on the formation of political
 parties.
 The Kuwait citizenry is 65-70 percent Sunni Muslim; the
 remainder are Shi'ite Muslim plus a tiny minority of
 Christians. Although the members of Kuwait's Shi'a minority
 perceive themselves as largely excluded from leadership
 positions in the Government, many of them have achieved great
 wealth. In addition, the Iranian revolution has made the
 rulers more responsive to Shi'a sensitivities. At the same
 time they keep a watchful eye on Shi'a loyalties. Meanwhile,
 the majority Sunni community has been subject to internal
 pressure by the upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism which is
 centered in the young, and frequently conflicts with attitudes
 of the traditionally moderate members of the merchant class.
 Kuwaitis are a 40 percent minority in their own country. Of
 the approximately 1 million non-Kuwaitis, around 350,000 are
 Palestinian long-term residents, many in their second
 generation. Non-Kuwaitis are given due process under the law
 but have few other civil and political rights.
 Although the Government restricts the political and civil
 rights of all residents, and particularly those of women and
 expatriates, it does not interfere drastically with the
 integrity of the individual. Kuwait's security apparatus is
 used primarily to maintain internal order. It does not engage
 in political suppression. The role of Kuwait's security
 organizations increased substantially in 1984, particularly
 with regard to the non-citizen community. Conscious of being
 a minority in their own country, the Kuwaitis' sense of
 vulnerability has been heightened by increased political
 turbulence in the region. Foreign-inspired terrorism (such as
 the December 1983 bombings of Kuwaiti installations and the
 American and French embassies and the hijacking of a Kuwaiti
 Airways flight to Iran in December 1984) and attempts by
 agents of foreign governments and organizations to subvert
 elements of the population have led to tightened security
 measures and legal restrictions on public gatherings and
 dissemination of "subversive" literature. Increased attention
 to law and order is also viewed by some Kuwaitis as a means to
 protect their society against the threat they perceive to
 Kuwaiti moral and social values from the large foreign
 population. Since the December 1983 bombings, security
 organizations have assiduously applied regulations governing
 expatriate presence in Kuwait. Consequently, larger numbers
 of non-Kuwaitis have been deported than in past years.
 The long-term trends for human rights are a subject of much
 speculation in Kuwait. Internal socio-economic changes
 
 
 1295
 KUWAIT
 brought on by sudden oil-related wealth, coupled in recent
 years with violent revolution in Iran, the Iran-Iraq war, and
 the perceived failure of wealth to solve local and regional
 political problems, have led to a growing demand by well
 organized groups for stricter controls over public morality
 and political expression. A resurgent Islamic fundamentalist
 movement advocates adoption of a more stringent legal code
 based on Islamic Shari'a law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1984, there were no reported incidents of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Local security forces, without authorization, occasionally use
 physical violence when interrogating individuals suspected of
 committing criminal acts. These incidents do not appear to be
 widespread or condoned. Non-Kuwaitis are more likely to
 receive rough treatment than are Kuwaitis, and the seriousness
 of the suspected crime also appears to be a determining
 factor. Evidence of mistreatment during interrogation is a
 defense in Kuwait's courts and has led to the release of a
 number of suspects. In the case of those charged in the 1983
 terrorist bombings we have no information that the accused
 received harsher treatment than other persons suspected of
 committing criminal acts.
 Kuwait's prisons are managed along modern lines. Treatment is
 humane, and the Government provides food and other
 necessities. Young offenders, few of whom are imprisoned, are
 separated from persons charged or convicted of serious
 crimes. There is no policy of discriminatory treatment among
 prisoners for racial or religious reasons.
 Although the legal process is based in part on Islamic law,
 punishments such as mutilation or stoning are not permitted.
 Some fundamentalist members of the National Assembly have
 attempted to force the Government to adopt Islamic law fully,
 and by extension its harsh punishments, as the only basis for
 legal process, but their efforts have not been successful.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In 1984, there were no reports of individuals detained for
 political reasons in Kuwait. Arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment are prohibited by the Constitution. With
 occasional exceptions, such practices are not sanctioned by
 the Government. Individuals may not be denied due process or
 held for more than four days without charge, and a
 prosecutor's approval is required for detention periods beyond
 24 hours. Thereafter the suspect must either be released or
 charged by a prosecutor, who may authorize detention for up to
 an additional 21 days. Further detention pending trial may be
 
 
 1296
 KUWAIT
 authorized by a judge. Warrants are required unless an
 individual is apprehended in the act of committing an
 offense. These procedures are followed in practice. Road
 blocks and spot checks of outdoor gatherings of expatriates,
 especially of South Asians, are used sporadically by the
 police searching for illegal immigrants and contraband
 liquor. Persons without proper identification may be detained
 by the police under the procedures described above. A number
 of Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis were detained and interrogated
 following the 1983 terrorist bombings. While preliminary
 evidence indicates that some detentions were arbitrary, it
 appears that the procedures for prosecutor's approval and
 formal charges described above were followed. Although there
 have been some unconfirmed reports of incommunicado detention
 following the bombings, this does not appear to be a common
 practice.
 No Kuwaiti citizen may be exiled or denied return to Kuwait.
 However, a non-citizen, even if a long-term resident, may be
 summarily expelled without a specific charge against him if
 considered a troublemaker by the authorities. As a result of
 security measures taken following the 1983 terrorist bombings,
 a substantially larger number of non-Kuwaitis were deported in
 1984 than in previous years. The vast majority however, were
 individuals who had arrived in Kuwait illegally or whose
 residence permits had expired.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Kuwait's judicial system is independent and provides for
 public trial, the right of appeal, and representation by an
 attorney of one's choice. Failure of the police to respect a
 suspect's rights may provide a defense in the courts. Trials
 in absentia have occurred. In such cases, the defendant is
 allowed an additional right of appeal. There are no reports
 of secret or unfair trials or of discrimination against
 defense counsel. However, the court-appointed attorney of a
 defendant unable to engage his own lawyer is not always given
 adequate time to prepare a defense. Interpretation of court
 proceedings to ensure their understanding by non-Arabic-
 speaking defendants is sometimes inadequate. A special state
 security court was established by Amiri decree in December
 1983 to try those charged in the terrorist bombings. In the
 subsequent two-month trial, the Government strictly applied
 procedures established for regular criminal courts, including
 the provision of defense attorneys for each of the accused.
 Except for the opening and closing sessions of the tribunal,
 however, all hearings were conducted in camera, rather than
 publicly. Six of the accused were sentenced to death,
 including three tried in absentia. A number of others
 received prison sentences of varying lengths, and five were
 acquitted. The death sentences were referred to the Amir, as
 required by law, but as of November 1984 no decree had been
 issued to carry out the sentences. (Such delays are not
 unusual: several death sentences against individuals found
 guilty of capital crimes have been awaiting issuance of
 execution decrees for over a year.) There were no prisoners
 known to be serving sentences for nonviolent political
 offenses in 1983. According to the Constitution, military
 courts have jurisdiction only over offenses committed by
 members of the armed or security forces, except during periods
 of martial law (which has never been declared in Kuwait). The
 Amir has the power to pardon or to commute sentences passed by
 either civilian or military courts and has occasionally done
 so
 
 
 1297
 KUWAIT
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Fome, or
 Correspondence
 The right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 Warrants are required to search, unless the police are in hot
 pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or where
 there is an indication of the presence of alcohol or illegal
 narcotics. Search warrants to enter residences or businesses
 are issued by a public prosecutor. Expatriates, and
 particularly common laborers and servants who live in
 accommodations provided by their employers, may have their
 premises searched by the police with authorization only of the
 employer.
 Although many expatriates in Kuwait are non-Muslims, Kuwait
 absolutely prohibits on religious grounds the sale of alcohol
 or pork products. Beyond these restrictions, the Government
 does not arbitrarily or unnecessarily intervene in the private
 lives of Kuwaiti citizens or expatriates.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees in this area are conditional, being
 modified by such phrases as "in accordance with conditions and
 manner specified by law." The average Kuwaiti or Kuwait
 resident feels free to offer his opinion in private without
 fear of official retaliation. No one may make a written or
 public attack upon the Amir and the ruling family, upon Islam,
 or upon leaders of friendly Arab states. Kuwait has an active
 censorship department, which reviews all books, films,
 videotapes, periodicals, and other material entering Kuwait in
 bulk or for commercial purposes. In practice, references to
 the State of Israel are often excised from educational
 materials, reference works, and maps. Items arriving by post
 for individuals or institutional use are usually not opened
 before delivery, unless the contents are suspected of being
 pornographic. Printed and visual material produced within
 Kuwait is not subject to precensorship, but is liable to
 government action after publication or release. Radio and
 television are government-owned and controlled.
 The Kuwaiti press is not precensored. Articles and editorials
 critical of government action or of individuals appear
 infrequently. The press law sets down several categories
 which are restricted. These include criticism of the Amir and
 the ruling family; official confidential communications or
 treaties and agreements with other states; material which
 might disturb relations with Arab and friendly states or which
 might prove embarrassing to their heads of state; and a
 general category of stories which "might incite people to
 commit crimes, create hatred, or spread dissensions among the
 people."  In practice, the list is interpreted selectively and
 violators are usually only issued warnings. Editors and
 publishers are liable to imprisonment and fines for
 violations, but to date there have been no known
 imprisonments. Editors are generally careful not to offend
 the Government. In 1984, two weekly magazines were closed
 temporarily for publishing articles considered offensive by
 the Government. The closures were based on court orders and,
 in one case, followed prior warnings to the chief editor of
 the magazine. In hearings following the suspensions, one of
 
 
 1298
 KUWAIT
 the editors was sentenced to pay a small fine while the other
 was acquitted of the charges. The Kuwaiti National Assembly
 is expected to consider again in the near future a government-
 proposed press law which will detail more explicitly the
 restricted areas, as well as spell out more rigorous
 punishments.
 The Government permits the use of languages other than Arabic
 in speech, print, and private schools.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned in Kuwait. Political activity
 finds some outlet in social clubs and religious societies, as
 well as through family or neighborhood gatherings known as
 "diwaniyyas.1 The Constitution protects private assembly,
 public meetings, processions, and gatherings which are
 peaceful and not contrary to public morals. However, any
 group of more than three people desiring to meet for public
 discussion (or to meet privately but issue a public statement)
 must receive explicit prior permission from the Ministry of
 Interior. The authorities may prevent such an assembly merely
 by ignoring the request. During 1984 there were no mass
 gatherings in Kuwait, except those associated with religious
 observances. In the case of an October 1984 Shi'a religious
 commemoration with potential political overtones, security
 forces were highly evident, although they did not interfere.
 Kuwait permits trade unions, although only government
 employees and the petroleum, banking, and airline sectors are
 unionized. The majority of union members are civil servants.
 Kuwaiti citizens and expatriates residing in Kuwait for five
 years are permitted to join unions. Only Kuwaitis may vote in
 union elections or hold union office. Kuwait's labor unions
 play only a minor economic role and virtually no political
 role. Nevertheless, unions do serve as an outlet for
 grievances and their views receive some government attention.
 The right to strike is officially recognized, but seldom
 exercised. Kuwaiti refinery workers of the state-owned oil
 company struck in the spring of 1983, but returned to work
 after some of their demands were met. During 1984 the
 petroleum workers successfully resisted an attempt to reduce
 their medical benefits without resorting to strike action.
 There is no apparent harassment of professional groups, bar
 associations, scientific bodies, or labor unions, which are
 also permitted to participate in international bodies. The
 Kuwait Federation of Trade Unions, grouping the government and
 petroleum workers, is a member of the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the World Federation of
 Trade Unions. Kuwait is an active tripartite member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO). In 1984 the ILO
 requested Kuwait to amend its labor laws to bring them into
 conformity with various ILO conventions to which it is a party.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While the Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is
 absolute,* it states further that its practice is not to
 .conflict with public policy or morals.' Kuwait's state
 religion is Islam, and the Shari'a (Islamic law) is, according
 to the Constitution, 'a main source of legislation.* The
 ruling family and most prominent Kuwaiti families are Sunni
 Muslims. There is no official policy of discrimination
 
 
 1299
 KUWAIT
 against Shi'a Muslims, who constitute about one-third of
 Kuwait's citizenry, but they and members of Kuwait's tiny Arab
 Christian minority are seldom appointed to sensitive
 government positions. There are a number of expatriate
 Christian congregations in Kuwait and several churches. In
 recent years the Government banned Christmas parties in the
 country's hotels and restaurants. Pressure from
 fundamentalist Islamic groups was the unstated reason for the
 restriction. Expatriate practitioners of Eastern religions,
 e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists, are not allowed to
 establish places of worship in Kuwait but may worship
 privately in their homes. Proselytizing of Muslims by
 non-Muslims is prohibited.
 In the past two years there have been initiatives within the
 National Assembly to enforce greater compliance with Islamic
 practices. The Assembly has also barred the future granting
 of citizenship to non-Muslims, prohibited all importation of
 alcoholic beverages, and repeatedly attempted to establish
 Islamic law as the basis for all legal process. Assembly
 members have also pressured, with some success, those campuses
 of Kuwait University which are sexually integrated to separate
 the sexes in the classrooms and in other facilities such as
 cafeterias. The Government has accommodated the National
 Assembly's demands for application of some fundamentalist
 principles in Kuwait. It has, however, blocked attempts in
 the Assembly to apply Islamic law across the board.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Kuwaiti citizens generally are free to travel inside and
 outside the country, to emigrate, and to return. There is
 some restriction on foreign travel for young men who have not
 completed, or been exempted from, their compulsory military
 service. Those serving in the military must receive
 permission from the Ministry of Defense before traveling
 abroad. While there are no different legal standards
 regarding the internal or foreign travel or emigration of
 Kuwaiti women, in practice husbands can prevent their wives
 and minor children from leaving the country.
 There are occasional instances in which citizens' passports
 are suspended temporarily. Generally, this occurs only for
 criminal suspects but has also happened to some outspoken
 critics of the regime. By late 1984, upwards of 400 Kuwaitis
 were barred from traveling abroad because of debts remaining
 from the collapse of an extra-official stock market two years
 earlier. Representatives of societies, associations, and
 trade unions wishing to travel to and participate in
 international meetings have to receive prior permission.
 While the Constitution states "no Kuwaiti may be deported from
 Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto," individuals have
 been stripped of Kuwaiti citizenship and deported. Such
 actions have been rare and have in some cases been based on
 the voluntary acquisition by the individual of foreign
 citizenship. No such incidents occurred in 1984.
 All non-Kuwaitis working in Kuwait must have the sponsorship
 of a Kuwaiti citizen. Kuwait does not extend permanent
 residence to its expatriate population. Thus, employers have
 the power to restrict job mobility and the continued residence
 in Kuwait of their expatriate employees. Because Kuwaiti
 sponsors are legally responsible for their employees' actions,
 
 
 1300
 KUWAIT
 many expatriates (including some government employees, such as
 teachers) are coerced by their employers into surrendering
 their travel documents, thus preventing them from leaving the
 country without the employer's consent. Those employed by
 government agencies are given residence visas which require an
 exit permit or "no objection" letter in order to leave the
 country. Non-Kuwaitis convicted of crimes are routinely
 deported after serving their sentences.
 Illegal entrants to Kuwait are normally returned to their home
 countries; exceptions have been made for those, mostly
 Iranians and Afghans, who are considered by the Government to
 be legitimate refugees and have been permitted to remain in
 Kuwait or sent to third countries. Among Kuwait's large
 Palestinian population, most have Lebanese or Jordanian travel
 documents. Undocumented Palestinians, and in 1984 those with
 Lebanese documentation, have received commitments from the
 Government that they will be allowed to stay even without
 sponsors.
 In the past few years, as the Government has sought to reduce
 its "permanent resident" foreign community, in response to
 economic problems and internal security concerns, fewer
 expatriates who were not already residents have been granted
 permission to enter the country. Also, some expatriates going
 abroad to study have had difficulty reentering Kuwait, despite
 government assurances that expatriate students would be
 permitted to rejoin their families.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Al Sabah, a family of Bedouin origin, have ruled Kuwait
 for over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution limited succession
 to descendants of Mubarak the Great, the ruler at the turn of
 this century. In practice, the ruler and senior family
 members choose the Crown Prince from either the al-Jabir or
 the al-Salim branch of the Al Sabah. Under the Constitution
 this choice is confirmed by majority vote of the National
 Assembly. Executive power is vested in the ruler and, under
 him, in an appointed Council of Ministers whose chairman by
 tradition is the Crown Prince.
 Upon independence, Kuwait inaugurated a National Assembly
 composed of 50 deputies, elected by secret ballot, plus
 cabinet members (presently 16, including the Prime Minister),
 sitting ex officio. Candidates for the National Assembly are
 self-nominated; multiple candidates compete for the 50 seats.
 A "grandfather clause" effectively limits suffrage to adult
 males who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and maintained a
 residence there until 1959, and their descendants. Women's
 suffrage was considered and rejected by the National Assembly
 in 1982. A Kuwait women's organization was unsuccessful in
 1984 both in its attempts to register women to vote and to
 take the issue to the constitutional court.
 The National Assembly reviews government policy and programs,
 including budgets, and makes recommendations. It questions
 ministers on a variety of subjects, especially their
 ministries' responsiveness in public services. Government
 policy is criticized in the Assembly, which only rarely
 rejects government-proposed legislation. Its main political
 function is to serve as a forum for creating and expressing a
 popular consensus on national issues.
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1301
 KUWAIT
 Constitutionally, the National Assembly can bring down the
 Government or force individual cabinet members to resign. In
 fact, since the Prime Minister is by tradition also the Crown
 Prince, the Assembly has exercised this right only once.
 Should the Assembly declare that it is unable to work with the
 Government, the Amir may dismiss the Government. He has the
 option, however, of dismissing the Assembly and calling new
 elections, which is the more likely course.
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are an important
 feature of the Kuwaiti political system. Traditionally, adult
 male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy access to their tribal
 and religious leaders, to the heads of the prominent merchant
 clans, and to the ruling family itself through the system of
 "diwaniyyas," informal clubs to which anyone can come and
 freely speak his mind. That custom has endured, as has the
 tradition that the Amir should govern in consultation with the
 other community leaders. High-ranking officials are also
 approachable through "wasta," the use of influential family
 members or acquaintances as intermediaries in obtaining favors
 or a more favorable hearing for one's case.
 While Kuwaiti citizens participate to a limited degree in the
 political process, non-citizens, who outnumber Kuwaitis by
 three to two, have no role. Kuwait has been reluctant to
 extend citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti origin, with the
 exception of certain stateless Bedouin. Naturalization of
 even Kuwait-born persons is rare. This anomaly is
 particularly striking for the 350,000 Palestinians, the second
 largest segment of the population. Citizenship has been
 extended only to a few Palestinian families who made
 significant contributions to Kuwait before the early 1970's.
 In 1984 the National Assembly passed a bill authorizing the
 naturalization of 500 persons annually. The Government has
 established a committee to draw up criteria for granting
 citizenship but the results of its deliberations are not
 expected in the near future. While expatriates have almost no
 say in internal affairs, they are permitted considerable
 freedom in conducting activities affecting their homelands.
 However, expatriates who violate sanctions against involvement
 in Kuwait'saffairs or whose activities risk embarrassing
 Kuwait in its foreign relations may be summarily deported.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International, in its 1984 report, expressed concern
 about reports that, in addition to the individuals charged
 with carrying out the terrorist bombings in 1983, large
 numbers of Kuwaiti, Iranian, and Iraqi Shi'as were also
 arrested, that some were ill-treated and held incommunicado,
 and that large numbers of the Iraqis had been deported or
 threatened with deportation to Iraq. Freedom House calls
 Kuwait "partly free." There are no known current requests by
 nongovernmental organizations to examine human rights in
 Kuwait. While Kuwait has not taken initiatives
 internationally on most human rights questions, it is among
 the strongest proponents of the rights and claims of
 Palestinians.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government has an extensive social welfare program to
 
 
 1302
 KUWAIT
 spread the benefits to all citizens of the extremely high per
 capita gross national product, estimated by the World Bank to
 have reached $19,873 in 1982 though less in subsequent years.
 The distribution of this wealth is heavily skewed in favor of
 Kuwaitis. Programs are designed to provide Kuwaitis with
 housing, family allowances, retirement income, medical care,
 education, and employment. Improved health care has resulted
 in a drop in the infant mortality rate to 21.6 per 1,000 live
 births and an increase in life expectancy for Kuwaitis, as of
 1984, to 71.5 years. Although exact figures are unavailable,
 few if any individuals are below the absolute poverty level
 and malnutrition has been effectively eliminated. In 1980,
 the adult literacy rate for Kuwaitis was 63.4 percent with 71
 percent of those over ten years of age literate.
 The major social distinction in Kuwait is between Kuwaiti
 nationals, who comprise only 40 percent of the population, and
 expatriates. Ownership of commercial establishments (above 49
 percent), real estate, and shares on the local stock market
 (the principal sources of private wealth in this capitalist
 economy) is open only to Kuwaitis. The current economic
 recession threatens the expatriate community by encouraging
 efforts to reduce the number of long-term resident
 non-Kuwaitis. Expatriates, therefore, feel more insecure than
 in the past, and many have begun to look for employment
 outside Kuwait.
 Expatriate workers often earn the same base pay as Kuwaitis
 but receive less in fringe benefits. Benefits restricted to
 Kuwaiti citizens include higher government salaries,
 additional government stipends and social allowances, and in
 general, retirement pensions. Resident expatriates are
 entitled to some medical benefits and to elementary and
 secondary schooling (but not kindergarten) for their children
 in the public schools. Kuwaitis are given preference for
 admission to the University of Kuwait. Many temporary "guest
 workers" come to Kuwait without their families and live in
 camps or crowded apartments.
 Kuwaiti women are allotted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice. Denied the vote, women are also limited by
 tradition from freely choosing their place in the society,
 though less so than in some other Islamic countries.
 Nevertheless, there are Kuwaiti women who are outspoken in
 their demand for a broader role in society. In contrast to
 the practice in some neighboring countries, a Kuwaiti woman is
 permitted to drive a car, may wear Western dress in public,
 and has legal access to higher education inside and outside
 the country. Although women have yet to join the work force
 in large numbers, they are able to compete for government and
 corporate employment and have the right to litigate against
 men (for example, in child custody suits). Many women have
 accumulated substantial personal wealth. However, the
 Government has restricted women from being assigned abroad in
 Kuwait's diplomatic service. Some prominent, educated women
 also are wary of current fundamentalist trends which they fear
 may lead the Government to restrict their freedoms as a price
 for fundamentalist restraint on other issues.
