 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven Emirates established
 in 1971. None has any democratically elected institutions or political parties. Each
 emirate retains control over its own oil and mineral wealth and some aspects of de-
 fense and internal security, although the Federal Government asserts primacy in
 most matters of law and government. Traditional rule in the emirates has generally
 
 
 1275
 been patriarchal, with political allegiance defined in terms of loyalty to the tribal
 leaders.
 Political leaders in the emirates are not elected, but citizens may express their
 concerns directly to their leaders via traditional mechanisms, such as the open
 majlis, or council. In accordance with the 1971 Provisional Constitution, the seven
 emirate rulers co  prise a Federal Supreme Council, the highest legislative and ex-
 ecutive body. The Council selects a President and Vice President from its member-
 ship; the President in turn appoints the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Council
 meets occasionally, although the leaders meet frequently in more traditional set-
 tings. The Cabinet manages the Federation on a day to day basis.
 Each emirate maintains its own police force, but only the Federal Government
 and the Emirate of Dubai have independent internal security organizations.
 The UAE has a free market economy based on oil and gas production, trade and
 light manufacturing. The Government owns the majority share of the petroleum
 production enterprise in the largest emirate, Abu Dhabi. The Emirate of Dubai is
 likewise an oil exporter, as well as a growing financial and commercial center in
 the Gulf. The remaining five emirates have negligible petroleum or other resources
 and therefore depend in varying degrees on federal government subsidies, particu-
 larly for basic services such as health care, electricity, water, and education. The
 economy provides citizens with a high per capita income, but it is heavily dependent
 on foreign workers, who comprise at least 80 percent of the general population.
 The Government continued to restrict human rights in a number of areas; e.g.,
 denial of the right of citizens to change their government, and limitations on the
 freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and worker rights. Women con-
 tinue to make progress in education and in the work force, but some types of dis-
 crimination persist. The press continued to avoid direct criticism of the government
 and exercised self-censorship.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of torture. The Provisional Constitution prohibits torture or
 degrading treatment. Shari'a courts frequently impose flogging on Muslims found
 guilty of adultery, prostitution, and drug and alcohol abuse. In practice, flogging is
 administered in accordance with Shari'a so as to prevent major or permanent inju-
 ries. The individual administeringthe lashing traditionally holds a Koran under the
 arm and sdngs the whip using the forearm only. According to press accounts, pun-
 ishments for adultery and prostitution have ranged from 80 to 200 lashes. Individ-
 uals convicted of drunkenness have been sentenced to 80 lashes.
 During the year, two Muslims aged 16, who had been convicted of kidnaping and
 attempted sexual assault, were sentenced to 50 lashes each, while two other Muslim
 teenagers, convicted of deadly traffic violations, each received 30 lashes adminis-
 tered in public.
 After several judicial reviews, a Filipina domestic worker, Sarah Balabagan, was
 sentenced in October to 1 year imprisnment and 100 lashes to be followed by de-
 portation on charges related to the killing of her employer. See Section 6.e. Authori-
 ties carried out the lashings, 20 each time, during the period January 30 to Feb-
 uary 5, 1996. Reports indicated that Balabagan showed no visible signs of injury.
 The Federal Supreme Cour. ruled in 1993 that convictions in the Shar'a courts
 do not necessarily require the imposition of Shari'a penalties on non-Muslims, but
 sentences have been carried out in a few cases. For example, in July the Supreme
 Court rejected an appeal filed by a non-Muslim convicted of public drunkenness and
 sentenced to receive 39 lashes.
 No amputations were known to have been carried out.
 In central prisons holding long-term  tes, cells may hold 8 to 10 prisoners.
 They are provided with food, medical care, and adequate sanitation facilities, but
 sleep on blankets on concrete floors. The central prisons are not air-conditioned dur-
 ing the intense heat and humidity of the summer. Prisoners normally may receive
 visitors up to three times each week, and ma also make occasional telephone calls.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.- he Provisional Constitution prohibits
 arrest, search, detention, or imprisonment except in acdordance with the law. The
 laws of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable cause.
 Under the Criminal Procedures Code, the police must report arrests within 48
 hours to the Attorney General, who must determine within the next 24 hours
 
 
 1276
 whether to charge, release, or order further detention pending an investigation. The
 Attorney General may order detainees held for up to 21 days without charge. After
 that time, the authorities must obtain a court order for further detention without
 charge.
 Although the Code does not specify a right to a speedy trial, authorities bring de-
 tainees to trial in reasonable time. There is no formal system of bail, but the au-
 thorities may temporarily release detainees who deposit money or an important doc-
 ument such as a passport. The law permits incommunicado detention, but there is
 no evidence that it is practiced.
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits exile, which is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Provisional Constitution provides for the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary. There is a dual system of Shari'a (Islamic) and civil (secu-
 lar) courts. The civil courts are generally part of the federal system and are answer-
 able to the Federal Supreme Court, located in Abu Dhabi, which has the power of
 judicial review as well as original jurisdiction in disputes between emirates, or be-
 tween the Federal Government and individual emirates.
 The Shari'a courts are administered by each emirate, but are also answerable to
 the Federal Supreme Court. In 1994 the President decreed that the Shari'a courts,
 and not the civil courts, would have the authority to try almost all types of criminal
 cases. The decree did not affect the emirates of Dubai, Umm Al-Qaiwain, and Ras
 Al-Khaimah which have lower courts independent of the federal system.
 Legal counsel may represent defendants in both court systems. Under the new
 Criminal Procedures Code, the accused has a right to counsel in all cases involving
 a capital crime or possible life imprisonment. Only the Emirate of Dubai has a pub-
 lic defender's office. If the defendant is indigent, the Government will provide coun-
 sel. The Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that a defendant in an appeals case has a
 "fundamental right" to select his attorney and that this right supersedes a judge's
 power to appoint an attorney for the defendant.
 There are no jury trials. A single judge normally renders the verdict in each case,
 whether in Shari'a or civil courts. All trials are public, except national security cases
 and those deemed by the judge likely to harm public morality. Most judges are for-
 eign nationals, primarily from other Arab countries; however, the Ministry of Jus-
 tice has trained some UAE citizens as judges and prosecutors.
 Each court system has an appeals process. Death sentences may be appealed to
 the ruler of the emirate in which the offense was committed, or to the President
 of the Federation. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Non-Mus-
 lims tried for criminal offenses in Shari'a courts may receive civil penalties at the
 discretion of the judge. Shari'a penalties imposed on non-Muslims may be over-
 turned or modified by a higher court. During the year, the Federal Supreme Court
 rejected an appeal by a non-Muslim sentenced to lashing (see Section 1.c.).
 The military has its own court system based on Western military judicial practice.
 Military tribunals try only military personnel. There is no separate national security
 court system.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Provisional Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission,
 except in accordance with the law. Although the police may enter homes without
 a warrant and without demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions in search-
 ing premises are subject to review, and he is subject to disciplinary action if he acts
 irresponsibly. Officials other than a police officer must have a court order to enter
 a private home. Local custom and practice place a high value on privacy, and entry
 into private homes without the owner's permission is rare. There is no known sur-
 veillance of private correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Provisional Constitution provides
 for freedom of speech, most people, especially foreign nationals, refrain from criticiz-
 ing the Government in public. All published material is subject to Federal Law 15
 of 1988, which stipulates that all publications, whether books or periodicals, should
 be licensed by the Ministry of Education. It also governs content and contains a list
 of proscribed subjects. Mindful of these provisions, journalists censor themselves
 when reporting on government policy, the ruling families, national security, religion,
 and relations with neighboring states.
 Many of the local English and Arabic language newspapers are privately owned,
 but receive government subsidies. In early 1995, the Government ordered the indefi-
 nite suspension of a Muslim, Arabic language weekly magazine, Al-Islah. Foreign
 publications are routinely subjected to censorship before distribution.
 
 
 1277
 
 All television and radio stations are government owned and conform to govern-
 ment reporting guidelines. Satellite receiving dishes are widespread and provide ac-
 cess to international broadcasts without apparent censorship. Censors at the Min-
 istry of Information and Culture review imported newspapers, periodicals, books,
 films, and videos and ban any material considered pornographic, violent, derogatory
 to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly critical of friendly countries, or critical of the
 Government or the ruling families.
 In July an Iranian national acquitted in a slander case against the Sharjah gov-
 ernment was later sentenced to death for heresy, because he claimed during the
 trial that he had been divinely ordained. Although he has refused to appeal the
 death sentence, it has not been carried out.
 The unwritten but generally recognized ban on criticism of the Government also
 restricts academic freedom, although in recent years academics have been more
 open in their criticism.
 b. Freedom of Peacefid Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are tightly re-
 stricted. Organized public gatherings require a government permit. Each emirate
 determines its own practice on public gatherings. Some emirates are relatively toler-
 ant of seminars and conferences on sensitive subjects.
 Citizens normally confine their political discussions to the numerous gatherings
 or majlis, held in private homes. There are no restrictions on such gatherings. How-
 ever, private associations must follow the Government's censorship guidelines if
 they publish any material. Unauthorized political organizations are prohibited.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion of all the emirates. Citizens
 are predominantly Sunni Muslims, but Shi'a Muslims are also free to worship and
 maintain mosques. In 1993 the Emirate of Dubai placed private mosques under the
 control of its Department of Islamic Affairs and Endowments. This move gave the
 Government control over the appointment of preachers and the conduct of their
 work. Throughout the emirates, most mosques are government funded or subsidized,
 and the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs ensures that clergy do not deviate
 from approved topics in their sermons.
 Non-Muslims are free to practice their religion but may not proselytize publicly
 or distribute religious literature. Major cities have Christian churches and Hindu
 and Sikh temples, some built on land donated by the ruling families. Other religious
 communities (mostly expatriates residing in Dubai and Abu Dhabi) include Ismailis,
 Parsis, and Iranian Bahais. The Government permits foreign clergy to minister to
 expatriate congregations. Non-Muslim religious groups are permitted to engage in
 private charitable activities and to send their children to private schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no limitations on freedom of movement or relocation within
 the country, except for security areas such as defense and oil installations.
 Unrestricted foreign travel and emigration are permitted to male citizens except
 those involved in financial disputes under adjudication. A husband may bar his wife
 and children from leaving the country without his permission. All citizens have the
 right to return. There is a small population of stateless residents, many of whom
 have lived in the UAE for more than one generation. They are Bedouins or the de-
 scendants of Bedouins who are unable to prove that they are of UAE origin.
 Citizens are not restricted in seeking or changing employment. However, foreign
 nationals in specific occupations, primarily professional, may change employers
 without first leaving the country for 6 months. This law is often not enforced.
 The Government does not have any formal procedures for accepting refugees. It
 may detain persons seeking refugee status, particularly non-Arabs, while they await
 resettlement in a third country. There is no formal procedure for naturalization, al-
 though foreign women receive citizenship by marriage to a UAE citizen, and anyone
 may receive a passport by presidential fiat.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 There are no democratically elected institutions, and citizens do not have the
 right to change their government or to form political parties. Although there are
 consultative councils at the federal and emirate levels, most executive and legisla-
 tive power is in the hands of the Federal Supreme Council. The seven emirate rul-
 ers, their extended families, and those persons and families to whom they are allied
 by historical ties, marriage, or common interest wield most political power in their
 own emirates. Decisions at the federal level are generally made by consensus of the
 sheikhs of the seven emirates and leading families.
 A federal consultative body, called the Federal National Council (FNC), coiisists
 of advisers appointed by the rulers of each emirate. The FNC has no legislative an-
 
 
 1278
 thority but may question ministers and make policy recommendations to the Cabi-
 net. Its sessions are usually open to the public.
 The choice of a new emirate ruler falls to the ruling family in consultation with
 other prominent tribal figures. By tradition, rulers and ruling families are presumed
 to have the right to rule, but their incumbency ultimately depends on the quality
 of their leadership and their responsiveness to their subjects' needs. Emirate rulers
 are accessible, in varying degrees, to citizens who have a problem or a request.
 Tradition rather than law has limited the social role of women. Women are free
 to hold government positions, but there are few women in senior positions. Although
 the small Shi'a minority has enjoyed commercial success, few Shi'a Muslims have
 top positions in the Federal Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent human rights groups. Government restrictions on free-
 dom of the press and public association make it difficult for such groups to inves-
 tigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights restrictions. However,
 in September the Emirate of Dubai announced the formation of a human rights sec-
 tion within its police force to monitor any allegations of human rights abuses.
 A few inforaal public discussions of human rights have taken place in recent
 years, such as a seminar in December 1992 and an international symposium in late
 1993. These events, along with some press coverage of selected local human rights
 problems, have led to a small increase in public awareness of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Provisional Constitution provides for equality before the law with regard to
 race, nationality, religious beliefs, or social status. However, there is institutional
 and cultural discrimination based on sex, nationality, and religion.
 Women.-There are few reports of spousal abuse. When reported, the local police
 authorities may take action to protect women from abuse. The laws protect women
 from verbal abuse or harassment from men, and violators are subject to criminal
 action. There continue to be credible reports of abuse of female domestic servants
 by some UAE and foreign employers (see Section 6.e.).
 Most women play a subordinate role in this family-centered society because of
 early marriages and traditional attitudes about women's activities. As noted in Sec-
 tion 2.d., husbands may bar their wives and children from leaving the country, and
 a married woman may not accept employment without her husband's written con-
 sent. Islamic law is applied in cases of divorce. Mothers receive custody of their chil-
 dren under 7 years of age. Older children live with their fathers unless judicial au-
 thorities decide otherwise. Courts usually grant custody to the father regardless of
 the child's age in divorce cases in which the mother is a Muslim or a foreigner. A
 woman who remarries forfeits her right to the custody of children from a previous
 marriage. Islamic law permits polygyny.
 Women are restricted from holding majority shares in most businesses. A wom-
 an's property is not commingled with that of her husband. Women who work outside
 the home generally receive equal pay for equal work, but do not receive equal bene-
 fits, such as housing, and may face discrimination in promotion. In June the UAE
 Cabinet provisionally extended paid maternity leave for citizen women in the pri-
 vate sector to 3 months at full pay from 45 days, and up to 1 year's leave at half
 pay and a second year's leave at quarter pay.
 Women continue to make rapid progress in education. They constitute over 75
 percent of the student body at the National University in Al-Ain, largely because
 women, unlike men, rarely study abroad. Opportunities for women have grown in
 government service, education, private business, and health services. According to
 UAE government figures, 16.3 percent of the country's workforce in 1995 was fe-
 male.
 Women are officially encouraged to continue their education, and government-
 sponsored women's centers provide adult education and technical training courses.
 The Federal Armed Forces accept female volunteers, who may enroll in a special
 training course started after the Gulf War. The Dubai Police College recruits
 women, many of whom are deployed at airports, immigration offices, and women's
 prisons. As of mid-1995, about 85 women had graduated from the college.
 The law prohibits cohabitation by unmarried couples. The Government may im-
 prison and deport noncitizen women if they bear children out of wedlock. In the
 event that the courts sentence women to prison for such an offense, local authorities
 will hold the newborn children in a special facility until the mother's release and
 
 
 1279
 deportation. Children may remain in this facility longer in the event of a custody
 dispute.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare of children. Children who
 are citizens receive free health care, free education, guaranteed housing, and other
 perquisites of citizenship. A family may also be eligible to receive aid from the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Welfare for sons and daughters who are under the age of
 18 or unmarried or disabled. There is no pattern of societal child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no federal legislation requiring accessibility for
 the disabled. However, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs sponsors centers
 which provide facilities and services to the disabled. Services range from monthly
 social aid funds, special education, and transportation assistance to sending a team
 to the Special Olympics.
 National lRacial /Ethnic Minoritie&-Discrimination based on national origin,
 while not legally sanctioned, is prevalent (see Section 2.d.). Employment, immigra-
 tion and security policy, as well as cultural attitudes towards foreign workers, are
 conditioned by national origin.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There are no unions and no strikes. The law does
 not grant workers the right to organize unions or to strike. Foreign workers, who
 make up the bulk of the work force, risk deportation if they attempt to organize
 unions or to strike.
 Since July the UAE has been suspended from the U.S. Overseas Private Invest-
 ment Corporation insurance prmgrams because of the Government's lack of compli-
 ance with internationally recognized worker rights standards.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law does not grant work-
 ers the right to engage in collective bargaining, which is not practiced. Workers in
 the industrial and service sectors are normally employed under contracts that are
 subject to review by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The purpose of the
 review is to ensure that the pay will satisfy the employee's basic needs and secure
 a means of living. For the resolution of work-related disputes, workers must rely
 on conciliation committees organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs or
 on special labor courts.
 Labor laws do not cover government employees, domestic servants, and agricul-
 tural workers. The latter two groups face considerable difficulty in obtaining assist-
 ance to resolve disputes with employers. While any worker may seek redress
 through the courts, this puts a heavy financial burden on those in lower income
 brackets.
 In Dubai's Jebel Ali Free Zone, the same labor laws apply as in the rest of the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and not practiced. However, some unscrupulous employment agents bring for-
 eign workers to the UAE under conditions approaching indenture.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor regulations prohibit employ-
 ment of persons under age 15 and have special provisions for employing those aged
 15 to 18. The Department of Labor enforces the regulations. Other regulations per-
 mit employers to engage only adult foreign workers. In 1993 the Government pro-
 hibited the employment of children under the age of 15 as camel jockeys and of jock-
 eys who do not weigh more than 45 kilograms.The Camel Racing Association is re-
 sponsible for enforcing these rules. Otherwise, child labor is not permitted.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administrative mini-
 mum wage. Supply and demand determine compensation. However, according to the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, there is an unofficial, unwritten nnnmum
 wage rate which would afford a worker and family a minimal standard of living.
 As noted in Section 6.b., the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry reviews labor con-
 tracts and does not approve any contract that stipulates a clearly unacceptable
 wage.
 The standard workday and workweek are 8 hours a day, 6 days per week, but
 these standards are not strictly enforced. Certain types of workers, notably demestic
 servants, may be obliged to work longer than the mandated standard hours. The
 law also provides for a minimum of 24 days per year of annual leave plus 10 na-
 tional and religious holidays. In addition, manual workers are not required to do
 outdoor work when the temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius (112 degrees Fahr-
 enheit).
 Most foreign workers receive either employer-provided housing or housing allow-
 anes, medical care, and homeward passage from their employers. Most foreign
 workers do not earn the minimum salary of $1,090 per month (or $817 per mont
 if a housing allowance is provided in addition to the salary) required to obtain resi-
 
 
 1280
 dency permits for their families. Employers have the option to petition for a 1 year
 ban from the work force against any foreign employee who leaves his job without
 fulfilling the terms of his contract.
 The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, municipalities,
 and civil defense units enforce health and safety standards. The Government re-
 quires every large industrial concern to employ a certified occupational safety offi-
 cer. An injured worker is entitled to fair compensation. Health standards are not
 uniformly observed in the housing camps provided for foreign workers. Workers' jobs
 are not protected if they remove themselves from what they consider to be unsafe
 working conditions. However, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs may require
 employers to reinstate workers dismissed for not performing unsafe work. All work-
 ers have the right to lodge grievances with ministry officials, who make an effort
 to investigate  all complaints. However, the Ministry is understaffed    and
 underbudgeted; complaints and compensation claims are backlogged.
 Rulings on complaints may be appealed within the Ministry and ultimately to the
 courts. However, many workers choose not to protest for fear of reprisals or deporta-
 tion. The press periodically carries reports of abuses suffered by domestic servants,
 particularly women, at the hands of some employers. Allegations have included ex-
 cessive work hours, nonpayment of wages, and verbal and physical abuse.
 During the year, several highly publicized cases involving Filipina maids high-
 lighted the conditions of domestic workers of all nationalities. In one case, 16-year-
 old Sarah Balabagan was initially sentenced to 7 years in prison for killing her em-
 ployer, who she claimed had raped her. After a retrial, an Islamic court sentenced
 aabagan to death; however, following an intervention by the UAE President, the
 victim's family agreed to accept monetary compensation as permitted under Islamic
 law. An appeals court subsequently overturned the death sentence and sentenced
 Balabagan to 1 year imprisonment and 100 lashes to be followed by deportation.
 The court alco required her to pay approximately $41,000 in monetary compensation
 to the family of her former employer.
