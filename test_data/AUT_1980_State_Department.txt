 AUSTRIA
 The Austrian human rights record reflects fundamental con-
 stitutional and policy orientations that have defined the
 country's domestic and foreign affairs since the restoration
 of Austrian sovereignty in 1955. The Austrian State Treaty
 and the Federal Constitution mandate the freedom of the
 individual and guarantee basic civil and political liberties.
 A champion of humane values in the international community,
 Austria has pursued an active program of assistance to
 refugees, granting permanent settlement to many persons and
 providing first asylum to a rising volume of applicants.
 The Austrian role in facilitating the transit of Jewish
 emigrants from the Soviet Union has been accorded widespread
 praise. A Western-oriented society with a highly developed
 economy, Austria has established a system of social democracy
 characterized by equality of opportunity and assured
 employment.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by imperial decree of
 January 2, 1776 and Article 3 of the Convention for the
 Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of
 November 4, 1950, which was incorporated into Austrian law
 on September 3, 1958; and is respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Capital punishment was abolished in 1950.
 c. Disappearances
 Since the restoration of sovereignty, there have been no
 known instances of extralegal or secret abduction or arrest
 of any person in Austria.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Austria has administrative
 arrest procedures for petty offenses, e.g., disturbance of the
 peace and traffic violations, as well as detention procedures
 pending deportation. Such administrative arrest has no
 effect on the respect for civil rights, inasmuch as the
 period of such arrest is regulated and limited by law.
 Detention pending deportation may not exceed three months.
 The law provides for control of such proceedings by either
 the administrative or the constitutional court.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Arrested persons may be placed in pre-trial,
 investigative detention after finding by an investigative
 judge that substantial grounds exist for investigation of a
 possible, specific criminal charge. The period of detention
 pending investigation is limited to six months and may be
 extended for up to one year (in rare cases involving a
 major crime for up to two years) by higher court. Formal,
 clearly stated charges are brought at the completion of the
 investigation, and trial follows speedily thereafter. The
 judiciary is fully independent of the military and the
 executive. The right to appeal to a higher court is
 guaranteed by pertinent provisions of the Austrian Code of
 Criminal Procedure and is fully respected in practice.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 A search warrant, issued by a judge, is required for entry
 of a private residence without consent. In the event of
 rational grounds for the presumption of a public hazard
 or in pursuit of a fugitive from justice the police may
 enter private premises without a warrant. Freedom from
 invasion of the home is guaranteed by law.  (1) Law
 No. 88 of October 27, 1892, which is incorporated in the
 Austrian constitution; (2) Pertinent provisions of the
 Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure, and (3) Article 8
 of the 1950 Human Rights Convention and is fully respected
 in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Austria has a highly developed social welfare system. An
 equitable distribution of income is achieved through a
 progressive income tax system. Government, labor and
 management cooperate well in a "social partnership" which
 has been effective in avoiding serious labor-management
 disputes and in maintaining a high level of employment.
 Basic human needs are met for all citizens. Austria's
 socialist government places heavy emphasis on maintaining
 and improving health, education and social services. The
 right to own property in Austria is not limited, although,
 in the absence of an international agreement, aliens must
 obtain approval for the acquisition of property from the
 provincial authorities in the province where the property
 is situated. Expropriation of property is permissible only
 if it is required in the public interest, and a fair value
 must be paid to the expropriated property owner.
 As in most industrialized countries, women are assuming more
 important positions in Austrian society. Women enjoy by
 law full equality with men in Austria, but there are differences
 in treatment resulting from tradition and local custom.
 For example, equal pay is guaranteed for equal work, but
 women sometimes have difficulties in being assigned to
 well-paying jobs. Women's prospects for promotions are often
 
 
 732
 hampered by factors like maternity leave, their refusal
 to work overtime because of children's sickness, etc. It
 is still difficult for women to get into leading positions,
 especially in rural areas where women are more strongly
 bound by tradition.
 The Austrian State Treaty states that the Slovene and Croatian
 minorities shall enjoy the same rights on equal terms as
 all other Austrian nationals, and it protects their ethnic
 rights. The Austrian parliament in 1976 passed a law
 regulating the legal status of these ethnic groups, reserving
 to the national government the power to decree where a
 minority language shall be accepted as an official language,
 in addition to German, and other aspects of the Austrian state's
 relationship to these minorities. There are disagreements
 regarding the compliance of the Austrian government with the
 terms of the State Treaty on minority rights. The Austrian
 government claims that its efforts on behalf of the ethnic
 minorities have been adequate and that further steps in
 some areas, such as bilingualism in judicial and adminis-
 trative bodies, and in the civil service in areas where there
 are substantial numbers of minorities, are not feasible
 given the high economic cost and the great imbalance in the
 number of people in minority groups as related to the general
 population. This position is challenged by some minority
 group representatives. It is unlikely that these differences
 will be resolved, but the Austrian government continues to
 hold regular meetings with minority representatives in
 an effort to respond to their concerns, to reduce the
 emotional strains caused by these disagreements, and to
 demonstrate its concern for the interests of the minority
 groups.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Labor unions enjoy full
 rights and privileges.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel
 and emigration are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Austria's record in refugee affairs is excellent.
 Austria has acted as a land of first asylum (its primary
 role), and has also granted permanent refuge to great
 numbers of ethnic German, Hungarians (1956), Czechs and Slovaks
 (1968/9), and other Eastern Europeans.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Women participate widely
 in the political process; they hold a number of important
 positions in party structures as well as in government.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no investigations of Austria's human rights
 record nor have there been any requests for such investigation
 by major, non-governmental human rights organizations.
 Austria has deposited a declaration with the Secretary
 General of the Council of Europe recognizing the competence
 of the Human Rights Commission in Strasbourg under Article 25
 of the European Convention to receive petitions from any
 person or persons claiming to be a victim of a violation
 of the rights set forth in the convention, and undertaking
 not to hinder the effective exercise of these rights. Thus
 persons believing that their rights have been infringed by
 the Austrian authorities may bring the matter before the
 commission.
