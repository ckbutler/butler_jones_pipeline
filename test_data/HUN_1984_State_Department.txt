 HUNGARY
 Hungary is ruled by the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist
 Workers (Communist) Party, which maintains a complete monopoly
 on political power. Although most civil rights are prescribed
 by the Constitution, the exercise of such rights is in
 practice often arbitrarily restricted.
 Since the early 19601s, the party has gradually eased internal
 controls and permitted a greater degree of economic well-being
 and cultural diversity. The party has sought public support
 through an explicitly stated policy of social reconciliation
 under the tenet 'who is not against us is with us.'
 Nevertheless, it tightly controls the expression of political
 opinion, and participation in the political process is not
 possible outside the limits which it sets.
 The human rights situation during 1984 remained generally
 unchanged. Official harassment of dissidents involved in
 samizdat (self-published)'press activities continued at a
 relatively moderate level. The activities of political
 nonconformists were closely controlled. There was some
 tightening in the party's cultural policy in 1984. Although
 no human rights activists were known to be arrested or
 imprisoned, at least one individual was temporarily detained
 in June and, in November, was subjected to a form of house
 arrest. The authorities have also generally succeeded in
 quashing a would-be autonomous peace movement which questioned
 Soviet as well as NATO nuclear weaponry.
 The Government announced that it would increase participation
 in the political system by requiring multiple candidates for
 most parliamentary and local council seats at the 1985
 elections, and by decentralizing some governmental authority.
 Contested elections are slated to be held in 1985 for the
 first time also in the Hungarian trade unions. Individual
 candidates will be subject to the approval of respective party
 and trade union councils.
 Two notable events occurred in church-state relations in 1984:
 one was the~convocation of the Lutheran World Federation in
 Budapest in July 1984, the first time such an assembly was
 held in a Soviet bloc country. The other was a gathering of
 Hungarian religious leaders in the Parliament building on the
 occasion of celebration of Cardinal Lekai's 50th anniversary
 in the priesthood. The state took the unusual step of
 granting a parcel of land to the Roman Catholic Church for the
 construction of a new church in Budapest.
 Although Hungary's economic prospects were burdened by
 uncertainties, its economic reforms encouraging individual
 initiative and a private entrepreneurial spirit continued to
 unfold. Hungarians are less burdened by the economic
 restrictions which beset other Warsaw Pact states, and their
 standard of living compares favorably with those of the other
 Eastern European countries.

 HUNGARY
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence that killing for political motives
 occurred in Hungary during 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reported disappearances in Hungary during
 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No known instances of torture have occurred in Hungary in
 recent years. There are reports that some who were involved
 in the 1956 revolution continue to have their activities
 limited. Citizens, in principle, may bring complaints against
 the police.
 Tnere are three levels of punitive incarceration in Hungary:
 workhouse, which allows some privileges of visiting, outside
 work, and leave; jail, which is more punitive; and prison,
 which means a maximum-security penitentiary. Confinement
 conditions vary in relation to the category level of
 incarceration, but all levels are believed to provide adequate
 diet and health care. Hardened criminals are confined
 separately from those convicted of petty crimes. With varying
 degrees of frequency, depending on levels of imprisonment,
 prisoners have rights to visitation by family members, other
 relatives, and friends. There does not appear to be
 deliberate and willful or systematic mistreatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Citizens are generally free from arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of what offense
 he or she is suspected of having committed and can be held at
 a police station for a maximum of 72 hours before charges must
 be filed. There is no right of bail or provisional pretrial
 liberty. In cases of suspicion for major crimes, a person can
 be held in jail 30 days before trial, renewable twice for a
 maximum of 3 months.
 Hungary's penal code contains an article on incitement which
 permits officials to prosecute for a wide range of utterances
 or statements. There are reports of individuals being
 sentenced for denouncing the Communist Party or the Soviet
 occupation of Hungary. It is not clear how many cases of
 incitement involve political matters. Official statistics
 show that 41 cases arose in 1983, resulting in 11 indictments.
 In addition, Hungarian law allows for administrative
 procedures to be applied by police against certain types of
 offenders. These include various restrictions on movement and
 forms of house arrest. Although these procedures are not
 often applied, and then usually against criminal offenders, in
 at least one case in 1984 they were applied against a person
 for dissident activity. In November, police placed dissident
 intellectual Gyorgy Krasso, a samizdat activist, under
 
 
 1004
 HUNGARY
 indefinite "police surveillance.' His personal papers were
 confiscated, he was forbidden to leave his home between the
 hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., he may not appear in public places
 such as restaurants, cafes, sports facilities, or movie
 houses, and he must report regularly to the police. He faces
 the prospect of fines or imprisonment if he violates any of
 these prohibitions. He has not been charged, tried, or
 sentenced in any judicial proceeding.
 Another penal code provision on "espionage' provides for
 punishing *a person who obtains, collects, or gives out data
 which can be used against the Hungarian People's Republic with
 the purpose of forwarding them to a foreign government or
 organization...' Neither the nature of the data transmitted
 nor the nature of the recipient organization is clearly
 defined, thus allowing a broad interpretation by the
 authorities of the kind of "data' considered to be proscribed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution stipulates that all court proceedings are
 open, except for cases specifically exempted by law (those
 involving morals or state secrets); and that 'all courts are
 independent* and 'subject to laws.'
 There are few closed trials in Hungary. Those which are
 closed usually involve *national security,' not otherwise
 defined. In general, judicial procedures are investigatory
 rather than adversarial in nature. There is no trial by
 jury. Defendants have the right to choose their own counsel.
 Courts normally seek to apply the law in a methodical fashion,
 and non-political trials are more likely to be handled in an
 impartial manner than are trials involving offenses considered
 to be political or crimes 'against the state.'
 According to a statement by the Hungarian Minister of Justice
 in October 1980, two-tenths of 1 percent of all Hungarians in
 jail can be classified as political prisoners, indicating an
 actual total of less than 50 individuals. The Minister
 described three categories of political offenses; war crimes,
 espionage, and "incitement against the Hungarian
 Constitution.' However, in an article published in February
 1984, a professor at the Hungarian Police Academy referred to
 a study of 402 cases involving 570 persons accused on charges
 of incitement and harming the public interest. Such charges
 are often used to cover political offenses.
 Additionally, some young men are still believed to be serving
 jail sentences of up to 3 years for having refused
 conscription on the grounds of conscientious objection to
 military service.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, as well as the privacy of correspondence and
 the home, but in practice these are violated whenever the
 authorities determine it to be in the state's interest.
 However, Hungarian practice does appear to afford a measure of
 due process. For example, search warrants are generally
 obtained. House searches are conducted by a court order and
 must be carried out in the presence of two witnesses. A
 
 
 1005
 HUNGARY
 written inventory must be prepared of items removed from the
 premises. These procedures are generally adhered to.
 In accord with the motto announced by Communist Party leader
 Janos Kadar in the early 1960's--Ihe who is not against us is
 with us*--Hungarian practice has become more tolerant with
 respect to private activities of individuals. Gathering
 personal information by formal systems such as block wardens,
 the use of informers, and overt intrusions of the police into
 the daily lives of persons has been substantially reduced. It.
 is widely assumed, however, that private telephone lines are
 tapped and correspondence opened when the authorities have an
 interest in doing so. Western radio broadcasts are not
 jammed. Parents who seek to provide religious instruction to
 their children in their homes are apparently not harassed.
 Membership in the Communist Party or in party youth and other
 organizations is not mandatory, though the absence of
 membership can have an adverse impact upon career
 possibilities in some fields.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for free speech and free press, but
 in practice these rights are subject to substantial
 limitations. According to the Constitution, these rights are
 qualified by the need to conform to the winterests of
 socialism and the people.' A Hungarian citizen may not speak
 publicly against the Communist form of government or Hungary's
 alliance with the Soviet Union. If a citizen publicly opposes
 these basic tenets, he or she may be subjected to varying
 measures of admonition, harassment, and punishment.
 Self-censorship in media and cultural circles is pervasive,
 and prepublication censorship occurs from time to time.
 Hungarian press, radio, and television are government-owned
 and carefully adhere to the party's press and ideological
 guidelines. Editors of newspapers who do not conform
 sufficiently through self-censorship are subject to removal.
 As a result, though some carefully nuanced differing views
 occasionally appear in the press and literature, they are
 usually well within the general constraints imposed by the
 party. The authorities have banned the circulation of certain
 books, magazines, and articles considered not to conform with
 accepted positions. The right to publish may be restricted
 for political reasons. A most recent example of official
 press censorship involved the August 1984 issue of a literary
 publication Mozgo Vilag which was shredded because of two
 articles about Trotsky. An alternate issue was distributed
 later. The public medium which enjoys relatively the greatest
 freedom of political expression is film, although the most
 politically controversial are typically withheld from public
 distribution unless specially authorized.
 Western viewpoints can be heard infrequently on Hungarian
 radio and television. These may be the views of a Western
 spokesman, broadcast together with those of other participants
 in a panel discussion, or straight reporting of a Western
 official's comments on a topical international issue such as
 U.S.-Soviet relations or events in Afghanistan or Poland.
 Hungary does not jam Western radio broadcasts, and Austrian
 and Yugoslav radio and television broadcasts reach much of the
 country. Hungary also permits some access to Western
 
 
 1006
 HUNGARY
 literature and films, including television programs. Some
 Western periodicals are available in limited quantities in
 Hungary, usually in hotels frequented by foreigners, but also
 in university libraries.
 Political dissidence is kept in check by official harassment.
 Dissident activity in Hungary seems to emanate mainly from
 intellectuals living primarily in Budapest. However, the
 February 1984 article referred to in Section l.e. concerning a
 study of cases of incitement and harming the public interest
 points out that in that study, nearly 80 percent of those
 persons involved were of working class origin and had not even
 finished high school. The implication is that dissident
 activities or expressions of dissatisfaction with the regime
 may not be limited solely to a small group of intellectuals.
 Hungary's economic progress over the last decade, its emphasis
 on consumerism, and its willingness to permit more frequent
 travel to the West than do other Warsaw Pact states have
 helped limit the appeal that dissident thought has for much of
 society. The Government has also shown a general willingness
 to tolerate without explicit reply or rejoinder some
 expressions of dissent. It has, however, occasionally
 expelled or encouraged the emigration to the West of outspoken
 opponents of the political system. In a recent case, a
 dissident was denied an exit visa to study abroad and was told
 that if he wished to leave Hungary, he would be allowed to do
 so only as an emigrant.
 Hungarian dissidents meet irregularly for private discussions
 of political and other topics. One of the several groups of
 Hungarian dissidents is active in the distribution of
 prohibited books and articles in samizdat (self-published)
 form. Since December 1982, the authorities have engaged in a
 campaign of harassment against samizdat activists. There have
 been occasional press articles attacking dissidents and their
 alleged Western supporters, periodic raids on dissidents'
 homes, and confiscations of samizdat material. A high level
 of activity, however, continues. Ten issues of the most
 sophisticated samizdat publication, the journal Beszelo, which
 discusses subjects and themes not permitted in the official
 press, have been circulated since late 1981. Each of the most
 recent issues was printed in approximately 2,000 copies, which
 were then passed informally to a wider readership throughout
 the country. Distribution of Beszelo and other samizdat
 literature is now believed to occur in a decentralized
 fashion.
 No arrests for dissident activity are known to have occurred
 in 1984, although Gyorgy Krasso, mentioned in Section l.d.,
 was briefly detained by police. During the summer of 1983,
 legal amendments were adopted permitting the authorities to
 impose fines on individuals involved in unauthorized
 publishing by administrative means without the need to resort
 to court trial. On at least two occasions in 1984, the police
 in Budapest levied fines of 9,000 and 10,000 forints (about
 $180 and $200) upon people caught possessing or distributing
 samizdat material. The police are empowered to take this
 action independent of and without appeal to the court system.
 Other means by which the authorities seek to discourage or at
 least moderate dissident activities are the exercise of
 official influence on employment possibilities and arbitrary
 denials of travels abroad for some dissidents.
 
 
 1007
 HUNGARY
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 the right to form associations, government approval or tacit
 acceptance is required for the exercise of these rights.
 Hungarian dissidents are loosely organized. In December 1979,
 young intellectuals and professionals formed a group which
 they called the Foundation for the Assistance of the Poor
 (known by its Hungarian acronym SZETA). The stated purpose of
 the group was to raise money and provide financial, legal, and
 other assistance for the poor within Hungarian society. Their
 most significant activity was the samizdat publication in 1983
 of a well-printed collection of essays, poems, and drawings by
 37 writers and artists, some of them prominent members of the
 establishment. The proceeds from the sale of this book, In
 the Dark, were donated to the poor. SZETA continued its
 activities in 1984, but at a much lower level after harassment
 by the authorities. Other dissidents meet frequently at an
 informal 'free university' in Budapest, where academicians and
 dissidents lecture on topics which are not discussed in formal
 university institutions.
 A fledgling organization called "Peace Group for Dialogue* was
 organized in the second half of 1982 by young people,
 primarily university students and recent graduates. By 1984,
 many of the group's leaders had left the organization, and
 membership in the group declined drastically from a one-time
 high of several hundred. *Many young people apparently
 concluded that the authorities were not prepared to tolerate a
 genuinely autonomous peace group, and they did not wish to
 risk their careers by remaining with an organization whose
 members were increasingly being treated as dissidents.
 The Hungarian National Trade Union Council is controlled and
 directed by the party. It serves the purpose of
 indoctrinating workers in party policy and also purports to
 represent worker interests within certain bounds. The
 Secretary General of the Council is a member of the Communist
 Party's Politburo. On the local and enterprise level, the
 Council has a veto over nominations of managers by the state,
 and administers a system of shop distribution of bonus money,
 profit sharing, enterprise-controlled housing, health care,
 union vacation plans, and other benefits.  Stewards can veto
 management decisions on personnel actions, plant safety, and
 other work-related issues which do not comply with collective
 agreements and labor regulations. Disputed questions are
 referred to higher authorities for arbitration. The Council
 announced in 1984 that it plans to follow the new practice,
 dictated for the National Assembly (Parliament) and local
 councils, of holding contested elections for the majority of
 union offices in 1985, in this case between candidates
 approved by the Trade Union Council.
 The Hungarian Constitution does not provide for the right to
 strike, but a number of Hungarian commentators have pointed
 out that they are not prohibited by law. There have been at
 least two or three localized strikes of several hours'
 duration in each of the major branches of Hungarian industry
 in the past 7 or 8 years. These strikes are described as due
 to the failure of management and union officials to implement
 existing agreements or to utilize other existing methods of
 conflict resolution. No major work stoppage which has either
 
 
 1008
 HUNGARY
 affected an entire industrial sector or assumed nationwide
 proportions has taken place in over a quarter of a century.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although freedom of conscience and freedom of religious
 practice are provided for in the Constitution, they are
 subject to restrictions. While committed to atheism, the
 authorities profess the acceptability of believers and
 non-believers working together in the interest of "socialist
 society.' The Government has generally improved relations
 with the hierarchies of the major religious denominations,
 many of which have representatives in the National Assembly.
 Holding religious beliefs, however, can limit the citizen's
 advancement in government, industry, and the professions.
 Some 19 religious denominations are recognized by law; small
 groups such as Jehovah's witnesses exist but are not
 recognized. Sizable religious groups include Roman Catholics
 (5.25 million), Reformed Calvinists (2 million), Evangelical
 Lutherans (0.5 million), and Jews (100,000). The total number
 of persons manifesting some religious belief is estimated at
 8.5 million out of a population of 10.7 million.
 There were several positive developments in church-state
 relations in 1984. The Catholic Church obtained greater
 flexibility to offer religious instruction to children. It
 also made some progress in the establishment of a new
 religious order of nuns dedicated to the care of elderly and
 infirm citizens. In October 1984, the state granted the
 Church a parcel of land for the construction of a new building
 in Budapest on the occasion of 50th anniversary in the
 priesthood of the Primate of Hungary, Cardinal Lekai.
 Religious denominations maintain close connections with their
 counterparts in other countries. They also have generally
 good access to religious materials, including Bibles and
 prayer books. In many cases, they print their own. They also
 publish periodicals and newspapers subject to the same state
 control as the publishing of secular material. During 1984,
 party and state officials expressed increased interest in
 cooperating with religious denominations on social matters of
 mutual concern, including adequate health care, the high
 divorce and alcohol rates, and juvenile delinquency.
 The churches do not act as organizing centers for dissent.
 However, dissension has grown up within the Catholic Church
 centering around the *basic community" movement, which has
 accused the hierarchy of being 'collaborationist.* The
 Hungarian authorities have not detained or arrested any
 clergy, but approximately 12 people have been sentenced to
 prison terms ranging up to 3 years for refusing military
 service. The right of conscientious objection is recognized
 for two small denominations, the Nazarenes and the Jehovah's
 Witnesses, but not for other Hungarians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The right of travel remains at the discretion of the state
 rather than a prerogative of the individual. Exit permission
 for both Hungarian tourists and emigrants can be and
 occasionally is denied for vague *reasons of state.' There
 are indications that such permission in certain instances has
 
 
 1009
 HUNGARY
 been denied to dissidents in order to pressure them to abandon
 or reduce their dissident activities.
 Hungary eased its travel regulations for visits to Western
 countries effective January 1, 1982. More than 500,000
 Hungarians currently visit the West annually, while more than
 5 million visits are made annually to Warsaw Pact countries.
 It is possible to pay for trips to Western Europe and other
 countries in Hungarian currency. Hungarian citizens now have
 the opportunity legally to visit the West at least once a year.
 --instead of every third year as before--if relatives or
 friends abroad pay the costs.
 Hungarian emigration law is restrictive. A person can
 normally apply to emigrate only if over 55 years of age and
 joining a parent, spouse, or child abroad. However, the law
 provides for exceptions in individual cases, and approximately
 90 percent of Hungarians who apply to emigrate for purposes of
 family reunification receive permission. Persons who are
 refused permission to emigrate may appeal and reapply;
 reapplications are sometimes successful, particularly if there
 are special humanitarian considerations. No systematic
 official sanctions, such as loss of employment or housing, are
 imposed on persons who seek to emigrate, and emigrants may
 take a modest amount of personal property with them. There
 are no outstanding divided family cases, and at present there
 is only one emigration problem involving a dual national.
 Persons who have emigrated legally from Hungary have a right
 to return. Persons who leave Hungary as visitors with
 permission to stay abroad only temporarily and who fail to
 return are subject to prosecution and sentencing either in
 absentia or upon their return. Their property becomes subject
 to confiscation. Hungary appears to follow, however, a
 discretionary practice of treating such persons leniently, if
 they return. Prosecution may not occur or, when it does, may
 amount to a formality leading to a suspended sentence.
 Returnees probably would not be granted the privilege of
 visiting abroad again for up to 5 years. Sometimes sanctions,
 such as deprivation of former employment, are applied.
 All adult citizens are issued an identity booklet and must
 carry it with them at all times; they must register with local
 police when moving from one locality to another. Although it
 is possible to move from rural areas to Budapest, this is not
 encouraged because of overcrowding and a scarcity of housing
 in the capital.
 Regulations introduced in recent years liberalized and
 simplified procedures for Hungarians to obtain permission to
 work abroad for up to 5 years. In some instances, a Hungarian
 who desires to work in the West may now get approval at the
 local level. The regulations envisage that the family may
 accompany the worker. The worker must agree to remit 20
 percent of hard currency earnings to the Hungarian National
 Bank, which will convert them into a Hungarian currency
 account that may be utilized by the individual within Hungary;
 the worker will be able to retain the remainder in hard
 currency.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Hungary is ruled by the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist
 
 
 1010
 HUNGARY
 Workers (Communist) Party. Political activity is not possible
 outside the party or party-sanctioned organizations. The
 Constitution explicitly states that the party represents the
 "working class" and the "interests of the whole of the
 society.' The party uses sanctioned organizations such as the
 Patriotic People's Front, trade unions, and the Communist
 Youth League to elicit public support. To a growing extent,
 the party invites the views and opinions of non-party
 organizations, such as cooperatives' associations, on policy
 proposals in which they have an interest, but any
 implementation is at the discretion of the party.
 In 1983, the party announced a limited electoral reform in
 which 90 percent of the seats in the National Assembly
 (Parliament) and all seats in local councils must be contested
 by at least two candidates in the 1985 elections. Candidates
 need not necessarily be members of the party, but all will
 have to accept the policies of the party-controlIed Patriotic
 People's Front and must be deemed acceptable to that body.
 Multiple political parties will not be allowed. The party has
 stated that it recognizes a need to go beyond the development
 of electoral forms if the elections are to attract genuine
 public interest, and if the National Assembly and local
 councils are to become more significant institutions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Hungarian Government refuses to accept outside charges or
 investigations of alleged huran rights violations, claiming
 that this constitutes "interference in internal affairs."
 Hungary has shown a willingness to engage in discussions with
 other countries on all aspects of the Helsinki Final Act,
 including its human rights provisions. In certain elements of
 its bilateral dialogue with some other countries, Hungary has
 been willing to discuss quietly some individual problem cases,
 particularly cases dealing with emigration.
 Amnesty International's 1984 report (covering 1983) expressed
 concern about the imprisonment of conscientious objectors to
 military service, the arrest and harassment of people who
 exercised their right of non-violent freedom of expression,
 restrictions on public access to courtrooms in political trial
 cases, and the use of the death penalty. Freedom House rates
 Hungary 'partly free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Hungary's economy has many features which are unique in
 Eastern Europe. Most state-owned enterprises enjoy a
 relatively high degree of autonomy. In 1984, for the first
 time, workers in a Gyor factory elected a new manager rather
 than having one appointed from above. Government economic
 authorities do not as a rule impose specific production quotas
 on enterprises, but usually rely on macroeconomic policy tools
 to guide the economy. Some consumer prices, especially for
 food items, are set largely by free market forces.
 Proiessional and skilled workers have extensive employment
 opportunities, on a part-time or full-time basis, in the
 private and quasi-private sectors. There are no food
 shortages. Private farming activities have long been
 encouraged on both state and collective farms. Private
 farming accounts for about one-third of Hungary's total farm
 
 
 1011
 HUNGARY
 production. Moreover, the Hungarian Government has recently
 begun encouraging private enterprise-type activities in the
 consumer services sector and in small units within industrial
 enterprises. However, while the significance of private
 industrial activities is growing, the purely 'private sector"
 is still not expected to become a large component of the
 Hungarian economy. In short, through the combination of
 flexible prices and enterprise autonomy, as well as through
 government encourgement of private enterprise-type activities,
 Hungary has produced an economic system that is more sensitive.
 to consumer needs than other Eastern European economies.
 One area of the consumer sector where Hungary lags behind is
 in housing. In 1980, there was an average of 1.5 persons per
 room in Hungarian dwellings. Although this figure reflects
 overcrowding, it is an improvement over 1970, when the average
 was about two persons per room. A substantial portion of this
 improvement in housing conditions can be attributed to the
 Government's encouragement of private house construction.
 Hungary's standard of living is relatively high for Eastern
 Europe. Its per capita income in 1982 was estimated at
 $4,180. Life expectancy at birth is 72 years, the infant
 mortality rate per 1,000 live births is 18.6, and the ratio of
 caloric supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements is 133.8 percent. Hungary has an
 adult literacy rate of 98.9 percent. In 1981, the primary
 school enrollment ratio was 133 percent for both male and
 female children. The percentage of the population with access
 to safe water in 1980 was 64.9, 83.8 in urban areas, and 42.8
 in rural areas.
 More than one-third of the members of the National Assembly
 are women. Thirty-one percent of the positions on local
 councils, 42 percent of the leadership positions within the
 committees of the Young Communist League, and 51 percent of
 the officer positions in the trade union councils are filled
 by women. There are nevertheless few women at top levels in
 the Government or party. Women still account for only
 one-eighth of the management positions in Hungarian industry
 and agriculture. Approximately half of these individuals have
 attained their positions within the past 5 years. Women's
 share of the more senior jobs, such as general director at
 state industrial complexes, is considerably lower. Many women
 in such enterprises tend to work in the personnel and social
 welfare sections rather than in the economic policy-setting
 divisions. Women's share of professional positions has been
 increasing. At present, 7.6 percent of Hungarian women are
 professionals. The figure for men is 8.6 percent.
 Ethnic minorities such as Germans, Slovaks, Serbs, and
 Romanians make up a very small percentage of the Hungarian
 population. Hungarian minority policy is liberal in theory
 and practice. Members of the minorities have full legal
 equality. As a result of Hungarian social and economic policy,
 minorities have substantial opportunity to obtain at least
 some education in their native language, as well as to foster
 their native cultures. Several million ethnic Hungarians live
 in neighboring countries, particularly Romania and
 Czechoslovakia.
 A much larger number of Gypsies (estimates range up to 5
 percent of the population) live in Hungary. They are not
 recognized as an official minority. Gypsies as individuals
 
 
 1012
 HUNGARY
 have equality before the law. In practice, the Hungarian
 Government engages in many programs specifically designed to
 raise the standard of living of Gypsies and help them to
 adjust to the mainstream of Hungarian life. Gypsies are on
 the average, however, considerably less well educated and
 poorer than the majority Magyar population or the recognized
 ethnic minorities. Candid discussion continues to appear in
 the press and specialized literature about the social and
 economic difficulties experienced by Gypsies, including the
 fact that considerable popular prejudice exists against them.
