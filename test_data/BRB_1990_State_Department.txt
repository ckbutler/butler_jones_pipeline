 BARBADOS
 Barbados is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty,
 parliamentary form of government and is a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations. Its House of Assembly is the third
 oldest elected body in the Western Hemisphere. Barbadians
 recognize the Queen of England as Head of State; she is
 represented locally by an appointed Governor General. The
 Prime Minister is the head of government and governs with an
 appointed Cabinet.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining
 public order; it respects constitutional and legal guarantees
 of human rights. Police morale has traditionally been good,
 and public respect for the police force is high. The small
 volunteer Barbados Defense Force is responsible for national
 security, but is used for public order in times of crisis,
 emergency, or other specific need.
 The country's economy, based on tourism, light manufacturing,
 services, and sugar, is highly susceptible to external
 economic developments. After several years of growth, the
 economy in 1990 experienced a downturn in several key sectors,
 most notably tourism.
 Barbados has a long record of respecting human rights. There
 was no change in that record during 1990.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c.   Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reports in 1990 of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment..
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. These provisions are respected in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and
 attorneys have ready access to their clients. Exile is not
 used as a punishment or means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal
 offenses be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Government
 provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts
 
 
 505
 BARBADOS
 independently and is free of intervention from other branches
 of government. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere arbitrarily in the private
 lives of its citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires judicial
 warrants to be issued before privately owned property may be
 entered and searched. The Government neither censors mail nor
 restricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or
 publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and
 these rights are respected in practice. There are five radio
 stations, two of which are government owned. CBC television
 service (the sole television station) is government owned.
 Views opposing government policies are regularly-reported,
 although opposition political figures occasionally claim their
 positions are slighted or ignored. There are two independent
 daily newspapers in which opposing political views are
 presented. The Government regularly comes under attack in the
 newspapers and on daily call-in radio programs.
 Barbados is the site of the Cave Hill campus of the University
 of the West Indies; academicians across the political spectrum
 express their views freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government observes the constitutional guarantees of
 peaceful assembly and private association. Permits required
 for public demonstrations are routinely granted. Political
 parties, trade associations, and private organizations
 function and hold meetings and rallies without government
 hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and
 Methodist faiths have traditionally predominated, there are
 numerous other active religious denominations and
 organizations throughout the country. Foreign missionaries of
 various faiths proselytize freely. The Caribbean Conference
 of Churches is headquartered in Barbados and publishes its
 materials there.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados, and
 leave and enter the country without restriction. Barbados has
 a small number of applicants for admission as refugees; their
 applications are processed on a case-by-case basis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have this right in law and exercise it in practice.
 Political parties freely compete in fair elections by secret
 
 
 506
 BARBADOS
 ballot at least every 5 years. There are no impediments to
 participation in the political process, and all Barbadians
 over age 18 may vote. The present Democratic Labour Party
 (DLP) government won the May 1986 election, taking 24 of the
 27 seats and replacing the incumbent Barbados Labor Party
 (BLP) Government. A small Marxist party, the Workers Party of
 Barbados, was formed in 1985, but has attracted little
 support. It participated marginally in the 1986 election and
 holds no parliamentary seats. In 1989 four DLP Members of
 Parliament resigned from the party and formed the National
 Democratic Party, replacing the BLP as the official opposition
 by virtue of its four seats in Parliament. A Cabinet of
 Ministers appointed by the Prime Minister exercises executive
 power.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local groups concerned with human rights, including women's
 rights groups, operate freely.
 There were no reports of human rights violations in Barbados
 during 1990, and human rights groups have not requested any
 investigations. The Government publicly advocates
 strengthening the human rights machinery of the United Nations
 and the Organization of American States, as well as more
 investigations into alleged violations of human rights in
 other countries and the increased use of fact-finding or
 observer teams to monitor controversial political and
 electoral situations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law,
 regardless of race, religion, or sex. These provisions are
 respected in practice. Women-form a large percentage of heads
 of household in Barbados and are not discriminated against in
 public housing and other social welfare programs. Compulsory
 education through the secondary level is enforced uniformly.
 Barbados is a signatory of the 1979 Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
 Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and
 are well represented at all levels of both the public and
 private sectors. Women's rights groups exist, they are
 devoted primarily to promoting women's participation in the
 professions and, to a lesser extent, to safeguarding the legal
 rights of illegitimate children.
 Neither the Government nor women's rights groups have singled
 out violence against women as a particular or acute social
 problem, although the latter have pointed out that there is
 reluctance on the part of some victims to report such
 incidents. No statistics exist on the extent of spouse abuse,
 but in 1990 there were a number of cases in the local courts
 of, domestic violence against women involving assault or
 wounding. Criminal penalties for violent crimes are the same
 regardless of the sex of the offender or the victim.
 Penalties for simple assault are minimal for first offenders,
 usually a small fine. For repeat offenders or those with a
 history of violent acts, jail sentences are usually imposed.
 In cases of domestic violence, courts also typically issue
 restraining orders if requested by the victim, the breach of
 
 
 507
 BARBADOS
 which is punished by a jail sentence. The penalty for rape is
 imprisonment for up to 14 years.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a.   The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to form and belong to trade unions and
 to strike, and freely exercise these rights. There are two
 major unions and several smaller ones, representing various
 sectors of labor. The largest union, the Barbados Workers'
 Union (BWU), is historically closely associated with the
 governing DLP (BWU officers hold elected parliamentary seats
 and the appointed post of President of the Senate), but the
 union is not controlled by the party or the Government. There
 were a few brief strikes and industrial actions in 19%0, but
 no significant work stoppages. Strikes are iMlegal in public
 services. Barbadian trade unions are free-to affiliate
 internationalay and are active in a variety of regional and
 international labor organizations. Barbados is a member of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 b. The Right to Organize and Barga-in Callectively
 The rights to organize- and to bargain collectively are
 provided by law and respected in practice. Over 20 percent of
 the working population is. organized, and wage and working
 conditions are negotiated through the collective bargaining
 process. Employers have no legal obligation to recognize
 unions under the Trade Union Act of 1964, but most do when a
 majority of their employees signify a desire to become
 represented by a registered union. While there is no specific
 law prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the regular courts
 provide a method of redress for employees alleging unfair
 dismissal. The courts commonly award monetary compensation
 but rarely order reemployment. There are no manufacturing or
 special areas where collective bargaining rights are legally
 or administratively impaired. Barbados has no specially
 designated.export processing zones. In November the ILO's
 Committee on Freedom of Asseciation reiterated that the
 Government's refusal to implement a collective bargaining
 agreement reached by a state-subsidized agency, because the,
 agreement did not conform t6 policy guidelines, was not in
 full conformity with the principles of freedom of
 association.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum working age of 16 in Barbados is generally
 observed. Minimum age limitations are reinforced by
 compulsory primary and secondary education policies. The
 Labor Department has a small cadre of labor inspectors who
 conduct spot investigations of enterprises and check records
 to verify compliance with the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave. Minimum
 wages for specified categories of workers are administratively
 
 
 508
 BARBADOS
 established and enforced by law. The minimum wage for shop
 assistants (entry level commercial workers), $75 per week, is
 marginally sufficient to meet minimal living standards; most
 employees earn more. All workers are covered by unemployment
 benefits legislation, and by national insurance (social
 security) legislation. A comprehensive government-sponsored
 health program offers subsidized treatment and medication.
 Legally mandated health and safety standards are enforced by
 the Department of Labor as effectively as staff and equipment
 allow, and are in keeping with normal standards. At year's
 end, the Government was reviewing the health and safety
 standards in the Factories Act of 1983, with a view to
 strengthening the law.
