 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a President and a unicameral Con-
 gress elected for 4-year terms, and an independent judiciary headed by a Supreme
 Court of Justice (CSJ). Liberal Party candidate Carlos Roberto Reina was elected
 President in November and took office on January 27, 1994. The November elections
 were marked by higher than usual absenteeism but little indication of fraud. Depu-
 ties continued to be elected indirectly from a slate, based on the vote totals for the
 presidential candidate.
 The Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) comprise not only the army, air force, and
 navy but also the national police (Public Security Force-FUSEP) as a fourth
 branch. Credible allegationsof extrajudicial killings by members of the FUSEP, tar-
 ticularly its Directorate of National Investigations (DNI), led to establishment of an
 Ad Hoc Commission on Police and Judicial Reform. It recommended creation of a
 new Public Ministry to manage every aspect of the investigative phase of criminal
 cases and a new Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DIC) to replace the DNI.
 Congress passed enabling legislation for the Public Ministry in December.
 The HOAF operates with considerable institutional and legal autonomy, particu-
 larly in the realm of internal security and military affairs. The military also plays
 a sizable role in the national economy, operating numerous enterprises usually asso-
 ciated with the private sector. In 1993 Congress passed a resolution restricting the
 jurisdiction of the military court system to military crimes committed by active duty
 personnel. Since then enlisted military personnel accused of crimes against civilians
 were in fact remanded to the civilian judicial system, although the congressional
 ruling has not been tested by an accusation against a senior military officer.
 The Honduran economy is based upon agriculture, with a small light manufactur-
 ing sector. Despite a relatively low inflation rate in the past few years, estimates
 for 1993 were above 10 percent. In 1993 real economic growth was expected to be
 about 3.5 percent. Per capita income in 1992 was estimated to be $637, combined
 unemployment and underemployment as high as 58 percent, and literacy only 67
 percent. The United Nations Development Program estimated that 74 percent of
 Hondurans lived in poverty.
 The principal human rights problems were extrajudicial killings,arbitrary and in-
 communicado detentions, and torture and abuse of detainees. However, reports of
 such abuses fell sharply following the establishment in March of a joint civilian-
 military supervisory board to oversee the activities of the DNI, the agency whose
 
 
 officers were most frequently criticized for abuses. The root cause of Honduras'
 human rights problems is the near-complete impunity before the law enjoyed by
 members of the civilian and military elite. The weak judicial system, intentionally
 underfunded and plagued by corruption, is unable to press cases against the
 wealthy and the powerful. Almost no elected official, member of the business elite,
 bureaucrat, politician, or anyone with perceived influence or connections to the elite
 was tried, sentenced, or even fined in 1993. Some progress in eroding the traditional
 impunity of military officers was made with the arrest and incarceration of three
 colonels pending trial or sentencing.
 National Human Rights Commissioner Leo Valladares at the end of December is-
 sued his preliminary report on politically motivated disappearances occurring be-
 tween 1979 and 1989. The report states that 184 individuals of various nationalities
 "disappeared" in Honduras during that period and that the HOAF and the former
 Nicaraguan Resistance were apparently responsible for the majority of the crimes.
 Valladares called on the judiciary to use his report as a basis for investigation of
 these matters. He included in his report unsubstantiated material from news arti-
 cles dating from the 1980's which claimed that U.S. advisers were working with the
 HOAF and Nicaraguan Resistance in Honduras and may have known of and toler-
 ated the disappearances.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-As in previous years, some members
 of the police and security forces were involved in extro.udicial killings; those pros-
 ecuted tended to be only from the ranks of enlisted men. Officers continued to enjoy
 impunity, despite the notable exception of the military officers tried and convicted
 in 1993 in the Riccy Mabel Martinez case (see below).
 In November five DNI agents were arrested and turned over to civilian judicial
 authorities for the torture and murder of narcotics suspect Jorge Alcides Medina
 Hernandez. He had been arrested earlier and then released; when his bod, was
 found, investigation revealed that he had been picked up a second time by the DNI
 agents. Authorities concluded he had been killed during interrogation; the fact that
 the DNI surrendered the perpetrators reflected compliance wit the congressional
 decree requiring all but strictly military crimes be handled by civilian courts (see
 Section i.e.). After the end of the year, seven FUSEP agents were arrested foe" rob-
 bing and killing a Nicaraguan in mid-December.
 In late January, San Pedro Sula businessman Eduardo Pina Van Tuyl was killed
 in a drive-by shooting. A television reporter, Eduardo Coto, witnessed the killers
 fleeing the scene. Later he claimed to have been threatened that day by a military
 officer who %yarned him not to implicate the armed forces in the crime. Fearing for
 his life, Coto sought refuge hi Lhe offices of Tiempo newspaper and later fled to
 Spain under Spanish government sponsorship. Following Coto a flight to Spain, the
 Commission for Human Rights (CODER) alleged that he had identified several serv-
 ing members of the armed forces as the perpetrators. The home of Yani R.senthal,
 editor of Tiempo, was bombed in what was alleged to be retaliation for having shel-
 tered Coto. U-on Coto's return from Spain in June, he recanted his earlier staia-
 ments made through CODEH implicating the military personnel, and id~lentified two
 common criminals, already in prison on unrelated charges, as having been resr. n-
 sible for the assassination. The two perons identified by Coto remained in jail
 awaiting trial at year's end.
 In February Eli Josue Zuniga, a former member of the San Pedro Sula office of
 the DNI, alleged that the office's antinarcotics unit had killed Pina and committed
 a number of other murders related to the unit's involvement in drug trefficking. De-
 spite Zuniga's low personal credibility (he had been dismissed from the DNI for mis-
 conduct) and the Tact that his information consisted almost entirely of hearsay,
 many Hondurans found credible his allegations that the DNI was involved in crimi-
 nal activities, including murder and drug trafficking.
 Zuniga and others alleged that the January killings of San Pedro businessman
 Guillermo Agurcia Lefebvre and his companion, Lourdes Enamorado were also per-
 petrated by the supposed clique of drug traffickers within the DNI. Although the
 medical examiner ruled the deaths a murder-suicide, Agria Lefebvre- who sup-
 posedly killed Enamorado before committing suicide- died of two gunshots to the
 chest. Aguria Lcfebvre's mother claimed that four police agents committed the
 crime and that a Captain Mendieta, then allegedly a member of the San Pedro Sula
 DNI, ordered the killing to cover up the units involvement in drug trafficking. No
 investigation of the victim's mother's allegations of DNI involvement was conducted,
 and none of the five police personnel she named was indicted. The FUSEP inves-
 
 
 tigation resulted in detention of a common criminal and initiation of court proceed-
 ings against him; he remains in prison awaiting trial. Mrs. Lefevbre claimed in No-
 vember that she was removed from the list of candidates for election as deputy to
 the Central American Parliament under pressure from HOAF Commander in Chief
 Discua, owing to his annoyance with her continued allegations of wrongdoing by
 military personnel. General Discua denied the charge.
 Also in January, Liberal Party Congssional Deputy Carlos Montoya was accused
 of killing a laborer, Juan Jose Menendez, who was reportedly illegally fishing on his
 land. First reports by eyewitnesses claimed that Montoya arrived in a vehicle with
 2 bodyguards and ordered 30 people fishing off his land, waving a submachine gun
 and firing shots in the air, one of which hit Menendez in the back, killing him in-
 stantly. Seven eyewitnesses, including Menendez' nephew, reported the crime to
 both the press and a justice of the peace. Montoya's claim of self-defense does not
 appear credible, based on his own initial remarks and the eyewitness testimony;
 Tontoya at first admitted shooting Menendez but called it an accident. Montoya
 later denied that he had fired any shots, claiming that his bodyguard had fired the
 fatal shot when he feared for Montoya's safety, .although the victim appeared to be
 fleeing the scene when he was struck.
 Within days, the judge who had begun to investigate the case was removed from
 office by the Supreme Court. Although the judge was relieved for corruption unre-
 lated to the Menendez killing (in fact, the process to remove him had begun weeks
 before), the timing of his firing caused the perception that the Supreme Court took
 the action to protect Montoya. As a congressman, Montoya had enjoyed immunity
 from prosecution, but in November he failed to win reelection. Subsequently, his im-
 munity was restored in December via special legislation granting "Honorary Dep-
 uty" status to all former congressional presidents (Montoya served as president of
 the Congress in the 1980's). Montoya will thereby have immunity from judicial ac-
 tion, including with respect to the killing of Menendez, at least while Congress is
 in session. Menendez' family protested the extension of immunity to Montoya.
 Rural leader Cleofes Colindres Canales, a member of a cooperative granted land
 in 1980 by the National Agrarian Institute (INA), was murdered in November. In
 July a combined force of FUSEP agents and military troops, acting on orders from
 INA, had forcibly removed the cooperative from the site and destroyed members'
 homes. Colindres was organizing a move back to the land when he was killed, ap-
 parently with FUSEP involvement and perhaps in collaboration with the wealthy
 original owner of the land. No action was taken against the guards or landowner,
 nor did it appear that the crime was being investigated.
 Soldiers from the 15th infantry battalion shot and killed Glenda Patricia
 Solorzano Medina and injured three others in May in Olancho when troops fired
 wildly at a youth seeking to avoid being forcibly recruited into the military. Armed
 Forces Commander Discus publicly blamed the commander of the 15th battalion for
 the incident, whom he said had violated Discua's order to cease forced recruitment
 nationwide, pending the national elections. The military promised an immediate and
 full investigation and removed and detained the battalion commander. No legal ac-
 tion was taken against the commander or the soldier or soldiers involved in the inci-
 dent, and the dead woman's mother claimed she was pressured to cease her efforts
 to bring those responsible to justice.
 In December CODEH president Ramon Custodio criticized the failure to inves-
 tigate two recent murders of former leftist political activists. Roger David Torres
 Vallejos, who had been a member of the "Cinchoneros" terrorist group, was killed
 in October; Rigoberto Quezada Figueres, a former member of the Honduran Com-
 munist Party, was murdered in November. Both had returned to Honduras under
 the 1991 amnesty issued by President Callejas for leftist opponents of the Govern-
 ment. In both cases, police authorities called the killings the work of common crimi-
 nals.
 In July both defendants in the July 13, 1991, rape and murder of 18-year-old stu-
 dent Riccy Mabel Martinez were convicted. Colonel Angel Castillo Maradiaga was
 sentenced to 16 years and 6 months in prison. Of this sentence, 10 years and 6
 months were levied for the crime of simple homicide (equivalent to second degree
 murder), and 6 years for rape. Sergeant Santos Ilovares Funes was sentenced to 10
 years for simple homicide. The family of the victim appealed the verdict and re-
 quested that the defendants be convicted of first degree murder.
 In December Lt. Colonel Leonel Galindo Knutsen, accused in the May 1991 killing
 of five peasants at El Astillero, was released. Galindo had been detained since 1991
 by judicial military authorities, but in May 1993 his case was transferred to the ci-
 vilian courts. The private attorney prosecuting the case for the victims' families an-
 nounced her intention to appeal Gaindo's release.
 
 
 There has been no investigation or judicial followup in the following cases from
 past years.
 -The July 1992 killing of Juan Humberto Sanchez, allegedly by the HOAF;
 -The July 15, 1992, assassination of Rigoberto Borjas, in which the deposed left-
 ist leadership of the Electrical Worker's Union was a prime suspect;
 -The 1992 killing of Ramon Castellon Baide, allegedly by the Morazanista Patri-
 otic Front
 -The July 1992 killing of University professor Cayo Eng Lee;
 -The December 1991 murder of Manuel de Jesus Guerra, a leader of the Na-
 tional Central of Farm Workers (CNTC), allegedlycommitted by members of the San
 Pedro Sula DNI unit;
 -The 1990 killings of labor leader Francisco Javier Bonilla Medina and student
 leader Ramon Antonio Briceno. A suspect in Briceno's murder was arrested but was
 later released for lack of evidence.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1993.
 During the election campaign, when local human rights groups and Amnesty
 International continued to press for an official accounting of the approximately 145
 claimed disappearances (which mainly occurred during the early 1980's under the
 tenure of former armed forces Commander General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez), the
 presidential candidates discussed suggesting formation of a "Truth Commission" to
 nvestigate the disappearances. However, ater consultation with the Archbishop of
 Tegucigalpa, the candidates concluded that any investigation or report should be left
 in the hands of the judiciary and the Government's Human Rights Commission.
 In November National Human Rights Commissioner Leo Vlladares announced
 that he was undertsking a review o the 1979--89 disappearances and would report
 d of December. The nearly 1,000-page preliminary report, entitled "The
 Fascts Speak for Themselves," is a comprehensive collection of news articles, eye-
 witness accounts, and other materials related to the disappearances. In announcing
 release of the report, Dr. Valladares called upon judicial authorities to use the re-
 port as a basis for initiating investigations.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and police and military authorities issued assur-
 ances that the practice had been stopped. After release of the Ad Hoc Commission
 report and the creation of a civil-military board to help oversee the activities of the
 DNI, allegations of torture and abuse by that police agency droppd sharply. An ear-
 lier case of alleged torture occurred in February, when Jose E frain Orellano Garcia
 claimed he hadbeen beaten and submerged in a tank of water before being released
 from detention.
 The FUSEP Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) is supposed to investigate
 cases of alleged torture and to recommend sanctions for police agents found guilty
 of such abuse. However, neither the FUSEP General Command nor the OPR is em-
 powered to mete out punishment for wrongdoers; only the commander of the ac-
 cused wrongdoer has the authority to do so. There are no known instances of mem-
 bers of the Armed Forces ever being convicted of torture in a court of law.
 After a number of killings reportedly committed by DNI agents, an Ad Hoc Com-
 mission on Police and Judicial Reform was formed in February. It recommended cre-
 ating a new Public Ministry to manage every aspect of the investigative phase of
 criminal cases; Congress passed the enabling legislation for the Ministry on Decem-
 ber 10. The new Ministry is to be responsible for a Directorate of Criminal Inves-
 tigations (DIC), which would replace the DNI; the head of the DIC must be a civil-
 ian. A supervisory board consisting of two civilians and one police officer was cre-
 ated to investigate allegations of misconduct, dismiss wrongdoers or poorly trained
 agents, and generally oversee DNI activities during the transition to the DIC.
 Alfredo Landaverde, one of the civilian members of the new board, told the press
 in December that 150 DNI agents (42 percent of the DNI work force) had been dis-
 missed as a result of the board's work. The police and military also began in-house
 training programs to prevent the practice of torture and other forms of abuse.
 In contrast to these signs of progress, however, in December the nongovernmental
 Committee of the Families of the Disappeared of Honduras (COFADEH) alleged
 that two DNI agents had illegally detained and tortured three minors arrested on
 suspicion of robbery in November. They were released a week later after COFADEH
 requested assistance from board member Landaverde. COFADEH asked the crimi-
 nal court to order the arrest of the two DNI agents involved and an investigation
 of the allegations.
 Prison conditions in Honduras are consistently deplorable. Prisoners suffer from
 severe overcrowding, malnutrition, and a lack of adequate sanitation. In December
 the Government inaugurated a larger detention facility in Tamara to replace the an-
 
 
 478
 tiquated central penitentiary in Tegucigalpa. Prisoners with money routinely buy
 private cells, decent food, and conjugal visitation rights, while prisoners without
 money often lack the most basic necessities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law states that a person may be ar-
 rested only with a court order, unless the arrest is made during the commission of
 a crime, and that the person must be clearly informed of the grounds of the arrest.
 A detainee must be brought within 24 hours before a judge who then must issue
 an initial temporary holding order within 24 hours, release an initial decision within
 6 days, and conduct a preliminary investigation to decide whether there is sufficient
 evidence to warrant further investigation. While bail is legally available and used,
 poor defendants, even when represented by a public defender, are often unable to
 take advantage of it.
 Under the 1984 Code of Criminal Procedures, criminal proceedings may be initi-
 ated by a judge, the police, public officials, or any citizen. Perhaps as many as 80
 percent of the cases reported to the police are never referrvmd to the criminal justice
 system but instead are settled administrativelyby the police or by municipal courts
 (the latter are separate from the regular judicial court system).
 There continued to be allegations that the FUSEP, in particular the DNI, and
 other security force elements continued to practice arbitrary arrest and detention
 in a substantial number of cases. Local human rights monitoring organizations as-
 serted, however, that this situation improved markedly since the issuance of the Ad
 Hoc Commission report. They reported that the police were more aware of the need
 to comply with holding order limits and to respond to writs of habeas corpus, and
 that the courts were more aware of the need to process cases in a timely manner.
 'Land invasions" were both less common and much smaller in extent than in the
 past, although they still sometimes resulted in armed confiicts among groups of
 peasants or squatters and landowners and military forces. The Government abro-
 gated an unpopular antiterrorist law previously used to arrest squatters, although
 on occasion the military was employed to carry out forcibly court orders.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-An accused person has the right to a fair trial,
 which includes the right to an initial hearing by a judge, to bail to an attorney pro-
 vided by the State if necessary, and to appeal. Defendants in miiitary tribunals have
 the same due process rights as those being tried in the civilian system with the ex-
 ception of bail. The mli'tary court system does not have its own courts of appeal;
 appeals and confirmations of military court verdicts are referred to the civilian judi-
 cial system.
 The judicial system applies justice inequitably. The poor are punished in accord-
 ance with the law, but the rich or politically influential are alnost never held in
 jail, much less brought to trial or convicted. Those few who are incarcerated usually
 buy thei:" way out or "escape."
 In March Congress took action to resolve a longstanding dispute over jurisdictions
 by civilian versus military courts, which arose when a member of the military was
 aleged to have committed a crime against a civilian in ci.cumstances unrelated to
 official duties. The Congress decreed that civilian courts will have jurisdiction in
 such cases; the military will maintain jurisdiction only in cases of a crime commit-
 ted on dut . The decree also stated that in the event of a conflict of juri-,diction be-
 tween civiian and military courts, the civilian court shall have precedence. Since
 the passage of the decree all cases of enlisted men accused of "civilian" crimes were
 in fact turned over expeditiously to the civilian legal system. Nonetheless, since no
 officers were involved, end since the armed forces determine when an officer or sol-
 dier is on duty, it was clear that this controversy had not been definitively resolved.
 Until improvements are made in the civilian Jubtice system, however, military of-
 ficers are no more likely to be convicted of human rights abuses or other crimes
 than they were under military justice. The civilian judiciary is weak, underfurded,
 politicized, inefficient, and orrupt. Honduran society continues to rely on influence,
 pressure, and accomodation rather than the rule of law to resolve disputes.
 The nine magistrates of the Sup.-eme Court are eleted by the Congress by a m..-
 jority vote for 4 years and confirmed by the President. The period of their terms
 coincides with those of the Congress and the President. The Supreme Court ap-
 points all of the judges in the lower civilian courts. While some headway was mae
 in using a career system to depoliticize the appointments process, both major politi-
 cal parties ignored the recommendation by the Ad Hoc Commission that they agree
 to a completely apolitical, independent judiciary. The judicial system also suffers
 from woe fully inadequate funding.
 Detention of criminal suspects pnding trial averaged 14 months and constituted
 a serious human rights problem. A significant number of defendants serve the maxi-
 mum possible sentence for the crime of which they are accused before their trials
 are ever concluded or even begun. Approximately 85 percent of the prison popu-
 
 
 479
 lation in 1993 had neither been sentenced nor exonerated. In midyear, the court al-
 located extra judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and funds to clear up the back-
 lT hese judicial weaknesses, along with the FUSEP's own problems of underfunding
 and poorly paid and ill-trained personnel, greatly undermine the right of Hondurans
 to a speedy, fair public trial. Judicial authorities were also subjected to threats
 when they attempted to perform their duties. The judge in the Ricey Mabel Mar-
 tinez case received a number of death threats during the trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that entry by persons
 authorized by the State may only be made with the owner's consent or with the au-
 thorization of a competent authority. Entry may only take place between 6 a.m. and
 6 p.m. or at any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the commission
 of a crime. However, as in previous years, there were credible charges that police
 and armed forces personnel failed at times to obtain the needed authorization before
 entering a private home. Police authorities claimed that part of the problem was the
 unavailability of judges to issue orders at night and on weekends. As a result of a
 DNI request, the Supreme Court refined procedures to ensure that "duty judges"
 will be available 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. It is too early to judge the effec-
 tiveness of the new system.
 Government monitoring of mail or telephones may be authorized by judicial order
 for specific purposes, such as criminal investigation or national security. Carlos
 Kellner, former president of the Honduran Telecommunications Union and now liv-
 ing in self-impsed exile in the United States, made credibleallegations in 1993 that
 the armed forces took advantage of its operation of the national telephone company
 to monitor illegallytelephone lines of influential people in the Government, the mili-
 tary, and the private sector.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom o Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and these freedoms are largely respected in practice. The media, while
 often openly critical of the Government and frequently willin to expose corruption,
 are subject to high levels of corruption and politicization. There continued to be
 credible reports of intimidation by authorities, instances of self-censorship, and pay-
 offs to journalists. In February FUSEP Chief Colonel Hung Pacheco told the press
 that the military maintained "dossiers" on journalists.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted to curtail po-
 litical expression on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to peaceful assembly for political, religious, or other purposes. The Govern-
 ment does not generally require prior authorization or permits but may ask for a
 permit to "guarantee public order." In most cases, neither the Government nor the
 armed forces interfere in the right of citizens to assemble. For example, police did
 not interfere in the demonstrations marking the second anniversary of the murder
 of Riccy Mabel Martinez, nor during public protests over the perceived mildness of
 the sentences imposed.
 However, the police used excessive force in April near Choluteca when members
 of the 6th regional police command and the 10 1st army brigade used tear gas, rifle
 butts, and gunshots to break up a demonstration of 600 fishermen. The fishermen
 were illegally blocking the Pan American      Highway   to protest Nicaraguan
 confiscation of Honduran fishing boats in contested waters of the Gulf of Fonseca.
 The police, who were attempting to clear the rad to permit passage by the Presi-
 dent, claimed that some of the fishermen carried firearms but reprtedly did not at-
 tempt to negotiate with or give warning to the protesters. At least 14 of the protest-
 ers were injured, including several women.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution protects all forms of religious expres-
 sion, and there is no state religion. While most Hondurans are nominally Roman
 Catholic, foreign missionaries of various Protestant sects work and proselytize
 throughout the country. There were no reported incidents of harassment or intimi-
 dation of the clergy by the military in 1993.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens enter and exit Honduras without arbitrary impediment, and
 travel within the country's borders is freely permitted. There were no known in-
 stances in which citizenship was revoked for political reasons. Of the 250 Haitian
 refugees who arrived in Honduras in November 1991, 45 remain. There were no re-
 ported human rights abuses committed against the refugees. In 1993 a total of 14
 Cuban citizens requested and received political asylum.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Hondurans continued to exercise the right to change their government through
 democratic and peaceful means in the November elections. International observers
 found the election free and fair. A last-minute effort by the Liberal, Christian Demo-
 crat, and PINU parties to permit voters to cast ballots even if their names did not
 appear on the voting list was thwarted by the National Party-controlled Supreme
 Court. This controversy did not affect the results of the election or its essential fair-
 ness. National and municipal governments are chosen by free, secret, direct, and
 obligatory balloting every 4 years. Suffrage is universal, but serving members of the
 armed forces are not permitted to vote. Any citizen born in Honduras or abroad of
 Honduran parentage may hold office except for members of the clergy and the
 armed forces. A new political party may gain legal status by obtaining 20,000 signa-
 tures and establishing party organizations in at least half of the country's 18 de-
 partments.
 In a significant change, voters in the 1993 elections were able to split their ballot
 by voting for a mayor from a different party, instead of being required to cast a sin-
 gle ballot for a single-party slate of candidates for almost all elected offices, from
 the President on down. Neither the names nor the photos of the mayoral candidates
 appeared on the ballot, however, which hampered the democratic process, given the
 predominantly illiterate electorate. The vote for Presidentcontinued to be a vote for
 the entire congressional slate of that candidate's party.
 The inability to split tickets in contests for other offices not only adversely af-
 fected small parties, but also limited the institutional effectiveness and independ-
 ence of the Congress and municipal government, since those elected officials have
 no independent mandate. In addition, the internal candidate selection process in
 both major parties limited direct, popular participation in the process, particularly
 at the reional or local levels. Both major parties have an extensive 'precandidate
 campaigne period, following which the presidential candidates are selected through
 internal party elections, held approximately 1 year prior to the national elections.
 Once selected through the internal elections, the parties' presidential candidates
 choose their slate's congressional and mayoral candidates.
 There are no legal impediments to women and minorities participating in govern-
 ment and politics. In practice, the proportion of women in political organizations
 and elected to office is far lower than their overall representaLion in society. Women
 tend to continue to be relegated to "traditional" roles. This may be changing, how-
 ever; for the first time a woman, Guadalupe Jerezano, was elected as one of the
 three vice presidents in the November elections, and many women were elected
 mayors. Several women served in high appointed positions in the outgoing Callejas
 administration.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) and the
 Committee of the Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras
 (COFADEH) are the best known and most active local nongovernmental human
 rights organizations. Prior to the Government's establishment of the Office of the
 Human Rights Commissioner, CODEH, with its network of offices throughout Hon-
 duras, was often the only recourse available to victims of abuses, particularly those
 living in rural areas. The nongovernmental Center for the Investigation and Pro-
 motion of Human Rights (CIPRODEH), established in April 1991, offers basic
 human rights courses, holds monthly seminars, carries out research on issues affect-
 ing Hondurans, and serves as a source of information on human rights. CIPRODEH
 continued its human rights training of police officers and added training programs
 for the military.
 Government officials continued to meet and cooperate with representatives of local
 and international human rights organizations in 1993. In 1992 President Callejas
 appointed experienced and widely respected human rights activist Dr. Leo
 Valladares as the Human Rights Commissioner. Since then, his office has grown
 from a staff of 5 to 21 persons, and published a "preliminary" study of the politically
 motivated disappearances which took place during the 1979-1989 period (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). The governmental Inter-Institutional Commission on Human Rights
 (CIDH), established in 1987 to respond to domestic and international inquiries and
 to investigate human rights violations, is largely ineffective, as it does not receive
 full cooperation from military and civilian judicial authorities.
 There were no reported incidents of harassment against members of human rights
 organization in 1993.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although discrimination on the basis of class is banned under the Constitution,
 in fact, both the military and the political and social elite generally enjoy impunity
 before the legal system. Members of the socioeconomic upper class are rarely ar-
 rested or jailed. The Constitution provides for 2 years of compulsory military service
 for male citizens between the ages of 18 and 30, although only Hondurans from the
 middle and lower classes are forcibly recruited into the armed forces.
 Women.-The Constitution also bans discrimination for reasons of race and sex.
 Women are represented in at least small numbers in most of the professions, but
 cultural attitudes act to limit their career opportunities. In theory, women have
 equal access to educational opportunities, but cultural attitudes within families
 often serve to brake the ambitions of women intent on obtaining higher education.
 Women are supposed to be paid equal wages for equal work but their jobs are often
 classified as less demanding than those of men, as a justification for paying them
 lower salaries.
 Efforts to combat violence against women are severely impeded by serious weak-
 nesses in the Penal Code. Visitacion Padilla, a women s human rights group has
 called for legislation to make violence against women a serious crime. Violence
 against women remains widespread, according to the group. An example of the
 weakness of Honduran law in this regard is the case of rape. Except in the case
 of children age 12 or under, rape is considered a private crime. Rape victims over
 age 12 are therefore required to hire a private prosecutor, a luxury few can afford.
 The penalties for rape are relatively light, rangin frm 3 to 9 years' detention.
 There are no shelters specifically maintained or battered women. Although the
 law offers some redress, few women take advantage of the legal process. This reluc-
 tance stems from a lack of education and the perception that judges would be un-
 willing to apply the law vigorously. Some organizations have begun to offer assist-
 ance to women, principally targeting those living in the rural sectors and marginal
 neighborhoods of cities.     onduran Federation of Women's Associations for ex-
 ample, provides home construction and improvement loans, offers free le aI assist-
 ance to women, and lobbies the Government on women's causes. CIPRODEH began
 an education program to make women aware of their rights under the law.
 Children.-The Government is committed to providing basic education and health
 care to children, and succeeds in some measure in this task. Lack of resources is
 a limiting factor. The Constitutionand the Labor Code prohibit the employment of
 minors under the age of 16, but the Ministry of Labor lacks resources to exemise
 its responsibility to ensure enforcement.
 Indigenous People.-There is no formal mechanism for the small community of in-
 digenous people to present petitions to the Government or to participate in decisions
 regarding traditional lands. With the assistance of international organizations and
 local human rights groups, the principal indigenous groups have succeeded in estab-
 lishing organizations to focus governmental and public attention on their wishes.
 People with Disabilities. -There are no formal barriers to participation by dis-
 abled persons in terms of employment, education, and health care, but neither is
 there specific statutory protection for them. There is no legislation that requires ac-
 cessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join labor
 unions, and with the exception of some "parallel" unions formed by the Government,
 the unions are independent of government and political parties. Although only about
 20 percent of the work force is organized, trade unions exert considerable economic
 and political influence. They frequently participate in public rallies against govern-
 ment policies and make extensive use of the media to advance their views. There
 are also three large peasant associations directly affiliated with the trade unions.
 The right to strike, along with a wide range of other basic labor rights, is provided
 for by the Constitution and honored in practice. The Civil Service Code, however,
 stipulates that public workers do not have the right to strike. In 1992, the Inter-
 national Labor Organization's Committee of Experts again noted that the Labor
 Code should be reformed to include workers of certain arcultural enterprises, and
 to eliminate provisionswhich prohibit more than one trade union per establishment
 and which impose restrictions on the right to strike.
 A number of private firms instituted "solidarity" associations which are essen-
 tially aimed atproviding credit and other services to workers and management who
 are members of the association. Organized labor, including the American Federation
 of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations and the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), strongly opposes these associations on the grounds
 
 
 482
 that they do not permit strikes, have inadequate grievance procedures, and neutral-
 ize genuine and representative trade unions. The membership of such associations
 remained static during 1993.
 The Government afforded official recognition to a parallel union in the Union of
 National Agrarian Institute Workers (SITRAINA) in April. It dismissed workers
 supporting the elected union and then replaced them with supporters of the govern-
 ment-backed union. The National Agrarian Institute also fired a number of workers
 in violation of the Labor Code, but 40 of these who staged 2 lengthy hunger strikes
 to protest the dismissals, were later reinstated. Carlos Kellner, former leader of the
 Telecommunications Workers Union SITRATELH, who had continued to challenge
 and appeal the imposition of a parailel union in 1992, left the country following se-
 vere and continued harrassment; he continued to live abroad at year's end.
 There were no killings of trade unionists in 1993. However, the ICFTU cited the
 Government as being unable or unwilling to bring the perpetrators of worker rights
 abuses to justice, including those responsible for a number of extrajudicial killings
 of trade unionists in 1992.
 The trade union movement maintains close ties with various international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and to
 bargain collectively is protected by law and collective bargaining agreements are the
 norm for companies in which the workers are organized. However, retribution by
 employers for trade union activity was not uncommon, in spite of its prohibition in
 the Labor Code. Employers threatened to close down unionized companies, harassed
 their workers, and in some cases fired them for trying to form a trade union. Rel-
 atively few workers are actually dismissed for union activity once the union is recog-
 nized; these cases, however, served to discourage other workers from attempting to
 organize. Workers in both unionized and nonumonized companies are under the pro-
 tection of the Labor Code, which gives them the right to seek redress from the Min-
 istry of Labor. Depending on the decision of the labor or civil court, employers can
 be required to rehire employees fired for union activity. Such decisions are uncom-
 mon.
 The same labor regulations apply in export processing zones (EPZ's) as in the rest
 of private industry. Working conditions and wages in the EPZ's are generally consid-
 ered superior to those prevailing in the rest of the country. There was a strike and
 plant seizure in September in an EPZ in Choloma, which was declared illegal. How-
 ever, since in this instance the strike occurred concurrently with the clear y illegal
 plant seizure, it remains unclear whether under other circumstances a strike in an
 EPZ might be declared legal.
 Unions are active in the government-owned Puerto Cortes free trade zone, but fac-
 tory owners have resisted efforts to organize the new privately owned industrial
 parks.
 Blacklisting is clearly prohibited by the Labor Code. Nevertheless, there was cred-
 ible evidence that informal blacklisting occurred in the privately owned industrial
 parks. When unions are formed, a list of initial members must be submitted to the
 Ministry of Labor as part of the process of obtaining official recognition. Before offi-
 cial recognition is granted, however, the Ministry informs the company of the im-
 pending union organization. Ministry inspectors have consistently been unable to
 provide effective protection to workers, including the prvision to plant owners of
 Ministry of Labor documentation for union formation. The inadequacy of inspectors
 is particularly obvious in the EPZ sector. Some companies in the industrial parks
 have taken the information and dismissed union organizers before recognition was
 granted.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor; such practices are prohibited by law and the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit the employment of children under the age of 16. Violations of the
 Labor Code occur frequently in rural areas or in small companies. High adult unem-
 p loyment and underemployment has resulted in many children working in small
 family farms, as street vendors, or in small workshops to supplement the family in-
 come. The Ministry of Labor has the responsibility for enforcing child employment
 laws, but it lacks the resources necessary to carry out the task.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In May organized labor and the private sector
 umbrella organization agreed on a 14.35 percent increase in the minimum wage,
 which became effective June 1. Daily pay rates vary by the sector of the economy
 affected and geographical zones: the lowest minimum wage is $1.70 (12 lempiras)
 per day in the agriculture sector. The highest minimum wage rate paid is in the
 mining sector, at $3.20 (22.60 lempiras) daily. Urban zone workers earn slightly
 more than in the countryside. The Constitution and the Labor Code require that all
 
 
 labor be fairly paid. Minimum wages, working hours, vacations, and occupational
 safety are all regulated, but the Ministry of Labor lacks the staff and other re-
 sources for effective enforcement. Even after the third consecutive annual increase,
 the minimum wage is considered insufficient to provide a decent standard of living,
 particularly in light of inflation. In addition, many workers receive even less than
 the minimum wage.
 The law prescribes an 8-hour day and a 44-hour workweek. There is a require-
 ment for at least one 24-hour rest period every 8 days.
 The Labor Code provides for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after 1 year and 20
 workdays after 4 years. The regulations are frequently ignored in practice as a re-
 sult of the high level of unemployment and underemployment.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing national health and safety laws.
 Due to a lack of resources, the laws are not well enforced. There is no provision for
 a worker to remove himself from a dangerous work situation without jeopardy to
 continued employment. Reliable reports indicate that there are still as many as 50
 deaths per year resulting from serious health and safety hazards facing Miskito In-
 dian scuba divers employed in lobster and conch harvesting off the Caribbean coast
 of Honduras. Some complaints have also arisen about the failure of foreign factory
 managers to comply with the Labor Code in factories located in free zones and in-
 dustrial parks.
