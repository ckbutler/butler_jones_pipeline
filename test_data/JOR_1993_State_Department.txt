 JORDAN
 According to the 1952 Constitution, Jordan is a hereditary monarchy in which the
 King forms and dismisses governments, may dissolve Parliament, and is the ulti-
 mate arbiter of domestic anT foreign policy. In practice, the King sets the broad pa-
 rameters of foreign and domestic policy while the Prime Minister and the Council
 of Ministers exercise management of daily affairs. The Parliament--consisting of a
 40-member Senate whuse members are appointed by the King and an 80-member
 lower house whose members are elected-is subordinate to the executive branch.
 The General Intelligence Directorate (GID) and the Public Security Directorate
 (PSD) have broad responsibility for internal security and wide powers to monitor
 segments of the population thought to pose a threat to the security of the regime.
 Although the Government revoked martial law directives in 1991, important ele-
 ments of martial law, such as the broad scope of police powers, remain operative.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with government participation in key sectors, in-
 cluding industrial production, transportation, and communications. The country has
 few natural resources and one of the highest population growth rates in the world.
 Jordan's stance during the Gulf war caused Arab Gulf states to suspend flows of
 financial aid. Nevertheless, the economy continued to show surprising strength in
 1993, growing by a projected 6 to 7 percent. Growth during this period is in part
 attributable to the investment of repatriated savings by returnees from the Gulf.
 Jordan continues to remain highly dependent on foreign assistance and remittances
 from its nationals abroad. The Jordanian economy was adversely affected by a re-
 duction of exports to Iraq, a major trading partner, as a result of United Nations'
 sanctions against Iraq. The unemployment rate was at least 14 percent for the year,
 while the inflation rate moderated to approximately 5 percent.
 Jordan continued to show prorss in liberalizing the country's political system.
 As a result of the legalization of political parties in 1992, 20 political parties, run-
 ning the gamut of leftist centrist, and Islamist conservative parties, were licensed
 in 1992 and 1993. The K      ratified a change from the previous bloc-voting system
 to a one person, one vote system in August. On November 8, 1992, the Govern-
 ment of Prime Minister Abd Al-Salam     Al-Majali supervised the country's first
 multiparty parliamentary elections since 1956. While there were some minor irreg-
 ularities on polling day, international and domestic observers agreed that the par-
 liamentary elections were essentially free and fair. Nevertheless, citizens still do not
 have the right to change their government. Other continuing human rights prob-
 lems included the broad scope of police powers, abuse of prisoners, prolonged deten-
 tion without charge, lack of fair trial in some security cases, official discrimination
 against adherents of the Baha'i faith, and restrictions on women's rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killings
 b. *iappearance -There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Despite the Government's denial that torture occurs and the Legal Code's requiring
 humane treatment of prisoners, physical abuse of prisoners during interrogation and
 detention continues to occur. Lawyers often do not receive timely access to their cli-
 ents in cases involving state security, and this lack of access makes confirmation
 of abuse in specific cases difficult. The most frequently alleged methods of torture
 or maltreatment are sleep deprivation, beatings, and subjection to the "falaqa"
 (beatings on the soles of the feet).
 Defense lawyers in the trial of six military cadets and two civilians accused of
 plotting to assassinate the King charged the security services with torturing the
 suspects during 4 months' incommunicado detention from April to August (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.). Although the State Security Court approved the defense lawyers' Septem-
 ber request for medical examinations to determine if physical or mental torture was
 used by GiD interrogators, the judges did not release the results of the physician's
 October examinations until mid-November. As of December the "Mu'tah trial pro-
 ceeded without an official court ruling on the allegations of torture. A forensic spe-
 cialist and a military doctor testified in early November that they found no evidence
 of physical or mental maltreatment. (The GID claims that detainees are routinely
 provided medical examinations during detention.) The defense, however, challenged
 the testimony and alleged that, since the doctors were government employees, they
 were vulnerable to government pressure. The military judge rejected the defense re-
 quest to provide its own doctor to examine the detainees. Amnesty International and
 
 
 1217
 the Arab Organization for Human Rights investigated the allegations of torture but
 reserved judgment until the verdict was reached and the anticipated appeal prcess
 corpleted. The Government gives the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICC) full access to detainees. ICRC representatives have had full and unimpeded
 access to the suspects detained in the Mu'tah case throughout the trial.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Most persons are arrested and held in
 accordance with the Criminal Code, which requires filing of formal charges within
 10 days. This period of detention may be extended if a court appruves the Prosecutor
 General's renewable request for 10-day extensions. The Ministry of Justice is re-
 sponsible for monitoring cases to ensure that persons are charged on a timely basis.
 In many cases, however, repeated requests by the prosecution for 10-day extensions
 of a suspect's detention-which can result in months of incarceration without
 charge-are routinely granted. Notification of arrest and access to legal counsel are
 provided on an inconsistent basis during the detention period. Notification and ac-
 cess are less likely to be provided in so-called state security cases.
 The practice of prolonged detention without charge continued in 1993, especially
 in "security" cases. After obtaining an arrest warrant, the GID detained persons
 without formal charges or trial for indeterminate periods. The Government detained
 a number of Islamists in 1993 for alleged affiliation with or membership in an ille-
 gal political organization, the Islamic Liberation Party (Hizb Al-Tahrir Al-Islami),
 which advocates the violent overthrow of the Jordanian Government, the abrogation
 of the Constitution, and the adoption of Islamic law as the foundation of the State.
 Several-including party leaders Ata Abu Rishteh and Bakr AI-Khawlidah-were
 released after almost 6 months in incommunicado detention. There are unconfirmed
 reports that up to 10 Hizb AI-Tahrir party members remained in detention without
 charges at the end of the year. Eight Islamists involved in the Mu'tah case (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.), charged with plotting to assassinate the King and with membership in
 the outlawed Islamic Liberation Party, were held incommunicado from the time of
 their arrest in late April until defense lawyers were granted access by the State Se-
 curity Court in late August. Throughout that time, the suspects were denied visita-
 tion by family members, human rights representatives, and  a counsel.
 Governors may order arrest anddetention under a law authorizing them to do so
 in order to prevent a crime. As an example of this practice, human rights monitors
 cited the case of a Jordanian man arrested in September and detained fori week
 without charges upon the instruction of the Governor of Amman, allegedly to pre-
 vent his participation in antipeace process demonstrations.
 The Constitution prohibits the exiling Lf Jordanian citizens, and the Government
 does not engage in the practice.
 e. Denial o" Fair n  blic Trial.-The judicial system consists of civilian courts,
 which hear most criminal cases; the Appeals Court; the Stat Security Court, which
 replaced the Martial Law Court in 1991; religious courts; and special courts, includ-
 ing one that deals exclusively with disputes involving government agencies.
 In the civilian courts, trials are open, except in a few cases such as those involv-
 ing sexual offenses. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty and are
 entitled to have counsel, to question witnesses, and to testify. Defendants facing the
 death penalty or life imprisonment must have legal counsel; if they cannot afford
 or do not want counsel, the Government must appoint representation. Decisions
 maybe taken to the Appeals Court.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over such family matters as marriage and di-
 vorce. The Shari'a Court handles all family and religious cases involving Muslims.
 Other courts handle similar matters for members of the main Christian sects (Greek
 Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant). Shari'a laws are generally applied in matters
 of inheritance, regardless of the religion of those involved.
 Obsce-vers continue to express concern about the impartiality of the judiciary, cit-
 ing low judicial salaries and strong tribal affiliations as undermining the court sys-
 tem. Observers have also raised concerns about the impartiality of military judges
 who preside over security cases in the State Security Court prosecuted by military
 The State Security Court comprises a minimum of three judges. While either civil-
 ian or military judges may serve, the use of military judges in security cases has
 prevailed in recent years. State Security Court procedures give rise to concern be-
 cause of the routine denial of private, unimpeded access to lawyers in the pretrial
 period and the absence of the right of appeal. A State Security Court sentence of
 death or imprisonment of more than 10 years must be reviewed by the Court of C'as-
 sation (the highest court) within 30 days. Although the State Security Court is theo-
 retically open to the public, in practice, courtroom access is restricted to official
 guests, journalists, and a limited number of family members. Embassy officers have
 in   allowednto attend sessions.
 
 
 1218
 Under the State Security Court Law ratified in January, all Security Court deci-
 sions may be appealed to the Court of Cassation. Unlike the previous law, which
 allowed the Supreme Court to review only the application of the law, the new code
 permits the court to review witnesses' testimony, the evidence presented, and the
 Stat Security Court's decision. Most important the appeal of State Security Court
 cases must be reviewed by a civilian-rather than a mlit ary-panel of judges. As
 of the end of the year, the appeal procedures had remained untested in sensitive
 state security cases such as the "Mu'tah" case. Claiming that no one is currently
 serving a prison term solely for political views, the Government denies that it holds
 any political prisoners. Following King Hussein's general amnesty in November
 1992, approximately 50 prisoners remain in prison who were convicted in military
 courts of crimes committed in pursuit of political aims; the charges in these cases
 included arms possession and terrorism, but in at least some of these cases the legal
 proceedings did not meet international standards for fair trial because of the State
 Security Court's denial of unimpeded access to lawyers in the pretrial period and
 an inadequate right of appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 stipulates that search warrants must be issued by the prosecutor general or a judge
 for searches of premises in most cases. In cases involving state security, however,
 the normal legal requirements for a search warrant are not routinely applied.
 Search warrants for security-related cases are sometimes obtained retroactively. Se-
 curity personnel reportedly monitor telephones, read correspondence, and engage in
 surveillance. These practices, legal under Jordanian law, are not believed to be
 widespread.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-In principle, the Constitution provides for free-
 dom of speech and the press, and Jordanians freely express wide-ranging opinions,
 including criticism of the Government. However, the Government continues to exer-
 cise limited censorship of the local media by pressuring news editors to change or
 omit coverage that the Government finds embarrassing or contrary to what it per-
 ceives to be Jordan's interests. More often, the print and broadcast media censor
 themselves without specific prompting from the Government because of fear of the
 authorities. The Parliament is also sensitive to public criticism and as an institution
 has been quick to sue critics for slander.
 A reporter for a weekly political party newspaper covering the "Mu'tah" conspir-
 acy trial was banned from the courtroom and arrested September 26 on the order
 of the military prosecutor; his editor was called in for questioning on September 29.
 Both were charged with slandering the State Security Court in articles written
 about court delays in ordering medical examinations for defendants. The Ministry
 of Information refused to intercede with the court on behalf of the journalist and
 editor, stating that the issue was judicial in nature.
 The new Press and Publications Law that went into effect on May 17 calls for
 the Government to reduce its ownership share of the capital of the press company
 or organization to 30 percent within 2 years. The Government still o'-ns the main
 newspapers and administers the broadcast media. Foreign newspapers and maga-
 zines are widely available, though on two known occasions the Government forbade
 distribution of foreign newspapers containing controversial articles about the King.
 In August the Government blocked distribution of two London-based Arabic dailies
 which carried off-the-record comments made by the King during a meeting with
 journalists. The Jordanian authorities forbade sale of an issue of the International
 Ierald Tribune in September that carried a Washingt.n Post editorial questioning
 the future of Jordan as a state. Western cable television is available through sat-
 ellite links.
 The new Press and Publications Law, which replaces the 1973 Press and Publica-
 tions Law, was widely criticized by Jordanian journalists and by international press
 rights groups because it continues restrictions on freedom of expression. Controver-
 sial provisions include: licensing of journalists, editors, and directors of publications
 and printing facilities; licensing of newspapers and periodicals; limited protection of
 confidentiality of journalists' sources; and restrictions on press coverage and prior
 restraint. Its requirement that journalists join the Jordan Press Association is a
 continuing source of contention. In August the Information Minister proposed a
 .press code of honor" to be enacted as a provision of the Press and Publications Law
 and as a Jordan press association law. The proposed honor code contains 11 points,
 including exhortations not to publish off-the-record information or state secrets, par-
 ticularly those pertaining to the armed forces that might benefit the "enemy of the
 Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan or any sister Arab states." Many journalists have
 characterized the code as redundant and view it as a further attempt to control
 
 
 1219
 their activities. The Press and Publications Law authorizes licensed political parties
 to publish newspapers, and these new publications have tested the limits of the new
 law's vagely worded restrictions on coverage of proscribed topice such as national
 security, parliamentary proceedings, and stories about the roya fmily.
 The rime Minister issued a directive in September barring civil servants from
 writing for the press. Such activity was already proscribed by the Civil Servants'
 Law, but that law was not previously enforced.
 Academic freedom is inhibited by the fact that academics have been dismissed for
 expressing certain political views. There were no known dismissals in 1993.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public demonstrations--in-
 cluding election campaign rallies--require permits. While such permits have been
 readily granted for peaceful protests since the beginning of the political liberaliza-
 tion in 1989 the Ministry of Interior banned election campaign rallies in late Sep-
 tember. Jordan's Supreme Court overturned this ban on October28 and election ral-
 lies were permitted in the last week before the November 8 parliamentary elections.
 Political parties were legalized in October 1992, and the first political party was
 licensed by the Ministry of Interior on December 2, 1992. Since that time, a total
 of 20 political parties have registered.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-U-nder the Constitution, Islam is the state religion, and
 over 90 percent of Jordanians are Sunni Muslims. The Government adheres to the
 constitutional guarantee of freedom of worship, and followers of most religions expe-
 rience no governmental persecution. Religious groups must be registered and recog-
 nized by the Government in order to manage property and administer schools.
 Non-Muslim sects are not allowed to proselytize among Muslims, but Muslims are
 allowed to convert to other religions. Individuals who wish to convert from Islam
 complain of social and legal barriers to equal treatment once they have converted.
 Such persons are regarded as apostates under Shari'a (Islamic) law and may be le-
 gally denied property and other rights. Converts from Islam do not fall under the
 jurisdiction o their new religion's laws in personal status matters and are still con-
 sidered Muslims under Shar'a law. The Government does not recognize the Baha'i
 faith as a religion, but it did take steps in 1993 to alleviate some of the problems
 of discrimination faced by Jordan's small Baha'i community (see Section 5).
 Several other religious gups are not officially recognized by the Government but
 are able to meet without harassment: Jehovah's Witnesses, the United Pentecostal
 Church, the Church of Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-hMovement within the country is restricted in military areas. While all
 women are required by law to obtain the written permission of a male guardian to
 travel abroad, this requirement is generally enforced only with married women who
 wish to travel abroad with their children. Jordanian men can prevent their children
 from departing the country, even when traveling with their mothers or other family
 members.
 Passport renewals for citizens residing in Jordan require clearance from the po-
 lice. Palestinians residing in the East Bank may obtain 5-year passports, while Pal-
 estinians residing in the West Bank may obtain 2-year passports. Jordan also
 grants some Palestinians of Gazan origin 2-year passports regardless of where they
 live. The Interior Ministry routinely grants permits for travel between the East
 Bank and the Israei-oocupied territories and neighboring states. There were reports
 in 1993 that several Palestinians, carrying restricted validity Jordanian passports,
 were barred from returning to their residences in Jordan from the West Bank on
 suspicion of belonging to radical Islamist groups outside the country.
 The Government claims that 300,000 Palestinian refugees returned from the Gulf
 states--the majority from Kuwait-as a result of the Gulf crisis (actual numbers
 may have been substantially lower). The number of Palestinian refugees registered
 with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is 1,093,800 persons,
 223,000 of whom reside in Jordan's 10 official and 3 unofficial refugee camps.
 Jordan indicated that 120,000 Iraqi refugees moved into Jordan in the months
 after Iraqi travel restrictions were Ii  in  ay 1991. International relief agencies
 responsible for refugee affairs in Jordan estimate the current number of Iraqis re-
 siding in Jordan tobe no more than 30,000. Since the imposition of a 15,000 Iraqi
 dinar (about $94 in December 1993) exit tax in February, the number of Iraqis able
 to afford the trip to Jordan has been severely curtailed.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Jordanian citizens may elect municipal officials and members of the Chamber of
 Deputies but are not ultimately free to change their system of government or its
 
 
 1220
 leaders. Executive and legislative powers are constitutionally vested in the King,
 who rules with the assistance of a Council of Ministers, which he appoints.
 The Parliament is composed of an appointed Senate and an elected lower house.
 The Parliament is overshadowed by the executive branch but has the right to a p-
 p rove, reject, or amend laws proposed by the Council of Ministers. According to the
 Constitution, the Parliament has the right to approve or reject treaties and agree-
 ments with a majority vote. The King may propose extraordinary sessions of Par-
 liament and postpone regular sessions up to 60 days. The King must approve all
 laws, which are then put into effect by royal decree. The Parliament must approve
 temporary laws issued by the Council of Ministers when Parliament is dissolved or
 not in session, otherwise the temporary law does not become a permanent part of
 Jordan's legal system. In August after the King had dissolved Parliament, he ap-
 proved a temporary law issued by the Council of Ministers modifying the 1986 elec-
 tions law by converting the previous bloc-voting system to a "one person, one vote"
 system. Despite the initial objection of 18 of the country's licensed political parties
 on the grounds that such drastic change to laws governing the election should be
 reviewed and adopted by Parliament, most parties and political figures eventually
 decided to participate in the parliamentary elections held in November rather than
 boycott them as they had threatened.
 On November 8, the Government of Prime Minister Abd A-Salam Al-Majali su-
 pervised the country's first multiparty parliamentary elections since 1956. While the
 Government's system for distributing ballot cards to registered voters was blamed
 for the difficulties in voting some citizens experienced, international and domestic
 observers agreed that the parliamentary elections were essentially free and fair. The
 lower house of Parliament created a number of committees to examine individual
 candidates' complaints about election procedures, but had issued no rulings on the
 formal complaints as of the end of the year.
 Despite the political and social uncertainties that arose in Jordan in the after-
 math of the September 13 signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Prin-
 ciples, King Hussein insisted that all Jordanian citizens-both Palestinian and East
 Banker-were entitled to vote in the November 8 elections. Some Jordanians of Pal-
 estinian origin had doubts about voting in Jordanian elections, fearing that partici-
 pation in the Jordanian political system would preclude their participation in a fu-
 ture Palestinian election. The Jordanian Government and the King actively encour-
 aged Palestinian-Jordanian citizens to participate fully in the elections. Palestinian-
 Jordanians were permitted to run as candidates in the parliamentary elections as
 � 'ell as vote on November 8.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups investigate allegations of human
 rights abuses and particularly in the area of women's rights have published and dis-
 seminated findings critical of government policy. Human rights groups, however,
 must abide by laws and regulations governing the publication of information about
 activities of Jordan's military and security services, which constrains them from
 publishing detailed allegations of torture or other abuse in Jordan. The Arab Orga-
 nization for Human Rights and the Amman-based Peace Center for Humanitarian
 Studies have actively pursued controversial human rights cases both publicly and
 privately. The Jordanian Bar Association also raises human rights concerns with re-
 gard to law and procedure, as well as with regard to individual cases. The ICRC
 operates freely in Jordan and is given access to detainees and prison facilities. Sev-
 eral women's organizations have dramatically increased their activism on issues of
 gender discrimination: in parliamentary debate on December 7, for example, Deputy
 Toujan Faisal criticized the discriminatory policy that does not permit Jordanian
 women to transmit their nationality to their children.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women experience legal discrimination regarding pension and social se-
 curity benefits, inheritance, and divorce.
 Under Shari'a law, which applies to all Jordanian citizens in inheritance matters,
 a female hei's inheritance is only half that of a male heir. In practice, non-Muslim
 women occasionally have been able to obtain rulings based upon their own religious
 laws. The divorce law allows men to obtain a divorce more easily than women, but
 men may have to pay considerable compensation based on the original marriage
 contract. A woman whose husband takes additional wives may seek and obtain a
 divorce under Shari'a law. The law gants women equal pay for equal work, but in
 practice the law is sometimes ignorel, and women are paid less. Under Shar'ia law,
 
 
 1221
 
 a woman's testimony in court carries only half the value of that of a man. Tradition
 also constrains women's freedoms, particularly their entry into professional and aca-
 demic realms.
 Nevertheless, some women have successfully entered the fields of engineering,
 medicine, and law, and women's issues are receiving increasing attention in the
 media and at symposia. Women's groups stress that the problem is not only one of
 laws but also of social constraiats, including women's lack of awareness of their
 rights or unwillingness to assert these rights. The Jordanian chapter of the Busi-
 ness and Professional Women's Club gives seminars on women's rights and assists
 women in establishing small businesses. Club members traveled to communities
 throughout Jordan during the election campaign and succeeded in increasing female
 voter registration and raising women's consciousness about the election process and
 their rights. Despite progress in these areas, overall change in women's status has
 been minimal.
 The Koran allows a husband to discipline his wife, which some men apparently
 interpret as a license to discipline with force. Sources in the medical field say that,
 while they know wife beating occurs, family and cultural norms constrain victims
 from seeking medical or legal help and prevent any realistic quantification of the
 extent of abuse. Many Jordanians consider it culturally unacceptable to highlight
 what is considered a private family matter. The issue also is considered a private
 one by the police and the judiciary, and public discourse rarely focuses on incidents
 of spouse or child abuse. Legal avenues to pursue redress in cases of spouse abuse
 do exist. If a womr.n is abused by her husband, she can visit a medical doctor, ob-
 tain a report documenting her injuries, submit the report to the police, and file a
 complaint in court based on this evidence. The court will then charge and try the
 husband. Assistance to victims of domestic violence is provided by nongovernmental
 organizations (nearly all of which operate with a government license). Wife beating
 is technically grounds for divorce, but the husband may demonstrate in court that
 the beating occurred because the wife was irreligious or did not obey him. It is with-
 in the discretion of the judge to deny a divorce in such cases.
 Children.--Jordan is a signatory to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
 Child, and discrimination against children in Jordan is rare. In September the Jor-
 danian chapter of Amnesty International sponsored a Jordanian children's forum,
 patronized by the Queen, which examined children's rights. Arab human rights or-
 ganizations met in Amman in December to discuss implementation of the Conven-
 tion on the Rights of the Child. Jordanian labor law prohibits children under the
 age of 16 from working. It is only in the past few years that employment of under-
 age children, child street peddlers, and child beggars have appeared. The Ministry
 of Social Development has set up a committee to address the problem and in most
 cases removes the children from the streets, returns them to their families, and pro-
 vides them a monthly stipend. A November report of a 12-year-old girl's engagement
 to her 11-year old cousin, who reportedly dropped out of school to work in a cottage
 shoe factory caused public outrage. The Jordanian Women's Union called on govern-
 ment officials to take strict measures, and the Secretary General of the Mimstry of
 Social Development concurred that the engagement was an abuse and unacceptable.
 Children under the age of 18 are excluded from capital punishment. Children con-
 victed of crimes are held in special reform centers where they receive vocational
 training and are not detained with adults. Corporal punishment at schools is prohib-
 ited.
 There have been problems regarding custody of children born to foreign female
 domestic servants. For example, if such a child has been fathered by a Jordanian
 man, that child is subject to Shari'a law. Currently, the Jordanian government is
 considering a law that would make it difficult for single foreign mothers to obtain
 a residence permit for children with a foreign father not present in Jordan.
 Indigenous People.-Aconrding to government figures, Bedouin tribes constitute
 approximately 36 percent of the population. These tribes participate freely in the
 political system.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-There are large numbers of 1967 Palestinian
 refugees, primarily from Gaza, who do not have full Jordanian citizenship and carry
 only limited validity Jordanian passports.
 ordan has granted full citizenship to all Palestinians who fled to the East Bank
 following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and to a large number of refugees that came
 to Jordan after the 1967 conflict. All Palestinian refugees residing in Jordan prior
 to August 1988 have the unrestricted right to live, work, and own property in Jor-
 dan. Many Palestinians, however, experience disproportionate scrutiny in taxation
 and discrimination in the awarding of university scholarships and government and
 military jobs, especially at senior levels. King Hussein and the Government of Prime
 Minister Abd Al -Salam Al-Majali determined that Jordanian citizens of Palestinian
 
 
 1222
 origin were entitled to the same rights of political participation-voting and runnig
 for parliamentary and local office-as their East Bank counterparts. Although Paf-
 estinian voter turnout was lower than that of East Bank Jord-anians, Palestinians
 did vote in the November 8 elections. Furthermore, several high-level parliamentary
 and ministerial positions are occupied by Jordanians of Palestinian origin.
 Religious Minorities.-The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a
 religion, and Baha'is have suffered various forms of official discrimination. Baha'i
 identity cards are blank where religion is indicated. In September the Ministry of
 Education issued regulations that made the previously mandatory study of Islam by
 Baha'i students optional. In December the Ministry of Interior agreed to accept
 Baha'i marriage certificates as proof of marriage for the issuance of passports and
 other official identity documents. However, the Baha'i community still does not have
 its own court to handle personal status and family matters. Instead, these matters
 are handled by Islamic Shari'a courts. Baha'i community property cannot be reg-
 istered in the name of the community but must be registered in the names of indi-
 vidual members.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government passed legislation in March regarding
 education and employment opportunities as well as standardized building and ac-
 cess codes for the disabled. The legislation, known as Law Number 12 for 1993, in-
 cludes a comprehensive code for all future public buildings to accommodate the
 needs of the visually, hearing, and physically disabled through standardized tech-
 nical building and infrastructure requirements. The code stipulates that existing
 public structures undergo retrofitting to conform to the code, although no specific
 deadlines for these adjustments were legislated. The law for the welfare of the dis-
 abled includes a "bill of rights" for the disabled and mandates the creation of a Na-
 tional Council for the Affairs of the Disabled. People with disabilities in Jordan face
 the problems of the disabled in many developing nations: severe financial con-
 straints on government and private programs for the disabled, traditional attitudes
 of discrimination against people wit physical and mental handicaps, and unem-
 ployment rates among the general population that restrict employment opportuni-
 ties for the disabled. Currently there is no budget for programs for the disabled: all
 funding for government and private projects comes from private and nongovern-
 mental organization donations as well as donations from the royal family. Several
 rivate nonprofit organizations concerned with education and rehabilitation of the
 diabled have been active in Jordan for many years.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All nongovernmental workers, except foreigners,
 have the legal right to form and join trade unions. Workers in some government-
 owned companies, such as the airlines, are also allowed to form unions. Jordanian
 labor unions are apolitical. Union leaders are elected by secret ballot for 1-year
 terms. The Jordan Federation of Trade Unions (JFTU) comprises 17 unions; unions
 are not required to belong to the Federation, but at present all unions are members.
 Union officials estimate that less than 25 percent of workers are unionized, thus ex-
 cluding the majority of the work force from union representation. All unions must
 register with the Government.
 Government influence over the JFTU decreased following political liberalization
 in 1989, but the JFTU is not independent since it depends entirely on government
 financing. In August the JFTU announced it would convene a general congress for
 the first time in 14 years. In April the JFTU -&tbliihed an official relationship
 with the Asian-American Free Labor Institute. These two moves, spearheaded by
 the current SecreLary General of the JFTU, are designed to invigorate Jordan s
 labor unions.
 Labor laws forbid strikes if an arbitration committee has been appointed by the
 Government to end the dispute. If arbitration fails, the matter may be ixferred to
 an industrial tribunal, provided both parties to a dispute agree to have the tribunal
 hear their case. The tribunal is a formal, independent body made up of judges ap-
 pointed by the Ministry of Labor. The tribunal's decisions are binding. Strikes are
 not permitted during arbitration or during the tribunal's deliberations. The current
 labor law stipulates that it is prohibited to dismiss workers during labor disputes.
 There were no official strikes in 1993.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions in Jordan have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. JFTU member unions regularly engage
 in collective bargaining with employers. Negotiations cover a wide range of issues,
 including salaries, safety standards, and working conditions.
 Though the Constitution bars antiunion discrimination, the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions notes that the Government does not adequately pro-
 tect employees against antiunion discrimination by employers and does not protect

 public employees adequately against dismissal for political reasons. Allegations of
 such discrmnation may be taken to the Ministry of Labor, which on occasion has
 ordered the reinstatement of employees discharged because of their union activities.
 Duty-free trade zones, in Aqaba and Zarqa, are governed by the same labor provi-
 sions that apply countrywide. Private sector workers employed in these zones are
 part of a national union and are thus allowed to organize and bargain collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Compulsory labor is forbidden by
 the Constitution, except in a state of emergency such as war or natural disaster,
 and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The labor laws forbid children
 under age 16 from working except in the case of professional apprentices, who are
 allowed to leave the standard education track and begin part-time (6 hours per day,
 no night shift) traing at age 13. Ministry of Labor inspection teams attempt to
 enforce these laws. In practice, some underage children work, primarily in family
 businesses. Despite compulsory education (education is compulsory up to the 1th
 grade or age 15), a small number of children in more remote areas are kept from
 school by their parents in order to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but the
 Government periodically prepares and adjusts a minimum wage schedule for various
 trades, bases on recommendations of an advisory panel composed of representatives
 of workers, employers, and the Government. ah asolut minimum wage rate is
 estimated at $140 per month, inclusive of all allowances. Unskilled workers earning
 the lowest scheduled wage face increasing difficulties earning enough to provide a
 family a decent living by local standards.
 Laws mandate maximum work hours and paid leave: workers are not supposed
 to work more than 48 hours per week (54 hours for hotel, restaurant, and cinema
 employees), and may not work more than 16 hours in any continuous period or more
 than 60 hours overtime per month. Employees are entitled to 1 day off each week.
 Domestic servants in Jordan are not protected by Jrdanian labor laws. Therefore,
 there is no legal forum to address their labor grievances. Large numbers of Sri
 Lankan and Filipino workers do not have the benefit of embassies in Jordan to
 lobby for their interests.
 The Labor Ministry maintains a gup of full-time inspectors to oversee occupa-
 tional health and safety standards. A parliamentary committee works with the Min-
 istry to monitor conditions in the workplace. Jordanian law speifes a number of
 health and safety requirements for workers, including standards for bathrooms,
 drinking water, and safety and first aid equipment. The Government appears to ad-
 minister and enforce its labor laws fairly, but the deployment of too few inspectors
 hinders its effectiveness. In addition, under the present Labor Code, inspectors lack
 the power to make, or have issued, orders having immediate force and no obligation
 is imposed with respect to notifying the Labor Inspectirate of Industrial Accidents
 and Occupational Diseass. Parlament declined to consider a draft labor law during
 its last session that would revise and update legislation dating from 1960.
