 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president
 and bicameral legislature. Because no presidential candidate
 received an absolute majority of the popular vote in the
 elections of May 7, 1989, the Congress, in a procedure
 mandated by the Constitution, selected Jaime Paz Zamora to
 succeed Victor Paz Estenssoro as President. A broad range of
 parties-from the far left to the center-right--carry on a
 vigorous debate about political, economic, and social issues.
 The Government's efforts commencing in November to control the
 Supreme Court--by impeaching most of the justices-polarized
 the country and led to opposition charges that the Government
 parties sought to control all sources of political power.
 Police security forces and the military are responsible to and
 generally controlled by the civilian government.
 Although rich in minerals, which account for the bulk of its
 export earnings, Bolivia is the second poorest country in the
 Western Hemisphere. Its economy only began to show consistent
 growth in 1987-88 after years of severe contraction. The
 Government has emphasized debt reduction, export development,
 foreign investment, and a freer bankinq syste.to strengthen
 Bolivia's economic base and accelerate development.
 Human rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and generally
 are respected in practice. In 1990 significant human rights
 concerns included terrorist violence, such as kidnaping and
 murder; government corruption and cases of serious abuse,
 including killing, of detainees and prisoners; severely
 substandard priso- conditions; an overburdened and sometimes
 corrupt judieial system, and discrimination against indigenous
 groups and women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In June a new far left terrorist group, the "Nestor Paz Zamora
 Committee of the National Liberation Army"(ELN/CNPZ), kidnaped
 industrialist Jorge Lonsdale. The CNPZ had not emerged
 publicly until October 10, when it bombed the U.S. Marine
 guard residence, killing one policeman. The police detained
 numerous CNPZ members, and eventually located the CNPZ safe
 house, which it assaulted on December 5. The police killed
 three CNPZ members and captured three more. The terrorists,
 however, murdered Lonsdale during the assault. There were
 charges, including some by alleged eyewitnesses, that two of
 the CNPZ dead had been captured alive and then executed. No
 thorough investigation of these charges was conducted.
 In a related event, on December 4 the police detained Peruvian
 CNPZ member Alejandro Escobar Gutierrez, a Tupac Amaru
 R6volutionary Movement terrorist, who eventually led police to
 the CNPZ safe house. At some point on December 4 or 5, he was
 turned over to members of army intelligence for questioning.
 After extracting information from him, the army turned the
 detainee over to policemen, who then executed him. His body,
 found on a street in La Paz, showed signs of a severe beating
 and bullet wounds, one of which was the cause of death
 according to the autopsy report. The policemen were under
 
 
 BOLIVIA
 investigation at year's end. There are credible reports that
 army personnel tortured Escobar. In fact, there have been
 previous allegations that the army has tortured other CNPZ
 suspects. However, there has been no investigation of these
 charges.
 In December 1989, Bolivian authorities arrested Luis Arce
 Gomez, Interior Minister during the regime of General Garcia
 Meza in 1980-1981, and expelled him to the United States,
 where he was convicted on charges of conspiracy to import
 cocaine into the United States. While Interior Minister, Arce
 Gomez was involved in numerous cases of torture, kidnaping,
 disappearance, and extrajudicial killing. In September 1990,
 reports surfaced that Arce Gomez was bankrolling assassination
 attempts against the President of Bolivia, other government
 leaders, and the U.S. Ambassador.
 General Garcia Meza has been in hiding for several years.
 During 1990 he and 16 of his officials were being tried in
 Bolivia in absentia on numerous charges, including the 1980
 murders of politician Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz and labor
 leader Carlos Flores.
 A terrorist group calling itself the "Armed Forces of
 Liberation - Zarate Willka" (FAL-ZW) claimed responsibility
 for the politically motivated machinegun murder of two U.S.
 Mormon missionaries in La Paz in May 1989. A government
 investigation resulted in the arrest of five persons on
 charges of terrorist activities and other crimes, which
 included involvement in the murder of the Mormons. However,
 the Government appeared not to be pursuing the investigation
 seriously. The case against those accused of the murders of
 the two American citizens was proceeding, albeit very slowly,
 in the judicial system.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known politically motivated disappearances
 during 1990.
 Judicial proceedings in the General Garcia Meza case (see
 Section l.a.) involving disappearances during 1981-82 have
 entered their fourth year. The Association of Relatives of
 Those Disappeared and Martyred for Democracy (ASOFAMD) has 156
 registered cases of persons who disappeared for political
 reasons, dating back to the late 1960's. There are several
 legal proceedings involving cases after 1980, but there have
 been no verdicts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture. However, there have been
 credible charges of torture, cruelty, and degrading treatment
 of detainees and prisoners by police officers. There are
 credible allegations that terrorist suspects were tortured by
 members of army intelligence (see Section l.a.). Beatings and
 electric shock are said to be used in the San Pedro prison.
 There are reports that at least one inmate died as the result
 of a beating. Police, prison, and security personnel are
 rarely tried and punished for such acts. Corruption,
 malnutrition, unsanitary conditions, and drug-related problems
 are endemic in the Bolivian prison system.

 BOLIVIA
 Clear evidence surfaced in 1989 of serious human rights abuses
 over a period of years at the Espejos Rehabilitation Farm in
 Santa Cruz department. Los Espejos was one in a system of
 government rehabilitation farms for minor offenders which had
 deteriorated into forced labor camps run for the personal gain
 of the police. The farms had no effective outside supervision
 and corruption was rife. According to testimony and forensic
 evidence made public in late 1989, a number of prisoners,
 including minors, were used as slaves, beaten, tortured, and
 even murdered. An estimated 40 bodies of prisoners were
 discovered in a clandestine cemetery. As of mid-1990, Los
 Espejos was closed, several of the guards had disappeared, and
 the officer in charge (Colonel Luis Camacho Antezana) and four
 of his subordinates were remanded for criminal prosecution.
 By year's end, two had escaped, and two were released on bond
 pending trial.
 The Permanent Assembly of Human Rights (APDH) charged that in
 those rehabilitation farms still in operation, there continued
 to be human rights abuses in that delinquents boys were kept
 beyond the length of their terms, and most of the money made
 from their labor went into the pockets of administrators.
 Many of the minors in Los Espejos were incarcerated on
 vagrancy charges (the law gives the police the power to hold
 vagrants for up to 12 months without trial). During 1990
 there were pressures on the legislature to revise the vagrancy
 laws to exclude minors.
 In 1990 the APDH charged that the Subsecretary of Immigration
 was responsible for acts of torture and extortion against five
 citizens of the People's Republic of China residing in Bolivia
 illegally. An APDH spokesman said he interviewed the PRC
 citizens and was convinced of their mistreatment even though
 they, apparently out of fear or intimidation, later denied the
 abuse. An investigation was initiated, but no disciplinary
 action had been taken by the end of 1990.
 Conditions in some Bolivian jails are said to be exceptionally
 poor. In the San Pedro jail in La Paz, which was constructed
 to hold no more than 200 inmates, there is a population of
 more than 1,400. Overcrowding is so severe that five may be
 confined to a small cell with the result that the occupants
 sleep sitting up because there is not enough space to lie
 down. Most prisoners are unsentenced; approximately 90 of San
 Pedro's occupants are dependent children of inmates or are
 minors who have not been charged with any crime. The
 penitentiary system does not attempt to be rehabilitative, and
 there is no formal work system. Punishment for difficult
 inmates consists of being placed in roofless, very cold, or
 crowded cells. There is insufficient medical treatment, drug
 and alcohol abuse is common, and minors risk being sexually
 abused. Conditions in Santa Cruz and in the women's jail are
 reportedly much better.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires a court order for an arrest, and
 detainees must be charged or released within 48 hours. In
 practice, many detainees remain incarcerated in excess of this
 period without being charged. The Constitution also provides
 for a judicial determination of the legality of detention, and
 prisoners are usually released if a judge rules that they have
 been detained illegally. After the initial detention,
 prisoners may consult a lawyer of their choice. Provisions
 
 
 518
 BOLIVIA
 for bail exist in Bolivia except in certain narcotics cases,
 and bail is generally granted.
 In 1990 the press reported that police assigned to the Special
 Force for the Fight Against Narcotics Trafficking (FELCN) in
 the El Alto airport were planting drugs on passengers in order
 to blackmail them. According to a press release from the
 FELCN, those accused were suspended from their duties and later
 remanded to the penal system for trial. The judge hearing the
 case determined in mid-December that there was not enough
 evidence for trial. This finding provoked controversy and an
 investigation, as a result of which the prosecutor was fired
 and the judge was put under trial for failure to do his duty.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitutional right of fair public trial is adhered to in
 most respects, but delays commonly result in trials lasting 3
 to 4 years without sentencing. Some 80 percent of the
 incarcerated are estimated to be unsentenced. Investigations,
 trials, and appeals procedures are so lengthy that some
 prisoners eventually serve more time than the maximum sentence
 for the crime for which they are being charged. Some lawyers
 assert that there are not enough courts to deal with the
 workload. Defendants have the right to an attorney, to
 confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal a
 judicial decision. These rights generally are upheld in
 practice. Although the law provides for a court-appointed
 defense attorney at public expense, if necessary, one may not
 always be provided because of a shortage of funds and
 qualified personnel.
 Corruption and intimidation in the judicial system remains a
 serious problem. Judges and prosecutors are paid very poorly,
 making them susceptible to bribery. Narcotics traffickers
 often bribe judicial and other officials to obtain release of
 suspected traffickers and their aircraft, return of captured
 drugs, and purging of incriminating files. The Government has
 taken some steps to discipline Bolivia's judicial system.
 Under provisions of the Coca and Controlled Substances Law
 (Law 1008) of July 1988, the Government has begun creating
 three-judge specialized narcotics courts to deal with cases
 arising under that law. However, the courts created so far
 are overburdened, personnel are poorly qualified, and
 facilities are inadequate. Thus, the processing of cases is
 often deficient. The U.N. Fund for Drug Abuse Control
 initiated a project during 1990 to improve the handling by the
 court and by prosecutors of the most significant cases.
 Terrorist threats against judges and other officials involved
 in the cases of five prisoners allegedly linked to "Zarate
 Willka" (see Section l.a.) caused five judges to resign from
 the case during 1990 and further delayed the trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The  sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives
 are protected by the Constitution and are usually respected in
 practice. There is no evidence of the use of wiretaps or mail
 tampering. The Constitution requires a search warrant before
 entry into a home or business, but there have been incidents
 in which the police did not follow this mandate.
 
 
 519
 BOLIVIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no legal or institutional barriers to freedom of
 speech and the press in Bolivia. Many journalists are paid by
 persons and politicians to increase their exposure or suppress
 negative exposure. Also, some journalists who experienced
 repression under former governments claim they still practice
 self-censorship. Both state-owned and private radio and
 television stations operate in Bolivia. All newspapers are
 privately owned.
 The Government has consistently respected academic freedom.
 Public uiiversities enjoy autonomous status by law, and that
 status is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of peaceful assembly and association are provided
 for by law and generally respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice.
 Although an estimated 400 other religious groups, mostly
 Protestant, are active, Roman Catholicism predominates in
 Bolivia, and the Constitution recognizes it as the official
 religion. Catholic bishops receive a nominal stipend from the
 State. The Government has designated the Catholic Church as
 the coordinator of all official public ceremonies. In July
 1985, the Government declared all existing religious
 registrations void and required religious groups to
 reregister. In 1989 the Government threatened to begin legal
 proceedings against unregistered religious groups. Some
 evangelical Protestant groups complain that they are subject
 to more stringent registration procedures than the Catholic
 Church. The National Association of Evangelicals in Bolivia
 (ANDEB) reported various incidents of religious discrimination
 in the public schools and two incidents in 1990 of physical
 beatings of evangelicals, reportedly caused by Catholic
 personnel inciting people.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on travel within Bolivia or abroad.
 The Government does not impede emigration and guarantees
 departing citizens the right to return. Citizenship is not
 revoked for political reasons. However, the Government has
 used the tactic of internal exile to break strikes (see
 Section 6.a.).
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president
 and a functioning, independent, bicameral legislature.
 Opposition groups ranging from the far left to the right
 function freely both in and out of the Congress. On May 7,
 1989, Bolivia held free and fair elections which resulted in a
 peaceful, constitutional change of administration on August 6.
 The Government subsequently held municipal elections in
 December 1989.
 
 
 520
 BOLIVIA
 Suffrage has been universal since the 1952 revolution. There
 are no impediments to women voting, holding political office,
 or rising to leadership in the Government; a woman was
 president in 1980-81. Nevertheless, men of European or
 mixed-race origin are predominant in the political system.
 In November the government coalition began impeachment
 proceedings against 8 of the 12 Supreme Court justices in an
 attempt to restrict the independence of the judiciary. This
 effort caused enormous criticism from the opposition parties,
 as well as from business, labor, and civic groups; the matter
 had not been resolved by year's end.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the opinions of both
 international and domestic organizations and is willing to
 discuss human rights concerns with them. In July, however, it
 refused permission to a foreign-organized "People's Tribunal"
 to hold sessions in Bolivia on alleged violations of human
 rights carried out under the military dictatorship (1971-78)
 of General Banzer, who as head of the ADN party is the
 President's coalition partner. The Congress has committees
 responsible for monitoring observance of human rights. The
 Catholic Church, APDH, labor organizations, and the press have
 been aggressive monitors of human rights. These organizations
 comment frequently on issues and developments related to human
 rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the law contains an advanced family code passed in
 the 1970's under the Banzer Government, Bolivian women do not
 enjoy a social status equal to that of men and are generally
 unaware of their rights under the law. Cultural traditions,
 social conditions, and limited political influence remain
 major obstacles to advancement for women. In rural families,
 women contribute significantly to economic activities and
 often control the family finances, but nonetheless they are
 considered socially and politically subordinate. In urban
 settings, women are slowly achieving a greater role in
 business and professional life, as their participation in
 cooperatives, community affairs, and education increases. In
 both rural and urban settings, women are more likely to be
 illiterate and employed in low-level or domestic jobs.
 There are no reliable and complete statistics indicating the
 extent of violence against women in Bolivia. However, many
 women charge that this is a serious problem. This charge was
 borne out in a study prepared by a women's rights group in
 November 1989 which cataloged 98 articles in 5 major
 newspapers between March and October 1989 concerning violence
 involving women. An organization called the Center for the
 Investigation and Development of Women (CIDEM) is working to
 change the penal code and further protect women from
 violence. Violence against women is a criminal offense in
 Bolivia, and legal sanctions are regularly applied' when cases
 come to the attention of the authorities. Women are reluctant
 to bring charges in cases of domestic violence, and the
 incidence of such abuse as wife beating is very likely
 underreported. Legal counseling is available for women on a
 limited basis through private organizations.
 
 
 BOLIVIA
 Although prohibited by the Constitution, discrimination
 against people of indigenous background continues, a fact all
 political leaders acknowledge. The Aymara- and Quechua-
 speaking Indian majority of the population remains at the
 lower end of the country's socioeconomic scale and is
 disadvantaged in terms of health, life expectancy, education,
 income, literacy, and employment. The Government's programs
 to ease Bolivia's economic crisis, including infrastructure
 projects sponsored by the Social Investment Fund, such as
 -schools, health clinics, and water systems, directly benefit
 some of the disadvantaged.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Bolivian workers have the right to establish and join
 organizations of their own choosing, and they are free to
 elect their own leaders. Labor law prohibits any contract
 which denies workers' constitutional rights and freedoms.
 Workers possess and frequently exercise the right to strike.
 However, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU) cited Bolivia, among other countries, in its May 1990
 "Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights" for
 infringing on the right to strike. Bolivia has legislated a
 compulsory dispute settlement system, which the ICFTU equates
 to a general strike prohibition. In practice, however,
 strikes do occur and the Government is often willing to settle
 the strikes peacefully. For example, in September three
 government ministers stepped in to negotiate a settlement with
 striking petroleum workers after the workers refused to
 negotiate with the management of the state-owned firm.
 Nevertheless, the Government has also used intimidation and
 force to suppress strikes.
 In its May report, the ICFTU also cited'Bolivia for two
 incidents that occurred in 1989. On March 15, 1989, the
 Government used force to disperse some 300 miners in La Paz
 who were engaged in a hunger strike for improved social
 benefits. On November 15, 1989, theGovernment declared a
 90-day state of siege because of a strike by 84,000 teachers
 for a cost-of-living bonus. The Government detained 858 trade
 unionists, including the General Secretary and eight national
 executive members of the Bolivian Workers Central (COB), and
 teachers' leader Wilma Plata, who alleges she was severely
 beaten at the time of her arrest; The Government did not
 dispute this in its response to the ICFTU complaint. Of those
 detained, 153 were held in internal exile in remote locations
 for 3 weeks and were released. The Government described the.
 strike movement as an attempt to destabilize constitutionally
 established authority, and justified the state of siege on the
 basis of street violence. The Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) criticized the state of siege as "out of all proportion"
 and said that the Government should have used lesser emergency
 measures. The May 1990 report of the CFA deplored the arrests
 and exiles; noted that the punishment was short-lived;
 reminded the Government that the principles of labor rights
 preclude this kind of action for trade union reasons; and
 expressed the hope that discussions the Government proposed
 with the Teachers' Union will yield an agreement satisfactory
 to both parties.
 
 
 BOLIVIA
 The COB, an umbrella labor organization which represents the
 majority of unionized workers, has been independent of the
 Government since its founding in 1952. In June the COB called
 for a 48-hour strike and demonstrations throughout the country
 to protest the Government's increase in fuel prices and to
 demand that the Government give up its attempt to privatize
 state-owned enterprises and levy new taxes. The Government,
 relying on the dispute settlement mechanism to which the ICFTU
 objects, declared the stoppage illegal.
 The Government places no restrictions on a union's right to
 join international labor organizations. The COB became an
 affiliate of the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Bolivian workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The law does not extend this right to
 government workers, but the distinction is largely ignored in
 practice, as virtually all government workers are unionized.
 Negotiations between government representatives and freely
 elected labor leaders are common.
 There are no collective bargaining agreements as the term is
 normally used. In state industries, the union issues a list
 of demands, and the Government concedes some points. The
 procedure in the private sector is similar: the union
 presents its demands, the Government determines the
 appropriate wage, and employers in that sector abide by the
 Government's decision. There are no signed agreements.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers
 against union members and organizers. Complaints are referred
 to the National Labor Court, which often takes a year or two
 to rule on a question. Labor activists say that a problem is
 often moot by the time the Court gives an answer.
 There are no export processing zones in Bolivia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor and it is
 generally not practiced (see Section l.c.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits the employment of minors under 18 years of
 age in dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work. Planned
 revisions in Bolivia's 50-year-old labor code should clarify
 ambiguities in the law concerning the employment of children
 under 14 years of age. However, the existing legal provisions
 concerning employment of children are not enforced. Child
 labor under 14 is very common. Children can be found on the
 streets vending lottery tickets and cocaine base, shining
 shoes, and assisting transport operators. They are not
 generally employed in factories or businesses.
 Responsibility for enforcing child labor provisions lies with
 the National Office of Minors, which is part of the
 independent executive agency, Social Action Group for the
 Presidency. The size of the enforcement agency does not
 measure up to the problem, however. The main reason that
 enforcement is ineffective is that child labor is so much an
 accepted part of the economy that the families of working
 
 
 528
 BOLIVIA
 children depend upon their income. Moreover, the people who
 employ children believe they are doing them a favor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Bolivia has a minimum wage law and a system of bonuses and
 compensation for the private sector. However, a minimum wage
 earner cannot on his own provide his family with a reasonable
 standard of living. Bolivia remains the poorest country in
 South America, and the per capita gross domestic product is
 stagnant as economic growth barely keeps pace with that of the
 population. In urban areas, only half the labor force
 observes an 8-hour day afid a workweek of 5 or 5 1/2 days.
 Like many other labor laws, the maximum legal workweek of 44
 hours is'not effectively enforced. The legal minimum monthly
 wage is less than $20. However, the average worker (in
 textiles and construction, for example) receives a monthly
 wage of somewhat less than $100.
 Responsibility for the protection of workers' health and
 safety lies with the Labor Ministry's Bureau of Occupational
 Safety. Labor laws that provide for the protection of
 workers' health and safety are not adequately enforced.
 Although the state-owned mine corporation COMIBOL has a
 special office charged with mine safety, the mines, often old
 and operated with antiquated equipment, are particularly
 dangerous and unhealthy.
 There is significant employment (estimated at 100,000 or more)
 in the illegal cocaine industry. Conditions of employment,
 particularly for itinerant laborers employed in the pits
 producing coca paste, are extremely poor and hazardous due to
 exposure to dangerous chemicals. Since this industry is
 illegal, it is completely unregulated. One important
 objective of Bolivia's extensive programs of alternate
 economic development is to provide acceptable conditions of
 legal employment for workers displaced by elimination of
 illegal cocaine production.
