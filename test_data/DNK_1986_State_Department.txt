 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a strongly
 established tradition of democratic parliamentary rule. The
 reigning monarch is Queen Margrethe II. A cabinet headed by
 the Prime Minister and accountable to the unicameral
 Parliament (Folketing) has responsibility for government
 decisions. The 179 members of the Folketing are elected in
 free and open elections under a complex system of proportional
 representation designed to protect the rights of minority
 parties and to reflect the popular vote. Since late 1982,
 Denmark has been governed by a four-party minority coalition
 led by Prime Minister Schlueter's Conservative Party. The
 coalition is dependent on support from other parties to
 maintain a parliamentary majority.
 Human rights are highly respected and well protected in
 Denmark, both in principle and in practice. The Constitution
 establishes the Folketing's "ombudsman," to whom any citizen
 may protest if he or she feels wrongly or unreasonably treated
 by any Danish national or municipal authority. At the global
 level, Denmark participates actively in a number of
 international commissions concerned with the protection and
 preservation of human rights.
 Denmark has displayed a high degree of concern for the rights
 of minorities, particularly the indigenous populations of
 territories such as Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which now
 enjoy broad powers of home rule.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions did not
 occur.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Protection against torture and inhuman treatment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. A rehabilitation and
 research center for torture victims established in 1983 in
 Copenhagen treats patients in the refugee community. An
 estimated 150 foreign torture victims obtain asylum yearly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person in Denmark can be deprived of personal liberty
 without due process of law. Arrested individuals must be
 taken before a judge within 24 hours of detention. The judge
 has the authority to determine whether the person should be
 detained in pretrial custody or released pending trial. The
 Constitution makes provision for bail. Arrested individuals
 have access to legal counsel of their choice or court-appointed
 attorneys. Non-Danish speakers are provided with interpreters
 at government expense. The occasional use of solitary
 confinement during the pretrial custody period has been
 criticized in the media, but police authorities maintain that

 the isolation system continues to be used only in the most
 serious crimes, such as narcotics violations.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally public; judges are allowed to make
 exceptions to this rule only in certain circumstances, such as
 paternity and divorce trials. In criminal cases, trials are
 only closed when it is necessary to protect the privacy of the
 victim, such as in rape or child molestation cases, or when it
 is deemed necessary to protect the identity of a witness. To
 ensure a fair trial, Danish courts make extensive efforts to
 obtain the facts of a case, and the rights of the accused are
 carefully protected. All indigent defendants have the right
 to a court-appointed attorney at government expense. The
 defendant is free to change the court-appointed attorney.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, searches of the home, seizure and
 examination of papers, and breaches of the secrecy of
 communications are prohibited in the absence of a judicial
 order, unless a particular exception is provided for by
 statute. These provisions are respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Denmark has a free and open society. A person may express an
 opinion in written or oral form on any matter, subject only to
 the condition that he or she may be held responsible in a
 court of law if there are charges of libel or malicious
 slander. Media representatives and private individuals make
 full use of the freedom of expression. Criticism of the
 Government or government policy is not a punishable offense,
 and censorship is not practiced.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danish residents are free to assemble and form associations
 for any lawful purpose. Police are entitled to be present at
 public meetings or demonstrations which could constitute a
 danger to the public peace.
 Approximately 85 percent of Danish wage earners are members of
 trade unions. Under the General Agreement of 1960, workers
 and employers acknowledged each other's right to organize.
 Labor agreements and legislation protect the rights of workers
 and employers and regulate the work environment.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, the Evangelical Lutheran Church is
 recognized as the established church of Denmark. However,
 religious freedom is guaranteed to all residents. No one may
 be discriminated against because of religious beliefs. These
 laws are strictly enforced in practice.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have complete freedom to travel and to reenter Denmark.
 Denmark is a homogeneous ethnocentric society with
 historically only a small number of nonnorthern European
 residents who have been accorded a high level of acceptance.
 Refugees and asylum-seekers are provided with travel documents,
 when needed, which permit return to Denmark. Forced
 repatriation is not utilized. The Alien Act of 1983 spells
 out in detail the rights of aliens in Denmark and provides for
 appeal procedures when residence permission is denied.
 Measures designed to protect the rights of potential refugees
 or asylum-seekers include the establishment of a Refugee Board
 with authority to reverse decisions of the Alien Directorate
 and guaranteed access to legal counsel and interpreter service.
 Since 1983 there has been a massive influx of asylum-seekers.
 Over 18,000 people have asked for asylum (mostly Sri Lankan
 Tamils, Iranians, and Lebanese). This large number of
 ethnically dissimilar people who require shelter, education,
 and public assistance has generated additional pressure on the
 Danish welfare system. The vast majority of Danish political
 leaders continue to emphasize the need for Danish understanding
 and acceptance of the recent arrivals,, and many have spoken
 out in favor of increased tolerance for other ethnic groups in
 Denmark following the rise of tensions between native Danes
 and immigrant groups.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Prime Minister is appointed by the reigning monarch after
 consultation with the political parties represented in the
 Folketing. Members of the Folketing are selected in open
 elections in which every Danish citizen 18 years or over may
 participate.' A political party must obtain at least 2 percent
 of the totalvote to obtain representation in the Folketing.
 Nine political parties with a variety of political beliefs are
 represented in the current Parliament. The Constitution
 states that parliamentary elections must be held at least
 every 4 years. The government can be changed in an election
 or, as happened in 1982, by the resignation of the government
 in power and the formation of a new government composed of
 parties already represented in the Folketing.
 All Danish citizens and subjects are guaranteed equal
 protection under the law. The territories of Greenland and
 the Faroe Islands have home rule governments with broad powers
 encompassing all but foreign and security affairs. Native
 Greenlanders enjoy all the rights and privileges of other
 Danish citizens. In addition, Greenland and Faroe
 representation in the national Parliament is proportionately
 larger than that for continental Denmark, and Greenland has a
 special criminal code designed for local customs and
 conditions. Native Greenlanders freely participate in
 international ethnic organizations such as the Inuit
 Circumpolar Conference, based in Greenland, which has been
 recognized by the United Nations. Despite periodic
 disagreements between home rule authorities and the
 Government, there have been no formal accusations of human
 rights violations made against the Government.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Denmark is a party to various international human rights
 conventions designed to promote and protect human rights. The
 Government's commitment to human rights issues is fully
 supported by the Danish population, as shown in opinion polls.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 The living standards and educational levels of native
 Greenlanders (Eskimos) are lower than those of other Danish
 citizens, but they are improving steadily, in part because of
 heavy spending on housing, health, and education programs by
 the Government.
 The Equal Rights Council has worked successfully to eliminate
 laws and regulations which contained sex discrimination
 provisions. Women hold positions of authority at all levels
 of society and actively participate at all levels of the
 political process. They are in positions of authority in
 political parties, local governments, and in the national
 government. Women head three cabinet ministries (Agriculture,
 Social Affairs, and Ecclesiastical Affairs) and hold about 26
 percent of the seats in the Parliament.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15, and
 specific limitations described in detail in the Working
 Environment Act of 1975 apply to the type of work which may be
 performed by those between 15 and 18 years of age. This act
 also describes acceptable conditions of work, including safety
 and health; the general duties of employers, supervisors,
 employees, and suppliers; the performance of work; rest
 periods and rest days; and medical examinations. The act also
 establishes a Labor Inspections Service. There is no minimum
 wage, but the lowest wage level set in any national labor
 negotiation is approximately the equivalent of US$6.40 per
 hour. Denmark is now taking steps to reduce the standard
 workweek from 40 to 39 hours. The "ll-hour rule" stipulates
 that any worker has the right to rest for 11 hours before the
 start of the next day's work.
