 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian state in which the Chi-
 nese Communist Party (CCP) is the paramount source of power. At the national and
 regional levels, party members hold almost all top government, police, and military
 positions. Ultimate authority rests with members of the Politburo. Leaders stress
 the need to maintain stability and social order and are committed to perpetuating
 the rule of the CCP and its hierarchy. Citizens lack both the freedom peacefully to
 express opposition to the party-led political system and the right to change their na-
 tional leaders or form of government. Socialism continues to provide the theoretical
 underpinning of Chinese politics, but Marxist ideology has given way to economic
 pragmatism in recent years, and economic decentralization has increased the au-
 thority of regional officials. The party's authority rests primarily on the Govern-
 ment's ability to maintain social. stability, appeals to nationalism and patriotism,
 party control of personnel and the security apparatus, and the continued improve-
 ment in the living standards of most of China's 1.2 billion citizens. The Constitution
 provides for an independent judiciary; however, in practice, the judicial system is
 subject to the "policy guidance" of the CCP and government influence, particularly
 in politically sensitive cases.
 The security apparatus is made up of the Ministries of State Security and Public
 Security, the People's Armed Police, the People's Liberation Army, and the state ju-
 dicial, procuratorial, and penal systems. Security policy and personnel were respon-
 sible for numerous human rights abuses.
 China has a mixed economy that continues to expand, albeit at a slower rate than
 in recent years. The growth rate target was 8.0 percent for 1998. According to offi-
 cial government statistics gross domestic product reached a growth rate of 7.8 per-
 cent, but the actual figure was widely considered to be between 3 and 5 percent.
 The economy faces growing problems, including state enterprise reform, unemploy-
 ment, underemployment, and regional economic -disparities. Rural unemployment
 and underemployment is estimated to be over 30 percent. Tens of millions of peas-
 ants have left their homes in search of better jobs and living conditions. Demog-
 raphers estimate that between 80 and 130 million persons make up this "floating
 population," with many major cities counting 1 million or more such persons. Urban
 areas also are coping with millions of state workers idled on partial wages or unem-
 ployed as a result of industrial reforms. Workers throughout the country increas-
 ingly organized public protests to press their demands. Nonetheless, economic re-
 forms have raised living standards for many, providing greater independence for en-
 trepreneurs, diminishing state control over the economy and citizen's daily lives,
 and creating new economic opportunities. Despite serious economic difficulties in the
 state sector, individual economic opportunities expanded in nonstate sectors, result-
 ing in increased freedom of employment and mobility. The total number of citizens
 living in absolute poverty continues to decline; estimates range from official figures
 of 42 million to World Bank estimates of 150 million. However, the income gap be-
 tween coastal and internal regions is growing markedly. The ratio is now approxi-
 mately 12 to 1.
 The Government's human rights record deteriorated sharply beginning in the
 final months of the year with a crackdown against organized political dissent. The
 loosening of restrictions on political debate and activism by authorities for much of
 1997 and 1998, including toward public calls forpolitical reform and expressions of
 opposition to government policies, abruptly ended in the fall. The Government con-
 tinued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in viola-
 tion of internationally accepted norms. These abuses stemmed from the authorities'
 very limited tolerance of public dissent aimed at the Government, fear of unrest,
 and the limited scope or inadequate implementation of laws protecting basic free-
 doms. The Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, but these
 protections often are ignored in practice. Abuses included instances of extrajudicial
 killings, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest
 and detention, lengthy incommunicado detention, and denial of due process. Prison
 conditions at most facilities remained harsh. In many cases, particularly sensitive
 political cases, the judicial system denies criminal defendants basic legal safeguards
 and due process because authorities attach higher priority to maintaining public
 order and suppressing political opposition than to enforcing legal norms. The Gov-
 ernment infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government continued restric-
 tions on freedom of speech and of the press, and tightened these toward the end
 of the year. The Government severely restricted freedom of assembly, and continued
 to restrict freedom of association, religion, and movement. Discrimination against
 women, minorities, and the disabled; violence against women, including coercive
 
 
 family planning practices--which sometimes include forced abortion and forced ster-
 ilization; prostitution, trafficking in Women and children, and the abuse of children
 all are problems. The Government continued to restrict tightly worker rights, and
 forced labor remains a problem. Serious human rights abuses persisted in minority
 areas, including Tibet and Xinjiang, where restrictions on religion and other fun-
 damental freedoms intensified.
 Beginning in the fall, Communist Party leaders moved to "nip in the bud" orga-
 nized challenges they believed threatened national stability or Communist Party au-
 thority. Dozens of political activists were arrested for attempts to register a political
 party and engage in other political activities. In November over 30 members and
 supporters of the China Democracy Party were detained, and, in December, three
 of its leaders were sentenced to lengthy jail terms, apparently as a warning to other
 activists. Veteran dissidents Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongmin were tried
 under the law on state security for their attempts to organize and register the CDP
 as an opposition party and for allegedly colluding with foreign forces to "subvert
 state power." They were given harsh sentences of 13, 11, and 12 years, respectively,
 in closed trials that flagrantly violated due process. Also in November and Decem-
 ber, the authorities imposed new regulations on the Internet, the publishing indus-
 try, and social organizations; closed several newspapers and fired several outspoken
 editors; and banned a popular, but politically- sensitive, book and other publications.
 The China Development Union, an independent group in Beijing, which had orga-
 nized discussions on a wide range of topical issues, including political reform, had
 its activities curtailed in November and was eventually shut down.
 Unapproved religious groups, including Protestant and Catholic groups, continued
 to experience varying degrees of official interference and repression. The Govern-
 ment continued to enforce 1994 State Council regulations requiring all places of reli-
 gious activity to register with the Government and come under the supervision of
 official, "patriotic" religious organizations. There were significant differences from
 region to region, and even locality to locality, in the attitudes of government officials
 toward religion. In some areas, authorities guided by national policy made strong
 efforts to control the activities of unapproved Catholic and Protestant churches; reli-
 gious services were broken up and church leaders or adherents were detained and,
 at times, reportediy beaten. At year's end, some remained in prison because of their
 religious activities. In other regions, registered and unregistered churches were
 treated similarly by the authorities. Citizens worshiping in officially sanctioned
 churches,, mosques, and temples reported little or no day-to-day interference by the
 Government. The number of religious adherents in many churches, both registered
 and unregistered, continued to grow at a rapid pace. The Government engaged in
 discussions of religious freedom, issues with the international community, welcoming
 several high-level foreign delegations.
 Although the Government denies that it holds political or religious prisoners, and
 argues that all those in prison are legitimately serving sentences for crimes under
 the law, an unknown number of persons, estimated at several thousand, are de-
 tained in violation of international human rights instruments for peacefully express-
 ing their political, religious, or social views. Persons detained at times during the
 year include political activists who tried to register an opposition party; leaders of
 a national house church movement; and organizers of political discussion groups
 that exceeded what-the Government deemed the permissible level of dissent. Some
 minority groups, particularly Tibetan Buddhists and Muslim Uyghurs, came under
 increasing pressure as the Government clamped down on dissent and "separatist"
 activities. In Tibet the reeducation campaign aimed at monks and nuns was re-
 newed, as was a rhetorical campaign against the Dalai Lama. In Xinjiang, authori-
 ties tightened restrictions on fundamental freedoms in an effort to control independ-
 ence groups.
 The Government took some actions to address international concerns in the area
 of human rights. In October it signed the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Po-
 litical Rights (ICCPR), but gave no indication when the covenant would be ratified.
 In September the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
 (UNHCHR) visited for the first time at the invitation of the Government. The Gov-
 ernment also continued to expand its human rights dialogs and exchanges with
 other nations, and in October hosted for the first time an international human
 rights conference in Beijing.
 The authorities released a few political prisoners before their terms were over.
 Tiananmen student leader Wang Dan was released on medical parole in April on
 the condition that he leave the country for medical treatment. Liu Nianchun was
 released under the same conditions in December. Both are now living abroad in
 exile. Catholic Bishop Zeng Jingmu and democracy activist Pan Mingdong were re-
 leased on medical parole before the end of their terms and remained in China.
 
 
 Bishop Zeng was reportedly under house arrest at year's end. Zhang Xiaoxu was pa-
 roled 6 years early, after having served 9 years of his 15-year sentence for involve-
 ment in the 1989 student protests. However, at year's end several thousand others,
 including Li Hal, Han Chunsheng, Liu Jingsheng, Chen Lantao, Liu Xiaobo, Chen
 Longde, Pastor Xu Yongze, Bishop An Shuxin, Abbot Chadrel Rinpoche, Ngawang
 Sangdrol, Jigme Sangpo, and Ngawang Choephel remained in prison for the peace-
 ful expression of their political, social, or religious views. Some of those who com-
 pleted their sentences and were released from prison-such as Bao Tong, senior aide
 to former Communist Party leaders-were kept under surveillance and prevented
 from taking employment or otherwise resuming normal lives.
 During the year, the Government launched new efforts to reform the legal system
 and widely disseminated information about new legislation. It also initiated a highly
 publicized campaign to "rectify" endemic problems such as corruption and abuse of
 power on the part of judges, prosecutors, and police. A number of laws passed in
 recent years, if enforced effectively, hold the potential to enhance citizens rights-
 e.g., the Administrative Litigation Law, the Lawyers Law, the State Compensation
 Law, the Prison Law, the Criminal Law, and the Criminal Procedure Law. The re-
 vised Criminal Procedure Law, which came into effect in 1997, provided for the de-
 fendant's right to legal counsel, an active legal defense, and other rights of criminal
 defendants recognized in international human rights instruments. If fully imple-
 mented, this law would bring China's criminal laws closer toward compliance with
 international norms. However, enforcement of the new statute was uneven and in-
 complete and was violated in the cases of high-proffie dissidents. In an effort to
 strengthen enforcement, the Government issued additional, more specific imple-
 menting guidelines. The Government also expanded efforts to educate lawyers,
 judges, prosecutors, and especially the public on the provisions of new statutes.
 China expanded its efforts to increase bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the
 field of law.
 In addition, some positive trends continued. The leadership continued govern-
 mental restructuring efforts and took steps to create a more accountable and less
 intrusive government (under the firm leadership of the Communist Party). The
 range of issues covered in the media--especially regarding corruption and abuse of
 power--continued to expand. New initiatives were undertaken to improve the trans-
 parency and accountability of China's judicial and legal systems; nongovernmental-
 level village committee elections were expanded, giving citizens choices about grass-
 roots representatives, as well as introducing the principle of democratic elections;
 and at least one experiment with township elections was conducted successfully (al-
 beit not approved in advance by the central Government). Government efforts to
 separate the military and the Communist Party from commercial ventures pro-
 ceeded, as did campaigns against government corruption and smuggling. Social
 groups with economic resources at their disposal continued to play an increasing
 role in community life.
 Despite the sharp crackdown on political dissent at the end of the year, society
 as a whole continued to be more open and diverse. Academics and government offi-
 cials continued to debate formerly taboo subjects such as political reform and democ-
 ratization in official channels. Satellite television broadcasts continued to be widely
 available, particularly in coastal provinces, despite the Government's efforts to regu-
 late the sale and use of satellite dishes. Cable television also is available in many
 cities, including access to global news networks. As many as 6 million citizens had
 access to the Internet, although the Government increased its efforts to try to con-
 trol the content of material available on the Internet. Overall, average citizens go
 about their daily lives with more personal freedom than ever before: Higher dispos-
 able income, looser economic controls, greater freedom of movement, increased ac-
 cess to outside sources of information, greater room for individual choice, and more
 diversity in cultural life. However, authorities did not hesitate to move quickly
 against those it perceived to be a threat to government power or national stability.
 Citizens who seek to express openly dissenting political and religious views continue
 to live in an environment filled with repression.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The official press reported a number
 of instances of extrajudicial killings, but no nationwide statistics are available. For
 example, the media reported that a police officer, who murdered a local official in
 September, was tried and sentenced to death. The case was cited as part of a na-
 tionwide crackdown on police corruption and abuses (see Section 1.c.).
 
 
 840
 The families of three suspects, who had died while 'in police custody, wrote to
 UNHCHR Mary Robinson during her September visit. One of the victims, Zhou
 -Guiyi, was found dead in a Hebei police detention center in April with wounds over
 most of his body. Another, Xiao Beizhou, died in a hospital in January after being
 beaten by police with batons, his family said. According to the-Tibet Information
 Network (TIN), 32 Tibetan political prisoners died in detention during the years
 1987-1998 (see Tibet addendum).
 There continued to be numerous executions carried out after summary trials, al-
 though the number of death sentences was significantly less than in 1997. Such
 trials can occur under circumstances where the lack of due process protections bor-
 ders on extrajudicial killing (see Section I.e.). On December 3, according to the
 Legal Daily, the Xinjiang Higher People's Court sentenced 15 persons to death; the
 executions reportedly were carried out immediately after the judgments were hand-
 ed down.
 In March the China Youth Daily reported that three prosecutors in Fuzhou had
 tortured a prisoner with boiling water and beat him to death in 1996 while trying
 to force him to confess (see Section 1.c.). The prosecutors were tried by a local court
 and given sentences ranging from 12 to 15 years in prison.
 There were a number of bombings and killings of policemen in Xinjiang by
 Uyghur separatist groups (see Section 5).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new reports of disappearances. However, the
 Government still has not provided a comprehensive, credible accounting of those
 missing or detained in connection with the suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen dem-
 onstrations. Long incommunicado detentions continued, although there were fewer
 reports than in 1997 (see Section l.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture; however, police and other elements of the security appa-
 ratus employed torture or degrading treatment in dealing with detainees and pris-
 oners. Former detainees and the press have reported credibly that officials used
 electric shocks, prolonged periods of solitary confinement, incommunicado detention,
 beatings, shackles, and other forms of abuse 'against detained men and women.
 Prominent dissident Liu Nianchun, who was released in December, reported that
 guards used an electric stun gun on him. Persons detained pending trial were par-
 ticularly at risk during pretrial detention due to systemic weaknesses in the legal
 system or lack of implementation of the revised Criminal Law and Criminal Proce-
 dure Law.
 In May a Canadian television network broadcast footage shot in October 1997 and
 April of prisoners being beaten during interrogations at a Shanghai police station.
 A foreign prisoner in Chinese custody reported in May that he had been beaten and
 kicked by police. According to a press report, in February a Yunnan court over-
 turned a verdict in which a young farmer had been sentenced to death for murder
 based upon a false confession extracted by police using torture. The victim said that
 the police had tied his hands with a wet rope, forced him to kneel, and beat him
 for 5 hours. Another falsely accused suspect in the case said that he had been given
 no water during 5 days of interrogation. According to the newspaper article, the tor-
 ture victims each were compensated approximately $3,000 (24,835.5 rmb). Three
 prosecutors who tortured and beat a prisoner to death in 1996 were sentenced to
 prison terms (see Section l.a.). In March the China Youth Daily reported that three
 prosecutors in Fuzhou had tortured a prisoner with boiling water and beat him to
 death in 1996. The three were tried and given sentences ranging'from 12 to 15
 years in prison (see Section l.a.). Authorities reportedly tortured and otherwise
 abused a Roman Catholic priest (see Section 2.c.), an allegation the Government de-
 nied. There were reports of instances when the police beat worshipers at house
 churches (see Section 2.c.); and there were reports that police beat protestors (see
 Section 2.b.).
 The Government has stated that "the Chinese judiciary deals with every com-
 plaint of trture promptly after it is fied, and those found guilty are punished ac-
 cording to law." Guangdong provincial authorities said in August that they had in-
 vestigated and prosecuted 507 Communist party cadres and policemen who had vio-
 lated the law, including those guilty of offenses such as extorting confession by tor-
 ture and unlawful detention of suspects. As part of its campaign to address police
 abuse, the Government for the first time published national torture statistics, along
 with 99 case studies, in a volume called, "The Law Against Extorting a Confession
 by Torture." The book, which was published by the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
 stated that 126 persons had died during police interrogation in 1993 and 115 in
 1994. There was also a noticeable increase in the number of torture cases reported
 in the official media during the year, although most still are believed to go unre-
 ported.
 
 
 Authorities mounted a nationwide crackdown on police corruption and abuses.
 The Minister of Public Security in October admitted that some policemen "would
 never pass the test of power and money" and that they "abuse their authority for
 personal profit and accept bribes to bend the law." In May the People's Daily re-
 ported that 2,000 police officers had been dismissed in Shanxi province since the
 start of a " rectification" drive in February; however, many police and security offi-
 cials who are guilty of abuses go unpunished.
 Conditions in penal institutions for both political prisoners and common criminals
 are generally harsh and frequently degrading. According to released political pris-
 oners, it is standard practice for political prisoners to be segregated from each other
 and placed with common criminals. There are reports that common criminals have
 beaten political prisoners at the instigation of guards. During a March meeting with
 the Minister of Justice, one National People's Congress delegate complained of se-
 vere overcrowding in her local prison in Guangdong, in which there reportedly was
 little space for inmates to sit down and two prisoners slept in each bed. China's
 1994 Prison Law was designed, in part, to improve treatment of detainees and re-
 spect for their legal rights. The Government's stated goal is to convert one-half of
 the nation's prisons and 150 reeducation-through-labor camps into "modernized, civ-
 ilized" facilities by the year 2010. According to credible sources, persons held in new
 "model" prisons receive better treatment than those held in other prison facilities.
 (For conditions in prisons in Tibet, see the Tibet addendum.)
 Adequate, timely medical care for prisoners continues to be a serious problem, de-
 spite official assurances that prisoners have the right to prompt medical treatment
 they become ill. Nutritional and health conditions can be grim. At year's end, po-
 litical prisoners who reportedly had difficulties in obtaining medical treatment, de-
 spite repeated appeals on their behalf by their families and the international com-
 munity, included Gao Yu, Chen Lantao, Zhang Shanguang, Chen Longde, Ngawang
 Sangdrol, and Chadrel Rinpoche. According to one credible report, there have been
 instances in which women in reeducation-though-labor camps found to be pregnant
 while serving sentences were forced to submit to abortions (see Section 1.f.).
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons or reeduca-
 tion-tough-labor camps, and prisoners remain largely inaccessible to international
 human rights organizations. The Government took some steps toward greater trans-
 parency in the prison system. Following visits to several Chinese prisons by the
 U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 1997, UNHCHR Robinson also in-
 spected prisons in several cities during her September visit. In May ambassadors
 from three European Union (EU) member states were allowed to visit Drapchi pris-
 on in Lhasa during a fact-finding trip to Tibet. In February a group of 20 EU rep-
 resentatives were allowed to visit Daxing prison in Beijing as part of the continuing
 China-EU human rights dialog. There were unconfirmed reports that prisoners who
 attempted to communicate with observers subsequently were punished or beaten.
 There was no progress in talks between China and the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) on an agreement for ICRC access to Chinese prisons. The
 Government continued discussions with a prominent foreign businessm   nand
 human rights monitor on prisoner accounting and confirmed its intention to con-
 tinue doing so. The flow of information from the Ministry of Justice to this monitor
 slowed noticeably in the latter half of the year; by year's end, information had been
 provided on 50 of the 100 names submitted on ists in 1995.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention remain
 serious problems. There were fewer reports of long incommunicado detentions than
 in the previous year. Because the Government tightly controls information, it is im-
 possible accurately to determine the total number of persons subjected to new or
 continued arbitrary arrest or detention. Amnesty International estimates that ap-
 proximately 250 persons remain in prisons or labor camps for activities related to
 the 1989 Tiananmen protests alone. According to estimates, thousands remain in-
 carcerated, charged with other criminal offenses, detained but not charged, or sen-
 tenced to reeducation through labor. The international pres  s reported that there
 are some 230,000 persons in reeducation-Through-labor camps, sentenced to up to
 3 years through administrative procedures, not a trial. According to a May Hong
 Kong report, Beijing dissident Wang Wanxing, who s e sted  a  ret in Tiananmen
 Square in 1992, still was being held in a psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Bei-
 jing. Chen Ziming remained under house arrest at year's end.
 The amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law, which came into effect in 1997,
 represented a significant improvement in the statutes governing arrest and deten-
 tion. The amendments provide for earlier and greater access for defendants to legal
 counsel and the abolition of a regulation that allowed summary trials in certain
 cases involving the death penalty. Under the old system, defendants were not al-
 lowed to consult an attorney until 7 days before trial, usually precluding the possi-
 
 
 842
 bility of mounting an effective defense. The amended law gives most suspects the
 right to seek legal counsel shortly after their initial detention and interrogation.
 However, political activists still have significant problems obtaining competent legal
 representation of their own choosing. In December Wang Youcai was forced to de-
 -fend himself during his trial because authorities prevented travel by his lawyer. Qin
 Yongmin also was tried without a lawyer because no lawyer would take his case
 due to his insistence on pleading innocent; his request that his trial be delayed until
 he could find a lawyer was denied. Although Xu Wenli was able to hire a lawyer,
 he was able to meet with him only once before his trial began.
 While representing an improvement over past practice, anecdotal evidence sug-
 gested that implementation of the new Criminal Procedure Law so far remains un-
 even and far from complete. In some cases, differing interpretations of the law taken
 by different judicial and police departments have resulted in contradictory and in-
 complete implementation. The Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's
 Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, the Min-
 istry of Justice, and the Legal Work Committee of the National People's Congress
 in January issued supplementary, implementing regulations to adress some of
 these weaknesses. During the year, the Government intensified its efforts to educate
 lawyers, judges, prosecutors, and especially the public on the provisions of the new
 law. The Deputy Procurator-General announced in October that, on an experimental
 basis, police and prosecutors would show suspects a card outlining their basic legal
 rights upon detention. Suspects also would be informed of time limits on investiga-
 tions, appeal regulations, and the legal responsibilities of prosecutors, the report
 said.
 Even if fully implemented, the Criminal Procedure Law still would fall short of
 international standards in many respects. For example, while the statute precludes
 a presumption of guilt it includes no explicit recognition of the presumption of inno-
 cence; has insufficient safeguards against use of evidence gathered through illegal
 means such as torture; the appeals process fails to provide sufficient avenue for re-
 view; and there are inadequate remedies for violations of defendants' rights. How-
 ever, the law did abolish an often criticized form of pretrial detention known as
 "shelter and investigation" that allowed police to detain suspects for extended peri-
 ods without charge. Nonetheless, in some cases, police unilaterally still can detain
 a person for up to 37 days before releasing him or formally placing him under ar-
 rest. Once a suspect is arrested, the revised law-allows police and prosecutors to
 detain him for months before trial while a case is being "further investigated." Few
 suspects are released on bail or put in another form of noncustodial detention pend-
 ing trial. In March poet Chen Dongdong was released after 10 months in police cus-
 y. In October a  ingdao court sentenced Shandong dissident Chen Zengxiang to
 7 years in prison after he had spent nearly 5 months in a detention center. Chen
 was convicte& at a closed trial of divulging state secrets, during which he was not
 allowed to be represented by a lawyer.
 During the year, as dissidents around the country stepped up their activities,
 there were more frequent reports of temporary detentions. These incidents ranged
 from dissidents being questioned by police for a few hours to activists being held
 for days or weeks especially during politically sensitive periods. Authorities also de-
 tained journallsts (see Section 2.a.), leaders of unauthorized religious groups and
 worshipers in house churches (see Section 2.c.), and the relatives of dissidents (see
 Section 2.a.).
 During the March plenary session of the National People's Congress (NPC),
 Shenzhen resident Miao Xike tried to set up a sign on Tiananmen Square and shout
 slogans urging greater respect for human rights. He was detained for more than 2
 weeks. Numerous activists throughout the country were warned to stay at home
 during the June 4 anniversary of the 1989 Tianamen Square crackdown. Liu
 Lianjun reportedly was detained for 7 days around the time of the anniversary.
 Prominent dissidents such as Jiang Qisheng, Ding Zilin, Chu Hailan (the wife of
 jailed labor activist Liu Nianchun), and Ren Wanding were detained for brief peri-
 ods or had their activities curtailed on more than one occasion. In July more than
 20 dissidents who had tried to register an opposition party in Zhejiang were de-
 tained. Wang Youcai, who was later arrested in November, was detained for more
 than 50 days, but others were held for brief periods. Following a similar pattern,
 numerous dissidents were detained and then released at the time of UNHCHR Rob-
 inson's September visit. Authorities continued the practice of inviting dissidents to
 take "vacations" at sensitive times during the year. Jiang Qisheng and Wei Xiaotao,
 the brother of Wei Jingsheng, were forced to spend several days each in Public Secu-
 rity Bureau guest houses in the Beijing suburbs during UNHCHR Robinson's visit,
 Under the revised Criminal Procedure Law, detained criminal suspects, defend-
 ants, their legal representatives, and close relatives are entitled to apply for a guar-
 
 
 antor to enable the suspect or defendant to await trial out of custody. In practice,
 the police, who have sole discretion, usually do not agree. The law also stipulates
 that authorities must notify a detainee's family or work unit of his detention within
 24 hours. In practice, however, timely notification remains a serious problem espe-
 cialy in sensitive political cases. Authorities did not respond to the attempts of the
 wife of dissident Xu Wenli to determine where Xu was held after his detention or
 what the charges were against him. Under a sweeping exception, officials need not
 provide notification if it would "hinder the investigation" of a case. During his 5
 months of detention, Chen Zengxiang's family was never notified formally of his de-
 tention. In July Wang Youcai, Lin Hui, Wang Donghai, and several other Zhejiang
 dissidents were detained for various lengths of time without notification of their
 families.
 In theory, the Administrative Litigation Law of 1989 permits a detainee to chal-
 lenge the legality of administrative detention, but lack of timely access to legal
 counsel inhibited the effective use of this law. Persons serving sentences in the
 criminal justice system can request release under Article 75 of the Criminal Proce-
 dure Law or appeal to the Procuratorate, but have no recourse to the courts to chal-
 lenge the legaty or length of criminal detention. In June the official Xinhua News
 Agency reported that Beijing prosecutors had found that 143 criminal suspects in
 the city had been detained illegally for more than 1 year. The procuratorate report-
 edly ordered 141 of these persons released. There are documented cases in which
 local officials and business leaders illegally conspired to use detention as a means
 of exerting pressure in commercial disputes involving Chinese and foreign business-
 men. There were also cases in which foreign businessmen had their passports con-
 fiscated during such disputes.
 TheStae Compensation Law provides a legal basis for citizens to recover dam-
 ages for illegal detentions. Although many citizens remain unaware of this 1995
 law, there is evidence that it is having growing, if still limited, impact. The
 Guangzhou City Intermediate Court awarded $1,150 (9,520.4 rmb) in compensation
 to Ruan Wenjian, who had been held illegally for a year by police for suspicion in
 a fraud case. The case was reported widely in the Guangzhou media. The press re-
 ported in 1997 a case in Yongshan township, Jiangxi province, in whiih a 15-year-
 old girl and her mother took local authorities to co  or forcing the girl to undergo
 a pregnancy test. Citing the girl's "psychological and economic losses,' the court or-
 dered the local government to make a formal apology to the girl and pay her $323
 (2,674 rmb) in compensation. Not satisfied with the judgment, the girls family said
 that it would ifie an appeal to seek higher compensation. During the year, the offi-
 cial press ran numerous articles to raise public awareness of recent laws meant to
 enhance the protection of citizens' rights, including the Criminal Law, Criminal Pro-
 cedure Law, State Compensation Law, Administrative Procedure Law, and Lawyers
 Law.
 A major flaw of the new Criminal Procedure Law is that it does not address the
 reeducation-through-labor system, which permits authorities to sentence detainees
 administratively without trial to terms of 1 to 3 years in labor camps. Local Labor
 Reeducation Committees, which determine the term of detention, may  xtnd an in-
 mate's sentence for an additional year. There have been cases of individuials success-
 fully appealing their reeducation sentences through the courts, though the exact
 number of successful cases is unknown. Shanghai activist Wang Tingjin was sen-
 tenced to 2 years of reeducation, apparentiy for meeting with foreign-based dissident
 Wan    inhng during the latter's trip to China in February. In Aprl Anhui dis-
 sident Shea Liangqing and Shanghai activist Yang Qinheng were sentenced to 2
 years and 3 years of reeducation Law,  s tive for conducting a serie of protests
 and activities, including making public statements that NPC Chairman Li Peng had
 "blood on his hands for his part in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. On De-
 cember 29, exiled dissidents who had returned illegally to China and eroyaged in po-
 litical activities were sentenced to 3 years reeducation through labor on charges that
 they had visited prostitutes. According to credible reports, these charges were fal-
 sifted by the authorities. Chen Longde, Liu Xiaobo, and other dissidents remained
 in labor camps.
 The Government also continued to refuse reentry into China by citizens who were
 dissidents and activists (see Section 2.d.). The Governmens denial of permission to
 some former reeducation-through-labor camp inmates to return to theie homes con-
 stitutes a form ofinteral exile (see Section 2.d.).
 There were no reports that the Government forcibly exiled citizens; however,
 Wang Dan and Liu Nianchun were released from prison on medical parole oniy on
 the condition that they leave the country for medical treatment (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution states that the courts shall, in
 accordance with the law, exercise judicial power independently; however, in practice,
 
 
 844
 the judiciary is subject to policy guidance from both the Government and the Com-
 munist Party, whose leaders use a variety of means to direct courts on verdicts and
 sentences in politically sensitive cases. Corruption and conflicts of interest also af-
 fect judicial decisionmahing. Judges are appointed by the people's congresses at the
 corresponding level of the judicial structure, which can result in undue influence by
 local politicians over the judges they appoint. During a Mvay conference at Beijing
 University, according to informed sources, it was estimated that more than 70 per-
 cent of commercial cases in lower court were decided according to the wishes of
 local officials'rather than the law. State-run media ran numerous articles calling for
 an end to such "local protectionism" and the development of a judiciary independent
 of interference by officials.
 The Supreme People's Court (SPC) stands at the apex of the court system, fol-
 lowed in descending 'order by the higher, intermediate, and basic people's courts.
 There are special courts for handling military, maritime, and rway transport
 cases.
 During the year, the Government initiated a highby publicized campaign t fix
 systemic weaknesses i the judicial system and make it more accountable to public
 scrutiny. The law requires that all trials be held in public, but in practice, many
 trials are not. In June the Beijing Number 1 Intermediate Court became the first
 Chinese court to open its trials to the public on an experimental basis, except for
 those involving state secrets, personal privacy, or minors, as prescribed by law. The
 exception for cases involving state secrets has been used to keep proceedings dosed
 to the public and even family members in some sensitive cases.
 In June the President of the Supreme People's Court, Xiao Yang, called for courts
 to come under the "supervision" of citizens and the media, and on July 11 state-
 ru television carried the first live broadcast of a trial, a case involving intellectual
 property. National newspapers gave both events extensive coverage, and numerous
 editorials highlighted the merits of public trials, including their value as a tool to
 prevent "lopsided adjudication, lax enforcement of necessary judicial procedures, and
 prejudicial judg..ments against the accused." The Government announced in Novem-
 ber th at all Beijing courts, not just the Number 1 Intermediate Court, would hience-
 forth be open to the public. However, cases involving state secrets, privacy, and mi-
 nors are excepted. None of the trials of high-profile political activists that took place
 at the end of the year was open, although family members usually were allowed to
 attend.
 The official Xinhua News Agency reported that between March and August, in re-
 sponse to criticism by NPC delegates, the Government conducted an "unprecedented
 internal shake-up" of the judiciary in which neariy 5,000 judges and prosecutors
 were disciplined. Courts reportedly corrected 8,110 misjudged cases, and prosecutors
 reconsidered 1,125 mishandled criminal offenses. In addion, both the SPC and the
 Supreme People's Procurtrate (SPP) set up hot lines for the public to report illegal
 activities by judges and prosecutors. By August there had been 12,000 reports to
 the SPC hotline, leading to the investigation of nearly 5,000 judges, 4,701 of whom
 were determined to have behaved improperly, with 131 cases resulting in criminal
 prosecution. In addition, 1,337 prosecutors were placed under investigation, 756
 were disciplined, and 73 were prosecuted based upon complaints received on the
 SPP hotline. The President of the SPC and the Procurator General both acknowl-
 edged that deep-rooted problems remained and that some courts and prosecutor's
 offices had not taken the campaign seriously. The media reported in July that Pan
 Yile, Vice President of the Higher People's Court of Guangxi, was sentenced to 15
 years in prison for accepting bribes.
 Police and prosecutorial officials often have ignored the due process provisions of
 the law and of the Constitution. For example, police and prosecutors can subject
 prisoners to severe  psoogic         to confess, and coerced confessions fre-
 quently are introduced as evidence. In May the top prosecutor, Han Zhubin, said
 in an interview that use of illegal methods by prosecutors had become "nery serious"
 in some areas. He acknowledged that some prosecutors employed torture to extract
 confessions and used interrogation rooms like "prison cells" to hold suspects beyond
 the legal detention period. The Criminal Procedure Law forbids the use of torture
 to obtain confessions, but one weakness of the law is that it does not expressly bar
 the introduction of coerced confessions as evidence. Traditionally, defendants who
 failed to show the correct attitude by confessing their crimes were sentenced more
 harshiy. The conviction rate in criminal cases is over 90 percent, and trials can be
 little more than sentencing hearings. A 13-year sentence was handed down in the
 case of prominent dissident Xu Wenli 20 minutes after a 3-hour trial. There is an
 appeals process, but appeals rarely reverse verdicts.
 The revised Criminal Procedure Law was designed to address many of these deft-
 ciencies and give defense lawyers a greater ability to argue their clients' cases. The
 
 
 845
 new amendments abolish a form of pretrial detention called "shelter and investiga-
 tion," expand the right to counsel, put limits on nonjudicial determinations of guilt,
 and establish a more transparent, adversarial trial process. However, the amend-
 ments do not bring China into full compliance with international standards. For ex-
 ample, in "state secrets" cases, the revised Criminal Procedures Law authorizes offi-
 cials to deny suspects access to a lawyer while their cases are being investigated.
 The definition of state secrets is broad and vague and subject to independent inter-
 pretation by police, prosecutors, and judges, at different stages in a criminal case.
 Uncertainty regarding the scope and application of this statute has created concern
 about a detainee's right to legal assistance.
 Nevertheless, there are signs that the public is beginning to use the court system
 and the new legal remedies available to it to protect their rights and to seek redress
 for a variety of government abuses. The SPC reported in March that citizens had
 filed 90,000 lawsuits against government officials in 1997. A court in Hebei province
 returned to its owner over $62,000 (513,267 rmb) that had been confiscated illegally
 by authorities. Nonetheless, in politically sensitive cases a decision in favor of the
 dissident remains rare. In September a Wuhan court threw out a case brought by
 Li Weiping who charged that local public security officials had confiscated illegally
 his passport after his release from prison.
 China s first Lawyers' Law, designed to professionalize the legal profession, took
 effect in 1996. Subsequently, the Ministry of Justice drafted relevant regulations to
 standardize professional performance, lawyer-client relations, and the administra-
 tion of lawyers and law firms. It also granted lawyers formal permission to establish
 law firms, set educational requirements for legal practitioners, encouraged free legal
 services for the general public, and provided for the discipining of lawyers. Govern-
 ment officials state that there is an insufficient number of lawyers to meet the coun-
 try's growing needs. A key element in Justice Ministry efforts to encourage legal re-
 orm is a plan to have 150,000 lawyers, 30,000 notaries, and 40,000 grassroots legal
 service centers by the year 2000. According to December 1997 figures, China has
 114,000 lawyers, 18,000 notarial personnel, and more than 8,300 law offices. Law-
 yers are organizing private law firms that are self-regulating and do not have their
 personnel or budgets determined directly by the State. More than 60 legal aid orga-
 nizations have been established around the country.
 Defendants have frequently found it difficult to find an attorney willing to handle
 sensitive political cases. Government-employed lawyers still depend on an official
 work unit for employment, housing, and other benefits, and therefore many may be
 reluctant to be seen as overzealous in representing politically sensitive defendants.
 Nonetheless, a loosely organized group of dissidents was able to hire attorneys to
 represent three Zhejiang activists who had been detained in July for trying to reg-
 ister an opposition political party. A Beijing lawyer who had represented Wei
 Jingsheng in the past agreed to defend the political theorist Fang Jue, who was ar-
 rested and charged with "economic crimes." In December authorities blocked the at-
 tempts by prominent dissidents Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin to hire lawyers of
 their own choosing. There were no new reports of the Government revoking the li-
 censes of lawyers representing political defendants, as it sometimes has done in the
 past.
 However, lawyers who try to defend their clients aggressively often run into ob-
 structions erected by police and prosecutors. In August the Secretary General of the
 All China Lawyer's Association said that in the past 3 years the group had received
 59 complaints from lawyers who had been threatened or harassed by law enforce-
 ment officials. He predicted that it would take 3 to 5 years for the new Criminal
 Procedure Law to take root in the legal system. He called for better protection of
 lawyers and their legitimate role in the adversarial process.
 The lack of due process is particularly egregious in death penalty cases. The num-
 ber of capital offenses has increased from 26 to 65 as amendments were added to
 the 1979 Criminal Law. They include financial crimes such as counterfeiting cur-
 rency. In May 1997, Zhao Binyi was executed in Tianjin after being convicted of
 seven counts of fraud involving approximately $6,000 (49,671 rmb). A higher court
 nominally reviews all death sentences, but the time between arrest and execution
 is often days and sometimes less, and reviews consistently have resulted in the con-
 firmation of sentences. Minors and pregnant women are expressly exempt from the
 death sentence, and only those theft cases involving banks or museums warrant
 capital punishment Based on a review of Chinese press accounts, Amnesty Inter-
 national (AI) reported that in 1997 China sentenced more than 3,152 convicts to
 death (compared with 6,100 in 1996 in the midst of the anticrime "Strike Hard"
 campaign) and carried out 1,876 executions (compared to 4,367 in 1996). AI believes
 that actual figures may be higher because not all death penalties or executions are
 reported, and such information can be manipulated by the authorities. Officials say
 
 
 that new safeguards placed on sentencing and execution have reduced the number
 of death penalty cases.
 In recent years, credible reports have alleged that organs from -some executed
 prisoners were removed, :sold, and transplanted. Officials have confirmed that exe-
 cuted prisoners are among the sources of organs for transplant but maintain that
 consent is required from prisoners or their relatives before organs are removed.
 There is no national law governing organ donations, but a Ministry of Health direc-
 tive explicitly states that buying and selling human organs and tissues is not al-
 lowed. In February two Chinese nationals were charged in a foreign court for trying
 to sell human organs allegedly taken from the bodies of executed prisoners. At least
 one Western country has asked for information on Chinese Government investiga-
 tions of alleged organ trafficking, but to date no information has been released.
 There were credible reports that patients from Taiwan had undergone organ trans-
 plant operations on the mainlan , using organs removed from executed criminals.
 Defendants legally are entitled to challenge reeducation-through-labor sentences
 under the Administrative Litigation Law. Persons can gain a reduction in, or sus-
 pension of, their sentences after appeal, but appeals are usually not successful be-
 cause of problems such as short appeal times and inadequate legal counsel that
 weaken the effectiveness of the law in preventing or reversing arbitrary decisions.
 In September the Shanghai Intermediate People s Court held a special session to
 hear dissident Yang Qinheng's appeal of his 3-year sentence. The hearing was ad-
 journed without a decision.
 Government officials deny that China holds any political prisoners, asserting that
 authorities detain persons not for their political or religious views, but because they
 violate the law. However, the authorities continued to confine citizens for political
 and religious reasons. It is estimated that thousands of political prisoners remain
 imprisoned. According to international press reports, some 230,000 persons are in
 reeducation-through-labor camps, sentenced to up to 3 years through administrative
 procedures, not a trial (see Section-I.d.).
 The 1997 Criminal Law replaced "counterrevolutionary" offenses, which often, in
 the past, had been used against the Government's political opponents, with loosely
 defined provisions barring "crimes endangering state security." In September offi-
 cials said that there were 1,946 individuals in prisons serving sentences under the
 Counterrevolutionary Law. Persons detained for such offenses included Hu Shigen,
 Kang Yuchun, Liu Wensheng, Yu Zhijian, Zhang Jingsheng, and Sun Xiongying.
 Several foreign governments urged-China to review the cases of those char ged with
 counterrevolution, given that the crime was no longer on the books, and release
 those who had been jailed for nonviolent offenses under the old statute. Officials
 have indicated that a case-by-case review of appeals filed by individual prisoners is
 'possible under the law, and there is one known case of a successful appeal. How-
 ever, the Government indicated that it would neither initiate a broad review of
 cases nor grant a general amnesty arguing that "crimes" covered by the law on
 counterrevolution still are considered crimes under the Law on State Security.
 Those charged with counterrevolutionary crimes continue to serve their sentences.
 The Government released early certain prisoners detained for their political or re-
 ligious beliefs, including Liu Nianchun, Wang Dan, Zhou Guoqiang, Pan Mingdong,
 and Zhang Xiaoxu. However, many others including Liu Xiaobo, Chen Lantao, Li
 Hai, Han Chunsheng, Xu Yongze, Fan Zhongliang, Xu Guoxing, Ngawang Choephel,
 Chadrel Rinpoche, Jigme Sangpo, and Ngawang Sandrol (see Tibet Addendum) re-
 mained imprisoned or under other forms of detention during the year.
 Criminal punishments can include "deprivation of political rights" for a fixed pe-
 riod after release from prison, during which the individual is denied rights of free
 speech and association. Former prisoners also can find their status in society, ability
 to find employment, freedom to travel, and access to residence permits and social
 services severely restricted. Economic reforms and social changes have ameliorated
 these problems for nonpolitical prisoners in recent years. However, former political
 prisoners and their families frequently are subjected to police surveillance, tele-
 phone taps, searches, and other forms of harassment, and may encounter difficulty
 in obtaining or keeping employment and housing.
 f.Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Govern-
 ment interference in daily personal and family life continues to decline for the aver-
 age citizen. In urban areas, most people still depend on government-linked work
 units for housing, permission to have a child, approval to apply for a passport, and
 other aspects of ordinary life. However, the work unit and the neighborhood commit-
 tee, which originally were charged with monitoring activities and attitudes, have be-
 come less important as means of social or political control. Political "study sessions,"
 meant to instill in all citizens a common, party-approved political line, no longer
 play a meaningful role in shaping attitudes and are held infrequently, if at all.
 
 
 Work units reportedly on occasion refused to cooperate with police requests to de-
 tain employees.
 Despite legal protections, authorities often do not respect the privacy of citizens
 in practice. Although the law requires warrants before law enforcement officials can
 search premises, this provision frequently has been ignored; moreover, the Public
 Security Bureau and the procuratorate can issue search warrants on their own au-
 thority. The Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of correspondence of citi-
 zens are protected by law." In practice authorities often monitor telephone conversa-
 tions, fax transmissions, electronic mail, and Internet communications of foreign
 visitors, businessmen, diplomats, and journalists, as well as Chinese dissidents, ac-
 tivists, and others. The security services routinely monitor and enter the residences
 and offices of foreigners, to gain access to computers, telephones, and fax machines.
 All major hotels have a sizable internal security presence. Authorities also open and
 censor domestic and international mail. Han Chunsheng, a Voice of America (VOA)
 listener who allegedly sent over 20 letters critical of China to a VOA mailbox, re-
 mains in prison on an 8-year sentence for counterrevolutionary incitement and prop-
 aganda. Government security organs monitor and sometimes restrict contact be-
 tween foreigners and citizens. Some dissidents are under heavy surveillance, and
 others routinely had their telephone calls with foreign journalists and diplomats
 monitored. On occasion, some were blocked from meeting with foreigners during po-
 litically sensitive periods. Dissidents routinely are warned not to speak with the for-
 eign press. In the period before his arrest, Xu Wenli and a Western journalist were
 detained and interrogated for several hours after trying to meet in a restaurant for
 an interview.
 Authorities also harassed and monitored the activities of relatives of dissidents.
 For example, security personnel keep close watch on relatives of prominent dis-
 sidents such as Chen Ziming, particularly during sensitive periods. Security person-
 nel followed He Xintong, the wife of Xu Weni and Wei Xiaotao, the brother of Wei
 Jingsheng, to meetings with Western reporters and diplomats on numerous occa-
 sions. Government harassment has prevented relatives of Chen Ziming, Liu
 Nianchun, Qin Yongmin and other dissidents from obtaining and keeping steady
 employment. In October authorities in Shandong province ordered activist Xie
 Wanjun to move out of his house and cut off electric power and the telephone line
 to his home. Xie's wife lost her teaching job. Also in October police in Beijing
 blocked a group of dissidents who tried to drive to Shandong in a demonstration of
 support for Xie. The Government froze a bank account kept by activist Ding Zilin
 to help the families of Tiananmen massacre victims. The action was criticized in a
 public letter issued by 98 Beijing-based activists. Police also detained the relatives
 of dissidents (see Sections 1.d. and 2.a.).
 The Government encouraged expansion of Internet and other communications in-
 frastructure. Internet use is expanding exponentially, creating a potentially power-
 ful channel of information to the computer literate. The Government reported that
 2.1 million people were connected to the Internet. Actual users are believed to num-
 ber as many as 6 million and industry experts projected that the country would
 have 10 million Internet users by the year 2000. High Internet service fees cur-
 rently limit access. The Government has created special Internet police units to in-
 crease control of Internet content and access. Authorities have blocked at various
 times politically "sensitive" web sites, including those of dissident groups and some
 major foreign news organizations, such as the VOA, the Washington Post, the New
 York Times, and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). However, a number
 of human rights web pages continue to be accessible, including that of the Tibet gov-
 ernment-in-exile.
 The Government's efforts to block content and control usage have had only limited
 success because sophisticated users can bypass site blocking, and, more important,
 because of the number of Internet sites that provide outside information and news.
 E-mail and e-mail publications are even more difficult to block, and there is no indi-
 cation that the Government has attempted to do so. However, the authorities target
 some e-mail users and read their e-mail. Dissident groups abroad use e-mail to send
 publications and disseminate information to readers in China, and activists within
 China now do this as well. An e-mail magazine called VIP Reference News, the con-
 tent of which originates from the mainland, publishes articles on many news stories
 not covered by the media. A May edition gave readers extensive coverage of a pro-
 test staged by jailed dissident Liu Nianchun's wife and mother in front of the NPC
 and their subsequent detention. At least one dissident has set up his own web site;
 a growing number of activists frequently communicate with each other via e-mail.
 When a dissident is harassed or detained, activists using e-mail, faxes, telephones,
 and pagers can quickly spread the word to colleagues around the country.

 There is no effective enforcement of State Council regulations issued in 1997 re-
 quiring those involved in international networking to apply for licenses and provide
 etails regarding the scope and nature of their activities. The State Council also
 promulgated a comprehensive list of prohibited Internet activities, including using
 the Internet to "incite the overthrow of the Government or the Socialist system" and
 "incite division of the country, harming national unification." The regulations, which
 came into effect on December 30, 1997, provide for fines and other unspecified pun-
 ishments to deal with violators. In March Shanghai businessman Lin Hal was ar-
 rested on charges of subversion, for providing an on-line dissident magazine with
 some 30,000 e-mail addresses in China. His trial on charges of trying to undermine
 state power was held in early December and subsequently he was sentenced to 2
 years' imprisonment.
 The authorities continue to jam VOA broadcasts, but the effectiveness of this in-
 terference varies considerably by region, with audible signals of the VOA and other
 short-wave broadcasters reaching most parts of the country (see Section 2.a.). Dis-
 sidents and average citizens in Beijing report few problems in picking up the VOA.
 Government jamming of Radio Free Asia (RFA) appears to be more effective (see
 Section 2.a.). In the absence of an independent press, overseas broadcasts such as
 VOA, BBC, and RFA have a large audience, including activists, ordinary citizens,
 and even government officials. In December Hunan dissident Zhang Shanguang was
 sentenced to 10 years in prison, in part because he granted an interview to RFA
 in which he revealed that 80 farmers had staged demonstrations to protest illegal
 taxes levied by local officials.
 The Government continued to implement comprehensive and often intrusive fam-
 ily planning policies. The State Family Planning Commission (SFPC) formulates
 and implements policies with assistance from the Family Planning Association,
 which has 83 million members in 1.02-million branches nationwide. Officials have
 predicted that the population will reach almost 1.6 billion in the year 2044 if cur-
 rent birth rates continue. Most Chinese demographers estimate fertility at 2.1 births
 per woman (although the official figure is 1.8)-indicating that the "one-child policy"
 is not applied uniformly to Chinese couples. According to official figures from a 1995
 survey, 25.7 percent of women of childbearing age have 3 or more children, 32.5 per-
 cent have 2, 36.1 percent have 1 child, and 5.7 percent are childless. Couples in
 urban areas are most affected by family planning guidelines, seldom receiving per-
 mission to have more than one child, although urban couples who themselves were
 only children may have two children. In general, economic development-as well as
 factors such as small houses and high education expenses-in major urban centers
 has reached a level where couples often voluntarily limit their families to one child.
 Outside the cities, exceptions to the "one-child policy" are becoming the norm. The
 average number of children per family in rural areas, where 70 percent of citizens
 still live, is slightly over two. Although rules can vary somewhat by province, in
 rural areas, couples generally are allowed to have a second child if the first is a
 girl, an exception that takes into account both the demands of farm labor and the
 traditional preference for boys. Families whose first child is handicapped are also
 allowed to have another child. Ethnic minorities, such as Muslim Uyghurs and Ti-
 betans, are subject to less stringent population controls. Minorities in some rural
 areas are permitted to have as many as four children. In remote areas, such as
 rural Tibet, there are no effective limits at all.
 Population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic incen-
 tives, as well as on more coercive measures, including psychological pressure and
 economic penalties. According to local regulations in at least one province, women
 who do not qualify for a Family Planning Certificate that allows them to have a
 child must use an intrauterine loop or implant. The regulations further require that
 women who use an intrauterine device undergo quarterly exams to ensure that it
 remains properly in place. If a couple has two children, those regulations require
 that either the man or woman undergo sterilization. Rewards for couples who ad-
 here to family planning policies include monthly stipends and preferential medical
 and educational benefits. Disciplinary measures against those who violate policies
 can include fines (sometimes called a "fee for unplanned birth" or a "social com-
 pensation fee"), withholding of social services, demotion, and other administrative
 punishments that sometimes result in loss of employment. Fines for giving birth
 without authorization vary, but they can be a formidable disincentive. According to
 the SFPC 1996 Family Planning Manual, over 24 million fines were assessed be-
 tween 1985 and 1993 for children born outside family planning rules. In Shanghai
 the fine for violating birth quotas is three times the combined annual salary of the
 parents. In Zhejiang province, violators are assessed a fine of 20 percent of the par-
 ents' salary paid over 5 years. According to new Guizhou provincial family planning
 regulations published in July, families who exceed birth quotas are to be fined two
 
 
 849
 to five times the per capita annual income of residents of their local area. The regu-
 lations also stipulate that government employees in Guizhou who have too many
 children face the loss of their jobs. In many provinces, penalties for excess births
 in an area also can be levied against local officials and the mother's work unit, thus
 creating multiple sources of pressure. In Guizhou, for example, regulations state
 that officials in an area in which birth targets are not met cannot be promoted in
 that year. Unpaid fines sometimes have resulted in confiscation or destruction of
 homes and personal property by local authorities.
 Government policy prohibits the use of force to compel persons to submit to abor-
 tion or sterilization. However, intense pressure to meet family planning targets set
 by the Government has resulted in documented instances where family planning of-
 ficials have used coercion, including forced abortion and sterilization, to meet &ov-
 emnent goals. During an unauthorized pregnancy, a woman often is paid multiple
 visits by family planning workers and pressured to terminate the pregnancy. In
 June a former Fujian province local family planning official stated that local au-
 thorities in a Fujian town systematically used coercive measures such as forced
 abortion and sterilization, detention, and the destruction of property to enforce birth
 quotas. After the Fujian allegations were made public, the SFPC sent a team led
 by a senior official to investigate the charges. In a meeting with foreign diplomats,
 the senior official did not deny that abuses may have occurred, but insisted that co-
 ercion was not the norm, or government policy, nor sanctioned by central authorities
 in Beijing. For the first time, the Government provided information on cases of local
 officials who had been punished for carrying out coercive family planning measures.
 SFPC Vice Minister Li Honggui said in June that local officials have been punished
 for using coercion and that the Government "made it a principle to ban coercion at
 any level." In October a senior famly planning official agai acknowledged that
 problems persist and reaffirmed the central Government's determination to address
 such problems. The official said that the SFPC had issued circulars nationwide pro-
 hibiting family planning officials from coercing women to undergo abortions or steri-
 lization against their will. Under the State Compensation Law, citizens also can sue
 officials who exceed their authority in implementing family planning policy, and
 there are instances in which individuals have exercised this right.
 In late 1998, China and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) launched
 a 4-year pilot project in 32 counties to address population growth solely through the
 use of voluntary measures on an experimental basis, emphasizing education and
 economic development. In preparation for the launch of the program, the Govern-
 ment held training conferences during the year, which were attended by family
 planning officials from each of the 32 counties and 22 provinces participating in the
 program. UNFPA officials and foreign diplomats went as observers to the meetings,
 at which SFPC leaders underscored to local and provincial authorities that only vol-
 untary measures would be permitted in project counties. The SFPC and the UNFPA
 worked together to prepare Chinese-language training materials for the program. It
 is still too early for an assessment of this pilot project.
 Regulations forbid the termination of pregnancies based on the sex of the fetus,
 but because of the traditional preference for male children, particularly in rural
 areas, some families have used ultrasound to identify female fetuses and terminate
 pregnancies. Use of ultrasound for this purpose is specifically prohibited by the Ma-
 ternal and Child Health Care Law, which came into effect in 1995 and calls for pun-
 ishment of medical practitioners who violate the provision. According to the SFPC,
 a handful of doctors have been charged under this law. In 1997 the press reported
 that the national ratio of male to female births was 114 to 100; the World Health
 Organization estimated the ratio to be 117 to 100. The statistical norm is 106 male
 births to 100 female. These skewed statistics reflect the underreporting of female
 births so that the parents can keep trying to conceive a boy, and the abuse of
 sonograms and the termination of pregnancies based on the sex of the fetus. Female
 infanticide, abandonment, or neglect of baby girls are also factors. During the year,
 state-run media paid increasing attention to unbalanced birth ratios, and the soci-
 etal problems, such as trafficking in women, which it is causing (see Section 5). In
 the cities the traditional preference for sons is changing.
 There reportedly have been instances in which pregnant prisoners in reeducation-
 through-labor camps were forced to submit to abortions (see Section 1.c.).
 The Maternal and Child Health Care Law requires premarital and prenatal ex-
 aminations to determine whether couples have acute infectious diseases or certain
 mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or are at risk for passing on de-
 bilitating genetic diseases. The Ministry of Health implements the law, which man-
 dates abortion or sterilization in some cases, based on medical advice. The law also
 provides for obtaining a second opinion and states that patients or their guardians
 must give written consent to such procedures (see Section 5). At least five provincial
 
 
 governments have implemented local regulations seeking to prevent persons with
 severe mental disabilities from having children. In August the Government issued
 an "explanation" to provincial governments clarifying that no sterilization of persons
 with genetic conditions could be performed without their signed consent.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution states that freedom
 of speech and of the press are fundamental rights to be enjoyed by all citizens, the
 Government interprets the Communist Party's "leading role," as mandated in the
 preamble to the Constitution, as circumscribing these rights. The Government does
 not permit citizens to publish or broadcast criticisms of senior leaders or opinions
 that directly challenge Communist Party rule. The party and Government continue
 to control many print and broadcast media tightly and use them to propagate the
 current ideological line. There are more than 10,000 openly distributed publications,
 including 2,500 newspapers. All media employees are under explicit, public orders
 to follow CCP directives, and "guide public opinion" as directed by political authori-
 ties. Both formal and informal guidelines continue to require reporters to avoid cov-
 erage of many politically sensitive topics. Journalists also must not divulge "state
 secrets" in accordance with the State Security Law (see Section I.e.). These public
 orders, guidelines, and statutes greatly restrict the freedom of broadcast journalists
 and newspapers to report the news and lead to a high degree of self-censorship.
 Until the fall, there was progress in greater openness of the press and electronic
 media. In an unprecedented move during President Clinton's June state visit, the
 Government allowed live television and radio broadcasts of both the joint press con-
 ference held by Presidents Clinton and Jiang and of President Clinton's speech at
 Beijing University. The two events allowed citizens to witness on television for the
 first time uncensored comments, exchange, and debate on previously taboo issues
 such as human rights abuses, the Tiananmen massacre, and Tibet. However, some
 of the more sensitive subjects addressed in these two events were not reported in
 later television broadcasts and print news accounts. In the following months, a num-
 ber of books were published that contained the full transcripts of the-press con-
 ference, the Beijing University speech, and other remarks made during the state
 visit.
 The press also continued to expand the range of issues it covers, particularly
 those relating to official corruption, citizens' rights, and legal reform, often with the
 tacit consent or even open support of the Government. A July opinion piece in the
 state-run China Daily commented, "Right now many officials still resent negative
 (press) coverage, regarding it as a betrayal, taking for granted that the press, under
 their charge, should be on their side. But the press must not become the private
 property of some officials used to promote their personal careers over the public in-
 terest."
 Southern Weekend, one of the most progressive newspapers, achieved a reputa-
 tion and won wide readership through a combination of muckraking investigative
 reports and proreform opinion pieces. A July article entitled "The Right To Inves-
 tigate and the Right To Speak" concluded that the Government should "lift restric-
 tions on the right to speak," and ensure "citizens' legitimate right to investigate."
 Stories of official corruption, misconduct and gross abuses, particularly by law en-
 forcement authorities, continued to proliferate in the media. Widely popular inves-
 tigative television news programs such as "Focus" and "Oriental Horizon" aggres-
 sively pursued official malfeasance. In November "Oriental Horizon" broadcast a
 story on an off-duty policeman in Hubei who had shot and killed a street vendor.
 The Yangcheng Evening News published a report in March along with photographs,
 which showed a mentally ill man who had been kept in a cage without trial for over
 5 years by local police. The man was released into psychiatric observation after the
 article was published. The state-run press ran numerous articles and interviews
 with senior officials that called for reform of the judicial system and an end to cor-
 ruption in the courts.
 Although increased debate among intellectuals within the system was tolerated,
 similar attempts by political dissidents to organize vehicles for the open discussion
 of ideas were consistently rejected or suppressed. In March Liu Kangxiu was ar-
 rested on charges of trying to subvert the Government for writing an unpublished
 manuscript on political reform called "Our Point of View." Wuhan activist Qin
 Yongmin, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison on state security crimes in De-
 cember, applied unsuccessfully to publish a human rights magazine called Citizen's
 Forum in March. The Ministry of Culture ignored an application by dissidents Mao
 Guoliang and Wang Donghai to establish a newspaper called China Human Rights
 News. The China Development Union, an independent forum that had been holding
 
 
 851
 weekly discussions open to the public on a broad range of political issues, was shut
 down in October.
 By late fall the authorities took steps to strengthen controls over both print and
 media journalism as the political atmosphere became increasingly tight. The Propa-
 ganda Department of the CCP shut down a Beijing-based monthly and closed sev-
 eral newspapers, including the South Culture Review, for exceeding what authori-
 ties deemed permissible. South Culture Review had published an article analyzing
 the upcoming 1999 anniversaries in China, including the Tiananmen Anniversary.
 Stern warnings were sent to other magazines and newspapers about the permissible
 content of articles and editorials. Some writers or editors were fired, including two
 editors of the economic journal, Guangdong-Hong Kong Information Daily. At year's
 end, the closings and firings had begun to take effect as journalists exercised great-
 er caution. It was not clear whether the newspapers that have been closed down
 will be allowed to reopen. In the past, authorities have allowed newspapers to re-
 open after their editors had spent time at the Central Propaganda Department to
 "correct their thinking."
 The political atmosphere also affected publishing, but books remain one of the
 most daring media forms because of the economic aspects of publishing. There are
 three kinds of book businesses: The roughly 500 government-sanctioned publishing
 houses; smaller independent publishers that cooperate with official publishing
 houses to put out more daring publications; and the underground press. The 500
 government-approved publishing houses are the only organizations legally permitted
 to print books. Control is exerted by issuing a limited number of publishing licenses,
 which are required for each edition of a book. A party member at each publishing
 house monitors the content of the house's publications, using the allocation of pro-
 motions, cars, travel and other perquisites to encourage editors to exercise "proper"
 judgement about publications. Overt intervention by the State Publications Admin-
 istration and Party Propaganda Bureau is strictly postpublication. Independent pub-
 lishers take advantage of a loophole in the law to sign contracts with government
 publishing houses to publish politically sensitive works. These works generally are
 not subjected to the same multilayered review process as official publications of the
 publishing houses. Underground printing houses publish the "hottest" books. The
 main target of the campaign initiated at the end of the year to stp illegal publica-
 tions, which has restricted the availability of politically sensitive books, is these un-
 derground printing houses. Street vendors who usually sell sensitive works appar-
 entiy have a tacit understanding with the authorities that they will look the other
 way when the vendors sell other illegal publications if the vendors stop selling po-
 litically sensitive books. Many illegal works are printed by police or military-affili-
 ated organizations, which often are not a target of investigations
 On December 23, a new interpretation of the Publications Law by the Supreme
 People's Court took effect. The majority of provisions in the new regulations concern
 intllectual property rights violations and the publication of pornographic material.
 However, one provision specifically criminalizes under the State Security Law the
 "publication, distribution, or bradcast of material containing content intended to
 "incite national division, damage national unity, incite subversion of national au-
 thority, or incite the overthrow of the socialist system."
 During the year, liberals and intellectuals in favor of political reform tested the
 limits of public discourse. For much of the year, scholars and commentators pub-
 lished essays that called for political liberalization, government accountability, and
 gradual democratization, with no adverse consequences. Prominent reformers orga-
 ned seminars on controversial subjects and, in some cases, became sought after
 speakers on a reviving campus lecture circuit. One such event brought together 50
 scholars to discuss the Austrian Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek, a staunch oppo-
 nent of socialism whose works had been banned in China for decades. Other lectures
 criticized the legacy of Mao Zedong and argued that China must relax political con-
 trols in order to continue economic development.
 In June a former senior leader reportedly sent a letter to top leaders urging a re-
 assessment of Tiananmen, which he termed "one of the biggest human rights prob-
 lems of this century." Bao Tong, an aide to the former leader, who had his political
 rights restored in May, immediately began granting interviews to the international
 press, criticizing both the Government and Deng Xiaoping. Bao reportedly was
 warned by authorities not to give any more interviews without prior permission.
 However, in October Bao spoke out again, granting an interview to a Hong Kong
 newspaper in which he called for the restoration of the former senior leader's politi-
 cal rights. A November report stated that the Government refused to issue Bao a
 passport to visit his son abroad.
 By fall, however, officials began to take steps to rein in this activity. "Political
 China" a collection of previously published essays on political reform, was ordered
 
 
 taken off shelves and a second printing was canceled, apparently because it had
 strongly advocated reform. At year's end, Shi Binhai, coeditor of the book, remained
 in custody. Political theorist Fang Jue, who had circulated a groundbreaking essay
 on reform in late 1997 without suffering retribution at the time, was detained in
 mid-1998 and subsequently charged with "economic crimes." During the year, Fang
 had made increasingly bold statements critical of the Government.
 Political dissidents also tested the limits of official tolerance. Until the fall, dis-
 sidents who limited their activities to voicing criticism publicly of the Government
 or expressing views contrary to government policy generally were dealt with less
 harshly than in the past. The Government relied on warnings, harassment, and
 temporary detention to control their activities, although arrest was used in some in-
 stances (see Section I.d.). An unprecedented number of activists openly challenged
 the Government during the March plenary session of Parliament and the June 4
 anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre. They called for, among other things, over-
 turning the Government's official verdict that the Tiananmen protests had been a
 "counterrevolutionary disturbance;" the rehabilitation of deposed Communist Party
 chief Zhao Ziyang; and an end to one-party rule. Activists also petitioned the Na-
 tiona People's Congress to reject Premier Li Peng-whom some called a "murderer"
 for his involvement in the Tiananmen massacre--as its new chairman.
 However by midfal, the Government had moved beyond the harassment and
 temporary detentions used to restrain political activists earlier in the year. A crack-
 down on political dissent was instituted beginning in November, and scores of politi-
 cal activists were detained while the most prominent were tried and sentenced
 harshly .(see Section 1.d.). There were instances where authorities also harassed and
 monitored the activities of the relatives of dissidents (see Section 1.f.).
 The Government kept tight control over the foreign press during the year and con-
 tinued efforts to prevent its "interference" in internal affairs. The authorities contin-
 ued to jain Chinese- and Tibetan-language broadcasts of Voice of America and Radio
 Free Asia (RFA) with varying degrees of success. The Government barred from
 entry into China three RFA journalists who were part of the White House press pool
 traveling with President Clinton for the June summit. In separate incidents in Sep-
 tember and October, a Western freelance producer and a Japanese journalist were
 detained briefly and then deported. In November the Beijing bureau chief for the
 German magazine Der Spiegel was expelled and barred for 5 years from returning
 to China for allegedly possessing classified government documents, charges he has
 denied.
 Despite such government controls, information about the nation and the world
 continued to flow into the country at an increasing rate. Residents in Guangdong
 and other parts of southern China have wide access to Hong Kong television pro-
 grams and newspapers. Throughout the country, a lively tabloid sector is flourish-
 ing. Radio talk shows remain popular, and, while avoiding the most politically sen-
 sitive subjects, they provide opportunities for citizens to air grievances about public
 issues. Despite licensing requirements and other restrictions, a small but rapidly
 growing segment of the population has access to satellite television broadcasts and
 the Internet. Most of the population has the means to own and use short-wave ra-
 dios, and the Government does not place any restrictions on their use.
 The Government continues to impose ideological controls on political discourse at
 colleges, universities, and research institutes. Academic discussions often are unre-
 stricted, but scholars and researchers report varying degrees of control regarding
 the issues that they may examine and the conclusions that they may draw. Censor-
 ship of written material comes at the time of publication, or when intellectuals and
 scholars, anticipating t.hat books or papers on political topics would be deemed too
 sensitive to be published, exercise self-censorship. In areas such as economic policy
 or legal reform, there was far greater official tolerance for comment and debate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, however, the Government severely restricts this right
 in practice. The Constitution stipulates that such activities may not challenge "party
 leadership" or infringe upon the "interests of the State." Protests against the politi-
 cal system or national leaders are prohibited. Authorities deny permnits and quickly
 move to suppress demonstrations involving expression of dissenting political views.
 In February Tu Guangwen, a pedicab driver in Wuhan, reportedly was sentenced
 to 3 years in prison for organizing a street protest In May the mother and wife of
 jailed labor activist Liu Nianchun staged a sitdown protest outside the National
 People's Congress to demand medical treatment for Liu. The two were detained at
 a nearby police station for several hours before being sent home. In September Liu's
 wife was removed forcibly by police from a Beijing hotel wher e  had gone to try
 to meet visit  nt in h    inson to discuss her husband's case. There were re-
 ports in September that several hundred police officers in Changsha, the capital city
 
 
 853
 of Hunan, beat 20 villagers and temporarily detained 6 others while breaking up
 a protest of several hundred persons in front of the provincial government building.
 Despite restrictions, the number of demonstrations nationwide continued to grow.
 According to one report, there were 3,380 instances of assembly, demonstration
 marches, and petitions in the first 5 months of the year. Many demonstrations were
 handled with restraint by authorities. Demonstrators frequently gathered at the
 front gate of the State Family Planning Commission to protest family planning poli-
 cies and were left alone by police as long as they remained peacef. In April some
 50 persons gathered in front of the Beijing city hall to object to the demolition of
 their homes to make way for a new subway line. After several hours, the demonstra-
 tors were persuaded to go home in a bus provided by authorities. In May 500 taxi
 drivers gathered outside municipal government offices in Xian to protest govern-
 ment-mandated fares. They reportedly blocked three main intersections for some 6
 hours before city leaders proised to listen to their grievances. The demonstrators
 then dispersed without incident. In September hundrds of~ students and women
 demonstrated in front of the Indonesian Embassy to protest reported violence
 against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. There were more reports of labor-related uin-
 rest than in the previous year (see Section 6).
 The Constitution provi   or  eedom of association; however, the Government re-
 stricts this right in practice. Communist Party policy and government regulations
 require that all professional, social, and economic organizations officially register
 with, and be approved by, the Government. Ostensibly aimed at restricting secret
 societies and criminal gangs, these regulations also p revent the formation of politi-
 cal, human rights, religious, labor, and youth organzations that directly challenge
 government authority.
 There are no laws or regulations that specifically govern the formation of political
 paries. In June a group of dissidents in Zhejiang province led by Wang Youca went
 to the local Civil Affairs Ministry office to register China's first oppositionpJolitical
 party. Their application was rejected, and a number of the activists were etained
 for various periods of time.
 In the months thereafter, there were similar attempts in provinces around the
 country to register local branches of the China Democracy Party. In some places,
 activists were harassed or temporarily detained, while in others local officials met
 with dissidents and explained the requirements for registering social organizations.
 However, the Government made clear that none of the applications would be ap-
 proved (see Section 3).
 In 1998 there were 1,500 national-level, quasi-NGO's and 200,000 similar lower
 level organizations registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Although these or-
 ganizations all came under some degree of government control, they were able to
 develop their own agendas. Many had support from foreign secular and religious
 NGO's. Some sought advocacy roles in public interest areas such as women's issues,
 the environment, and consumer rights. In November the Government promulgated
 a revised and more complete set of regulations on the registration of nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's). The revised regulations require that all NGO's must
 reregister under the revised regulations, a process which may be used to further re-
 strict the numbers and types of NGO's. To register, local-level groups must have an
 offitcal office and at least $3,600 (30,000 yuan) in f  fds. National-level groups must
 have at least 100,000 yuan. Applications must be vetted by the Government, which
 has 2 months in which to grant approval. Once established, groups are required to
 submit to regular oversight and "obey the constitution, laws, and national policies;"
 they must not violate the four cardinal principles, damage national unity, or upset
 ethnic harmony." Violators (groups that disobey guidelines or unregistered groups
 that continue to operate) may face administrative punishment or criminal charges.
 There was no information by year's end on how these regulations are being imple-
 mented.
 During the year, Beijing businessman Peng Ming and several associates formed
 an independent forum for discussion of economic and political issues called the
 China Development Union (CDU). Foreign reporters and diplomats as well as inter-
 ested Chinese were invited to weekly meetings. The CDU took up a range of topics,
 including sensitive issues such aspolitical reform, labor, and democratization. Peng
 claimed publicly that the CDU hadaregistered 4,000 members nationwide and hoped
 to recruit a million more to become a major political force. Authorities allowed the
 group and its provocative weekly meetings to continue for several months before for-
 meally closing down the CDU's offices in October. At year's end, the group was con-
 tinung to meet but less openly and on a less frequent basis with fewer members.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religious beief
 however, the Government seeks to restrict religious practice to government-sanc-
 tioned organizations and registered places of worship and to control the growth and
 
 
 854
 
 scope of the activity of religious groups. During the year, some unregistered reli-
 gious groups were subjected to increased restrictions, although the degree of restric-
 tions varied significantly from region to region and the number of religious adher-
 ents, in both unregistered and registered churches, continued to grow rapidly. The
 Criminal Law states that government officials who deprive citizens of religious free-
 dom may, in serious cases, be sentenced to up to 2 years in prison. However, there
 are no known cases of persons being punished under this statute.
 The State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau (RAB) is responsible for monitoring
 and judging the legitimacy of religious activity. The RAB and the CCP United Front
 Work Department, staffed by officials who are rarely religious adherents, provide
 policy "guidance and supervision" over implementation of government regulations on
 religious activity, as well as the role of foreigners in religious activity.
 During the year, the Government continued a national campaign to enforce 1994
 State Council regulations that require all places of worship to register with govern-
 ment aeiiu      affirs bureaus and come under the supervision of official "patriotic"
 religious organizations. There are six preconditions for the establishment of venues
 for religious activity Possession of a meeting place; citizens who are religious believ-
 ers and who regularly take part in religious activity; an organized governing board;
 a minimum number of followers; a set of operating rules; and a legal source of in-
 come.
 At the end of 1997, the Government reported that there were more than 85,000
 approved venues for religious activities. Some groups registered voluntarily, some
 registered under pressure, while authorities refused to register others. Unofficial
 groups claimed that authorities often refuse them registration without explanation.
 According to the Government, these refusals were mainly the result of inadequate
 facilities and meeting spaces. Many religious groups have been reluctant to comply
 with the regulations out of principled opposition to state control of religion or due
 to fear of adverse consequences if they reveal, as required, the names and addresses
 of church leaders. In some areas, efforts to register unauthorized groups are carried
 out by religious leaders and civil affairs officials. In other regions, registration is
 performed by police and RAE officials, concurrently with other law enforcement ac-
 tions. Police closed many "underground" mosques, temples, seminaries, Catholic
 churches, and Protestant "house churches," many with significant memberships,
 properties, financial resources, and networks. At times leaders of unauthorized
 groups ar    e targets of harassment, interrogations, and detention, and physical
 abuse.
 In certain regions, government supervision of religious activity is minimal, al-
 though local implementing regulations in other places, such Zhejiang, Guangxi,
 Shanghai, and Chongqing call for strict government oversight. In some parts of the
 country, registered and unrestetered churches are treated similarly by authorities,
 existing openiy side by side, and many congregants worship in both types of church-
 es. In other areas, particularly where considerable unofficial and unregistered reli-
 gious activity takes place, authorities closely monitor places of worship and'take ac-
 tion against unregistered churches. The relationship between unregistered and reg-
 istered churches can be tense. Some house church members maintained that au-
 thorities had renewed efforts in the last half of the year to register house churches
 and to harass those who resist, especially in Henan and Shandong provinces.
 Throughout the year, the Government moved swiftly against houses of worship out-
 side its control that grow too large or espouse beliefs that it considers threatening
 to "state security." In October and November, approximately 140 house church wor-
 shipers were detained in central Henan after attending services that attracted par-
 ticipants from other provinces and from outside China.
 The law does not prohibit religious believers from holding public office; however,
 most influential positions in state units rre reserved for party members and Com-
 munist Party officials state that party membership and religious belief are incom-
 patible. The Communist Party reportedly issued a circular in 1997 ordering party
 members not to adhere to religious beliefs. This followed a 1995 document circulated
 to party organizations at the provincial level ordering the expulsion of party mem-
 bers who belong to religious organizations, whether open or clandestine. The Peo-
 ple's Liberation Army's "Routine Service Regulations" state explicitly that service-
 men "may not take part in religious or superstitious activities." There is no avail-
 able evidence indicating whether party or PLA military personnel were expelled
 under such regulations. According to government officials, 20 to 25 percent of local
 Communist Party officials engage in some kind of religious activity. Most officials
 who practice a religion are Buddhist or believe in a folk religion. Religious figures
 are included in national-level government organizations. The National People's Con-
 gress (NPC) includes several religious leaders, including Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai,
 a Tibetan "living Buddha," who is a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of
 
 
 855
 the NPC. Religious groups also are represented in the Chinese People's Political
 Consultative Conference, a forum for multiparty cooperation and consultation led by
 the CCP, which advises the Government on policy.
 After forcefully suppressing all religious observances and closing all seminaries
 during the 1966-76 ultural Revolution, the Government began in the late 1970's
 to restore or replace some damaged or confiscated churches, temples, mosques, and
 monasteries, and to allow the reopening of seminaries. Implementation of this policy
 has varied from locality to locality. According to official figures published in late
 1997, there are over 180 million religious adherents, over 3,000 religious organiza-
 tions, about 300,000 clergy, and 74 religious schools and colleges. Official religious
 organizations administer local Bible schools, nearly two dozen Catholic and Protes-
 tant seminaries, nine institutes to train imams and Islamic scholars, and institutes
 to train Buddhist monks. Students who attend these institutes must demonstrate
 "political reliability," and all graduates must pass an examination on their theo-
 logical and political knowledge to qualify for the clergy. The Government permitted
 some Catholic and Protestant seminarians, Muslim clerics, and Buddhist clergy to
 go abroad for additional religious studies. In most cases, funding for these training
 programs is provided by foreign organizations. Both official and unofficial churches
 have problems training adequate numbers of clergy to meet the needs of their grow-
 ing congregations. However, unofficial churches have particularly significant prob-
 lems training clergy or sending students to study overseas, and many clergy receive
 only limited and inadequate p reparation.
 The authorities permit officially sanctioned religious organizations to maintain
 international contacts that do not entail "foreign control." What constitutes "control"
 is not defined. Regulations enacted in 1994 codified many existing rules involving
 foreigners, including a ban on proselytizing by foreigner, but allow foreign nation-
 als to preach to foreigners, bring in religious materiasfo their own use, and preach
 to Chinese at churches, mosques, and temples at the invitation of registered reli-
 gious organizations. Missionaries officially are not permitted, but foreign Christians
 currently are teaching English and other languages on college campuses with mini-
 mum interference from authorities as long as their proselytizing is low key. In re-
 cent years, some local authorities have subjected worship services of alien residents
 to increased surveillance and restrictions.
 The Government continued to engage in    ternational dialog on religious issues.
 China invited an increasing number of foreign religious organizations to visit reli-
 gious sites and talk to official religious leaders and-figures. As a result of the Octo-
 er 1997 summit between President Clinton and President Jiang a delegation of
 three American religious leaders traveled to China in February at the invitation of
 President Jiang to open a bilateral dialog on issues of religious freedom. Afer the
 visit; President Jiang, who met personally with the three religious leaders, commis-
 sioned the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) to draft separate volumes on
 Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Islam, and Taoism-the five "official" reli-
 gions-for study by government and party cadres.
 Buddhists make up the largest body of religious believers. The Government esti-
 mates that there are more than 100 million Buddhists, most of whom are from the
 dominant Han ethnic group. However, it is difficult to estimate accurately the num-
 ber of Buddhists because they often practice their faith without participating in pub-
 lic ceremonies. The Government reports that there are 13,000 Buddhist temples and
 monasteries and more than 200,000 nuns and monks. Local governments strictly en-
 forced regulations on places of worship, particularly illegally constructed Buddhist
 temples and shrines. During a May conference in Hunan on provincial religious
 work, a senior provincial party official said that goals fur the coming year were to:
 "Tighten management of places of religious activities, properly handle issues con-
 cering the indiscriminate establishment of temples and the setting up of outdoor
 Buddha statues, and crack down on heretical religious organizations and illegal reli-
 gious activities." The traditional folk religion (worship of local gods, heroes, and an-
 cestors) of 75 percent of the population has been attacked as "feudal superstition"
 and thousands of religious shrines have been destroyed. Nonetheless, folk religion
 has revived in recent years and is tolerated unofficially to varying degrees as a loose
 affiliate of Taoism or as an ethnic minority cultural practice. (A discussion of gov-
 ernment restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism can be found in the Tibet addendum to
 this report.)
 According to government figures, there are 1 million Muslims, 30,000 Islamic
 places of worship, and more than 40,000 imams. In some areas where ethnic unrest
 has occurred, officals continue to restrict the building of mosques and the religious
 education of youths under the age of 18. Ater a series of violent incidents in
 Xinjiang in 1997, police cracked down  on Muslim religious activity and places of
 worship, and local authorities issued regulations further restricting religious activi-
 
 
 856
 
 ties and teaching. A May report on Xinjiang People's Radio quoted a senior provin-
 cial official accusing separatists of having 'carried out subversion and sabotage in
 the region in the name of religious activities." The official said that the Government
 must 'resolutely oppose illegal religious activities" and that religious practice must
 "uphold the dignity of laws, the interest of the people, the unification of the mother-
 land, and the unity of the nationalities. Any violation will not be tolerated by the
 people's democratic dictatorship" (see Section 5).
 The Government permits and in some cases subsidizes, Muslim citizens who make
 the hajj to Mecca. According to government statistics, more than 45,000 Chinese
 Muslims have made the pilgrimage in recent years-5,000 in 1998. In November a
 Qing dynasty mosque was destroyed in Chengdu's Muslim quarter to make way for
 a boulevard near an expanded city square despite strong opposition from the city's
 Muslim population. The construction of a new mosque over a complex of retail es-
 tablishments further offended the community.
 The number of Christians in both official and unofficial churches continues to
 grow rapidly, particularly in rural areas. The growth of unofficial churches has
 caused concern among many government and Communist Party officials who per-
 ceive unregulated religious gatherings as a potential challenge to their authority a
 threat to public order, and an alternative to Socialist thought. There was evidence
 that authorities in some areas continued a concerted effort to crack down on the ac-
 tivities of the unapproved Catholic and Protestant churches. The Government offi-
 cially permits only those Christian churches affiliated with either the Catholic Patri-
 otic Association/Catholic Bishops Conference or the (Protestant) Three Self Patriotic
 Movement/Chinese Christian Council to operate openly.
 In some regions, coexistence and cooperation between official and unofficial
 churches is close enough to blur the line between the two. Coadjutor Bishop Joseph
 Zen Ze-kiun of Hong Kong said in an address to the Vatican Synod for Asia in April
 that "bishops and priests of the official (Catholic) church today are, with very few
 exceptions, zealous workers in the vineyard of the Lord, leading a poor and exem-
 plary life, respected by the faithful they serve. . . ." However, in some areas rela-
 tions between the two churches remain hostile. A Roman Catholic news agency re-
 ported that, from June 25 to July 3, the provincial government in Gansu "invited"
 32 unofficial Catholic church leaders to attend study sessions, during which they
 were forced to sign documents affirming that their faith should "not be linked with
 the Pope politically or economically." Two bishops of the official Catholic Church,
 who have been recognized by the Vatican as well, were denied passports to attend
 the Synod for Asia in April.
 The unofficial, Vatican-affiliated Catholic Church claims a membership far larger
 than the 4 million persons registered with the official Catholic Church. Precise fig-
 ures are Aifficult to estimate because many Catholics, particularly in rural areas,
 attend both official and unofficial services, but Vatican officials have estimated as
 many as 10 million adherents. According to official figures, the government-ap-
 proved Catholic Church has 4,000 clergy and over 4,600 churches and meeting
 houses. China so far has not agreed to establish diplomatic relations with the Holy
 See, and there is no Vatican representative in China. Bishops in the official Catholic
 Church are not consecrated by Rome, but many have been recognized unofficially
 by Rome.
 The Government maintains that there are between 10 and 15 million registered
 Protestants, 18,000 clergy, over 12,000 churches, and some 25,000 meeting places.
 According to foreign experts, perhaps 30 million persons worship in house churches
 that are independent of government control, although estimates by some Chinese
 house church groups range as high as 80 million.
 This increase in the number of Christians has resulted in a corresponding in-
 crease in the demand for Bibles. In 1998 the Government approved the printing of
 more than 3 million Bibles, and there are currently more than 18 million Bibles in
 print. One printing company that is a joint venture with an overseas Christian orga-
 nization also prints approximately 500,000 Bibles a year. Although Bibles can be
 purchased at some bookstores, they are not readily available and cannot be ordered
 directly from publishing houses by individuals. However, they are available for pur-
 chase at most officially recognized churches, and many house church members buy
 their Bibles from churches without incident. Nonetheless, some underground Chris-
 tians hesitate to buy Bibles at official churches because such transactions sometimes
 involve receipts identifying the purchaser. Foreign experts confirm reports of chronic
 shortages of Bibles, mostly due to logistical problems in disseminating Bibles to
 rural agreas. However, they note that the situation has improved in recent years due
 to improved distribution channels, including to house churches. Customs officials
 continue to monitor for the "smuggling" of Bibles and other religious materials into
 the country.

 In some areas, security authorities used threats, demolition of unregistered prop-
 erty, extortion of "fines," and interrogation to harass reigious figures and followers.
 Implementing regulations, provincial work reports, and other government and party
 documents continued to exhort officials to enforce vigorously government policy re-
 garding unregistered churches. In March the Guangzhou Municipal People's Con-
 gress passed highly restrictive religious regulations. Zhejiang province also promul-
 gated new Religious Affairs Regulations that stipulated that 'illegal" property and
 income would be confiscated from those who "1) preside over or organize religious
 activities at places other than those for religious activities or at places not approved
 by a religious affairs department; 2) do missionary work outside the premises of a
 place of religious activity; and 3) sponsor religious training activities without obtain-
 ing the approval of a religious a   department at or above the county level." In
 particular, authorities targeted unofficial religious groups in Beijing and the prov-
 inces of Henan and Shandong, where there are rapidly growing numbers of unregis-
 tered Protestants, and Hebei, a center of unregistered Catholics. In Henan there
 were reports that police raided two house church services and detained approxi-
 mately 140 worshipers, beating some of them in the process. On October 26, the
 Public Security Bureau broke up a house service and detained 40 house church
 members in Lr"wan. According to reports some were beaten. On November 5, the
 Public Security Bureau surrounded a gathering of house church members in
 Nanyang and detained over 100 persons, including church leaders who reportedly
 were beaten. Some house church leaders have alleged that this raid was initiated
 at the urging of officials from the local branch of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement
 In some cases, public security officials have used prison or reform-through-edu-
 cation sentences to enforce regulations. Evangelist Xui Yongze, a leader of the
 Protestant "unity movement," continues to serve a 3-year reform-through-labor sen-
 tence in Pingyuan prison in Henan for allegedly disturbing public order. The Gov-
 erment's 1997 White Paper on Reigious Freedom stated that Xu had violated the
 law by promoting a cult, preaching that the Apocalypse was near, and asking wor-
 shipers to wail in public spaces for several consecutive days. Group members deny
 these charges. Xu's colleagues Qin Baocai and Mu Sheng continue to serve reeduca-
 tion-through-labor sentences. In September a group of leaders from house church
 networks met in Henan and issued a public communique calling on the Government
 to enter into a dialog with unofficial Protestant churches, to release all religious
 prisoners, and to redefine what constitutes a "cult." In December another commu-
 nique set forth a common theological creed and a joint position on relations with
 the Government. House church pastor Allen Yuan, 85, reportedly was placed under
 virtual house arrest for a periodof time in June and again in August after he held
 a large ceremony in which 350 worshipers were baptized.
 In May the authorities released 78-year-old Roman Catholic Bishop Zeng Jingmi
 6 months before the end of his 3-year reeducation sentence after foreigu govern-
 ments and religious leaders interceded on his behalf. He is reportedly under house
 arrest.
 In Hebei, where perhaps half of China's Catholics reside, friction between unoffi-
 cial Catholics and local authorities continued. Hebei authorities have been known
 to force many underground priests and believers to make a choice of either joining
 the "patriotic" church or facing punishment such as fines, job loss, and, in some
 cases, having their children barred from school. The whereabouts of Roman Catholic
 Bishop Su Zhimin, whose followers reported that he was arrested in October 1997,
 remained unclear. Underground Catholic sources in Hebei claimed that he was still
 under detention, while the Government denied having taken "any coercive meas-
 ures" against him. Reliable sources reported that Bishop An Shuxin, Bishop Zhang
 Weizhu, Father Cui Xing, and Father Wang Quanjun remained under detention in
 Hebei. The Cardinal Kung Foundation reported that Father Wei Jingkun and Sister
 Zhang Yanzhi were detained in August for celebrating the Feast of the Assumption
 of the Blessed Virgi Mary, and that Bishop Jia Zhiguo was detained during the
 June visit of Presient Clinton. Reliable sources reported that priests Dong Zhenlu,
 Chun Yunpeng, and Zhang Ruowang were detained in February; some linked their
 detention to the visit to China of three foreign religious leaders. Father L Genyou
 and Father Shi Wende reportedly were detained in the spring. Underground Catho-
 lic Bishop Joseph Fan  hongliag of Shanghai remained under surveillance and
 often had his movements restrited. A delegation of American reigious leaders was
 prevented from seeing him when they visited Shanhai in February. In November
 Roman Catholic priest Li Qinghua was arrested. According to press reports, Li has
 been tortured since his arrest, including by being forced to have sexual intercourse
 with prostitutes.
 Religious groups that preached beliefs outside the bounds of officially approved
 doctrine-such as the coming of the Apocalypse--often were singled out for harass-
 
 
 858
 ment. Police continued their efforts to close down an underground evangelical sect
 called the "Shouters," a branch of a pre-1949 indigenous Protestant group. The sect
 has been deemed an antigovernment, counterrevolutionary "cult." Since the early
 -1980's, authorities repeatedly have detained, fired, or imprisoned its members.
 Independent observers report an increase of nontraditional sects in recent years.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government places some restrictions on freedom of movement. The
 effectiveness of the Government's household registration/identification card system,
 used to control and restrict the location of individual residences, continued to erode.
 The "floating population" of economic migrants leaving their home areas to seek
 work elsewhere in the country is estimated to be between 80 and 130 million. This
 group comprises not only migrant workers, but also includes a growing number of
 middle-class professionals attracted to large cities by hopes of better paying jobs in
 their fields. This itinerant population lacks official residence status, which is re-
 quired for full access to social services and education. Unless such persons obtain
 resident status, they must pay a premium for these services. However, some cities,
 such as Beijing, are beginning to offer social services free of charge. In August the
 Public Security Ministry issued revised regulations that allow persons from the
 countryside to apply for permanent residence in a city iff 1) They have investments
 or property in a city; 2) they are elderly and have children who live in a city; or
 3) their spouses live in a city.
 Several dissidents reported that the authorities had restricted their freedom of
 movement at politically sensitive periods. In June Mu Chuanghang, who was visit-
 ing Beijing at the time, apparently was detained and sent back to Qingdao by police
 prior to President Clinton's arrival in China. Before his arrest in Wuhan at the end
 of the year, dissident Qin Yongmin said that he was prevented repeatedly from
 Soing to Beijing to visit his daughter, who lived with his ex-wife there. Others were
 ept under close surveillance. In October Beijing police blocked a group of dissidents
 who tried to drive to Shandong in a demonstration of support for Xie Wangjun (see
 Section 1.f.).
 Under the "staying at prison employment" system applicable to recidivists incar-
 cerated in reeducation-through-labor camps, authorities have denied certain inmates
 permission to return to their homes. Those inmates sentenced to more than 5 years
 in reeducation-through-labor camps also may lose their legal right to return home.
 For those assigned to camps far from their residences, this Practice constitutes a
 form of internal exile. The number of prisoners subject to this restriction is un-
 known. Authorities reportedly have forced others to accept jobs in state enterprises
 where they can be monitored more closely after their release from prison or deten-
 tion. Other released or paroled prisoners returned home but were not permitted
 freedom of movement. Chen Ziming, who was paroled on medical grounds in Novem-
 ber 1996, remained confined to his home except for police-escorted visits to doctors.
 A former senior leader remained under house arrest, and security around him was
 tightened routinely during sensitive periods, such as the anniversary of the
 Tiananmen massacre and during the visits of important foreign leaders. A former
 aide of this individual, Bao Tong, who was released in 1997, remained closely mon-
 itored.
 The Government permits legal emigration and foreign travel for most citizens.
 The Government continued to use political attitudes as criteria for selecting persons
 for government-sponsored study abroad. However, it did not control privately spon-
 sored students, who constitute the majority of Chinese studying abroad. Business
 travelers wishing to go abroad can obtain passports relatively easily. Permission for
 couples to travel abroad sometimes was conditioned on agreement to delay child-
 birth. In Xinjiang a businesswoman and former member of the Chinese People's
 Consultative Conference reportedly has been deprived of her passport and cannot
 leave Urumqi without police authorization. The Government continued efforts to at-
 tract persons who had studied overseas back to China. Official media have said in
 the past that persons who have joined foreign organizations hostile to China should
 quit them before returning home and refrain while abroad from activities that vio-
 late China's laws.
 Wang Dan was released from prison on medical parole in April on the condition
 that he leave the country for medical treatment. The Government subsequently
 issued passports to Wang's parents, sister, and niece, allowing them to visit him.
 Wei Jingsheng's family members also were allowed to visit him in exile. In March
 Shanghai dissident Xu Shuiliang and his family were allowed to leave China. In
 contrast, Beijin activist Ren Wanding was denied a passport because his 'political
 rights" still hag not been restored after his release from prison. In May the wife
 of Wang Xizhe, who escaped China in 1996, was denied permission to meet her hus-
 band in Macao. Bao Tong reportedly was refused a passport to visit his son abroad.
 
 
 859
 There were also instances when the authorities refused visas or entry on apparent
 political grounds. International observers and human rights organizations reported
 that they had documents that substantiated claims that border control stations keep
 background records of certain individuals who are to be denied entry. Authorities
 have denied these reports. In October Thomas Keng Lu, a U.S. citizen who works
 for a Taiwanese magazine, was denied entry into the mainland, apparently for help-
 ing former Hong Kong Xinhua (the official New China News Agency) bureau chief
 Xu Jiatun flee the country in 1989 after the Tiananmen crackdown. Li Xiaorong,
 a U.S. citizen, university lecturer, and vice chairwoman of Human Rights in China,
 was expelled after arriving at her parents' home for a visit in April Also in April,
 democracy activist Frank Woo was turned back at the Beijing airport. Two foreign-
 based dissidents, Zhang Lin and Zhou Quanbao were detained and sentenced to 3
 years' reeducation through labor after returning to China illegally. According to
 press reports, Chinese authorities also detained and deported Yan Duizheng a  .S.
 citizen, who met in Qingdao with the sister of imprisoned dissident Sun Weibang
 in October. Foreign academics with contacts with the dissident community also re-
 peatedly have been refused entry visas. In contrast, Chen Yizi, an ex-aide to a
 former, senior Communist Party leader and the highest ranking official to flee to
 the West after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, was aowed to return in July to visit
 his ailing mother.
 The Government does not provide first asylum. However, since the late 1980's,
 China has adopted a de facto policy of tolerance toward the small number of per-
 sons-fewer than 100 annually-from other nations who have registered with the
 Beijing office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as
 asylum seekers. The Government has permitted these persons to stay in China
 while the UNHCR makes determinations as to their status and-if the M     CR de-
 termines that they are bona fide refugees-while they await resettlement in third
 countries. As yet, China has no law or regulations that authorize the authorities to
 grant refugee status, but the Government reportediy continues to draft working
 rules on granting such status.
 The Government continued to accept the repatriation of citizens who had entered
 other countries or territories illegally. The authorities have accepted the return of
 would-be illegal emigrants to the United States, Hong Kong, and Australia, provided
 that their identity can be verified.
 The Government has worked with Laos and Cambodia to facilitate the return of
 resettled individuals who have decided to return to their home countries. The Gov-
 ernment denies having tightened its policy on accepting Vietnamese asylum seekers.
 Due to the stable situation in Vietnam with regard to ethnic Chinese and the in-
 creasingly porous border between the two countries, very few Vietnamese have
 sought resettlement in China in recent years.
 There were no confirmed reports of the forced return of persons to a country
 where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens lack the means to change their government legally and cannot freely
 choose or change the laws and officials that govern them. Citizens vote directly for
 local nongovernmental village committees, and among party-reviewed candidates for
 delegate positions in town and township and county-level people's congresses. How-
 ever, people's congress delegates at the provincial level, are selected by county-level
 people's congresses, and in turn provincial-level people's congresses select delegates
 to the National People's Congress (NPC). Although the CCP vets all candidates,
 many county and provincial elections are competitive, with more candidates running
 than there are seats available.
 According to the Constitution, the NPC is the highest organ of state power. For-
 mally it elects the President and Vice President, selects the Premier and vice pre-
 miers, and elects the Chairman of the State Central Military Commission. In prac-
 tice the NPC Standing Committee oversees these elections and determines the agen-
 da and procedure for the NPC under the direct authority of the Politburo Standing
 Committee. At the 1998 session of the NPC, slightly over 45 percent of the dele-
 gates--the largest negative vote ever-voted against or abstained from voting on the
 Supreme People's Procuratorate work report, close to the 50 percent needed to reject
 a government-sponsored motion. Most observers interpreted the vote, which ex-
 pressed delegate unhappiness about the problems of crime and corruption, as re-
 flecting the NPC's increased willingness in recent years to question the Govern-
 ment's performance. Although the NPC does not have the power to set policy or re-
 move government or party leaders, some 35 percent of NPC delegates opposed the
 candidacy of Han Zhubin, a protege of President Jiang who had been nominated to
 
 
 860
 be the new procurator-general. Government officials cited the NPC's new willingness
 to voice its displeasure, especially toward government corruption and the 'weak judi-
 cial system, as a main reason behind the Government's high profile campaign
 against official malfeasance and its focus on the rule of law.
 In general, the election and agenda of people's congresses at all levels remain
 under the firm control of the Communist Party, the paramount source of political
 authority. A number of small "democratic" parties that date from before the Com-
 munist takeover in 1949 play a minor consultative role and must pledge their alle-
 giance to the CommunistParty. The CCP retains a tight rein on political decision-
 making and forbids the creation of new political parties. Starting in June, activists
 in a number of provinces repeatedly tried to register the first true opposition politi-
 calpary-the China Democracy P.ary (CDP) -with local civilaffairs offices (see
 Section 2.b.). The frst group of petoners, led by Wang Youcain Hangzhou, were
 detained for various periods of time, but subsequent attempts over the next few
 months by activists did not automatically result in detention. In some cases, local
 authorities explained to dissidents the proper procedures and minimum qualifica-
 tions necessary to register a social organization. However, none of the applications
 was approved, and in November authorities began a crackdown on members of the
 CDP and its supporters. At year's end, Wang Youcai,, Xu Wenli, and Qin Yongmin
 had been arrested, tried, and given harsh sentences ranging from 11 to 13 years
 for their political activities. Dozens of others were in detention or under tight sur-
 veillance. NPC President Li Peng was widely quoted as saying that groups that
 "seek a multiparty system and try to negate the leadership of the Communist Party
 will not be allowed to exist."
 At the same time, democratic decisionmaking continued to grow as the local vil-
 lage committee elections program expanded. Under the 1987 Organic Law of the Vil-
 lage Committees, all of China's approximately 1 million villages are expected to hold
 competitive, direct elections for village committees. The NPC Standing Committee
 in November passed a revised version of the law, which called for enhancements in
 the electoral process, including substantial improvements in the nominating process
 and the required use of voting booths. It also provided for improved transparency
 in village committee administration and appears to boost the authority of te village
 committees over communally owned properties.
 Both the Government and foreign observers estimate that more than 90 percent
 of v1llages have participated in elections for local leaders. According to the Ministry
 of Civil Affairs, the majority of provinces have carried out at least two rounds of
 village elections, 18 provinces have held three elections, and 4 provinces have held
 four ballots. Foreign observers who have monitored local village committee elections,
 including the Carter Center and the International Republican Institute, have judged
 the elections they observed, on the whole, to be fair. However, many villages have
 yet to hold truly competitive elections. The Government estimates that on-third of
 all elections have procedural flaws. Successful village committee elections have in-
 cluded secret ballots to select candidates, active campaigns by multiple candidates,
 platforms, and the use of secret ballots in the election itself.
 Candidates favored by local authorities have been defeated in some elections, al-
 though in general the party dominates the electoral process, and roughiy 60 percent
 of the members elected to the village committees are party members. The final bal-
 lot is the culmination of an election process that includes government screening of
 candidates and an indirect vote that eliminates some candidates. Many observers
 caution that the village election system is not necessarily a precursor for democracy
 at higher levels of government, and village elections-as currently practiced-do not
 threaten to undermine the implementation of unpopular central policies or endanger
 the leading role of the Communist Party. There were credible reports in November
 that the election of dissident Yu Tielong to head the Wangshanding village commit-
 tee was nullified by the local Communist Party committee. The nongovernmental
 elected village committees are not part of the formal government structure. The
 powers of elected village committees vary from region to region. Most committees
 have the authority to mediate disputes between villagers, improve public order, and
 authorize small expenditures. The committees also carry out political work by serv-
 ing as a channel of communication between villagers and the Government. The vil-
 lage committees have no power to tax, set fines or punishments independently, or
 hire or fire village enterprise managers.
 A recent development, which the Government has encouraged, is the formation of
 villagers' representative assemblies that oversee the performance of the village com-
 mittees. According to a government report, such village assemblies have been oper-
 atin ing Zhaoxian County, Hebe province since 1996. In 1997 assemblies in the
 county reportedly removed 54 corrupt or incompetent village committee members
 and vetoed 72 umreasonable development projects."
 
 
 The Government places no restrictions on the participation of women or minority
 groups in the political process. Women freely exercise their right to vote in village
 committee elections, but only a small fraction of elected members are women. For
 example, in Hubei province, villagers elected 31,692 village committee chairmen and
 803 chairwomen. The Government and party organizations include approximately
 12 million female officials out of 58 million party members. Women constitute 22
 percent of the National People's Congress. The 15th Party Congress elected 22
 women to serve as members or alternates on the 193-person Central Committee, an
 increase over the total of the previous committee. However, women still hold few
 positions of significant influence at the highest rungs of the party or government
 structure. One alternate member of the 22-member Politburo is a woman, and
 women hold 2 of 29 ministerial-level positions.
 Minorities constitute 14 percent of the National People's Congress. All of China's
 56 nationalities are represented in the NPC membership. The 15th Party Congress
 elected 38 members of ethnic minorities to serve as members or alternates on the
 Central Committee, an increase over the total of the previous committee. However,
 minorities hold few senior party or government positions of significant influence.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent domestic NGO's that publicly monitor or comment on
 human rights conditions. Over the past year, a network of dissidents in cities
 around the country grew to become a credible source ,of information about govern-
 ment actions taken against activists. The information is disseminated to the outside
 worid through organizations such as the Hong Kong-based Information Center for
 Human Rights and Democratic Movement and the New York-based Human Rights
 in China. In October a group called Corruption Watch formed by dissidents in
 Xinyang reportedly was deemed illegal and closed down by authorities who claimed
 that the Government already had agencies working to fight corruption. The press
 regulariy prints stories about officials who exceed their authority and infringe on
 citizens' rights. However, the Government remains reluctant to accept criticism of
 its human rights record by other nations or international organizations and criti-
 cizes reports by international human rights monitoring groups, maintaining that
 they are inaccurate and interfere with the country's internal affairs. The Govern-
 ment still maintains that there are legitimate, differing approaches to human rights
 based on each country's particular history, culture, social situation, and level of eco-
 nomic development. In 1993 the Government established the China Society for
 Human Rights, a "nongovernmental" organization whose efforts have been focused
 on defending the Government's views and human rights record.
 China has active human rights dialogs with a large number of countries, includ-
 ing Great Britain, France, Australia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Brazil, Japan, the
 United States, as well as the European Union (EU). In December as part of a bilat-
 eral rule of law initiative, the United States and China convened a bilateral sympo-
 sium on the legal protection of human rights, a project originally proposed by the
 former Justice Minister. The Government held similar meetings, which increasingly
 included the participation of legal experts and not just foreign ministry officials,
 with Canada and the EU. In September the Government hosted the first visit by
 the UNHCHR. In October the Government hosted its first international conference
 on human rights, although no domestic critics of the Government were invited to
 attend. China is also greatly expanding the number and frequency of judicial ex-
 changes with other countries. A China-UK "Legal Week" was held in Beijing in Oc-
 tober. China, Germany, and the American Bar Association held a 4-day program in
 which mock criminal trials in both the German and American systems were dem-
 onstrated in front of Chinese judges and court administrators.
 In October the Government signed the International Covenant on Civil and Politi-
 cal Rights. At year's end no timetable had been announced for ratification by the
 NPC.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are laws designed to protect women, children, the disabled, and minorities.
 In practice, however, societal discrimination Lased on ethnicity, gender, and disabil-
 ity persists. The concept of a largely homogeneous Chinese people pervades the
 thinking of the Han majority.
 Women.-Violence against women can be grounds for prosecution under the law.
 Sociologists note that there has been no detailed research on the extent of physical
 violence against women. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the reporting of
 domestic abuse is on the rise, particularly in urban areas, because greater attention
 
 
 862
 has been focused on the problem. Informal surveys by women's groups indicate that
 20 percent of women may have been beaten by their husbands. Actual figures may
 be higher because spousal abuse still goes largely unreported. According to experts,
 the percentage of households in which domestic abuse has occurred is higher in
 rural areas than in urban centers. In September an official with the All China Wom-
 en's Federation noted that there also had been a significant rise in domestic violence
 in the homes of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises.
 In recognition of the seriousness of spousal abuse, some localities, such as Hunan
 province, have passed legislation to address the problem. However, some experts
 note that, even when appropriate legislation exists, local law enforcement authori-
 ties frequently choose not to interfere in what they regard as a family matter. There
 is no national spousal abuse law.
 According to some estimates by experts, there may be up to 10 mifion commercial
 sex workers. The increased commercialization of sex and related trafficking in
 women has trapped tens of thousands of women in a cycle of crime and exploitation.
 It is estimated that there are 70,000 prostitutes in Beijing alone. Unsafe working
 conditions are rampant among the saunas, massage houses, and hostess bars that
 have sprung up in large cities. According to research done by medical professionals,
 up to 80 percent of prostitutes in some areas have hepatitis. The incidence of AIDS
 is a growing problem. Although the central Government and various provincial and
 local governments have attempted to crack down on the sex trade, there have been
 numerous credible reports in the media of official complicity in prostitution. Thus
 far actions to crack down on this lucrative business, which involves organized crime
 groups and business people, as well as the police and military, have been largely
 ineffective.,
 The abduction of women is a serious problem. The Government acknowledges that
 the kidnaping and sale of women for marriage or prostitution is a human rights
 abuse that warrants severe punishments for criminals involved with the trade, and
 continues to take steps to prevent the practice and punish those who engage in this
 trade. Media reports, as well as an Amnesty International report on capital punish-
 ment in China, cite numerous cases in which individuals received the death penalty
 for the crime of abducting women. Some research indicates that a key reason for
 the abduction and sale of women is a serious imbalance in sex ratios in certain lo-
 calities (see Section l.f.). This has created a situation in which the demand by men
 for marriageable women cannot be met by local brides. Some families address the
 problem by recruiting women in economically less advanced areas. Others seek help
 from criminal gangs, which either kidnap women or trick them by promising them
 jobs and an easier way of life and then transport them far from their home areas
 for delivery to buyers. Once in their new "family," these women are "married" and
 raped. Some accept their fate and join the new community; others struggle and are
 punished.
 Crime experts say that many of the kidnapings also occur in provinces, such as
 Sichuan and Guangxi, where the male to female ratio generally is balanced. The
 Government reported that some of its efforts to end the illegal trade were success-
 ful.
 There is no statute that outlaws sexual harassment in the workplace, although
 there has been some discussion by legislators about the need for such legislation.
 The problem remains unaddressed in the legal system and often in society. How-
 ever, experts state that more women are raising their concerns about sexual harass-
 ment because of greater awareness of the problem.
 Suicide of women is a serious problem in the countryside where highly toxic pes-
 ticides are readily available. According to the World Bank, Harvard University, and
 the World Health Organization, some 56 percent of the world's female suicides occur
 in China. Research indicates that the low status of women, the rapid shift to a mar-
 ket economy, and the availability of-pesticides in rural areas are among the leading
 causes.
 The authorities have enacted laws and conducted educational campaigns in an ef-
 fort to eradicate the traditional preference for sons; however, this preference re-
 mains strong in rural China. A number of provinces have sought to reduce the per-
 ceived higher value of boys in providing old-age support for their parents by estab-
 lishing or improving pensions and retirement homes.
 The central Government has made gender equality a policy objective since 1949.
 The Constitution states that "women enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of
 life," including ownership of property, inheritance rights, and access to education.
 Women's economic and political influence has increased. Nonetheless, female activ-
 ists are increasingly concerned that the progress that has been made by women over
 the past 50 years is being eroded and that women's status in society has regressed
 in the 1990's. They assert that the central Government appears to have made the
 
 
 863
 pursuit of gender equality a secondary priority as it focuses on economic reform and
 political stability. Social and familial pressure also has grown for women to resume
 their traditional roles as wives and mothers. A recent study of women's role in the
 media reveals that images of women's worth increasingly are linked to their ability
 to attract a wealthy husband and be a good mother.
 In 1992 the NPC enacted legislation on the protection of the rights and interests
 of women, which was designed to assist in curbing gender-based discrimination.
 However, in 1997 women continued to report that discrimination, sexual harass-
 ment, unfair dismissal, demotion, and wage discrepancies were significant problems.
 Efforts have been made by social organizations as well as the Government to edu-
 cate women about their legal rights, and there is anecdotal evidence that women
 increasingly are using laws to protect their rights. Nevertheless, women encounter
 serious obstacles in getting laws enforced. The structure of the social system also
 prevents women from having a full range of options. For example, women who seek
 a divorce face the prospect of losing their housing since government work units allot
 housing to men when couples marry.
 Women have borne the brunt of China's economic reform of-state-owned enter-
 prises. As the Government's plan to revamp state-owned enterprises is carried out,
 millions of workers have been laid off. Of those millions, a disproportionate percent-
 age are women, many of whom do not have the skills or opportunities to find new
 jobs. Government statistics for 1997 show that while 42 percent of the work force
 in state-owned enterprises were female, more than 60 percent of the laid off workers
 have been women. Women between the ages of 35 and 50 were the most affected,
 and the least likely to be retrained. In addition, female employees were more likely
 to be chosen to take pay cuts when a plant or company was in financial trouble.
 Discriminatory hiring practices appear to be on the rise as unemployment rises. In-
 creasingly, companies discriminate by both sex and age, although such practices vio-
 late labor laws. A store in Shenyang, a state-owned enterprise that had been bought
 out by a Hong Kong company, laid off 60 percent of its 200 employees-mostly mid-
 die-aged women. Those not laid off were all young women in their twenties.
 Many employers prefer to hire men to avoid the expense of maternity leave and
 child care and some even lower the effective retirement age for female workers to
 40 years of age. (The official retirement age for men is 60 years and for women 55
 years.) Lower retirement ages have the effect of reducing pensions, which generally
 are based on years worked.
 The law promises equal pay for equal work. According to a 1997 World Bank re-
 port, Chinese women, on average, earn between 80 and 90 percent of their male
 counterparts. Most women employed in industry work in lower skilled and lower
 paid jobs.
 While the gap in the education levels of men and women is narrowing, men con-
 tinue to constitute the majority of the relatively small percentage of the population
 that receives a university-level education. According to figures released by the All
 China Women's Federation, at the end of 1997, women made up 36 percent of all
 university students, and 30 percent of all graduate students. However, educators in
 the large cities have reported that there is a trend toward greater gender balance
 in universities. Some academics have reported that in some departments women are
 beginning to outnumber men-even in some graduate schools. However, women
 with advanced degrees report an increase in discrimination in the hiring process as
 the job distribution system has opened up and become more competitive and mar-
 ket-driven.
 According to official figures, in 1995 there were 145 million illiterates above the
 age of 15. Women make up approximately 70 percent of this total. The Govern-
 ment's "Program for the Development of Chinese Women (1995-2000)" sets as one
 of its goals the virtual elimination of illiteracy among young and midde-aged
 women by the end of the century. The main priority is to increase the literacy of
 rural women, 80 percent of whom are wholly or partially illiterate. However, some
 women's advocates were skeptical that the Government's goal could be attained
 given the lack of resources.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for 9 years of compulsory education for chil-
 dren (see Tibet addendum). The 1992 Law on the Protection of Juveniles forbids in-
 fanticide, as well as mistreatment or abandonment of children. The law also pro-
 hibits discrimination against disabled minors, emphasizes the importance of safety
 and morality, and codifies a variety of judicial protections for juvenile offenders. The
 physical abuse of children can be grounds for criminal prosecution.
 The extensive health care delivery system has led to improved child health and
 a sharp decline in infant mortality rates. According to 1997 official figures, the in-
 fant mortality rate was 33 per 1,000 in 1996. According to the U.N. Children's Fund
 
 
 864
 (UNICEF), in 1995 the mortality rate for children under 5 years of age was 47 per
 1,000 live births.
 There were credible reports of female infanticide. The use of ultrasound tests to
 determine gender also results in decisions to terminate pregnancies of female
 fetuses, but no reliable statistics are available on the extent of the problem. One
 1997 newspaper article quoted a doctor as saying that as many as 97.5 percent of
 pregnancies terminated in his hospital were of female fetuses. A 1997 World Health
 Organization paper reported that the national ratio of male to female births in 1994
 was 117 to 100. (The worldwide statistical norm is 106 to 100.) Part of the statis-
 tical gap may be attributable to female infanticide, sex-selective termination of preg-
 nancies, abandonment or neglect of girls. Underreporting of female births by couples
 trying to evade family planning laws to try to have a son is another significant fac-
 tor (see Section 1.f.).
 According to the latest available figures, compiled in 1994, the number of children
 abandoned each year is approximately 1.7 million, despite the fact that under the
 law child abandonment is punishable by fines and a 5-year prison term. The vast
 majority of those eventually admitted to orphanages are female, although some are
 disabled, or in poor health. Children put up for foreign adoption are almost exclu-
 sively girls. The treatment of children at these institutions varies from adequate to
 deplorable. There have been reports of children at some orphanages being restrained
 for long periods of time and being denied basic care and food. Accurate determina-
 tion of infant mortality rates in orphanages is difficult, but rates appear to be very
 high at many, especially-among new arrivals.
 According to several sources, orphanage workers in some facilities reserve basic
 medical care and even nutrition for children who are deemed to have the best
 chances for survival. Some sources report that children whose prospects of survival
 are determined to be poor are placed in rooms separate from other children and sub-
 jected to extreme neglect. Claims that government policies, as opposed to lack of re-
 sources, were to blame for the lack of care of children placed in orphanages could
 not be verified. However, Human Rights Watch reported in 1996, that many institu-
 tions, including those with the highest death rates, have budgets that provide for
 adequate wages, bonuses, and other personnel-related costs, but that budgets for
 children's food, clothing, and other necessities are low throughout the country.
 There was a report that, at least in one orphanage, a new conference room was built
 while the facilities and care for orphans under the age of2 remained abysmal. The
 mortality rate for children under the age of 2 at this institution reportedly ap-
 proached 100 percent, even for those infants who entered in fair health. Bureau-
 cratic indifference and corruption on the part of orphanage administrators appear
 to be significant factors in such cases.
 The Government denies that children in orphanages are mistreated or refused
 medical care but acknowledges that the system is often unable to provide ade-
 quately for those children, especially those who are admitted with serious medical
 problems. In an effort to address this problem, the NPC adopted a revised adoption
 law in November making it easier for Chinese couples to adopt. The new law
 dropped a restriction that parents who adopt a child must be childless. It also allows
 for multiple adoptions and lowers the age at which couples are eligible to adopt. The
 Civil Affairs Ministry announced in 1997 that the Government's top social welfare
 priority for that year would be to improve conditions in orphanages, and there have
 been credible reports of new construction, renovation, and improved care in some
 areas. Over $30 million (248.4 million rmb) reportediy was allocated for this pro-
 gram. A government white paper on women and chidren issued in 1997 stated that
 the central Government had spent $25.7 million (212.8 million rmb) between 1990
 and 1994 to improve "children's welfare institutions," the official term for orphan-
 ages. During the same period, local governments apparently allocated almost $18
 million (149 million rmb) to these institutions.
 Despite government efforts to prevent kidnaping and the buying and selling of
 children the problem persists in some rural areas.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1990 the Government adopted legislation that pro-
 tects the rights of the country's disabled persons. According to the official press, all
 local governments subsequenty drafted specific measures to implement the law.
 The press publicizes both the plight of the disabled and government efforts to assist
 them. The Government, at times in conjunction with NGO's such as the Lions Club
 International, sponsors a wide range of preventive and rehabilitative programs, in-
 cluding efforts to reduce congenital birth defects, treat cataracts, and treat hearing
 disorders. The goal of many of these programs is to allow persons with disabilities
 to be integrated into the rest of society.
 However, reality for the disabled lags far behind legal dictates. Misdiagnosis, in-
 adequate medical care, pariah status, and abandonment remain common problems.
 
 
 865
 
 In an October speech, Vice Premier Li Lanqing noted that, in the past decade, the
 Government had helped some 14 million disabled citizens solve their food and cloth-
 ing problems. Nonetheless, government statistics show that almost one-quarter of
 the approximately 60 million disabled persons live in extreme poverty. According to
 official government statistics released in October, the unemployment rate for dis-
 abled persons is 26.7 percent, a decrease from the past, but still almost 10 times
 the official rate for the general population. The Government's new strategy is to in-
 tegrate the disabled into the mainstream work force, but these efforts are running
 into a cultural legacy of discrimination and neglect, as well as a slowing economy.
 In the mid-1990's in Beijing and eight other cities, the Government began, on a trial
 basis, to require all companies and institutions to hire at least 1 percent of its work-
 ers from among the disabled. However, over a period of 2 years in Beijing, only 400
 disabled persons obtained jobs this way; in Shanghai, over a period of 3 years, only
 100 persons obtained jobs.
 Deng Pufang, son of the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, heads the China
 Welfare Fund for the Handicapped and the China Disabled Persons' Federation
 (CDPF), government-affiliated organizations tasked with assisting the disabled. In
 March the CDPF laid out a series of goals to achieve by the year 2000, including
 ensuring that all persons with disabilities have adequate food and clothing, provid-
 ing rehabilitation services for 3 million individuals, increasing to 80 percent the en-
 rollment rate for disabled students, and reducing to 20 percent the unemployment
 rate for disabled workers,
 The Maternal and Child Health Care Law forbids the marriage of persons with
 certain specified contagious diseases or certain acute mental illnesses such as schiz-
 ophrenia. If doctors find that a couple is at risk of transmitting disabling congenital
 defects to their children, the couple may marry only if they agree to use birth con-
 trol or undergo sterilization. This law mandates premarital and prenatal examina-
 tion for genetic or contagious diseases, but it specifies that medically advised termi-
 nation of pregnancy or sterilization requires the signed consent of the patients or
 their guardians.
 In N~ovember China revised its adoption law to loosen age restrictions on adoption.
 This change, which was intended to facilitate adoption, may have unintended con-
 sequences for children with special needs. In the past, individuals under the age of
 35 could adopt only children with special needs. The minimum age for adopting a
 healthy child is now set at 30 instead of 35. Some observers worry that when the
 law becomes effective on April 1, 1999, the lowered minimum age will eliminate the
 age-based incentive for such adoptions.
 Standards adopted in 1994 for making roads and buildings accessible to the dis-
 abled are subject to the 1990 Law on the Handicapped, which calls for their "grad-
 ual" implementation. Lax compliance with the law has resulted in only limited ac-
 cess to most buildings.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-According to 1995 government statistics, the
 total population of the country's 55 ethnic minorities was 108.46 million, or 8.98
 percent of the national population. Most minority groups reside in areas they tradi-
 tionally have inhabited, many of which are mountainous or remote. The Govern-
 ment's avowed policy on minorities calls for preferential treatment in marriage reg-
 ulations, family planning, university admission, and employment. Programs have
 been established to provide low-interest loans, subsidies, and special development
 funds for minority areas. Nonetheless, in practice, minorities face discrimination.
 Most of the minorities in border regions are less educated than the national aver-
 age, and job discrimination in favor of Han migrants remains a serious problem. Ra-
 cial discrimination is the source of deep resentment on the part of minorities in
 some areas, such as Xinjiang and Tibet; however, China does not openly recognize
 Han racism against minorities as a problem or tension among different ethnic
 groups as a problem.
 Official figures state that the Government invested $12.6 billion in infrastructure
 development for minority areas during the period 1991 to 1995. The ninth 5-Year
 Plan announced in 1997 stated that the Government would raise this figure to $27.8
 billion for the period from 1996 to 2000. According to government statistics, between
 1991 and 1996 the economies in minority regions grew by nearly 11 percent annu-
 ally, surpassing the national average in each year. Government development policies
 have helped improve minority living standards. However, real incomes in minority
 areas, especially for non-Han groups remain well below those in other parts of the
 country, and minorities credibly claim that Han Chinese have benefited dispropor-
 tionately from government programs and economic growth. Many development pro-
 grams have disrupted traditional living patterns of minority groups, including Tibet-
 ans and the Muslim Uyghur majority of western Xinjiang. For example, there is
 some evidence that official poverty alleviation programs include the forced evacu-
 
 
 866
 
 ation of persons from the poorest mountain areas. Plans to develop tourism in
 Xinjiang also often have focused on marketing and investment opportunities but
 paid little attention to how minority cultures and the environment might be affected
 adversely. Some projects, however, have been dropped for environmental reasons-
 for example, a proposal to build a railway around Lake Tianchi near Urumqi. Since
 1949 central government and economic policy have resulted in a significant migra-
 tion of Han Chinese to Xinjiang. In 1997 there were 8 million Uyghurs and 7 million
 Han in Xinjiang, up from 300,000 Han in 1949.
 According to official government statistics, 15.34 million minority students at-
 tended, schools between 1994 and 1996. A 1997 white paper stated that 98.16 per-
 cent of all school-age children in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were en-
 rolled in schools in 1996. In many areas with a significant population of minorities,
 there are two-track school systems using either Mandarin or the local minority lan-
 guage. Students can choose to attend schools in either system. One acknowledged
 side effect of this policy, originally designed to protect and -maintain minority cul-
 tures, has been reinforcement of a segregated education system. Under this divided
 education system, those graduating from minority schools are at a disadvantage in
 competing for jobs in government and business, which require good Chinese-lan-
 guage skills. Graduates of these schools typically need a year or more of intensive
 Chinese before they can cope with course work at a Chinese-language university
 (see Tibet addendum).
 The Communist Party has an avowed policy of boosting minority representation
 in the Government and the party. In 1997 the official press reported that there were
 2.48 million minority officials in the Government. According to government statis-
 tics, there were 163,000 minority officials in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Re-
 gion. Minority officials constitute 23.3 percent of the region's total, exceeding the
 ratio of the minority population to Han Chinese in the region. Many members of
 minorities occupy local leadership positions, and a few have positions of influence
 at the national level. However, in most areas ethnic minorities are shut out of posi-
 tions of real political and decisionmaking power. In Xinjiang the job of county party
 secretary-the most important position in a county-typically is reserved for Han
 Chinese, even in counties that are close to 100 percent Uyghur. Many minorities re-
 sent Han officials holding key positions in minority autonomous regions.
 Tensions between ethnic Han citizens and Uyghurs in Xinjiang continued There
 were a number of reports of bombings and kings of policemen in Xinjiang by
 Uyghur separatist groups (see Section l.a.). Since 1996 the authorities have been
 cracking down harshly on suspected Uyghur nationalists and independent Muslim
 religious leaders. This crackdown intensified during the year as the number of anti-
 Chinese demonstrations grew and a series of bomb explosions and violent incidents
 occurred. According to Amnesty International (Al), thousands of persons have been
 detained arbitrarily, including some for their suspected support of the nationalist
 cause. AI has reported instances of torture. In 1998, 14 Uyghurs were executed al-
 legedly for "terrorist" and "separatist" offenses.
 A campaign to stress ethnic unity and to condemn "splittism" and religious extre-
 mism that began in Xinjiang in 1997 continued during the year. This campaign per-
 vades the Chinese-language media and reaches into the province's 1,500 schools.
 Authorities mainained tight control over separatist activities, announced tightened
 security and antiterrorist measures, and mounted several campaigns to crack down
 on opposition during the year.
 According to some estimates, the migration of ethnic Han into Xinjiang in recent
 decades has caused the Han-Uyghur ratio in the capital of Urumqi to shi from 20
 to 80 to 80 to 20, and is a source of Uyghur resentment. Han control of the region's
 political and economic institutions also has been a factor in the growth of tension.
 The testing of nuclear weapons in Xinjiang in past years is another source of serious
 contention because of continuing health concerns and environmental degradation.
 There has been no testing of nuclear weapons in Xinjiang since July 1996, after
 which China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Although government poli-
 cies have brought tangible economic improvements, Uyghurs maintain that they re-
 ceive only a small share of the benefits. The majority of Uyghurs are poor farmers
 - and 25 percent are illiterate.
 The education system provides Chinese-language instruction for Han students
 and the Uyghur-language instruction for Uyghur students until fourth grade and
 then gradually switches to Chinese as the principal language of instruction. Gradua-
 tion from the Uyghur school system leaves Uyghurs poorly educated, with an inad-
 equate command of the Chinese language.
 Possession of separatist publications is not permitted, and, according to reports,
 possession of such materials has resulted in lengthy prison sentences. A Uyghur-
 language press exists in Xinjiang, but it has a very small circulation, and much of
 
 
 the population depends on market rumor for information. In general, central au-
 thorities made it clear that they do not tolerate opposition to Communist Party rule
 and responded to unrest and terrorist incidents with force and heightened security
 measures.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for "freedom of associa-
 tion," but qualifying language makes it clear that this right is subject to the inter-
 ests of theState and the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party
 controls the country's sole officially recognized workers' organization, the All China
 Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). The head of the ACFTU is a member of the
 Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the CCP. Independent trade
 unions are illegal. The 1993 Trade Union Law required that the establishment of
 unions at any level be submitted to a higher level trade union organization for ap-
 proval. Following the signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social,
 and Cultural rights in 1997, a number of labor activists petitioned the Government
 to establish free trade unions as allowed under the covenant. The Government so
 far has not approved the establishment of any unions.
 Under China's planned economy, the ACFTU's main task was to improve labor
 discipline, mobilize workers to achieve party and government objectives, and dis-
 pense social welfare funds. As increasingly large numbers of workers, who have
 een laid off as the result of state-owned enterprise reform, engaged in demonstra-
 tions, the ACFTU has attempted to respond. In April ACFTU officials stated that
 "the greatest danger presently threatening the trade unions' survival is that they
 have lost their close relationship with the broad masses of the workers." The Gov-
 ernment has instructed the ACFTU to play a more active role in protecting the
 rights of the large and growing number of laid off workers and in assisting the Gov-
 ernment with the reemployment process. The ACFTU contributed $250 million in
 relief funds for laid off workers, offered 700,000 union jobs to displaced workers, and
 established vocational training centers. Workers laid off by a state enterprise lose
 employment, but not other benefits. In contrast, unemployed workers are workers
 without a work unit and thus without benefits. Most unemployed workers lack the
 resources to sustain themselves and their families adequately in the absence of a
 meaningful social safety net.
 The ACFTUs primary attention remains focused on workers in the state sector,
 where it has over 90 million members. The Trade Union Law mandates that work-
 ers may decide whether to join the union in their enterprises. There have been no
 reports of repercussions for those 5 percent of the workers who have not joined
 ACFTU unions. In 1994 the ACFTU actively began recruiting workers in the private
 sector, including in township and village enterprises (TVE's), as well as in foreign
 joint ventures. According to official statistics reported in mid-1996, 4.54 million
 workers in enterprises with foreign investment, 75 percent of the total, were mem-
 bers of ACFTU unions.
 Despite these recruiting efforts, over half of the nonagricultural work force is still
 largely unorganized and outside the state industrial structure. In TVE's only a tiny
 percentage of workers are organized in ACFTU affiliates. Although some TVE's have
 local branches of the ACFTU, most TVE managers maintain that an ACFTU pres-
 ence is not feasible because their employees continue to be classified as "farmers"
 rather than "workers." However, some Communist Party secretaries in TVE's take
 it upon themselves to establish union representation and then affiliate with the
 ACFTU.
 The Government has attempted to stamp out illegal union activity. Li Qingxi was
 picked up at his home in January after he publicly posted a declaration calling for
 free and independent trade unions. Although formally sentenced to 1 year of reedu-
 cation through labor, Li was allowed to serve out his sentence at home, and activists
 reported that his movements were not restricted. In February Tan Li, one of the
 founders of the independent labor group the China Labor Alliance, was arrested in
 Guangzhou. Also in February Tu Guangwen, who had led a group of protesting laid-
 off workers in an October 1997 demonstration, was sentenced to 3 years in prison.
 Zhou Guoqiang, who was released in January after spending nearly 4 years in a re-
 education camp, was detained temporarily in Beijing on April 30. Observers specu-
 lated that the central Government feared that Zhou would incite laid-off and redun-
 dant workers to establish independent unions. Zhang Shanguang was arrested in
 July for trying to establish an organization to defend the rights of laid-off workers.
 In December Zhang was sentenced to a 10-year prison term on charges of "illegally
 providing intelligence to a foreign organization.' He had spoken to a Radio Free
 Asia reporter about a demonstration by 80 farmers who were protesting excessive
 taxes. In August labor activist Li Bifeng was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment
 
 
 868
 for fraud. However, human rights groups maintain that Li was framed for leaking
 reports of wide-scale demonstrations in Sichuan province in 1997. In December
 labor activist Qin Yongmin, who earlier in the year issued public calls for increased
 worker rights without repercussions, was sentenced to a 12-year prison sentence on
 charges of "inciting the overthrow of state power," primarily because of his political
 activities.
 The Constitution does not provide for the right to strike. Strikes are not officially
 sanctioned, and accurate statistics on strike incidents are not available. However,
 there have been numerous reports from both foreign and Chinese sources that there
 has been a marked increase in the number of strikes, work stoppages, and worker
 demonstrations. There have been credible reports that the central Government for
 the most part hasused minimal force to resolve labor conflicts and refrained from
 detaining large numbers of participants.
 The Trade Union Law assigns unions the role of mediators or go-betweens with
 management in cases of work stoppages or slowdowns. In addition, a workers' dis-
 pute settlement procedure, in effect since 1987, provides for mediation, two levels
 of arbitration committees, and a final appeal to the courts. The Ministry of Labor
 and Social Security (MOLSS) has established a nationwide organizational network
 for handling labor disputes, consisting of 270,000 enterprise labor dispute mediation
 commissions and 3,159 labor dispute arbitration commissions. There are 1,569,000
 full- and part-time enterprise mediators and more than 17,000 labor arbitrators. In
 May the ACFTU reported that in 1997 there had been more than 71,000 cases of
 labor-management disputes. This was double the number reported by the ACFTU
 in 1995.
 There are no provisions allowing for individual workers or unofficial worker orga-
 nizations to affiliate with international bodies. However, the ACFTU has tried ac-
 tively to foster relations with other international trade unions. According to the
 ACFTU, by the end of 1997 it had established exchanges and cooperative relations
 with 419 trade unions and international and regional trade organizations in 131
 countries and regions. In the past 2 years the ACFTU has sent over 400 of its offi-
 cials overseas to study labor relations, labor laws, labor-management negotiations,
 social security, and cooperation mechanisms among trade unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1995 National Labor Law
 permits collective bargaining for workers in all types of enterprises. The law also
 provides for workers and employers at all types of enterprises to sign individual as
 well as collective contracts. Collective contracts are to be worked out between
 ACFTU or worker representatives and management and specify such matters as
 working conditions, wage distribution, and hours of work. Individual contracts are
 then to be drawn up in line with the terms of the collective contract. Collective con-
 tracts must be submitted to local government authorities for approval within 15
 days. According to an official report, 97.3 percent of urban state-sector workers had
 signed contracts by the end of 1997.
 The MOLSS uses four methods to set a total wage bill for each collective and
 state-owned enterprise: 1) as a percentage of profits, 2) as a contract amount with
 the local labor bureau, 3) as a state-set amount for money-losing enterprises, or 4)
 as an enterprise-set amount subject to Labor Ministry review. Individual enterprises
 determine how to divide the total among workers, a decision usually made by the
 enterprise manager in consultation with the enterprise party chief and the ACFTU
 representative. In practice, however, only a small number of workers with high tech-
 nical skills can negotiate effectively on salary and fringe benefits.
 Worker congresses, which are held once or twice a year, have been established
 in over 300,000 enterprises. The congresses are now involved in examining enter-
 prises' reform plans and in promoting or dismissing factory leaders. A number of
 provincial ACFTU chairmen have -called for further strengthening the power of the
 congresses-particularly on the sale and merger of enterprises. The congresses are
 attended either by all enterprise employees or their representatives. Since 1989
 ACFTU leaders have attempted to make worker congresses more responsive to the
 basic welfare concerns of ordinary workers and reduced the emphasis on purely ide-
 ological concerns.
 However, the use of these rights varies widely. Many worker congresses continue
 to act largely as rubber stamps for deals hammered out by the manager, union rep-
 resentative, and the party secretary. In smaller enterprises it is not unusual to find
 these three posts held by the same person. The Trade Union Law prohibits
 antiunion discrimination and specifies that union representatives may not be trans-
 ferred or terminated by enterprise management during their term of office. Union-
 ized foreign businesses generally report pragmatic relations with ACFTU represent-
 atives.
 
 
 Laws governing working conditions in special economic zones (SEZ's) are not Sig-
 nificantly different from those in the rest of the country. However, wages in the
 SEZ's and in southeastern China generally, are significantly higher than in other
 parts of the country because high investment has created a great demand for avail-
 able labor. As in other areas of the country, officials admit that some foreign inves-
 tors in SEZ's are able to negotiate "sweethear' deals with local partners that effec-
 tively bypass labor regulations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is a problem. Some
 penal facilities contract with regular industries for prisoners to perform manufactur-
 ing and assembly work. In 1991 the Government published a reiteration of its regu-
 lations barring the export of prison-made goods. These regulations have not been
 enforced effectively. In 1998 there were reports that Adidas World Cup soccer balls
 were produced for export by prisons in the Shanghai area. A request for investiga-
 tion of the allegations was made to the Government in October; there has been no
 response to date.
 In 1992 the U.S. and Chinese Governments signed a Memorandum of Under-
 standing (MOU) prohibiting trade in prison labor products. A statement of coopera-
 tion (SOC) detailing specific working procedures for implementation of the MOU
 was signed in 1994. Although the signing of the SOC initially helped foster a more
 productive relationship between U.S. Customs and Chinese authorities, cooperation
 overall has been inadequate- In 1998 U.S. Customs unsuccessfully pursued eight
 standing requests-seven of them dating back to at least 1995-to visit sites sus-
 pected of exporting prison labor products. Customs also referred three new inves-
 tigative requests during the year to the authorities. In all the cases, the Ministry
 of Justice refused the request, ignored it, or simply denied the allegations made
 without further elaboration.
 In addition to prisons and reform-through-labor facilities, which hold inmates sen-
 tenced through judicial procedures, the Government also maintains a network of re-
 education-through-labor camps, where inmates are sentenced, without judicial re-
 view, through administrative procedures (see Section i.e.). Inmates of reeducation-
 through-labor facilities generally are required to work, and there have been reports
 that products made in these facilities are exported. The Government has taken the
 position that the facilities are not prisons and has denied access to them under the
 1992 prison labor MOU with the United States. Credible reports from international
 human rights organizations and the foreign press indicate that some persons in pre-
 trial detention also are required to work.
 Most anecdotal reports conclude that work conditions in the penal system's light
 manufacturing factories are similar to those in other factories, but conditions on the
 penal systems farms and in mines can be very harsh. As in many workplaces, safety
 is a low priority. There are no available figures for deaths and injuries in prison
 industries.
 Trafficking in women, and the kidnaping and sale of women and children for pros-
 titution is a problem (see Section 5).
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces the
 prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Na-
 tional Labor Law specifies that "no employing unit shall be allowed to recruit juve-
 niles under the age of 16," 2 years above the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 standard of 14 years for developing countries. Administrative review, fines, and rev-
 ocation of business licenses of those businesses that hire minors are specified in the
 Labor Law. The law also provides for children to receive 9 years of compulsory 'edu-
 cation and to receive their subsistence from parents or guardians. Laborers between
 the ages of 16 and 18 are referred to as "juvenile workers," and are prohibited from
 engaging in certain forms of physical work, including labor in mines.
 Neither the ILO nor UNICEF believe that there is a significant child labor prob-
 lem in the formal sector. Good public awareness, a cheap, abundant supply of legal
 young adult workers, nearly universal primary schooling, and labor law enforcement
 all serve to reduce opportunities and incentives to hire child workers. In view of this
 ample supply of adult laborers, most employers choose not to risk fines and possible
 arrest by iring underage workers. Furthermore, many foreign businesses m more
 developed areas follow codes of conduct that set standards for labor conditions and
 provide for independent inspections. However, in poorer, isolated areas child labor
 in agriculture is widespread.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces the
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law codifies many of the general
 principles of labor reform, setting out provisions on employment, labor contracts,
 working hours, wages, skill development and training, social insurance, dispute res-
 
 
 olution, legal responsibility, supervision, and inspection. There is no national mini-
 mum wage; the Labor Law allows local governments to determine their own stand-
 ards on minimum wages. In general, minimum wage level determinations are high-
 er than the local poverty relief ceiling but lower than the current wage level of the
 average worker. In general minimum wages are sufficient to provide a decent stand-
 ard of living for a worker and family. The growing problem of unemployment has
 diverted attention to discussion of minimum standard of living allowances. There
 were no media reports of increasing wages during the year.
 In April the Government announced that 400 of the country's 600 cities had estab-
 lished a system to ensure a minimum standard of living. The Government expects
 this system to be in effect nationwide by the end of 1999. Government officials esti-
 mate that over 6 million people would qualify for benefits under this new system.
 The minimum standard of living varies from region to region. In Beijing the mini-
 mum per capita income was set at $24 (200 rmb) per month. In addition to this sti-
 pend, families living below the poverty line are eligible for subsidized food, medical
 services, housing, and funds to enable school-age children to complete the compul-
 sory education program. Shenyang, the largest city in northeast China, has set the
 per capita monthly income at $18.25 (150 rmb). In east China's Zhejiang province,
 the minimum standard of living is set on a sliding scale ranging from $0.76 to $20
 per family member (6.3 to 165 mb). According to the State Statistical Bureau the
 annual per capita disposable income of Chinese urban residents in 1997 was $620
 (5,133 rmb) an increase of 3.4 percent in real terms from 1996. The net income of
 rural residents was $251 (2,078 rmb), an increase of 4.6 percent in real terms from
 the previous year. Official figures for the first three-quarters of 1998 indicate that
 while urban incomes are continuing to increase, rural incomes are decreasing, wid-
 ening the already large gap between the living standards of the 900 million peas-
 ants and those of urban workers. The ratio between average incomes in coastal
 provinces and interior provinces has been estimated credibly to be 12 to 1.
 The Government reduced the national standard workweek in 1995 from 44 hours
 to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The Labor Law mandates a 24-hour rest period
 weekly and does not allow overtime work in excess of 3 hours a day or 36 hours
 a month. It also sets forth a required scale of remuneration for overtime work. En-
 forcement of regulations governing overtime work varies according to region and
 type of enterprise.
 Occupational health and safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns.
 Every work unit must designate a health and safety officer, and the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) has established a training program for these officials.
 Nonethaless, there is a high rate of industrial accidents, with most of the accidents
 occurring in the mining sector. According to a report released in June by the
 MOLSS and the State Statistical Bureau, there was a drop in the number of indus-
 trial accidents in 1997. However, official figures indicate that in fact there was an
 increase in the total number of accidents when compared with the official figures
 reported in 1996. In 1996 there were 18,181 industrial accidents, compared with
 18,268 in 1997. Nonetheless, there was a decrease in accidents in the mining indus-
 try, which had 7,226 accidents, resulting in the deaths of 11,625 miners. In 1997,
 119,000 persons died as a result of pneumoconiosis, a common disease among min-
 ers, which is caused by inhaling too much dust. Less than half of rural enterprises
 meet national dust and poison standards. Many factories that use harmful products,
 such as asbestos, fail not only to protect their workers against the ill effects of such
 products, but also to inform them about the potential hazards.
 Poor enforcement by local officials of occupational safety and health regulations
 continues to put workers' lives at risk. The Government's attempts to improve work
 conditions have been inadequate. Existing safety regulations are inadequately en-
 forced and a large number of unlicensed mines operated at the local level. Work
 safety issues have attracted-the attention of senior government leaders. MOLSS offi-
 cials, aware of the extremely poor mine safety record, have been seeking to expand
 foreign cooperation on mine safety. Additionally, the Government continues to work
 with the ILO on worker safety issues. The MOLSS announced in April that new
 technologies and facilities would be introduced to supplement legal and educational
 measures in order to control dust pollution in mines.
 Although the Constitution does not provide for the right to strike, the Trade
 Union Law explicitly recognizes the right of unions to "suggest that staff and work-
 ers withdraw from sites of danger" and participate in accident investigations. How-
 ever, it is unclear, to what extent workers actually can remove themselves from
 such dangerous situations without risking loss of employment.
