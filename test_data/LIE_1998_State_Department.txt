 LIECHTENSTEIN
 The Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy. The reigning Prince is the head of state; all legislation enacted by the
 popularly elected Parliament (Landtag) must have his concurrence. The Landtag
 elects and the Prince appoints the members of the Government and of the independ-
 ent judiciary.
 The Interior Ministry effectively oversees the regular and auxiliary police forces.
 There is no standing military force.
 Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed
 during recent decades from an agrarian society into a prosperous, highly industri-
 alized, free-enterprise economy with a vital service sector. It participates in a cus-
 toms union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency.
 Liechtenstein is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA). Citizens enjoy a.
 very high standard of living. Unemployment was only 1.5 percent in 1998.
 The Government respects the human rights of its citizens provided for in the Con-
 stitution, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individ-
 ual instances of abuse. The Government is working to eliminate societal discrimina-
 tion against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMZAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other cruel punishment, and there were no reports
 of the use of such methods.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest and detention, and the authorities honor these provisions. Within 24
 hours of arrest, the police must bring suspects before an examining magistrate, who
 must either file formal charges or order release. The law grants suspects the right
 to legal counsel of their own choosing, at no cost if they are indigent. Release on
 personal recognizance or bail is granted unless the examining magistrate has reason
 to believe the suspects are a danger to society or will not appear for trial.
 There is no provision for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The judicial system has three tiers: Lower court, high court, and Supreme
 Court. In addition, an Administrative Court hears appeals against government deci-
 sions. Also, the State Court protects the rights accorded by the Constitution, decides
 on conflicts of jurisdiction between the law courts and the administrative authori-
 ties, and acts as a disciplinary court for members of the Government.
 The Constitution provides for public trials and judicial appeal, and the authorities
 respect these provisions.
 The Constitution authorizes the Prince to alter criminal sentences or pardon of-
 fenders. However, if the offender is a member of the Government and is sentenced
 for a crime in connection with official duties, the Prince can take such action only
 if the Parliament requests it.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for personal liberty and for inviolability of the home, postal
 correspondence, and telephone conversations. No violations were reported. Police
 need a judicial warrant to search private property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, an effective judiciary,
 and a democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the
 press. Two daily newspapers are published, each representing the interests of one
 of the two major political parties, as is one weekly newsmagazine. There is one state
 and one private television station and a private radio station, but residents freely
 receive radio and television broadcasts from neighboring countries. An information
 bulletin is also issued by the third party (Freie Liste) represented in Parliament.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the authorities do not interfere with these
 rights in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith. The finances of
 the Roman Catholic Church are integrated directly into the budgets of the national
 and local governments. Roman Catholic or Protestant religious education is compul-
 sory in all schools, but the authorities routinely grant exemptions for children whose
 parents so request.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have unrestricted freedom to travel in or outside the country,
 to emigrate, and to return.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 The Government provides first asylum, but the country's lack of an airport or
 international train station means that it receives few requests. However, since pas-
 sage of an asylum law in July, the number of requests has increased. Those persons
 who enter from Austria without permission are still returned to Austrian authorities
 in accordance with a bilateral agreement.
 The Government granted asylum to all 18 of the Tibetans who entered the coun-
 try in 1993; of 139 refugees from the former Yugoslavia, 50 received temporary resi-
 dence permits on humanitarian grounds and 89 were told to leave expeditiously in
 order to avoid forced repatriation. The latter group planned to appeal this decision.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. The
 monarchy is hereditary in the male line. The 25-member unicameral legislature is
 elected every 4 years. Suffrage is universal for adults over age 20, and balloting is

 secret. Political parties operate freely. Citizens regularly vote on initiatives and
 referenda.
 Since women gained the right to vote, a growing number have been active in poli-
 tics. One woman, the Foreign Minister, is among the five members of the Cabinet,
 and one is a member of Parliament Women serve on the executive committees of
 the major parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 International and domestic human rights groups operate without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Govern-
 ment officials are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 The sole local human rights organization, Justitia Et Pax, is an informal group
 of about 10 persons who monitor prison conditions and assist foreign workers with
 immigration matters.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, language, or social status,
 and the authorities respect these provisions. The law also prohibits public incite-
 ment to violence or public agitation-or insult directed against a race, people, ethnic
 group, or state.
 Women.-The law prohibits all forms of domestic violence, and the Government
 vigorously enforces the law. There is one shelter, which provided refuge for 14
 abused women in the first half of 1997, only 4 of whom were citizens. In 1998 the
 Government supported the shelter with about $180,000 (250,000 Swiss francs). In
 1997 the government Bureau for the Promotion of Equal Rights for Women and Men
 started an antiviolence campaign, focusing especially on public violence, such as sex-
 ual harassment in the workplace, as well as on violence in relationships. The cam-
 paign fostered widespread public awareness.
 Societal discrimination still limits opportuities for women in fields traditionally
 dominated by men. On the aggregate level, men earn more than women. However,
 it is unclear if this fact represents overt discrimination. In accordance with a 1992
 constitutional amendment mandating equality for women, Parliament has amended
 a significant number of laws to provi   or equality of treatment. Among other
 things, Parliament has revised the citizenship law, the employment law, the law on
 labor conditions, and the tax law. The process of amending laws to ensure equality
 of treatment is almost complete.
 There are three active women's rights groups. Their chief concerns are public af-
 fairs, information, legal counseling, lobbying, and other political activities on behalf
 of women's rights.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. The Government provides compulsory, free, and universal primary school edu-
 cation for children of both sexes for 9 years, normally until the age of 16.
 The Government supports programs to protect the rights of children and matches
 contributions made to    our nongovernmental organizations monitoring children's
 rights. A children and youth service belonging to the Office for Social Services over-
 sees the implementation of government-supported programs for children.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the law does not expressly prohibit discrimi-
 nation against people with disabilities, complaints of such discrimination may be
 pursued in the courts. Amendments to the law on insurance for the disabled, which
 were intended to improve the economic situation of disabled persons, came into force
 in 1997.
 The Government requires that buildings and government services be made acces-
 sible for people with disabilities, but in general they are not, particularly old build-
 ings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, including foreigners, are free to associ-
 ate, join unions of their-choice, and select their own union representatives. Due to
 the country's small size and population, only one trade union operates, representing
 about 13 percent of the work force. However, the trade union looks after the inter-
 ests of nonmembers as well. It is a member of the World Confederation of Labor
 but is represented on an ad hoc basis by a Swiss union.
 Workers have the right to strike except in certain essential services. There were
 no reported strikes during the year. The law does not provide specific protection for
 those who strike. Employers may dismiss employees for refusal to work; such dis-
 
 
 1364
 
 missals may be contested. In 1997 the Government incorporated European Economic
 Area guidelines into labor law legislation that subsequently came into force. These
 guidelines require that, among other things, employers enter into consultations in
 cases of projected mass dismissals and submit employment contracts in written
 form.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 of workers to organize and bargain collectively. However, collective bargaining
 agreements are generally adapted from ones negotiated by Swiss employers and
 unions.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there were no reports of violations. Except by implication, the law
 does not specifically forbid forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices
 are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such
 practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). The law generally prohibits em-
 ployment of children under 16 years of age. However, exceptions may be made, for
 the limited employment of youths at least age 14 and for those who leave school
 after completing their 9 years of compulsory education. Children ages 14 and older
 may be employed in light duties for not more than 9 hours a week during the school
 year and 15 hours a week at other times.
 Inspections are adequate. No employers have been fined or imprisoned for viola-
 tions of the law. The Government devotes adequate resources and oversight to child
 labor policies. The Department for Worker Safety of the Office of the National Econ-
 omy effectively supervises compliance with the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but even
 the lowest actual wages afford a decent standard of living for workers and their
 families. The law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours for white-collar workers
 and employees of industrial fn-ms and sales personnel, and 48 hours for all other
 workers. With few exceptions, Sunday work is not allowed. Workers over age 20 re-
 ceive at least 4 weeks of vacation; younger ones, at least 5 weeks.
 The law sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Department for
 Worker Safety of the Office of the National Economy effectively enforces these provi-
 sions. The law provides for a hearing in cases in which workers remove themselves
 from dangerous situations.
