 WESTERN SAMOA
 
 The political system of Western Samoan is based upon the
 British pattern of parliamentary democracy, modified to take
 Samoan customs into account. The position of head of state, a
 role patterned after the British monarchy, is now occupied by
 Malietoa Tanumafili II, who will hold the position for life.
 According to the Constitution, future heads of state are to be
 elected by the Legislative Assembly for five-year terms. The
 head of state appoints as Prime Minister the elected member of
 the Legislative Assembly who commands majority support in the
 Assembly. The Prime Minister heads the Government, and with
 his advice, the head of state appoints the members of cabinet.
 The Prime Minister and cabinet hold office as long as they
 retain the confidence of the Legislative Assembly. The
 Assembly has 47 members elected for three-year terms.
 Western Samoa lies in the Pacific Ocean approximately 1600
 miles northeast of New Zealand. Most of its population of
 approximately 158,000 lives on two main islands. After more
 than forty years of U.N. Trusteeship and League of Nations
 mandate rule by New Zealand, Western Samoa became independent
 on January 1, 1962. It still maintains a formal treaty
 relationship with New Zealand. Apia, with a population of
 35,000, is the capital and commercial center and the only major
 city in the country. Samoans, a Polynesian people, have tended
 to retain their traditional ways based upon the "aiga," or
 extended family group, headed by a "matai," or chief. The
 title of "matai" is conferred by consensus of the "aiga" upon
 any eligible member of the group, including women. The "matai"
 is responsible for the general welfare of the "aiga" and
 directs the use of family lands and other assets, in addition
 to representing the "aiga" in village and district councils.
 There were no significant human rights problems in the area of
 personal integrity in Western Samoa during 1983, and the
 traditional government and social system appeared to provide
 essential elements of civil and political rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Killing for political motives, whether by the Government or by
 opposition political organizations, does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no secret arrests, clandestine detentions, or
 abductions in Western Samoa.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel or degrading treatment or punishment are
 prohibited by law in Western Samoa and are not inflicted in
 practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no political prisoners. There are full and effective
 legal safeguards of internationally recognized rights in this
 area.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Western Samoan law guarantees the right to a fair public trial,
 and this right is honored. All charges are stated formally and
 clearly, defendants are entitled to counsel, and assessors are
 provided to assist in cases involving traditional matters.
 There are no special courts to deal with political or security
 offenses, and the judiciary is independent of Government
 interference or influence.
 Those arrested are charged promptly, normally within
 twenty-four hours. Most arrests occur for relatively minor
 offenses, and terms of sentence are short.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the privacy of its population and does
 not permit arbitrary interference with the family, home, or
 correspondence. Both law and local custom provide for the
 protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property
 without substantive and procedural safeguards, including search
 warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Included as part of the fundamental rights in the Constitution
 are the freedoms of speech and expression; these rights are
 respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right to assemble peacefully
 without arms and to form associations or unions, and there are
 no significant restrictions. A strong trade union movement has
 not developed, although the public service has an employees
 organization which engages in collective bargaining. The
 Government has permitted efforts to develop unions within the
 country, and the courts have upheld the rights to strike and
 enter into arbitration.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Guaranteed within the Constitution is the right of every person
 to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This includes
 the right to change one's religion or belief and to worship or
 teach religion either alone or with others, in public or
 private. These rights are respected. Nearly 100 percent of
 the population is Christian, of which about half is associated
 with the London Missionary Society. Approximately 40 percent
 is equally divided between the Roman Catholic and Methodist
 churches, and the rest belong to smaller denominations. There
 is no government-favored religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees to all citizens of Western Samoa
 the right to move freely throughout the country and to change
 residence. They are also free to travel abroad, and the rights
 of emigration and repatriation are respected. Western Samoa
 has not generated any refugees, and none from other countries
 are known to reside there.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Western Samoa's Government is based upon the British
 parliamentary system with power vested in the Prime Minister and
 the Legislative Assembly. The "matai" of the country elect 45
 Assembly members who are themselves "matai", while two Assembly
 members are elected by universal suffrage by those citizens who
 are not Samoan by heritage. When a "matai" seeks election to the
 Legislative Assembly, he or she campaigns throughout the
 constituency, knowing that members of other extended family
 groups will influence the voting of their "matai." "Matai"
 traditionally consult with the extended family they have been
 chosen to represent before making decisions for the group.
 The "matai" system is a predominately conservative force, but
 does allow change. The number of "matai" titles, approximately
 12,000, has doubled since the country's independence. While
 Samoans must show respect and obedience to their "matai" in
 family and communal affairs, the "matai" also have well-defined
 responsibilities toward their family groups. If these
 responsibilities are not met, a "matai" can be removed and a new
 "matai" elected to the position.
 In the past Samoa did not have organized political parties;
 members of the Legislative Assembly rallied around leading
 personalities, and the personality receiving the majority support
 of Assembly members became Prime Minister. In the 1982
 elections, several candidates formed the Human Rights Protection
 Party which now governs, headed by Prime Minister Tofilau Eti.
 Members of the Assembly who oppose the Government are not
 formally organized as a party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests for human rights investigations have been made to the
 Western Samoan Government, nor have human rights organizations
 found cause for comment or special reporting on Western Samoa.
 Although the governing party calls itself the "Human Rights
 Protection Party," it functions as a political party rather than
 as an organization devoted solely to the protection of human
 rights. There are no non-governmental human rights
 organizations. Amnesty International did not express concern
 about conditions in Western Samoa in its 1983 report, and Freedom
 House called Western Samoa "partly free".
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Western Samoa continues to import more than it exports, thus
 creating a critical balance-of-payments problem. The Government
 is implementing an austerity program to curb domestic demand,
 restrain imports, and cut inflationary pressures.
 Except in the capital, land is communally owned by extended
 family groups. Ninety percent of the work force is engaged in
 agriculture, cultivating both subsistence and cash crops. Per
 capita income estimates range from $400.00 to t450.00 per year
 for the population of 158,000. In 1977 the calorie supply as a
 percent of requirements was 82.94 percent.

 Life expectancy at birth is approximately 63 years. Health
 standards are good, and adequate medical care is available.
 Education is compulsory for all children from seven to fifteen
 years, and primary school enrollment ratios exceed 94 percent.
 This dedication to education is evident in the literacy rate,
 which exceeds 97 percent.
 The Constitution affords the same rights to all persons
 regardless of sex. While women have been active in the
 Legislative Assembly, other public offices, and community
 affairs, they are generally under-represented in proportion to
 their population. One of Samoa's four highest chiefs is a
 woman.
