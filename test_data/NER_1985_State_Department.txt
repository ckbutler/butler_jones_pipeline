 NIGER
 Niger is governed by an authoritarian military regime with
 power concentrated in the hands of its President, General
 Seyni Kountche, who heads the nation's highest body, the
 Supreme Military Council. Kountche took power in 1974 in a
 military coup, toppling the civilian regime of Hamani Diori.
 At that time, the Constitution was suspended and Kountche has
 ruled by decree ever since. Freedoms of assembly, speech, and
 political activity are restricted. Public dissent is
 nonexistent, and private dissent tends to be rare for fear of
 retribution. Nigeriens, however, may pursue their own
 economic interests and hold private property. The Government
 is proceeding cautiously with the implementation of the
 National Development Society, which many believe will lead to
 greater civilian involvement in economic decisionmaking.
 Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, occupies a large
 area in the arid Sahel region of West Africa. The economy
 hinges on subsistence farming and livestock and some of the
 world's largest uranium deposits. However, severe drought and
 declining world demand for uranium since the early 1980's have
 had a serious negative impact on the Nigerien economy. During
 1985, the Government was preoccupied with the massive
 logistical effort required to distribute food aid to the many
 areas of Niger where people faced starvation as a result of
 the disastrous 1984 harvest.
 The human rights situation in Niger did not improve in 1985.
 In response to an armed attack by Tuareg dissidents on an
 administrative post at Tchin-Tabaraden in late May, during
 which 1 Tuareg and 2 soldiers were killed, the Government
 arrested about 1,000 ethnic Tuaregs in Niamey. On June 6, the
 Government expelled over 200 Malian and Mauritanian Tuaregs.
 Former President Diori was put back under the house arrest
 from which he had been released in April 1984, and
 restrictions were placed on nighttime travel in Niger as a
 result of the same incident. In July, a state/security court
 tried 11 Tuaregs arrested at Tchin-Tabaraden and condemned at
 least 8 of them to death. The death sentences are not
 believed to have been carried out. An undetermined number of
 detainees are still being held in connection with the October
 1983 coup attempt.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the integrity of the person, including
 freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports in 1985 of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported during 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Systematic torture of detainees and prisoners is not believed
 to take place in Niger. Cruel treatment usually in the form
 of physical beatings has taken place, however, as the result
 of overzealousness on the part of officials charged with
 handling political prisoners. Many of the Tuaregs detained in
 early June in reaction to the Tchin-Tabaraden affair were
 
 
 232
 NIGER
 beaten, and several are reported to have died in detention.
 One political prisoner, a former member of an opposition group
 based in Europe, is reported by witnesses, who have seen him
 in detention, to have been beaten regularly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 With the Constitution suspended since 1974, there are no
 specific statutory protections against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment, nor does habeas corpus exist. Warrants are not
 required for an arrest. In cases concerning political or
 security related matters, detainees can be held indefinitely
 without charge, as in the case of the detainees who are still
 awaiting trial from the October 1983 coup attempt. When the
 Government believes the national security to be at risk, large
 groups of citizens may be rounded up arbitrarily for
 questioning, as with the roundup of Tuaregs in Niamey after
 the Tchin-Tabaraden attack. In that instance, over 1,000
 Tuaregs were detained on the basis of their ethnicity. The
 majority of the detainees were released, but only after
 several days of detention in crowded, unsanitary conditions.
 For criminal offenses, the law holds that detainees must be
 charged within 48 hours, but delays sometimes occur as the
 result of a lack of trained, competent legal officials.
 Forced labor is not practiced in Niger, but during the 1985
 drought emergency, displaced herders, primarily ethnic Tuaregs
 and Fulanis, were in some instances forcibly moved onto
 government-sponsored vegetable growing projects. There are no
 known instances of dissidents or political opponents being
 exiled by the Kountche Government, although some dissidents
 have voluntarily gone into exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are an estimated 30 political prisoners in Niger,
 including the detainees from the October 1983 coup attempt and
 the 11 Tuaregs detained in connection with the Tchin-Tabaraden
 affair. It is also believed that political prisoners are
 rarely allowed visits from family members. However, political
 prisoners with severe medical problems have been allowed
 treatment by specialists from Europe, and in one recent
 instance a prisoner was evacuated to Europe for the treatment
 of a life-threatening illness.
 There are public trials for civil and criminal cases not
 involving political or security-related acts. Legal counsel
 is provided for indigent defendants accused of felonies or
 other major offenses if they are under 18 years of age,
 handicapped, or face the possibility of a sentence of more
 than 10 years. While there are reliable accounts that courts
 in some specific cases have been subject to political
 influence or pressure in ordinary civil or criminal cases, the
 judicial system is believed to be generally independent and
 fair. Defendants may appeal verdicts first to an Appellate
 Court and, if desired, to the nation's highest tribunal, the
 State Court, composed of civilian magistrates, which serves in
 the capacity of a final court of appeals. The President has
 the right of pardon in penal cases and invoked this right
 twice during 1985. On April 1, the llth anniversary of
 Kountche's accession to power, 123 prisoners were pardoned.
 An additional 238 were pardoned or had their sentences reduced
 on the occasion of the Id-el-Fitr Islamic holiday. At the
 village level, matters such as property disputes are
 
 
 233
 NIGER
 frequently resolved by traditional means without reference to
 the legal system.
 Operating outside of the traditional legal framework is the
 state security court, which tries political and security
 related cases. This body meets in secret and little is known
 about its proceedings, but it is believed that its members are
 military officers. This court tried the 11 Tuaregs from the
 Tchin-Tabaraden. affair in July, and is reportedly finally
 making preparations to try the prisoners detained after the
 October 1983 coup attempt.
 In early June, President Kountche announced the formation of a
 special court to investigate civil service corruption. The
 investigation has been proceeding throughout 1985.
 Reportedly, stiff penalties will be assessed, including the
 death penalty for convictions of embezzlements of amounts over
 $500,000.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The police have the right to enter homes between 5 a.m. and 9
 p.m. and will enter at other times if deemed necessary. Many
 of the Tuaregs rounded up in Niamey in early June were removed
 forcibly from their homes. Court warrants are not required in
 such instances. Violations of privacy such as interference
 with correspondence, telephone tapping, and use of informer
 networks are known to take place. The Government used strong
 measures in 1985 in forcibly resettling some elements of the
 population as part of the official strategy for dealing with
 the drought.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are very restricted. Institutions which might
 voice dissent, such as a free press or a freely elected
 legislature, do not exist. The media are controlled by the
 Government. While some criticism of government policy or
 bureaucratic inefficiency is allowed, especially in the
 relatively new Sunday Sahel, such criticism is expressed with
 the knowledge or at the behest of the Government. Debates on
 aspects of the economy or cultural policy sometimes take place
 in the media, but the boundries of permissible discussion are
 well understood in advance by all participants. The primary
 functions of the media are to disseminate government policies
 and viewpoints and to rally popular support for government
 programs and leading figures such as the President. Nigerien
 journalists are acutely aware of their status as government
 employees and of the guidelines within which they must
 operate. Journalists whom the Government believes have
 strayed from these guidelines have been demoted, fired, or
 otherwise disciplined. Full academic freedom does not exist.
 There have been no reports of censored or banned magazines or
 other publications, but the Government is under no constraints
 should it discover material that it deems offensive. Foreign
 films are subject to censorship by the Ministry of Interior on
 the grounds of public morality and political content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except for political parties, most forms of voluntary
 association, such as trade unions, churches, and other 4
 
 
 234
 NIGER
 eligious groups are allowed to function with the understanding
 that they do so in accordance with government policy. Public
 meetings of such organizations are usually allowed, but the
 Government is not obliged by law to permit such activity. Its
 permission is required for public gatherings.
 The trade union movement is controlled and partially financed
 by the Government. All unions are organized under a
 government-controlled umbrella group, the National Union of
 Nigerien Workers (USTN). The head of the USTN is appointed by
 the Government. Th USTN represents approximately 30 percent
 of the approximately 60,000 salaried workers in Niger. The
 group is poorly financed partly because of government refusal
 to allow fund raising methods such as a paycheck checkoff
 system. Lower level elections in the USTN are believed to be
 fairly democratic. Strikes in Niger are rare. The
 confederation maintains relations with recognized
 international bodies and sends representatives to
 international meetings. It is a member of the Accra-based
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is overwhelmingly Muslim, but Christian churches are
 allowed to operate freely. Conversion from one religion to
 another is riot prohibited but occurs only rarely. Foreign
 missionaries are permitted to live, work, and travel in
 Niger. There have been no reports of religious
 discrimination, but adherence to Islam tends to give one an
 advantage in all sectors of life. The Government, cautious
 because of the Islamic fundamentalist violence which erupts
 periodically in northern Nigeria, monitors religious activity
 through the Islamic association which is funded by the
 Government. Local religious leaders are subject to an
 informal government screening process and Islamic services
 that have gone beyond strictly religious subjects have been
 shut down by the Government. Religious groups are allowed to
 maintain links with coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger is closely monitored, although no special
 travel documents are required for domestic travel. Police
 checks, often entailing thorough searches, take place upon
 entering or leaving any major town or city. These controls
 became more stringent in June as part of the Government's
 reaction to the Tchin-Tabaraden incident. At the same time,
 the Government imposed a de facto 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew on
 internal travel and on entering Niger from neighboring
 countries. These measures reflect a governmental
 preoccupation with smuggling as well as concern over possible
 movements into the country of foreign-based dissidents or
 criminal elements. Moreover, the Government uses these
 measures to discourage migration to urban areas. Nigeriens
 wishing to travel abroad must obtain exit visas, which are
 usually granted routinely. Married women must have the
 permission of their husbands to travel abroad. The
 repatriation of Nigerien nationals is unrestricted. In May
 1985, the Government of Niger efficiently resettled
 approximately 10,000 Nigeriens who were expelled from
 neighboring Nigeria. A few refugees from other countries have
 been accepted. Niger is a signatory to the UN Convention and
 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.

 NIGER
 Section 3 *Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The capacity of the people to influence the Government is
 extremely limited. Virtually all power is held by the
 President, General Seyni Kountche. He rules through the
 Supreme Military Council which is made up of officers who
 helped stage the 1974 coup that toppled the previous civilian
 regime. Kountche rules by decree, makes all government
 appointments, and controls the pace of political change and
 economic development. Government operations are conducted
 largely by civilian technocrats who implement decisions
 promulgated by the Supreme Military Council and Kountche
 himself. The President derives his power from the military.
 While all but three of the ministerial positions have passed
 from military to civilian hands in recent years, all of
 Niger's seven departments have military governors, who have
 virtually autocratic powers within their departments.
 Moreover, there is a marked military presence in the upper
 echelons of the National Development Society.
 In lieu of a party system, the Kountche Government since 1979
 has been organizing the National Development Society which in
 theory will lead to greater popular participation in economic
 decisionmaking. The Society consists of a hierarchical
 network of councils at the village, regional, departmental,
 and national levels. The councils consist of elected and
 appointed members although only at the village level are
 members elected directly by the people. The national level
 council consists of Nigeriens from all walks of life, who also
 serve on special committees considering various aspects of
 economic development, cultural policy, and social issues, One
 such committee is writing a national charter which, it is
 believed, will serve as the basis for a new constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Niger is not active in regional and international human rights
 organizations. Over the past few years, inquiries from
 international human rights organizations have apparently been
 ignored by the Government. There are no domestic groups which
 monitor the human rights situation in Niger. Amnesty
 International, in its 1985 Report, expressed concern about the
 detention without trial of suspected opponents of the
 Government. Freedom House rates Niger "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Niger's population of 6,491,000 is growing at the rate of 3.4
 percent and lives at no more than a subsistence level.
 Roughly 90 percent of Niger's workforce is employed in some
 form of agriculture or herding. A combination of extensive
 drought and prolonged slump in the world uranium market has
 seriously affected the economy. Gross national product per
 capita was only $240 in 1983.
 Infant mortality is 134 deaths per 1,000 live births. Life
 expectancy at birth is 46 years. On the average, Nigeriens
 receive 94 percent of daily nutritional requirements (1977
 estimate). A 1975 estimate showed that only 33 percent of the
 population had access to safe water, (41 percent urban, 32
 percent rural), but this figure is believed to hAve improved
 
 
 236
 NIGER
 in recent years, thanks to a large-scale government
 well-drilling program. Other social indicators are also low.
 The adult literacy rate was 10 percent in 1980 (male 14
 percent, female 6 percent). In 1981, the primary school
 enrollment ratio was 25 percent, with a large bias in favor of
 males (32 percent) compared to females (17 percent).
 Under the Niger labor code, workers receive benefits for on
 the job injury, leave for family emergencies, and health
 benefits. Annual holidays and leave benefits are clearly
 spelled out. Children between the ages of 12 and 18 may be
 employed, but there are strict provisions concerning the hours
 of employment and types of employment for children in this age
 group. All labor provisions, especially those concerning
 child labor, apply in practice only to urban areas. In the
 agricultural sector, which employs most Nigeriens, children
 work on family plots under conditions which exceed the
 provisions of the labor code.
 The essentially traditional nature of society helps ensure
 that family and ethnic group ties remain strong and
 supportive, but traditional practices and attitudes on
 ethnicity, women, and education have some negative effects.
 Males have considerable advantages in terms of education,
 employment, and property rights. In case of divorce, custody
 of all children under eight years of age is given to the
 husband. Conscious of this situation, the Government has made
 progress in improving the status of women by launching work on
 a new family code, by providing better employment
 opportunities to women, by giving them a significant role in
 the National Development Society, and by supporting the
 National Women's Association. In 1985, the Government
 undertook a major initiative to encourage Nigeriens to use
 birth control.
 Four major ethnic groups, each with its own language, make up
 the bulk of the population. The two primarily nomadic groups,
 Tuaregs and Fulani (Peul), have less access to government
 services, partly because their transient lifestyles make it
 difficult for the Government to supply them with services and
 partly because of historical animosities between the nomads
 and the sedentary Djerma and Hausa ethnic groups which
 dominate the Government. Such animosities undoubtedly
 contributed to a slowness on the part of some government
 officials in 1985 to guarantee that adequate quantities of
 food relief reached isolated Tuareg and Fulani populations.
