 HALDI-VES
 The Reppblic of Maldives has a parliamentary system headed by
 a strong president. There are no political parties, and
 candidates for the unicameral legislature, the Majlis, run for
 office as individuals. The Majlis selects a single nominee
 for presidentA who is subsequently approved or rejected by the
 voters. All citizens over age 21 may vote. In practice,
 government control in "this -small, homogeneous society is
 exercised by a small elite with a common background and
 outlook, whose-authority is generally and traditionally
 accepted by the population.
 The Maldiyes is a nation of 1,200 islands in 19 atolls
 scattered across an area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in
 the Indian Ocean. The isolation of individual island
 communities from each other, and of the Republic as a whole
 -from the rest of the world, is a dominant feature of social
 and economic life. It is one-of the world's least-developed
 countries, with nearly half the population engaged in
 traditional activities such as fishing, harvesting and
 processing of-coconut-s, and small-scale farming.
 The Maldives-,as not been subject to attack or invasion from
 outside for hundreds of years, and thus sees no need for a
 large defense establishment. The country's 800-1,000 strong
 national security service is responsible for maintaining
 internal law and order, protecting the President, defending
 the country, 4nd preventing foreign fishermen from encroaching
 on Maldivian fishing grounds. The police division of the
 service investigates crims, makes arrests, and enforces house
 arrest.
 There was little change in the human rights situation during
 1987. Virtually universal adherence to Islam, the innate
 conservatism of a traditional society, and the high degree of
 homogeneity of the Maldivian people all underlie the relative
 absence of prepsures for social and political change. The
 authority of the small ruling elite is widely accepted, and
 open dissent is rare.
 RESPECT-FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section, 1 Respect fpr the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings i-n 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in.1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The 196 Constitution stipulates that "under no condition"
 shall a torture considered to be injurious be inflicted upon
 any person.
 Maldivians follow Shaxi'a or Islamic law, and occasionally
 convicted criminals are flogged. Usually, however, punishment
 is confined to less physical means such as fines, payment of
 
 
 1239
 14ALDIVES
 compensation, house arrest, imprisonment, or banishment to a
 sparsely populated island where the prisoner must labor to
 earn his daily keep.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution .requires that 'no person shall be apprehended
 or arrested, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or
 (civil) law." There is no provision under Maldivian law for
 preventive detention, and incommunicad detention is not
 usually practiced.
 Acting on information or complaints received, the Attorney
 General's office passes the case to the appropriate court, and
 the judge then instructs the police to undertake an
 investigation. The suspect is questioned at police
 headquarters and may, depending upon the charges, be detained
 or placed under house arrest for 15 days while the case is
 investigated. If the case is not brought to trial within 15
 days, the suspect is freed. Detention or house arrest may be
 extended after the first 15 days by authority of the President,
 but usually for not more than 1 nonth. While there are no
 provisions for bail, an -accused person held without bail who
 has valid reason to travel may receive permission to do so
 from the court handling his case.
 Actions which "arouse the people against the Government" are
 illegal, and persons can be arrested and charged with violation
 of this law,,the penalty for which can be banishment to remote
 atolls of'the'Ma-ldives. Forced labor does not exist, except
 in the-case Qf persons banished to remote atolls, who must
 work to earn their keep.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a-High Court and eight lesser courts in the capital
 at Male, each dealing with specific types of cases (e.g.,
 debt, theft, property claims). On other islands there are
 courts that deal with all types of cases. Judges are trained
 in Islamic law, are appointed by the President and serve at
 his pleasure, and thus cannot be considered fully-independent.
 Cases in island courts that present knotty legal points are
 referred to the -appropriate specialized court at Male, whose
 judge may in tuxn refer the legal point to foUr judges
 attached-tb the Justice Ministry for assistance. The High
 Court acts as a court of appeal.and handles political cases,
 such es the trials of the participants in an attempted coup
 d'etat in 1980 and four Majlis members found guilty of bribery
 in 1983.
 During trial, the accused may defend himself and call
 witnesses. He also may be assisted by a lawyer, but there are
 few lawyers, and lawyers are not provided by the courts. The
 accused is sentenced by the judge; the length and type of
 sentence are established by law and custom.
 There are currently no Maldivians serving sentences for
 political crimes; the last remaining prisoner of those
 banished for participation in the 1980 coup attempt was
 pardoned in 1987.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits the opening, intercepting, reading,
 or making public of letters, telephone conversations,
 telegrams, and wireless messages exchanged between persons
 "except in-accordance with the specific provisions of the
 law." There were na reports of complaints in 1987 that the
 Government monitors-correspondence or telephone conversations
 or uses a system'of informers.
 There are no prohibitions on the importation of foreign
 publications, except pornography, and foreign broadcasts are
 not jammqd. TheGovernme.nt does-not interfere with the right
 to marry.
 The Constitution also requireszthat private premises and
 dwellingr, be respected and provides that-"they shall not be
 entered !into.except .under conditions and in a manner
 stipulatedd.n-the law, There have been no reports of
 practices to the cdntrary.
 Section 2 Respecb for, CivilLiberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-
 The ConstitUtion provides for fteedom of speech and expression
 "so, (Ing.as thi specific pfovisions. of Shari'a and the law are
 not contxavened.".. Anyitizen may criidize or, -omplain -to
 the Government without ,fear, if he does- -o: thr'ough rec6qnized
 channels -such-As by letters or oral.-complaints to the
 President, to a Majlis member, or to a civil sWrvant of'other
 person in authority.
 Maldivians are frequently frank in private when discussing and
 criticizing the.Gbvernment. However, the tlaw which 11rohibits
 arousing opposition. -to the -legally, stablished govrnmnt,  ,
 together withf)aiong,:tradit~on of authoritarian rule, tend to
 make I'aldivians careful when expressing their opiniofi to
 foreigners or, in the media.: There 'is no prior censotship of
 newspapeXa,1,bt- writers land-editors are subject to  rosecution'
 if their articles contravene the law.-- In 1987 -no writers or
 editorz-,were prosecuted for 'writing articlievialleged to have
 created antigovernment feelings. . '                  "
 There arethree privately owned newspapers, each required to
 registenwith the Government. The -only -government-owned
 publication: is the news bulletin,, publishid by the Maldivian
 Department of Information and Broadcasting.
 b. Freedom.of-,Peaceful' Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures freedomof assembly and association,
 but Maldivians.make little use of these freedoms in a
 political sense. The majority af rallies and meetings are
 sponsored or approved by the Government and commonly are
 addressed by.offici-la-or religious leaders. Clubs and other
 private assooiations  of.which'there are any, :=re permitted
 to function if, they do not contravene Shari'a and -i'vil" law,
 and if they register with the Government.
 There are no trade unions in the Maldives. Workers' rights to
 organize, bargain collectively, and strike are not recognized
 or protected by statute. Until the 1970's, most Maldivians
 either were self-employed or held government jobs and there
 
 
 1241
 MALDIVES
 was a relative lack of interest in workers' rights or
 organization. However, during the past 5 years three sizable
 garment manufacturing facilities opened, employing large
 numbers of workers. There were no special provisions
 regarding workers' rights or treatment in the agreements to
 establish these companies between the Government and the
 foreign investors. However, a Department of Labor was formed
 in 1982, and an Intergovernmental Labor Advisory Board met in
 1987 and drafted the country's first labor laws, pertaining to
 hours of work, overtime pay, and required annual holidays.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution makes Islam the official religion, and all
 citizens are Muslims. There are no churches or shrines for
 the practice of any other religion. Missionaries of
 non-Muslim faiths are not permitted to proselytize in the
 Maldives. Conversion of a Muslim to any other faith would be
 a violation of the Shari'a, the law of the land, and would
 automatically result ino the loss of Maldivian citizenship.
 However, links with coreligionists in other countries are
 freely allowed, and a delegation from the Maldives performs
 the Haj each year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Maldivians are free to move about the country unless they are
 under house arrest or detention or banished. However, the
 Government discourages Maldivians from changing islands of
 residence, primarily because most recent migrants have moved
 to Male, which is becoming severely overcrowded. The
 Government reimposed regulations in 1982 that limit immigration
 to the capital island and its surrounding atoll, permitting
 migration to Male only for short periods in order to work, be
 educated, br receive medical treatment. At'the same time, the
 Government has made a major effort to improve social and
 educational services and develop industry outside of Male. In
 1987 the Government announced new housing standards for all
 residences and plans to lease land on two islands in Male
 atoll as part of a new plan to reduce overcrowding on the
 capital island.
 Maldivians are free to change jobs. There are no restrictions
 on foreign travel or on emigration, and there are no exit
 visas. The Government requires any Maldivian who has acquired
 another nationality to maintain Maldivian nationality
 concurrently. Such a person must enter and leave the Maldives
 on a Maldivian passport. As far as is known, the Government
 never has revoked the citizenship of any Maldivian, there are
 no refugees or displaced persons in the Maldives, and no
 Maldivians have been exiled or are refugees or displaced
 persons elsewhere.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of the Maldives have only limited and indirect
 influence on the selection and organization of their
 government. President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom rules the Maldives
 together with a small group of generally well-educated members
 of the elite Who are loyal to him. There are no political
 parties, although they are not forbidden by law. President
 
 
 1242-
 MALDiVES
 Gayoom has, however, publicly discouraged their formation as
 being inappropriate to the homogeneous nature of Maldivian
 society.
 Members of the unicameral legislature, the Majlis, are chosen
 for 5-year tekms by means of secret ballots cast by all
 MaldiVians over 21 yegis'of age. Candidates for the Majlis
 must-be bver 25'yarsdf age, Muslim, able to read and write
 both Arabic afid'Maldivian script, not involved in a crime for
 the past 5 years,'and in good mental and physical condition.
 Of 48 members, 40 are elected (2 from each atoll and 2 from
 Male), and 8 are appointed by the President. There were 162
 candidates for the 40 seats contested in the December 1984
 elections. -Once elected, Majli representatives are freely
 approachedby'citizens or groups with'grievances-or points of
 view on propoded legislation.
 Candidates-foi piesident must be Sunni 1uslim,'bon of
 Maldivian  arentsrdale, over 30 years old, ndt convicted of
 any crimes, and-mentally stable. A single nominee for
 president~is chosen by secret ballot in the Majlis from as
 many candidates as are proposed by the nembers.- The
 nomination then is confirmed or rejected in a nationwide
 referendum, also by secret ballot. In 1983 the Majlis voted
 47 to 1 to-*i6minate Gayoom-to a sec6ad 5-year term.
 Maldivians confirmed Gayoom-with 95.62 percent of their
 votes. At the time of his nomination and the referendum,
 President:-Gayoom had no serious competitor for the position.
 Some irk~gularitibs apparezitly occurred-d6iring the referendum,
 especialIy-- outier.atolfs' where 'island chiefs'cast the  "'
 ballots of all elioibld vdters 'on their Isfinds. Nevertheless,
 Gayoom's leadership-is believed to be'widely accepted by the
 eledtorate. ,
 Sinco"th e?'-are no political parties, factions in the Majlis
 tend' fo toiflesce'around individuals or points of view and vary
 according to the 1?sUe. - Any iember may introduce leaislat-in,
 which, if sh6cnded, iust be'cotiiddredby the'Mailis. All
 laws must be approved bYy the Ma14lis. The Majlis has the power
 to question ministers and to call for their removal. In
 practice, however, the Majlis generally supports the Government
 after carefully discussing and sometimes amending its
 proposals.
 Section 4 Gove-nmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nonjovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of -uman Rights
 There were 'no requests for outside investigations of human
 rights violations in 1987. There are no local human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The population of the Maldives increased to 189,400 in 1986,
 50,000 of whom live on the capital island of Male. Concerned
 about overcrowding in Male, the Government has restricted
 migration to the bapital from other atolls, which results
 indirectly in discrimination against residents of the more
 distant atolls'in terms of their access to a better life. In
 1987, to address the interrelated problems of unhealthy
 overcrowding on Male and greater access for non-Male residents
 to the advantages available only on Male, the Government
 announced plans to lease land on two other islands to people
 
 
 1243
 MALDIVES
 who work on Male. One of the islands is within reasonable
 commuting distance of the capital; the other is 17 miles away,
 too far for a daily commute. Also, the Government has plans
 to intensify development of three new proposed regional
 centers, which will include regional airports (one is already
 finished) and industrial areas with a free trade zone.
 Women enjoy an equal status with men under Maldivian law, and
 patterns of behavior are not notably restrictive. By Islamic
 and Maldivian tradition, women play a lesser role than men in
 public life. No women were serving as members of the Majlis
 elected in 1980, but President Gayoom appointed one. There
 are three women in the citizens' special Majlis that is
 reviewing the Constitution. Women hold several responsible
 positions in the civil service. The President has appointed
 two women as aides, another to be his Director of Social
 Affairs, and two women to his 12-member Consultative Committee.
 In 1982 the President appointed a National Women's Committee
 which is seeking ways to increase participation by women in
 the country's life.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There are very few labor standards set by the Government.
 Only Government workers are entitled by presidential directive
 to a paid annual holiday and free health care in, the event of"
 work-caused illness. There is no minimum age for the
 employment of young people. The Government has set no
 restrictions on conditions under which children or young
 people may be employed, although most..employers do not hire
 young people for work at night or in what are considered
 hazardous conditions. There is no national minimum wage,
 although the Government has established wage floors for
 certain kinds of work, Employees who work more than an 8-hour
 day are entitled to be paid overtime, and employers are
 required to provide a certain minimum number of holidays per
 year under new laws adopted in 1987.
