 AFGHANISTAN
 In April 1978, a bloody Communist coup toppled the Afghan
 Government and led to the creation of the Democratic Republic
 of Afghanistan (DRA). Following a period of intense and
 violent intraparty factionalism and growing internal
 opposition, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December
 1979. Soviet occupying troops--numbering 118-120,000--plus
 regime forces, are now in the seventh year of a brutal
 country-wide war against the Afghan resistance, or mujahidin,
 which is supported by the vast majority of the people. The
 regime headed by Babrak Karmal depends totally on the presence
 of the Soviet troops for its authority and its very existence;
 its writ extends mainly to Kabul and several other cities and
 military bases.
 The Soviets' central and long-term objective appears to be to
 absorb Afghanistan into the socialist system by reshaping that
 country's traditional Islamic society into the Soviet mold as
 they did in Central Asia in the 1920's. Since the 1979
 invasion, Soviet advisers have moved into controlling
 positions in government ministries, the armed forces, and the
 security apparatus. They now either directly make, or are
 deeply involved in, all significant political, military, and
 socioeconomic decisions. With Soviets dominating the central
 government organs, the still divided Marxist-Leninist People's
 Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) serves principally as a
 political facade.
 Even before the economic deterioration brought about by the
 years of upheaval and warfare since 1978, Afghanistan was
 among the world's poorest nations. The war has further
 lowered living standards, disrupted the international trading
 system, led to the devaluation of the currency, ana disrupted
 internal economic production and distribution. Moreover, the
 Soviets have pursued a deliberate policy of destroying crops,
 livestock, irrigation systems, and villages as part of their
 strategy.
 Afghanistan is a country without an independent judiciary to
 guarantee even the most fundamental human rights. The most
 feared and consistent violator of human rights is the secret
 police, KHAD. More than 25,000 Afghans are believed to work
 full time for KHAD under the close supervision of Soviet
 secret police (KGB) "advisors." KHAD has operational
 responsibility for collecting foreign and domestic
 intelligence, conducting clandestine activities inside
 Afghanistan and abroad, and maintaining regime control through
 intimidation, surveillance, arrest, interrogation, and
 imprisonment.
 An already bad human rights situation deteriorated still
 further in 1985. Basic rights continued to be violated on a
 magnitude unprecedented in recent Afghan history. Military
 and KHAD forces carried out systematic violations of the human
 rights of Afghans on a grand scale, and with impunity, as part
 of their campaign to maintain their grip on the few urban
 Afghans under their control. Urban centers were repeatedly
 bombed and strafed by aircraft and subjected to mortar and
 artillery bombardment. Large-scale military operations were
 mounted with scant regard for--and at times with deliberate
 intent to cause--death and injury to innocent civilians.
 Harsh reprisals continued against non-combatants, and entire
 villages were bombarded on suspicion of harboring resistance

 AFGHANISTAN
 fighters. Reports continue of old men, women, and children
 being rounded up and shot..
 Moscow's brutal conduct of the war has resulted in one of the
 greatest mass migrations in history. Many Afghans have been
 forced into urban centers such as Kabul, whose population has
 more than doubled to over 2 million. More than 5 million
 Afghans have been uprooted, nearly 4 million of them becoming
 refugees abroad. In large areas of the countryside where the
 resistance is active, wartime conditions and longstanding
 animosities among competing tribal groups have led to multiple
 taxation, arbitrary detention, and outright banditry. Without
 the withdrawal of Soviet forces and a political resolution of
 the conflict, there are no prospects for an improvement in the
 human rights situation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 As in the past, arbitrary killings and other acts of violence
 by Soviet and Afghan troops and security forces were a daily
 occurrence throughout 1985. In March, Soviet soldiers
 reportedly -urdered over 1,000 civilians during punitive
 strikes against villages in Laghman Province in retaliation
 for their support of the mujahidin. In May. again in Laghman
 Province, some 100 innocent civilians, mostly children and old
 women, were slaughtered when Soviet soldiers attacked the
 village of Qargan'i. After looting homes, the soldiers
 massacred women and children who had taken refuge in the
 village mosque.
 Large-scale Soviet-led military operations in Logar valley
 caused death and massive destruction in villages located east
 of Asadabad and created another influx of several thousand
 refugees into neighboring Pakistan. Military operations in
 the Panjsher added to the destruction visited on villages
 during 1984. During October, Soviet and Afghan troops were
 reported to have systematically destroyed many of the smaller
 villages around Jabol As Saraj, near the mouth of the
 Panjsher. Homes and fields were methodically destroyed, often
 with bulldozers, and large numbers of women and children fled
 into Kabul and the larger towns in the Shomali.
 Battlefield executions of captured resistance fighters are
 commonplace. Although fighting is a daily occurrence, there
 are no known prisoner-of-war camps or facilities for detention
 of resistance fighters. Regime media seldom mention the
 capture of mujahidin but make frequent reference to their
 1elimination." Reports continue to circulate that resistance
 forces have also killed captured Afghan (paiticularly officers
 and party members) and Soviet soldiers, though the standard
 practice for captured Afghan troops, and often officers as
 well, is to invite them to join the resistance and/or to send
 them back to their villages. There have been reports that in
 isolated instances a few prisoners have been exchanged, but
 such is by far the exception rather than the rule. The
 mujahidin have kept some Soviet prisoners in an apparent
 attempt to bring about prisoner exchanges, but the Soviets and
 DRA have shown little interest; as a result, Soviet prisoners
 
 
 1165
 AFGHANISTAN
 are often executed when they become a burden to mujahidin
 forces because of military operations. Some Soviet soldiers
 have reportedly defected to and fight with the resistance.
 The pace of executions of political prisoners seems to have
 picked up in 1985, but the regime has provided no reliable
 data. There was one report of an attempted breakout by 13
 political prisoners from Kabul's notorious Pule Charkhi prison
 in early October. Wives, children, and other family members
 have been threatened or killed by Soviet and Afghan troops in
 an effort to extort information or confessions from villagers
 during house-to-house searches.
 The Soviets continue to employ particularly cruel types of
 antipersonnel explosives to restrict the movement of
 resistance forces, and refugees alike. Butterfly mines and
 explosive devices disguised as household objects or toys have
 been strewn along trails and paths in the southwest and
 eastern regions of the country. Many of the relatively large
 number of leg and foot injuries seen on the streets of major
 towns and cities of Afghanistan, and among many of the
 refugees, probably result from such explosive devices.
 Kidnappings and assassinations by mujahidin of Afghan
 Communist Party members, suspected police-agents, informants,
 and Soviets in Afghan cities are a common occurrence.
 Political assassinations are often the work of rival party
 factions rather than the mujahidin, however. Resistance
 attacks against regime and Soviet targets have led to the
 death or injury of innocent bystanders. However, most
 resistance actions in urban centers are directed against
 military or government objectives.
 There has been no fully confirmed report of the use of
 chemical weapons by Soviet forces in Afghanistan since 1982.
 However, reports continue to be received of incidents in which
 chemical or toxic agents may have been employed. There was
 one unconfirmed report of the use of chemical weapons by
 Soviet/Afghan forces during a military operation near
 Maidanshahr in Wardak Province in early October. Thirty
 Afghan soldiers and a number of civilians were said to have
 perished when the vapors drifted over their positions.
 b. Disappearance
 Persons frequently disappear and are never heard from again,
 although families as a rule eventually learn when missing
 relatives have been taken as military conscripts or have been
 detained by the secret police.
 Reports continued of abductions of KHAD members by the
 resistance. In almost all cases, those abducted were executed
 or detained for lengthy periods.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and physical or psychological intimidation remain
 standard techniques used by the security services, reportedly
 with the participation of Soviet "advisers," to extract
 information or confessions from detainees and to inflict
 punishment. Such torture reportedly includes electric shock,
 beatings, deprivation of sleep, extraction of fingernails, and
 burning of genitalia.
 
 
 1166
 AFGHANISTAN
 One man was repeatedly tortured over an 18-month period before
 his will was finally broken enough for him to appear before
 regime television in 1985 to recount his "crimes" against the
 regime. There are similar accounts of other prisoners being
 "prepared" for public recantations.
 Independent international human rights groups have repeatedly
 cataloged credible reports, many of them firsthand, of torture
 and ill treatment of people while in custody of the military
 and KHAD. Amnesty International, in its report "Torture in
 the Eighties," and more recently the U.N. Commission
 on Human Rights' report--approved by the General Assembly--on
 the human rights situation in Afghanistan, have both described
 grisly treatment of prisoners at the hands of the Afghan
 security apparatus. Resistance fighters have also been known
 to inflict grisly punishment on those who fall into their
 hands.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no effective constitutional or legal safeguards
 against arbitrary arrest or detention. Afghans in areas
 controlled by the regime live in fear of unwarranted seizure
 by the secret police. Persons are often detained for
 questioning on the word of KHAD informants and are not told of
 the charges against them. Warrants are not used, nor is the
 right of habeas corpus respected. Untold numbers of prisoners
 have languished incommunicado in Afghan prisons. Formal
 charges are usually brought only after months of
 interrogation, if ever. In many instances, innocent victims
 are rounded up, imprisoned, and virtually forgotten.
 Political crimes range from armed opposition to authorship or
 distribution of leaflets against the regime or Soviet
 occupiers, or simply an association or remote connection with
 a foreigner.
 Bail has never been a regular feature of Afghan law. In cases
 of common crimes involving wealthy persons or those with good
 connections, bail is sometimes granted. Corruption, however,
 is so widespread that it is possible for the families of
 people detained for common crimes to obtain their release
 after paying bribes to secret police agents or regime
 officials.
 To compensate for recruiting problems and the high rate of
 desertions, the Afghan regime uses house-to-house searches and
 press gangs in the bazaars and markets of the major cities to
 obtain conscripts, often seizing those with no legal liability
 to service. The regime also forces soldiers to remain in
 service beyond their term.
 In areas not under regime control, Soviet or Afghan soldiers
 or suspected secret police agents are either killed or
 detained after an informal mujahidin inquiry. Regime soldiers
 are often treated as fellow Muslims and are either invited to
 join the resistance or are instructed to return to their
 villages. Soviet soldiers are sometimes killed out of hand or
 held for long periods of time. In many cases, such as in the
 Panjsher valley, they are kept under detention. Prisoners
 held by the mujahidin reportedly face harsh conditions. The
 ratio of Soviet soldiers in captivity to the number of Soviets
 reportedly captured appears low, suggesting that many Soviets
 are executed. Under a 1982 agreement, the mujahadin have
 delivered to the International Committee of the Red Cross 11
 
 
 1167
 AFGHANISTAN
 Soviet prisoners-of-war to serve a 2-year internment in
 Switzerland before being offered resettlement or repatriation
 to the U.S.S.R.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All courts, whether civil, military, "revolutionary," or
 security, are controlled by the party. The laws governing
 their organization and jurisdiction set out as the first
 priority the safeguarding of the gains of the "revolution."
 One consequence is that plaintiffs may be denied due process
 simply because of charges regarding their political beliefs.
 Most of those accused of nonpolitical offenses are apparently
 tried in the civil court system under the harsh norms of
 pre-Communist judicial codes. Most political detainees, when
 charged, are arraigned on allegations of treason, espionage,
 or terrorism and are tried and sentenced in secret. They are
 not allowed effective legal counsel and are seldom able to
 cross-examine hostile witnesses. On the rare occasions when
 foreigners are accused of political crimes, they are denied
 their choice of defense counsel and not permitted to question
 regime witnesses whose testimony is invariably accepted as
 fact by the court.
 In the case of widely known acts against the Government or
 Soviets, there is generally a televised recantation followed
 by a show trial. In August, five persons were condemned to
 death in Mazar-i-Sherif following their "confessions" about
 planting a bomb in an apartment building and a host of other
 'crimes against the revolution." Three others were condemned
 in June for a series of alleged crimes near Kabul, including a
 March bomb blast in a bazaar in which at least one Soviet
 woman was killed. Press accounts of such show trials
 repeatedly use formulations such as, "The suspects will be
 tried and sentenced," indicating the sham nature of the
 trials. Although in most cases the penalty was death,
 occasionally lengthy prison sentences were substituted. Death
 penalties generally are carried out quickly after a pro forma
 review by the ruling Revolutionary Council. There is no
 appeal from a death sentence endorsed by the Revolutionary
 Council.
 In areas not controlled by the regime, civil and criminal
 cases are apparently tried by Islamic "qazis" (judges) under
 traditional Shari'a law and Afghan custom. The imposition of
 such sentences as death, stoning, or mutilation is reportedly
 rare. There are also some mujahidin courts for trying Soviet
 and regime soldiers or suspected regimg agents. Little is
 known of these bodies, although they are believed to be based
 on traditional or Islamic jurisprudence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Afghan regime and the Soviet occupation forces do not
 recognize the right to privacy. In the cities and during
 military operations against villages, areas are frequently
 cordoned off and subjected to house-to-house searches for
 military conscripts, mujahidin fighters, and weapons. Members
 of the secret police commonly accompany the military and check
 book titles and correspondence for evidence of unorthodox
 opinion or antiregime connections. House-to-house searches in
 Kabul are often conducted in the early morning before daybreak.
 
 
 1168
 AFGHANISTAN
 Rights to privacy and freedom from arbitrary interference vary
 widely in areas controlled by local mujahidin leaders. The
 resistance has generally tried not to antagonize the civilian
 population by arbitrary demands for shelter or supplies, but
 there are exceptions, and growing suspicion caused by the
 increased use of informers and agents compounds an already
 difficult situation.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The regime and its Soviet backers consider the educational
 system and the mass media to be essential to the realization
 of their long-term objectives of Sovietizing Afghan society
 and of overturning all traditional Afghan social and political
 institutions. The regime tolerates no expression of ideas
 which have not been carefully weighed, judged, and approved by
 the party and its Soviet ideological supervisors. Every
 effort is taken to stifle and suppress opposition viewpoints,
 and criticism of the regime or the Soviets is swiftly
 punished.   The regime employs censorship, surveillance, and
 oppression to ensure that all publicly expressed views hew to
 the party line. There is no academic freedom in Afghanistan.
 All media are owned and controlled by the regime and tightly
 supervised by Soviet officials. The press, radio, and
 television are used to convey regime policy and the Soviet
 interpretation of world events. Soviet films and
 entertainment programs are frequently featured on Afghan
 television to reinforce that interpretation. The unlicensed
 import and sale of foreign video and audio tapes, magazines,
 books, posters, and other publications are forbidden. The
 great majority of new books on sale in Kabul, irrespective of
 language, are published in the U.S.S.R. Afghans are guarded
 in their private conversations, even among friends or
 colleagues, lest antiregime or anti-Soviet remarks be reported
 to the secret police. Western radio broadcasts in the local
 languages are regularly jammed, although some programs do get
 through to Afghan listeners and constitute one of their main
 sources of information. The regime has actively hampered
 efforts of non-Communist news media to cover the war inside
 Afghanistan and has imprisoned or expelled foreign
 correspondents captured while accompanying the mujahidin.
 Soviet and regime spokesmen have threatened unauthorized
 foreign journalists with capture or death. The regime
 reportedly offered a reward for the capture of foreign
 journalists. One America4 journalist was killed in September
 by Afghan or Soviet troops near Kandahar while traveling with
 a resistance group.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of peaceful assembly or association in
 areas controlled by the regime; only assemblies which are
 regime-sponsored and orchestrated are permitted. The regime
 frequently stages "spontaneous" meetings to create the
 impression of popular support. Demonstrations at Western
 embassies can be arranged on demand. Without exception, all
 mass organizations are tightly controlled by the regime.
 Employees have been threatened with loss of jobs or
 imprisonment if they refuse to join party organizations. In
 some cases, families are warned that their children will be
 
 
 1169
 AFGHANISTAN
 forced out of school if they do not join one of the youth
 organizations. This campaign to restrict and channel
 political and social activities has encouraged the exodus of
 the already shrunken upper and middle classes.
 There is no right of labor to organize in any meaningful
 fashion for the protection and furtherance of workers'
 economic and political goals. Trade associations and unions
 of workers and of peasants are closely modeled after those of
 the Soviet Union and serve as vehicles for the Sovietization
 of Afghan society. The Central Committee of Afghan Trade
 Unions, with a claimed membership of 150,000 workers, is an
 affiliate of the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade
 Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Afghanistan is an overwhelmingly Islamic nation, primarily
 Sunni. There are some Shi'a Muslims, particularly in the
 Hazarajat area of central Afghanistan. Small urban enclaves
 of Hindus, Sikhs, and Jews have been traditionally tolerated.
 The media portrays the regime as defending the faith and the
 resistance as destroyers of mosques. However, by far the vast
 bulk of the population appears to reject this interpretation
 and considers the regime and its Soviet sponsors to be
 anathema.
 Since the 1978 coup, religious organizations have been tightly
 supervised. The regime established a Ministry of Religious
 Affairs in 1985. Major regime policies are promptly given the
 Ministry's imprimatur. Wherever possible, the regime selects,
 censors, and pays the mullahs for individual mosques. Such
 clerics are considered to be secret police agents by many
 Afghans and have been frequent targets for assassination by
 the resistance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel remains severely curtailed by the war.
 Overland movement has become more difficult because of damage
 to roadbeds and bridges. Surface travelers also risk being
 caught in fights between mujahidin and Soviet forces. Buses
 and other vehicles are sometimes deliberately attacked by
 Soviet or regime helicopter gunships. The civilian traveler
 is also faced with frequent checkpoints or roadblocks by
 Soviets, regime forces, mujahidin, and, in some cases,
 bandits. Tolls are often extracted. Regime officials
 ordinarily travel by air, since they risk being identified and
 executed at mujahidin roadblocks. Air travel has become more
 hazardous because of occasional resistance attacks on aircraft
 and airports. Reportedly three civil aircraft were downed by
 the mujahidin in 1985.
 The regime severely curtails foreign travel by Afghans under
 its control. Travel to the West is effectively discouraged
 and permission routinely denied for fear the traveler will not
 return. Some businessmen can still obtain passports, but many
 Afghans are forced to pay bribes of $1,000 or more for a
 passport. Bank accounts and real estate are often demanded as
 surety for return, and the regime is free to seize the
 property of persons absent for more than a year. Pilgrims to
 Mecca are carefully screened and are issued documents valid
 
 
 1170
 AFGHANISTAN
 only for Saudi Arabia. In 1985, the regime levied heavy fees
 on pilgrims in addition to requiring the deposit of real
 estate with the Government in an effort to assure their return.
 Legal emigration is virtually impossible, but large numbers
 continue to seek refuge abroad. Families caught attempting to
 leave the country have been arrested, shot, or bombed by
 Soviet or regime aircraft patrolling Afghanistan's borders.
 Nevertheless, over 3 million Afghans have been registered with
 various international relief agencies in Pakistan and Iran,
 and each new military operation creates more refugees . The
 regime maintains that exiles are welcome to return without
 penalty if they agree to support objectives of the "Saur
 Revolution." Few, however, have returned.  Recently the
 regime established a commission to handle returning refugees,
 but although there is much traffic both ways across the border
 few refugees have taken the regime's offer.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Afghanistan is ruled by a totalitarian apparatus fronted by a
 handful of Afghans and the PDPA but in reality controlled by
 the Soviet Union. The party is modeled closely on Soviet
 lines and headed by a 12-member Politburo. Regime figures put
 the number of party members at 123,000 but the actual number
 of active members is far lower. Soviet military and civilian
 advisors sit in almost all ministries and make or approve
 every significant decision.
 Membership in the PDPA, the sole legal political party, is a
 prerequisite for meaningful participation in public affairs
 and professional advancement in most fields. The party itself
 is deeply split between its Parcham and Khalq factions. The
 less numerous Parcham faction, presently favored by Moscow,
 retains control of the party apparatus.
 The regime and Soviets exert control over only a few major
 cities, and then only by virtue of their military presence.
 In cities such as Herat and Kandahar, this control is limited
 and challenged frequently by armed resistance attacks. Most
 of the countryside is, for practical purposes, not under
 regime control.
 In April the regime staged a five-day Loya Jirga (Great
 Council) meeting in Kabul involving over 2,000 delegates.
 Numerous sources, including many delegates, said that the
 meeting was largely organized by KHAD and that most of the
 participants had either been bribed or coerced to attend.
 Another Jirga of borderland tribes was similarly organized in
 September, again with participants subjected to bribes or
 coercion. At both Jirgas, only expression of support for the
 regime was permitted.
 During the year, the regime also conducted elections for local
 councils in Kabul, Faizabad (the capital of Badakhshan
 Province), and Zaranj (the capital of Nimroz Province). A few
 minutes prior to the voting, the single slate of candidates
 was presented for the first time to the voters, who then cast
 their votes by raising their hands. Regime and secret police
 officials, some with cameras, stood watch at the fringes of
 these voting sessions, clearly to discourage "no" votes.
 Regime newspaper pictures showed young children raising their
 hands along with other voters.
 
 
 1171
 AFGHANISTAN
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Kabul regime has resisted all efforts by international
 humanitarian organizations to investigate its human rights
 practices. The International Committee of the Red Cross has
 not been allowed in Kabul since 1982. A request by Helsinki
 Watch to send an official factfinding mission to Kabul was
 denied. The Afghan government has refused to cooperate with
 Special Rapporteur Felix Ermacora, who was appointed by the
 U.N. Human Rights Commissioner (UNHRC) in the summer of 1984
 to investigate human rights abuses in Afghanistan. Based
 principally on interviews with Afghan refugees in Pakistan,
 various reports have documented large-scale human rights
 violations; these include a 212-page report by Helsinki Watch
 entitled "Tears, Blood and Cries" and Professor Ermacora's
 interim report of February 19, 1985.
 The decision to appoint the UNHRC Special Rapporteur was
 strenuously opposed by the U.S.S.R. and Afghanistan, which
 further declared it would not be bound by any conclusion of
 the report. Since submission of his report to the UNHRC in
 Geneva in February 1985, Professor Ermacora has been subjected
 to personal attacks and vitriolic denunciations. The findings
 of the interim report, endorsed by the UNHRC, were approved by
 the U.N. General Assembly in December 1985. They state "that
 the current situation in Afghanistan has given rise to willful
 killing, including murder; torture and inhuman treatment;
 denial of a fair trial; arbitrary arrest and execution of
 sentences; and the taking of hostages." The UNHRC has
 extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for an
 additional year.
 In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, the
 detention of political prisoners without charge or trial, the
 use of the death penalty, and reports of torture and
 ill-treatment of prisoners and extrajudicial executions. It
 also expressed concern about political trials which appeared
 to fall short of internationally recognized standards.
 Freedom House rates Afghanistan as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Reliable social and economic statistics are not available.
 Population estimates vary widely but the true figure now may
 be under 10 million. There are also more than 3.5 million
 external refugees. The estimated annual population growth
 rate is 2.4 percent.
 Party members, secret police, regime figures, and some
 merchants may have been enriched by the war, but most Afghans
 have suffered economically. Except for regime-subsidized
 staples in the major cities, the cost of many food items and
 housing has risen faster than personal income. Heating fuel
 costs have become exorbitant. Electricity is available only
 in a handful of cities and for varying periods and is often
 cut off completely in winter. Difficulties with surface
 travel and deliberate bombings of formerly rich agricultural
 and pastoral areas such as the Shomali, the northern steppe,
 and Helmand Valley have led to a decrease in traditional
 Afghan cash crops and exports such as grapes, dried fruit, and
 Karakul lambskins. Production of traditional handicraft items
 for export, such as carpets, has also been severely impeded.
 The once thriving tourism industry has vanished.
 
 
 1172
 AFGHANISTAN
 Life expectancy is 37 years and the infant mortality rate is
 more than 180 per 1,000 live births. Rural health delivery
 services have never been adequate. At present, they are
 nonexistent except for folk medicine, a limited number of
 Afghan paramedics who are usually only semiskilled and serve
 in mujahidin-controlled areas, and foreign doctors who enter
 the country clandestinely. Medical services provided in urban
 areas under regime control are also inadequate because of the
 war-related rural immigration, war casualties, an overall
 shortage of doctors and qualified staff, and severe lack of
 basic medicines, equipment, sheets, and beds.
 The war also has had a drastic impact on education. Large
 numbers of the country's educated individuals have fled the
 country. Most rural schools were destroyed by the resistance
 when the regime attempted to turn them into political
 indoctrination centers. Many others have been closed because
 of the danger to regime teachers. Formal education in many
 cities has been brought to a virtual standstill as a result of
 daily firefights. In rural areas, education seems to be in
 the hands of traditional Islamic teachers. The regime's
 inability to maintain the strength of its armed forces has led
 to the drafting of boys as young as 15 (16 is the official age
 limit). University admission has been limited to women, party
 members, and men who have completed military service. The
 student body at Kabul University, the country's main center
 for higher learning, has dropped from 15,000 before the Soviet
 invasion to under 4,000 today. In secure urban areas, schools
 for boys and girls are functioning. The curriculums have been
 reoriented to conform to the Soviet model. In 1985, the
 regime dismissed the last of a handful of French and German
 high-school teachers. The regime has initiated a literacy
 program in the military forces. Ideological tracts serve as
 texts and rote memory is the method used. The regime
 estimates the literacy rate at less than 10 percent although
 the actual rate may be even lower.
 Each year, thousands of young Afghans are sent to the Soviet
 Union for training heavily geared to political
 indoctrination. Thousands of teenagers have been sent to
 various Soviet Central Asian republics for summer vacations.
 And more young children, some as young as 7 years or less,
 have been sent to the U.S.S.R. for what has been said to be 10
 or more years of education.
 Information on labor conditions and practices, including the
 use of forced labor, is unavailable due to the current
 situation in Afghanistan.
 Participation of Afghan women in activities beyond home and
 field is severely limited by traditional beliefs, customs, and
 religious practices. In areas of resistance control, the role
 of women remains much as it traditionally has been. Since the
 installation of the Babrak Karmal regime, the social position
 of some individual women has tended to improve in Kabul and
 other cities controlled by the regime. Access to education by
 younger women has increased. To attract women to the regime's
 banner, and to fill the gap caused by males in the army or
 fighting for the resistance, women have been placed in a
 number of nontraditional professions such as radio and
 television, banking, and the civil service. Few women,
 however, aside from one Politburo member, have decisionmaking
 positions. The vast majority of women under regime control
 have seen no improvement in their social position or status.
