 CAMEROON
 Cameroon is a single-party state with a civilian
 government operating under a Constitution adopted
 in 1972. Its unique history as the only African
 country to have fused former French and British
 territories into a single political entity has led
 Cameroon to make national unity a principal objec-
 tive. An ethnically based and ideologically moti-
 vated guerrilla campaign, begun against the French
 and continued against the newly independent govern-
 ment, severely tested that Government's ability to
 foster national unity. By the mid-sixties, how-
 ever, the Cameroonian Government had managed to
 assert its control over the area in conflict. In
 recent years, as the threat of internal subversion
 has receded, most political detainees have been
 released and some restrictions on civil liberties
 have been relaxed.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited in Cameroon. However,
 Amnesty International has reported allegations
 of harsh prison conditions and ill treatment of
 detainees.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Except under extraordinary circumstances (e.g.,
 a person resisting arrest), the Cameroonian Penal
 Code prohibits public servants from using force
 against any petson. Representatives of the
 Cameroonian Government state that this prohibition
 is strictly enforced and cite several examples of
 prison sentences given policemen who physically
 abused others. However, there are continuing
 
 
 25
 reports of the unnecessaiy use of force by the
 police, ranging in severity from bullying to out-
 right brutality. Such incidents appear to take
 place in public during checks for identification
 or other papers, apprehensions of suspects or
 interrogations at police stations.
 The Cameroonian Government acknowledges that prison
 conditions are inadequate, the result of a lack
 of resources rather than deliberate neglect. The
 Fiscal Year 1978/1979 budget allocates about $5.5
 million to prison administration, an increase of
 23 percent over the previous year.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Cameroonian legal and judicial system is gener-
 ally patterned after that of France. It is rela-
 tively easy to obtain orders to hold suspects in
 custody while their cases are under investigation.
 In 1976 several hundred Cameroonians were arrested
 for having distributed illegal political tracts in
 Douala. The tracts, which called for a general
 strike, were written by members of the organiza-
 tion which led the guerrilla war of the late 1950s
 and early 1960s. No public trials were held for
 those arrested, nor did they have access to legal
 counsel. Government officials state that nearly
 all the persons arrested have been released.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cameroon law guarantees defendants a fair public
 trial, including legal representation, at state
 expense if necessary. With regard to judicial
 proceedings, the law does not distinguish between
 those accused of ordinary crimes and those accused
 of political violations. As noted above, the
 Douala group arrested for political reasons was
 denied a fair public trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Cameroon Penal Code prohibits the entry into
 another's residence without permission unless the
 
 
 act takes place pursuant to a court order. In prac-
 tice, there are occasional police sweeps of the
 poorer residential districts in searches for crim-
 inals during which indiscriminate and unauthorized
 entry into homes occurs.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Cameroonian Government's main socio-economic
 priority is agricultural and rural development,
 which, given the country's elongated shape and
 difficult topography, requires a large concurrent
 investment in transportation infrastructure. Dur-
 ing the current fiscal year the budgets of the
 Ministries of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Public
 Health, Social Affairs and Education account for
 26.3 percent of the national budget. The Ministry
 of Education has the largest share, surpassing the
 Ministry of Armed Forces for the first time. This
 is the result of an active campaign to facilitate
 recruitment and training of new teachers. The
 Government has begun a program to provide better
 medical care to the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Professors and students at the University are
 strongly discouraged from writing or publishing
 works specifically critical of the Cameroonian
 Government and its policies. The works of cer-
 tain critical authors may not be imported or read
 in Cameroon. However, the Government encourages
 the expression and development of ethnic traditions
 within the framework of overall Cameroonian unity.
 (Cameroon has at least 160 culture/language groups.)
 The Cameroonian Government contends that the media
 
 
 27
 should be controlled and used to mobilize the popu-
 lation in support of its development goals. It
 uses censorship to that end.
 Cameroon is a nation of Muslims, Christians and
 animists. Freedom of religion is protected by law
 and respected in practice, except for sects such as
 the Jehovah's Witnesses which are proscribed for
 not accepting secular authority.
 The Cameroonian Penal Code prohibits participation
 in public meetings, demonstrations or processions
 without prior government approval.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within the country is not
 restricted by law. In practice, however, travelers
 are often stopped by the police for checks of iden-
 tity, tax receipts and the like. These checks some-
 times develop into incidents of petty harassment and
 bullying.
 Exit visas are required to leave the country. Often
 they are available only after long bureaucratic de-
 lays. In some cases, these delays undoubtedly repre-
 sent attempts by the Government to discourage or
 even prevent departure.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 While there is no legal proscription against addi-
 tional parties, in practice Cameroon is a one-party
 state. Opposition parties are not tolerated and
 all political activities must take place under
 the umbrella of the Cameroon National Union. At
 the local level it is possible for almost any citi-
 zen to participate actively in party politics
 which often involve competition among factions
 representing different political points of view.
 For the overwhelming majority of the Cameroonian
 people who are not party militants, the political
 process involves virtually no element of choice.
 
 
 In 1972, Cameroon's three labor federations were
 united to form the National Union of Cameroon
 Workers, an affiliate of the Cameroon National
 Union (CNU). Labor unions have little political
 or economic strength because of the small size of
 the salaried work force and government control over
 union activities. Strikes are banned.
 Women enjoy equal rights with men under the Consti-
 tution and are politically active in the Cameroon
 National Union. An affiliated group, the Organi-
 zation of CNU Women, was created in 1966 to develop
 and implement social and educational programs aimed
 at emancipating the Cameroonian woman.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Government Investigations of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 During 1978, Amnesty International requested in-
 formation from the Cameroonian Government on the
 status of several persons allegedly detained with-
 out formal charges and without public trial. The
 Government recognizes no obligation to respond to
 these inquiries since it views Amnesty International
 as having neither "official" international status
 nor any right to question Cameroon's sovereignty
 in the human rights field.
