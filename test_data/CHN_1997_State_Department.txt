 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian state in which the Chi-
 nese Communist Party (CCP) is the paramount source of power. At the national and
 regional levels, party members hold almost all top government, police, and military
 positions. Ultimate authority rests with members of the Politburo. Leaders stress
 the need to maintain stability and social order and are committed to perpetuating
 the rule of the CCP and its hierarchy. Citizens lack the freedom to express peace-
 fully opposition to the party-led political system and the right to change their na-
 tional leaders or form of government. Socialism continues to provide the theoretical
 underpinning of Chinese politics, but Marxist ideology has given way to, economic
 pragmatism in recent years. Economic decentralization has increased the authority
 of regional officials. The party's authority rests primarily on the Government's abil-
 ity to maintain social stability, appeals to nationalism and patriotism, party control
 of personnel and the security apparatus, and the greatly improved living standards
 of most of China's 1.2 billion citizens. The Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary; however, in practice, the judicial system is-subject to the "policy guidance"
 of the CCP.
 The security apparatus is comprised of the Ministries of State Security and Public
 Security, the People's Armed Police, the People's Liberation Army, and the state ju-
 dicial, prcuratori"al, and penal systems. Security policy and personnel were respon-
 sible for numerous human rights abuses.
 China has a mixed economy that continuesto expand rapidly. Economic reforms
 are raising living standards for many, providing greater independence for entre-
 preneurs, diminishing state control over the economy and people's daily lives, and
 creating new economi'c opportunities. Despite economic difficulties in the state sec-
 tor, individual economic oppotnties continue to expand rapidly in nonstate sec-
 tors, resulting in increased freedom of employment and mobility. The Government
 continues to adopt market-based policies and both state-owned and nonstate enter-
 prises are benefiting from freedom to compete in domestic and overseas markets.
 As economic opportunities grow the number of citizens living in absolute poverty
 continues to decline; estimates range from official figures of 58 million to estimates
 as high as 350 million. China faces growing problems, including state enterprise re-
 form, unemployment, underemployment, and regional economic disparities. Accord-
 ing to estimates, rural unemployment and underemployment range from 30 to 50
 percent. During the year, the definition of employment was changed to working 5
 or more hours per week from working 20 hours per week. Tens of millions of peas-
 ants have left their homes in search of better jobs and living conditions. According
 to estimates, as many as 100 million people make up this "floating population," with
 many major cities counting 1 million or more such people. Urban areas are also cop-
 ing with millions of state workers idled on partial wages or unemployed as a result
 of industrial reforms. Workers in Liaoning, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and other provinces
 increasingly organized public protests to press their demands.
 There were positive steps in human rights, although serious problems remained.
 The Government continued to commit widespread and well-documented human
 rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms stemming from the au-
 thorities' very limited tolerance of public dissent, fear of unrest, and the limited
 scope or inadequate implementation of laws protecting basic freedoms. The Con-
 stitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, but they are often ignored
 in practice. Abuses included torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confes-
 sions, and arbitrary arrest and lengthy incommunicado detention. Prison conditions
 at many facilities remained harsh. The Government continued tight restrictions on
 freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, and worker
 rights. Discrimination against women, minorities, and the disabled, violence against
 women, prostitution, trafficking in women and children, and the abuse of children
 remain problems. The Government continued to restrict tightly worker rights. Seri-
 ous human rights abuses persisted in minority areas, including Tibet and Xinjiang,
 where tight controls on religion and other fundamental freedoms continued and, in
 some cases, intensified.
 In 1997 the Government took several positive actions to address international con-
 cerns in the area of human rights. In October the Government signed the United
 Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and allowed the United
 Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to visit China. The Government also
 
 
 714
 significantly expanded its dialog on human rights with a number of foreign inter-
 locutors.
 The Government's response to dissent was also somewhat more tolerant than in
 recent years. Although authorities continued to use repressive measures such as in-
 timidation, administrative detention, imposition of prison terms, house arrest or
 exile to control tightly dissent, the Government exhibited some limited tolerance of
 public expressions of opposition to government policies and calls for political reform.
 During the year, a number of dissidents, academics, and former officials issued pub-
 lic statements, letters or petitions challenging the Government's policies or advocat-
 ing political reform. Some, including Fang Jue, Shang Dewen, and Lin Mu had no
 action taken against them. Others, including Bao Ge, Qin Yongmin, and Shen
 Liangqing were harassed, arrested or rearrested, left the country under pressure,
 or were subjected to stricter forms of house arrest, as in the past.
 China also released a few political prisoners on medical parole or before their
 terms were over. Prominent dissident and democracy activist Wei Jingsheng was re-
 leased from prison in November on medical parole and allowed to travel abroad for
 medical treatment. Journalists Xi Yang and Zhao Lei, and labor activists Tang
 Yuanjuan, Li Wei, and Zhou Guoqiang also were released before the end of their
 prison terms. However, thousands of others, including Wang Dan, Liu Nianchun,
 Gao Yu, Pastor Xu Yongze, Bishop Zeng Jingmu, Chadrel Rinpoche, and Ngawang
 Choephel remained in prison for the peaceful expression of their political, social or
 religious views and/or "counterrevolutionary" offenses despite official denials that
 China holds political prisoners. Some of those who completed their sentences and
 were released from prison were kept under tight surveillance and prevented from
 taking employment or otherwise resuming a normal life. Others were released from
 prison at the completion of their sentences and subsequently allowed to leave China,
 including Tong Yi and Zhang Lin.
 China made progress in legal reform efforts in 1997. The judicial system continues
 to deny defendants basic legal safeguards and due process because authorities at-
 tach higher priority to maintaining public order and suppressing political opposition
 than to implementing and enforcing legal norms. The Government, however, contin-
 ued to take positive steps to strengthen its legal system by enacting and implement-
 ing new legislation. Legislation passed in recent years includes laws with a potential
 impact on citizens'-rights-e.g., the Administrative Procedure Law, Lawyers Law,
 State Compensation Law, Prison Law, and Criminal Law-if they are enforced effec-
 tively. The Government has initiated efforts to educate lawyers, judges, prosecutors,
 and the public on the provisions of the new laws. China also has expanded its ef-
 forts to increase bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the field of law. For exam-
 ple, President Jiang agreed to increase such cooperation in October.
 The revised Criminal Procedure Law, which came into effect on January 1, pro-
 vided for the defendant's right to legal counsel, an active legal defense, and other
 rights of criminal defendants recognized in international human rights instruments.
 If fully implemented, the law would bring China's criminal law closer toward com-
 pliance wit    trnaional norms.
 Nonapproved religious groups, including Protestant and Catholic groups, experi-
 enced varying degrees of official interference and repression as the Government con-
 tinued to enforce 1994 State Council regulations requiring all religious organiza-
 tions to register with the Government and come under the supervision of official,
 "patriotic" religious organizations. There was evidence that authorities in some
 areas, guided by national policy, made strong efforts to control the activities of un-
 approved Catholic and Protestant churches, and some church leaders or adherents
 were arrested or remained in detention or prison because of their religious activi-
 ties. In other regions, registered and unregistered churches are treated similarly by
 the authorities and congreants worship in both types of churches. Despite this
 pressure, the number of religious adherents in many churches, both registered and
 unregistered, continued to grow at a rapid pace. Citizens worshipping in officially
 sanctioned churches, mosques, and temples reported little or no day-to-day inter-
 ference by the Government. The Government estimates that China has 4 million
 registered Catholics, 10 to 15 million registered Protestants, and 18 million Mos-
 lems. They worship in some 12,000 churches and 30,000 mosques. Nongovernmental
 estimates indicate that as many as 30 million Christians worship privately in house
 churches that are not registered with the Government. The Government released a
 white paper on religion in October, which defended government practices and stated
 that citizens' rights should conform to international conventions.
 Chinese society continued to become more open and to diversify at a rapid pace.
 New social groups with economic resources at their disposal have arisen and started
 to play a role in community life. Although citizens still do not have the right to
 change their national leaders or form of government, several hundred million Chi-
 
 
 715
 nese have participated in the Government's village elections program, which allowed
 basic democratic expression in multicandidate elections for nongovernmental local
 village committees. Satellite television broadcasts are widely available, particularly
 in coastal provinces, despite the Government's efforts to regulate the sale and use
 of satellite dishes. Cable television also is available in many cities, including access
 to global news networks. Increasing numbers of citizens have access to the Internet
 although the Government continued efforts to control the content of material avail-
 able on the Internet. Average citizens go about their daily lives with more personal
 freedom than ever before. They also continued to enjoy a higher disposable income,
 looser economic controls, greater freedom of movement, increased access to outside
 sources of information, greater room for individual choice, and more diversity in cul-
 tural life. However, those Chinese who seek to express openly dissenting political
 and religious views still live in an environment filled with repression.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were reports of a number of
 extrajudicial killings related to separatist activity in the Xinjiang region. In Feb-
 ruary police dispersed a crowd of women in Yining during the Ramadan Festival.
 In subsequent protests of this action, police killed at least 10, and perhaps as many
 as 70, Uyghur demonstrators. On April 24, in Yining security forces killed two pro-
 testers when they opened fire on a crowd that had surrounded a bus carrying indi-
 viduals convicted of involvement in the February riots.
 There is no reliable information about the number of extrajudicial killings nation-
 wide. There continued to be numerous executions carried out after summary trials.
 These trials can occur under circumstances where the lack of due process protec-
 tions borders on extrajudicial killing (see Section i.e.).
 In December 1996, the official press reported that four policemen in Zhejiang
 province were sentenced to up to 11 years in jail for torturing a bank robbery sus-
 pect to death:
 Xinjiang separatist groups also committed killings. On February 25, three bombs
 exploded on buses in the regional capital of Urumqi killing nine persons. Several
 people were killed on March 7 when a bomb linked to Uyghur separatists exploded
 aboard a bus in one of Beijing's busiest shopping districts. There were also reports
 in September that nine officials in Xinjiang were killed in antigovernment attacks.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new reports of disappearances. The Govern-
 ment, however, still has not provided a comprehensive, credible accounting of all
 those missing or detained in connection with the suppression of the 1989
 Tiananmen demonstrations. Long incommunicado detentions continued (see Section
 1.d.), although there were fewer reports than in 1996.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture; however, both official Chinese sources and international
 human rights groups reported cases in which police and other elements of the secu-
 rity apparatus employed torture or degrading treatment in dealing with detainees
 and prisoners. Former detainees have credibly reported that officials used electric
 shocks, prolonged periods of solitary confinement and incommunicado detention,
 beatings, shackles, and other forms of abuse against detained men and women. Per-
 sons detained pending trial were particularly at risk during p retrial detention due
 to systemic weaknesses in the legal system, many of which were addressed by
 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law, which became effective on January 1.
 In May prison officials placed labor activist Liu Nianchun in solitary confinement
 for 10 days and beat him with an electric baton to p unish him for refusing food.
 Liu had started a hunger strike to protest beatingsby prison guards who wanted
 him to renounce his antigovernment views. Wei Jingsheng reported that he was
 beaten by fellow inmates with the encouragement of prison authorities and that the
 inmate who instigated these attacks was rewarded with a reduced sentence. In the
 months before his November release, Wei was under 24-hour surveillance in a light-
 ed, glass-walled cell. He was denied reading material. Relatives and friends of evan-
 gelist Xu Yongze reported in March that he and other detainees with him were beat-
 en by Henan authorities.
 The Government has stated that "the Chinese judiciary deals with every com-
 plaint of torture promptly after it is filed, and those found guilty are punished ac-
 cording to law. The official media reports on torture cases, but many are believed
 to go unreported. One central government prosecutor reported to a visiting delega-
 tion that his office investigated hundreds of cases a year of alleged torture by secu-
 rity personnel. On February 21, the Jilin Provincial People's Procuratrate reported
 that it had investigated 34 cases of "extorting confession by torture" during the pre-
 
 
 716
 vious year in that province alone. In December 1996, four policemen received sen-
 tences of up to 11 years for torturing a suspect to death (see Section L.a.). According
 to the Supreme People's Procuratorate, 5,214 cases of "unethical activities" by po-
 licemen were investigated between 1985 and mid-1996. The Government has pro-
 vided no information on convictions and punishment in these cases.
 Conditions in penal institutions for both political prisoners and common criminals
 are generally harsh, and frequently degrading. China's 1994 Prison Law was de-
 signed, in part, to improve treatment of detainees and respect for their legal rights.
 The Government's stated goal is to convert one-half of the nation's prisons and 150
 reeducation-through-labor camps into "modernized, civilized" facilities by the year
 2010. According to credible sources, persons held in new "model" prisons receive bet-
 ter treatment than those held in other prison facilities.
 Adequate, timely medical care for prisoners continues to be a serious problem, de-
 spite official assurances that prisoners have the right to prompt medical treatment
 if they become ill. Nutritional and health conditions can be grim. Political prisoners
 who reportedly had difficulties in obtaining medical treatment, despite repeated ap-
 pals on their behalf by their families and the international community, included
 WagDan, Liu Nianchun, Zhou Guoqiang, Gao Yu, Bishop Zeng Jingmu, Chen
 Lantao, and Wei Jingsheng. According to one credible report, tere have been in-
 stances where women in reeducation-through-labor camps found to be pregnant
 while serving sentences were forced to submit to abortions (see Section l.f.).
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons or reeduca-
 tion-through-labr camps, and prisoners remain largely inaccessible to international
 human rights organizations. However, the Government took several steps toward
 greater transparency in the p rison system. A delegation of the United Nations
 orin   Group on Arbitrary Detention visited China for 10 days in October. The
 grup visited prisons and reducation-thrugh-labor camps in Beijing, Shanghai,
 hengdu, and Tibet. The Government allowen the U.N. team to choose at random
 some of the prisoners interviewed at each facility. Interviews with certain prisoners
 were conducted without the presence of Chinese officials. Talks between the Govern-
 ment and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on prison visits re-
 sumed in June. By year's end, no agreement had been reached. Finally, the Govern-
 ment resumed cooperation with a prominent foreign businessman/human rights ac-
 tivist on prisoner accounting, and the Ministry of Justice provided him with infor-
 mation on more than 11 cases by year's end.
 d. Arbitray Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention remain
 problems. The amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law, which came into effect
 on January 1, represented a significant improvement in the laws governing arrest
 and detention. Among other things, the amendments provide for earlier and greater
 access for defendants to legal counsel and the abolition of a 1983 regulation that
 allowed summary trials in certain cases involving the death penalty. U nder the old
 system, defendants were not allowed to hire a lawyer until 7 days before trial, usu-
 ally precluding the possibility of mounting an effective defense. The amended law
 gives suspects the rht to seek legal counsel from the time of their initial detention
 and interrogation. e Government has initiated efforts to educate lawyers, judges,
 prosecutors, and the public in the provisions of the new law and has undertaen
 a well-publicized effort to establish legal aid centers for indigent defendants. Anec-
 dotal evidence suggested, however, that in some cases implementing regulations
 promulgated by the Public Security Ministry, Ministry of Justice, Supreme People's
 Procuratorato, and Supreme People's Court have resulted in ontraditory and in-
 complete implementation of the new amendments.
 Despite these reforms, the Criminal Procedure Law still would fall short of inter-
 national standards in many respects if fully implemented. While an often criticized
 form of administrative detention known as "shelter and investigation" that allowed
 police to detain suspects for extended periods without charge was abolished, police
 can still detain a person for up to 14 or 37 days, depending on the nature of his
 alleged offense before formally placing him under arrest. Once a suspect is arrested,
 the revised law still allows  o  rice and prosecutors to detain him for months before
 trial while a case is being "further investigated." On June 3, a court in Shenzhen
 finally sentenced labor activists Li Weming and Guo Baosheng to 3o years in pris-
 on for "conspiring to subvert the Government." Li and Guo had already spent more
 than 3 years in jail without sentencing. Both Li and Guo were released in late 1997
 at the completion of their terms (see Section 6.a.). Two foreigners remained in jail,
 without either a verdict or a sentence, over a year after their trials were concluded,
 despite many interventions on their behalf by their government.
 Und      he revised Criminal Procedures Law, detained criminal suspects, defend-
 ants, their legal representatives, and close relatives are entitled to  1 for a guar-
 antor to enable the suspect or defendant to await trial out of custody. The law pro-
 
 
 717
 vides that if the people's courts, people's procuratorates, and public security organs
 decide to allow a criminal suspect or defendant to obtain a guarantor and await trial
 out of custody, they should order the suspect or defendant to name a guarantor or
 pay bail. The law stipulates that authorities must notify a detainee's fanily or work
 unit of his detention within 24 hours. In practice, however, timely notification re-
 mains a serious problem. Under a sweeping exception to the law, officials need not
 provide notification if it would "hinder the investigation" of a case.
 In theory, the Administrative Procedure Law of 1994 permits a detainee to chal-
 lenge the eall   of detention. In the past, however, lack of timely access to legal
 ounsel inhibited the effective use of this law. The expanded rights to a lawyer pro-
 vided for in the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law are designed to im-
 prove this situation. In addition, the State Compensation Law provides a legal basis
 or citizens to recover damages for illegal detentions. Although the majority of citi-
 zens apparently remain unaware of this 1995 law, there is evidence that it is having
 some limited impact. The Supreme People's Procuratorate reported on March 11,
 that in 1996 it had investigated 379 criminal compensation claims, reached a con-
 clusion in 110 cases, and awarded compensation in 44 cases.
 Because the Government tightly controls information, it is impossible to accu-
 rately determine the total num er of people subjected to new or continued arbitrary
 arrest or detention but estimates are in the thousands. The Supreme Peoples
 Procuratorate reported in March that it had reversed 570 "incorrect arrest deci-
 sions" in the previous year. The Jilin Provincial People's Procuratorate report of
 February 21 said that the office had investigated 80 cases of illegal detention during
 the previous year in that province alone. There are documented cases where local
 officials and business leaders illegally conspired to use detention as a means of ex-
 erting pressure in commercial disputes involving Chinese and foreign businessmen.
 There were other cases where foreign businessmen had their passports confiscated
 during such disputes.
 A major shortcoming of the recent amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law
 is that they do not affect the reeducation-through-labor system, which permits au-
 thorities to sentence detainees to terms of I to 3 years in labor camps without trial.
 The Labor Reeducation Committee, which determines the term of detention, may ex-
 tend an inmate's sentence for an additional year. Wang Ming, a democracy activist
 in Sichuan who had called for the release of Wei Jingsheng, was sentenced in Janu-
 ary to 3 years of reeducation through labor. Activist Liu Huanwen was also sen-
 tenced to 3 years of reeducation through labor on April 7. Catholic Bishop Zeng
 Jingmu, Chen Longde, Hu Kesi and other dissidents remained in labor camps. The
 sentences of Liu Nianchun and Zhou Guoqiang's were extended 6 days for every
 month remaining in their sentences for refu~sing to prepare written confessions. In
 December, however, the Ministry of Justice reversed the decision to extend their
 sentences, and Zhou was released in January 1998.
 Authorities continued the practice of detaining or tightening control over political
 and labor activists or inviting then to take "vacations" at "sensitive" times during
 the year, but there were fewer reports of this practice than in 1996. Shen Liangqing
 was picked up by police officers at his home in Anhui province days before the open-
 ing of the 15th Chinee Communist Party Congress. Shen had coauthored an open
 letter to President Jiang Zemin and other senior leaders demanding justice for op-
 pressed workers" after reported police suppression of labor unrest in Sichuan's
 anyang city in July. Dissidents in Beijing were reportedly warned against causing
 trouble during the August visit of a high ranking foreign official. The Government
 also stepped up surveillance on family members of leading dissidents during the Oc-
 tber visit of the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. At year's end, the
 authorities continued to detain citizens for political reasons (see Section i.e.).
 The Government continued to refuse reentry into China by dissidents and activ-
 ists (see Section 2.d.), but there were no reports of the Government forcibly exiling
 citizens. However, the Government's denial of permission to some former reeduca-
 tion-tbrough-labor camp inmates to return to their homes constitutes a form of in-
 ternal exile (see  were Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution states that the courts shall, in
 accordance with the law, exercise judicial power independently. However, in prac-
 tice, the judiciary is subject to policy guidance from the Government and the Chi-
 nese Communist Party, whose leaders use a variety of means to direct courts on ver-
 dicts and sentences in politically sensitive cases. Corruption and conflicts of interest
 also affect judicial decisionmaking.
 The Supreme People's Court stands at the apex of the court system, followed in
 descending order by the higher, intermediate, and basic people's courts. Judges are
 appointed by the people's congresses at the corresponding level. There are special
 courts for handling melitary, maritime, and railway transport cases.
 
 
 Officials often have ignored the due process provisions of the law and of the Con-
 stitution. For example, authorities can subject prisoners to severe psychological
 pessure to confess, and coerced confessions are freenty introduced as evidence.
 an accused drug smuggler, was reportedy interrogated for 50 straight
 hours in July before a greeing to sign a confession. Defendants who fail to show the
 orrect attitude by onfessing their crimes are typically sentened more harshly. The
 conviction rate is over 90 percent. There is an a p peals process, but appeals generally
 do not reverse verdicts. The law requires that all trials be held in public, but a 1988
 law on state secrets provides for an exception in cases involving state secrets. This
 provision has been used to keep proceedings closed to the public and, in some cases,
 even family members in sensitive cases. Pastr Xu Yongze s family received no noti-
 fication of his mid-1997 trial.
 The revised Criminal Procedure Law is designed to address many of these defi-
 ciencies and give defense lawyers a greater ability to argue their clients' cases, in
 order to change the practice of holding trials that are essentially sentencing hear-
 ings. The new amendments abolish the form of pretrial detention called "shelter and
 investigation," expand the right to counsel, put limits on nonjudicial determinations
 of guilt, and establish a more transparent, adversarial trial process. Coerced confes-
 sions are expressly forbidden, although there is still no law barring coerced confes-
 sions from being introduced into evidence. The amendments do not, however, bring
 China into full compliance with international standards. For example, in "state se-
 crets" cases the revised Criminal Procedures Law authorizes officials to deny sus-
 pects access to a lawyer while their cases are being investigated. The definition of
 state secrets is broad and vague and subject to independent interpretation by police,
 prosecutors, and judges at different stages in a criminal case. Uncertainty regarding
 the scope and application of this statute has created concern about a detainee a right
 to leg assistance.
 In what may turn out to be a landmark case in Chinese legal history, in June
 a court in Jilin province overturned the convictions of four dissidents connected to
 the Tiananmen protests of 1989, marking the first time a conviction for
 counterrevolutionary crimes has been reversed. Tang Yuanjuan and Li Wei, who
 were still in prison at the time they won their appeal, were released.
 China's first Lawyers' Law, designed to professionalize the legal profession, took
 effect January 1996. Accordingly, the Ministry of Justice drafted relevant regula-
 tions to standardize professional performance, lawyer-client relations, and the ad-
 ministration of lawyers and law firms. The new law recognized for the first time
 that lawyers represent their clients, not the State. The bill also granted lawyers for-
 mal permission to establish law fin-ms, established educational requirements for
 legal practitioners, encouraged free legal services for the general public, and pro-
 vided for the disciplining of lawyers. Gvernment officials state that there is an in-
 sufficient number of lawyers to meet the country's growing needs. A key element
 in Justice Ministry efforts to encourage legal reform is a plan to have 150,000 law-
 yers, 30,000 notaries, and 40,000 grassroots legal service centers by the year 2000.
 Minister of Justice Xiao Yang stated in December that China currently has 114,000
 lawyers, 18,000 notarial personnel, and more than 8,300 law offices. Lawyers are
 organizing private law firms outside the framework of established government legal
 offices that are self-regulating and do not have their personnel or budgets deter-
 mined directly by the State.
 During the first half of the year, attorneys handled 115,000 legal aid cases in six
 provinces and municipalities, including Shanghai and Guangdong. In the past, how-
 ever, defendants have frequently found it difficult to find an attorney willing to han-
 dle sensitive political and religious cases. It is unclear to what extent government
 reform efforts and new legislation are changing the past practice of authorities re-
 voking the licenses of lawyers representing political defendants. Government-em-
 ployed lawyers still depend on an official work unit for employment, housing, and
 other benefits and therefore many may be reluctant to be seen as overzealous in
 representing politically sensitive defendants.
 The effects of the lack of due process are particularly egregious in death penalty
 cases. A 1995 law raised the number of capital offenses from 26 to 65, and included
 financial crimes such as counterfeiting currency, passing fake negotiable notes and
 letters of credit, and illegal "pooling' of funds. In May 1996, the Supreme Court
 ruled that crimes resulting in death should be punished by death regardless of ex-
 tenuating circumstances. Amnesty International (AI) reported in August, based on
 a review of Chinese press accounts, that in 1996 China sentenced more than 6,100
 convicts to death and carried out 4,367 executions. More summary executions were
 reported as officials continued to promote the "strike-hard," national anticrime cam-
 paign. A high court nominally reviews all death sentences, but the time between ar-
 rest and execution is often days, and reviews have consistently resulted in a con-
 
 
 719
 firmation of sentence. The Al report included one case in which a man was con-
 victed on May 13, 1996 and executed on May 19, 1996. According to a Chinese news-
 paper, the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People's Court held a public sentencing on
 June 26, at which seven previously convicted criminals were given the death pen-
 alty. The convicts were "escorted to the execution ground and executed by shooting
 after the meeting." No executions for political offenses are known to have occurred
 in 1997.
 In recent years, credible reports have alleged that organs from some executed
 prisoners were removed, sold, and transplanted. Officials have confirmed that exe-
 cuted prisoners are among the sources of organs for transplant, but maintain that
 consent is required from prisoners or their relatives before organs are removed.
 There is no national law governing organ donations, but a Ministry of Health direc-
 tive explicitly states that buying and selling human organs and tissues is not al-
 lowed.
 Government officials deny that China holds any political prisoners, asserting that
 authorities detain persons not for the political or religious views that they hold, but
 because they violate the Criminal Law. However, the authorities continue to confine
 citizens for political and religious reasons. It is estimated that thousands of political
 prisoners remain imprisoned or detained. Vice Minister of Justice Zhang Xiufu told
 a press conference on May 30 that there were 2,026 prisoners in China jailed for
 "counterrevolutionary crimes," a charge often lodged in the past against political dis-
 sidents. Thousands more were charged with criminal offenses, detained but not
 charged, or sentenced in an extrajudicial process to 1- to 3-years in reeducation-
 through-labor camps.
 Defendants are legally entitled to challenge reeducation-through-labor sentences
 under the Administrative Proedures Law. Sme persons have gained a reduction
 in, or suspension of, their sentences after reconsideration or appeal, but problems
 such as short appeal times and inadequate legal counsel weaken the effectiveness
 of the law in preventing or reversing arbitrary decisions. Few appeals are success-
 ful. Liu Xiaobo's appeal was rejected in March.
 The   new  Criminal Law, which      came  into  effect in  October, replaced
 "counterrevolutionary" offenses with provisions barring "treasonous acts designed to
 threaten national security." Crimes that threaten national security are loosey de-
 fined and some observers think they will be used to punish the same crimes cov-
 ered under the counterrevolutionary laws. Before this new law became effective, po-
 litical dissidents Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan were both sentenced for "conspiracy
 to overthrow the government" to 14 years and 11 years respectively. Labor activists
 Li Wenming and Guo Baosheng, who had been detained since 1994, were given
 lighter sentences than the legaly prescribed minimum for the charge of subversion
 when their sentences were handed down in May, 6 months after their trial. They
 were released in late 1997. Those charged with counterrevolutionary crimes con-
 tinue to serve their sentences.
 The Government released early certain prisoners detained for their political or re-
 ligious beliefs, including Xi Yang, Zhao Lei, Zhou Guoqiang, and Yu Zhenbin. Other
 prisoners were released in 1997 upon completion of their sentences, including Zhang
 Lin and Ba Ge. Bao Tong was released from house arrest, although forced to give
 up his government quarters in Beijing and move with his family to an apartment
 in the suburbs, where he remains closely monitored. Many others, including Liu
 Nianchun, Liu Xiaobo, Li Hai, Bishop Zeng Jingmu, Ngawang Choephel,' and
 Ngawang Sandrol (see Tibet Addendum) remained imprisoned or under other forms
 of detention during the year. Chen Ziming remained under house arrest at year's
 end.
 Criminal punishments can include "deprivation of political rights" for a fixed pe-
 riod after release from prison, during which the individual is denied rights of free
 speech and association. Former prisoners often also find their status in socieyabil-
 ity to find employment, freedom to travel, and access to residence permits an social
 services severely restricted. Economic reforms and social changes have ameliorated
 these problems for nonpolitical prisoners to some extent in recent years. Former po-
 litical prisoners and their families, however, are frequently subjected to police sur-
 veillance, phone taps, searches, and other forms of harassment, and also may en-
 counter difficulty in obtaining or keeping employment and housing. Chinese security
 personnel are posted at the homes of and follow the close relatives of prominent dis-
 sidents such as Wang Dan and Chen Ziming, particularly during sensitive periods.
 On occasion, Chen Ziming's wife was followed by 10 or more Public Security Bureau
 personnel on motorbikes or in cars. Dissidents Xu Shuiliang, Bao Ge, and others
 were prevented from taking employment following their releases and were under
 constant surveillance. Bao (l's mother sent an open letter to President Jiang Zemin
 in September, pleading for an end to the police and municipal government harass-
 
 
 720
 ment that had made it impossible for Bao Ge to find a job after his release from
 a labor camp in June. Fearing rearrest, Bao Ge left China in October. Government
 harassment has prevented relatives of Chen Ziming, Liu Nianchun, Qin Yongmin,
 and other dissidents from obtaining and keeping steady employment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Govern-
 meat interference in daily personal and family life continues to decline for the aver-
 age Chinese citizen. In urban areas, most people still depend on government-linked
 work units for housing, permission to have a child, approval to apply for a passrt
 and other aspects of ordinary life. However, the work unit and the neighbrhood
 committee, which were originally charged with monitoring activities and attitudes,
 have become less important as means of social or political control. Political "study
 sessions," meant to instill in all citizens a common, party-approved political line, no
 longer play a meaningful role in shaping attitudes and are infrequent, if held at all.
 Work units reportedly have refused to cooperate with police requests to provide de-
 tention for employees.
 However, despite legal protections, authorities often do not respect the privacy of
 citizens in practice. Although the law requires warrants before security forces can
 search premises, this provision can be ignored by authorities; moreover, the Public
 Security Bureau and the procuratorate can issue search warrants on their own au-
 thority. The Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of correspondence of citi-
 zens are protected by law." In practice, however, authorities often monitor telephone
 conversations, fax transmissions, electronic mail, and Internet communications of
 foreign visitors, businessmen, diplomats, and journalists, as well as Chinese dis-
 sidents, activists, and others. Authorities also open and censor domestic and inter-
 national mail. In November 1996, Han Chunsheng, a Voice of America (VOA) lis-
 tener who allegedly sent over 20 letters critical of China to the VOA mailbox in
 Bijing between the summer of 1995 and May 1996, was sentenced to 8 years' im-
 prisonment on the charge of counterrevolutionary incitement and propaganda.
 Around mid-year, Wan     an's amily stopped receiving foreign mail. Government
 security organs monitor and sometimes restrict contact between foreigners and citi-
 zens. Rules implementing the State Security Law define as a violation of the law
 "activities of individuals outside the country (including non-Chinese citizens resi-
 dent in China) who disregard dissuasion and meet with personnel in the country
 who have endangered state security or who are seriously suspected of endangering
 state security." Dissidents are routinely warned not to speak with the foreign press.
 The Government encouraged expansion of Internet and other communications in-
 frastructure. Internet use among Chinese is expanding exponentially, creating a po-
 tentially powerful channel of information to the computer-literate. Estimates of the
 number of Chinese connected to the Internet vary from 200,000 to over 600,000, al-
 though the majority of users are on e-mail only accounts. Chinese authorities con-
 tinue to try to control Internet content by blocking politically sensitive web sites,
 including those of some major foreign news organizations and dissident groups. A
 number of human rights web pages are, however, accessible, including that of the
 Tibet government-in-exile. The Government's efforts to block content and control
 usage have limited effectiveness because users can easily use browser "proxies" to
 bypass site blocking. E-mail and e-mail publications are more difficult to block, and
 there is no indication that the Government has attempted to do so. Chinese dis-
 sident groups abroad have successfully used e-mail to send publications to readers
 in China. In May the State Council issued regulations requiring those involved in
 international networking to apply for licenses and provide details regarding the
 scope and nature of their activities. In December the State Council promulgated a
 comprehensive list of prohibited Internet activities, including using the Internet to
 "incite the overthrow of the Government or the Socialist system" and "incite division
 of the country, harming national unification." The regulations, which came into ef-
 fect on December 30, provide for fines and other unspecified punishments to deal
 with violators.
 The authorities continue to jam VOA broadcasts, but the effectiveness of this in-
 terference varies considerably by region, with audible signals of VOA and other
 short-wave broadcasters reaching most parts of China, including the capital. Radio
 Free Asia began operation in Chinese and Tibetan in 1996. In August monitors in
 Beijing and Hong Kong reported that for the first time some Radio Free Asia trans-
 missions in Mandrin were being jammed.
 The Government continued to implement comprehensive and often intrusive fam-
 ily planning policies. The State Family Planning Commission formulates and imple-
 ments policies with assistance from the Family Planning Association, which has 83
 million members in 1.02 million branches. Chinese demographers at an October con-
 ference predicted that the population would reach almost 1.56 billion in the year
 2044 if the current fertility rate continued. Most estimated fertility at 2.1 births per
 
 
 721
 woman-indicating that the "one-child policy" is not applied to the majority of Chi-
 nese couples. Couples in urban areas are most affected, seldom receiving permission
 to have more than one child, although the Government maintains that urban cou-
 ples who themselves were only children may now receive permission to have two
 6hildren. Outside the cities, exceptions to the "one-child policy" are becoming the
 norm. The average number of children per family in rural areas, where 70 percent
 of the people live, is slightly over two. In rural areas, couples are allowed to have
 a second clild if the first is a girl, an exception that takes into account both the
 demands of farm labor and the traditional preference for boys. Some ethnic minori-
 ties, such as Muslim Uyghurs and Tibetans, are subject to less stringent population
 controls. Minorities in some rural areas are permitted to have as many as four chil-
 dren. In remote areas, such as rural Tibet, there are no effective limits at all.
 Population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic incen-
 tives, as well as on more coercive measures, including psychological pressure and
 economic penalties. Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy include monthly
 stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits. Disciplinary measures
 against those who violate the policy can include fines, withholding of social services,
 demotion, and other administrative punishments that sometimes result in loss of
 employment. Penalties for excess births can also be levied against local officials and
 the mothers' work units, thus creating multiple sources of pressure. Fines for giving
 birth without authorization vary, but they can be a formidable disincentive. Accord-
 ing to the State Family Planning Commission 1996 family planning manual, over
 24 million fines were assessed between 1985 and 1993 for children born outside
 family planning rules. In Fujian, the standard fine has been calculated to be twice
 a family's gross annual income; additional, unauthorized births incur fines assessed
 in increments of 50 percent per child. In Guangzhou the standard fine is calculated
 to be 30 to 50 percent of 7 years income for the average resident. In some cases
 a 'social compensation fee" is also imposed. Unpaid fines have sometimes resulted
 in confiscation or destruction of homes and personal property by local officials.
 Central government officials acknowledge that such incidents occur, but insist that
 cases like these are neither the norm nor in line with official policy; they attribute
 such behavior to ignorance or 'unsophisticated thinking" on the part of local offi-
 cials. In September several dozen people in the town of Changb, Guangdong prov-
 ince, reportedly clashed with local police because they blamed the death of a village
 woman on an intrauterine device that had been inserted as part of the official fam-
 ily planning program. Several hundred peasants in Gaozhou city, Guangdong prov-
 ince, and neighboring villages staged protests in September against fines imposed
 by the local government for family planning violations.
 The Government prohibits the use of force to compel persons to submit to abortion
 or sterilization, but poor supervision of local officials who are under intense pressure
 to meet family planning targets can result in instances of abuse, including forced
 abortion and sterilization. During an unauthorized pregnancy, a woman is often vis-
 ited by family planning agents and pressured to terminate the pregnancy. There
 were credible reports in 1996 that several women were forced to undergo abortions
 of unauthorized pregnancies in Fujian. Officials maintain that, when discovered,
 those responsible for such coercion are disciplined and undergo retraining, but they
 have not provided any data or examples that confirm this assertion. Individuals also
 can sue officials who exceed their authority in implementing family planning policy,
 and there are instances where individuals have exercised this right. The Chinese
 press reported in November a case in Yongshan township, Jiangxi province, in
 ich a 15-year-old girl and her mother took local authorities to court for forcing
 the girl to undergo a pregnancy test. Citing the girl's "psychological and economic
 losses," the court ordered the Yongshan township government to make a formal
 apology to the girl and pay her $323 in compensation. Not satisfied with the judg-
 ment, the girl's family sai that it would file an appeal to seek higher compensation.
 According to one credible report, some women in reeducation-through-labor camps
 found to be pregnant while serving sentences were forced to submit to abortions,
 despite the offficial prohibition on forced abortion.
 Regulations forbid the termination of pregnancies based on the sex of the fetus,
 but because of the traditional preference for male children, particularly in rural
 areas, some families have used ultrasound to identify female fetuses. Use of
 ultrasound for this purpose is specifically prohibited by the Maternal and Child
 Health Care Law, which calls for punishment of medical practitioners who violate
 this provision. According to the State Family Planning Commission, a handful of
 doctors have been charged under this law. The Chinese press has reported that the
 national ratio of male to female births is 114 to 100; in September the World Health
 Organization estimated the ratio to be 117 to 100. The statistical norm is 106 male
 births to 100 female. Official statistics may exclude many female births, especially
 
 
 722
 the second or third in a family. Such births are unreported so that the parents can
 keep trying to conceive a boy. These statistics also probably reflect, however, the
 abuse of sonography and the termination of pregnancies based on the sex of the
 fetus. Female infanticide, abandonment, or neglect of baby girls may also be a factor
 in some areas.
 The Maternal and Child Health Care Law, which came into effect in 1995, calls
 for premarital and prenatal examinations to determine whether couples have acute
 infectious diseases, certain mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or
 are at risk for passing on debilitating genetic diseases. The Ministry of Health, not
 the State Family Planning Commission, implements the law, which mandates abor-
 tion or sterilization in some cases, based on medical advice. The law also provides
 for obtaining a second opinion and states that patients or their guardians must give
 written consent to such procedures (see Section 5). At least five provincial govern-
 ments have implemented local regulations seeking to prevent people with severe
 mental disabilities from having children.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution states that freedom
 of speech and freedom of the press are fundamental rights enjoyed by all citizens,
 the Government interprets the Communist Party's "leading role," as mandated in
 the preamble to the Constitution, as circumscribing these rights. It does not permit
 citizens to publish or broadcast criticism of senior leaders or opinions that contradict
 basic Communist Party doctrine. The party and Government continue to control
 tightly print and broadcast media and use them to propagate the current ideological
 line. There are 10,000 openly distributed publications in China, including 2,200
 newspapers. During the year, the Central Propaganda Department instructed all
 provinces and municipalities to set up a special team to review publications. All
 media employees are under explicit, public orders to follow CCP directives, and
 "guide public opinion" as directed by political authorities. Both formal and informal
 guidelines continue to require reporters to avoid coverage of sensitive subjects and
 negative news. Journalists also must protect state secrets in accordance with the
 State Security Law (see Section i.e.). These public orders, guidelines, and laws
 greatly restrict the freedom of broadcast journalists and newspapers to report the
 news and leads to a high degree of self-censorship. In October leading dailies in
 China carried a translation of a major policy speech by a foreign official; however,
 a lengthy section on human rights was dropped from the translation.
 In lanuary the State Council issued new regulations governing the publishing in-
 dustry that provided for citizens' rights to "freely express their view on state affairs
 and publish academic and literary works" but stipulated that people cannot publish
 any material that is contrary to the Constitution, reveals state secrets, endangers
 the national security, or harms the country. The effect of these regulations at year's
 end was unclear.
 In September President Jiang called for increased supervision over the media and
 the arts to check the spread of "decadent ideas." On October 1, regulations banning
 foreign ownership or management of theaters, music halls, radio stations, networks,
 production studios, booking agencies, and publishing and printing enterprises went
 into effect. Foreign films face strict quotas and censorship.
 During the year, a number of Chinese spoke out publicly to criticize the Govern-
 ment or express views contrary to the official line. The Government's response to
 these dissenters varied, but, overall, was somewhat more tolerant than in recent
 years. Zhang Lin, who was released from prison in June and subsequently co-au-
 thored an open letter to Jiang Zemin calling for better treatment of "oppressed
 workers," was granted a passport and allowed to leave the country. The other co-
 author of the letter, Shen Liangqing was briefly detained. After his release in June,
 democracy activist Bao Ge publicly lobbied the Government in support of a series
 of controversial causes, including war reparations from Japan, reassessment of the
 Tiananmen incident, and the cremation of Mao's corpse. Bao also filed a case in the
 Shanghai courts arguing that his rights had been violated during his 3 years in a
 labor camp because prison administrators had denied him writing materials and ac-
 cess to visitors. Bao was allowed to carry c'ut these activities under tight surveil-
 lance for several months until the eve of the Communist Part Con   ss in Septem-
 ber, when public security officials beat and briefly detained him. Fearing rearrest,
 Baa Go left China in October. Lin Mu, the secretary of the late Communist Party
 leader fu Yaobang, in September sent an open letter to the 15th Party Congress
 calling for a reassessment of the Tiananmen Sare Massacre. No action was taken
 against him. A former party leader reportedly approved sending a letter on political
 issues under his name to party leaders; as a result, the conditions of his house ar-
 rest were tightened.
 
 
 723
 There were other calls from those "within the system' for greater political reform.
 In August Be ing University Professor Shang Dewen publicly advocated a 25-year
 program of political reform that would include the phased adoption of direct elec-
 tions for senior government officials, a directly electedparliament, an independent
 judiciary, and a free press. In a September speech before the foreign press corps,
 author Wang Shan called on the Government to ease controls on the news media.
 A new book of essays by senior academics, entitled "A Critical Moment," called for
 direct elections of leaders "when conditions are ripe." Beijing intellectual Fang Jue
 ubished and disseminated an article advocating elections, freedom of press, and
 faster eonomc reforms. These authors were not punished or harassed by the Chi-
 nese authorities. Since the release of Wei Jingsheng in November, there were more
 demands for legal and political reform and a review of the Tiananmen Incident. In
 private conversations among family and friends, citizens generally feel freer than
 in the past to express personal views on politics, even if those views are critical of
 the Government.
 The Government continued, however, to control tightly dissenting views and pun-
 ish those who voiced such views when it felt that its authority was directly chal-
 lenged or that social stability was threatened. Shen Liangqing, who was released
 from a labor camp in June, was briefly detained in Anhui province in September
 after sending an open letter to Chinese leaders demanding justice for oppressed
 workers and action against corrupt officials. Shen also had written a series of letters
 calling for the release of Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng. During the 15th Communist
 Party Congress, authorities censored editions of the International Herald Tribune
 that carried a photorph of police arresting a protester outside the Great Hall of
 the People where the Congress was taking place. The state-owned media also
 blocked at least one foreign news report showing footage of then party secretary
 Zhao Ziyang addressing student protesters in Tiananmen Square during the 1989
 protests.
 The Government initially denied but subsequently issued a visa to a foreign jour-
 nalist who had written stories critical of the country. Reporters were subjected to
 surveillance and, on occasion, harassment. A German journalist was held for several
 days under loose house arrest in a hotel in Anhui province for conducting an "illegal
 interview" with the younger brother of Wei Jingsheng. He subsequently resumed his
 journalistic activities in China.
 Despite these government controls, uncontrolled information about the nation and
 the world is flowing into the country at an increasing rate. Residents in Guangdong
 and other parts of southern China have access to Hong Kong television programs
 and newspapers. Throughout China, a lively tabloid sector continues to flourish.
 Radio talk shows remain popular, and, while avoiding politically sensitive subjects,
 they provide opportunities for citizens to air grievances about public issues. Despite
 licensing requirements, a small but rapidly growing segment of the population has
 access to satellite television broadcasts and most sites on the Internet. Most citizens
 have the means to own and use short-wave radios, and the Government does not
 place any restrictions on their use.
 Fierce competition and dwindling government subsidies have increased opportuni-
 ties for private publishers and booksellers, but the Government continued efforts to
 control the production and dissemination of publications. Despite efforts to limit the
 number of books published by controlling book registration numbers issued to offi-
 cially approved publishing houses, books continued to be published through
 unsanctioned channels.
 I The Government continues to impose ideological controls on political discourse at
 colleges, universities, and research institutes. In June, just prior to the Tiananmen
 anniversary, academics in Beijing were required to inform police in advance if they
 planned to hold conferences attended by more than 20 people in or out of the cap-
 ital. Academic discussions are often unrestricted but scholars and researchers report
 varying degrees of control regarding the issues that they may examine and the con-
 clusions that they may draw. Censorship of written material comes at the time of
 publication, or when intellectuals and scholars, anticipating that books or papers on
 political topics would be deemed too sensitive to be published, exercise self-censor-
 ship. In areas such as economic policy or legal reform, there was far greater official
 tolerance for comment and debate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, but the Government severely restricts this right in
 practice. The Constitution provides, for example, that such activities may not chal-
 enge  party leadership" or infringe upon the "interests of the State." Protests
 against the political system or its leaders are prohibited. Authorities deny permits
 and quickly move to suppress demonstrations involving expression of dissenting po-
 litical views. In March Beijing police arrested a man or distributing leaflets about
 
 
 724
 Tiananmen Square that demanded a government apology for the violent suppression
 of the 1989 student demonstrations. At least eight protesters were picked upby po-
 lice in Tiananmen Square during the 15th Party Congress. Police reportedly sup-
 pressed large-scale labor demonstrations in several provinces, including Sichuan.
 Estimates of the number of protesters in Mianyang, Sichuan, ranged from several
 hundred to several thousand. Approximately 1,000 rickshaw       drivers in Zigong,
 Sichuan, protested in December (see Section 6.a.). In May security officials in a
 major northeastern city responded to worker unrest by issuing a public notice ban-
 ning all demonstrations.
 The Government, however, showed greater tolerance in a number of instances of
 peaceful, public protest. In September the wife of jailed labor activist Liu Nianchun
 unfurled a protest banner in front of the Justice Ministry, demanding her husband's
 release on medical parole. Officials listened to her case and promised an investiga-
 tion. There are credible reports that small, peaceful protests that do not challenge
 the regime occur daily across the country. Demonstrators frequently gathered at the
 front gate of the State Family Planning Commission building and were left alone
 by police as long as they remained  ace ul. Protests on a wide range of issues occur
 at the Beijing city government hesdquarters every week or two.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, however, the Government re-
 stricts this right in practice. Communist Party regulations require that all profes-
 sional and social organizations officially register and be approved. Ostensibly aimed
 at secret societies and criminal gangs, these regulations also deter the formation of
 political, religious, and labor organizations that directly challenge government au-
 thority.
 Nevertheless, there are 1,500 national-level quasi-nongovernmental organizations
 and 200,000 similar lower level organizations registered with the Ministry of Civil
 Affairs. Although these organizations all come under some degree of government
 control, they are nonetheless increasingly able to develop their own agendas. The
 number of such organizations and the scope of their activities are growing rapidly.
 Many have support from foreign secular and religious nongovernmental organiza-
 tions. Some seek advocacy roles in public interest areas such as women's issues, the
 environment, and consumer rights. Before he fled China in October, Bao Ge joined
 with journalist Feng Yinzi, a member of the Shanghai Chinese People's Political
 Consultative Conference Standing Committee, to form a group to demand war rep-
 arations from Japan. The two wrote a letter in August to the Ministry of Civil Af-
 fairs seeking registration of their new organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief.
 Although there is no comprehensive legislation governing religious affairs, the
 Criminal Law states that government employees who illegally deprive citizens of
 this right may, if the case is serious, be sentenced to up to 2 years in prison. There
 are no known reports of persons being punished under this law. The Government,
 however, seeks to restrict religious practice to government-controlled and -sanc-
 tioned religious organizations and registered places of worship.
 The State Council is responsible for monitoring religious activity. During the year,
 the Government continued a national campaign to enforce 1994 State Council regu-
 lations that require all religious groups to register with government religious affairs
 bureaus and come under the supervision of official "patriotic" religious organiza-
 tions. Some religious groups were subjected to increased restrictions, although the
 degree of restrictions varied significantly from region to region and the number of
 religious adherents, in both unregistered and registered churches, continued to grow
 rapidly.
 In certain regions, government supervision appears to have loosened, but local im-
 p lementing regulations, such as those for Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangxi, call
 for strict government oversight. In some parts of the country registered and unregis-
 tered churches are treated similarly by authorities and congregants worship in both
 types of churches. In other areas, particularly in regions where considerable unoffi-
 cial and unregistered religious activity has taken place, authorities closely monitor
 places of worship and the relationship between unregistered and registered church-
 es is tense.
 At the end of 1996, the Government reported that more than 70,000 places of wor-
 ship had registered. During 1997 authorities continued the campaign to register all
 religious groups. Some groups registered voluntarily, some registered under pres-
 sure, while authorities refused to register others. Unofficial groups claim that au-
 thorities often refuse them registration without explanation. According to the Gov-
 ernment, these refusals were mainly the result of inadequate meeting spaces. Many
 religious groups have been reluctant to comply with the regulations out of principled
 opposition to state control of religion or for fear of adverse consequences if they re-
 vead, as required, the names and addresses of members and details about leadership
 
 
 725
 activities, finances, and contacts in China or abroad. In April one of the largest
 house churches in Zhejiang agreed under persistent pressure to apply for registra-
 tion on the condition that it would not be required to join the Three-Self Patriotic
 Movement or the Chinese Christian Council; however, provincial authorities judged
 that this condition was not in accord with government regulations, declared it Me-
 gal, and closed the church down.
 The State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau is responsible for judgi  the legit-
 imacy of religious activity. The Religious Affairs Bureau and the CCPUnited Front
 Work Department, staffed by officials who rarely are religious adherents, provide
 "guidance and supervision" over implementation of government regulations on reli-
 gion and on the role of foreigners in religious activity.
 The law does not prohibit religious believers from holding public office; however,
 Communist Party officials state that party membership and religious belief are in-
 compatible. According to an April Hong Kong newspaper article, the Communist
 Party issued a circular in early 1997 ordering party members not to adhere to reli-
 gious beliefs. In January 1995, the CCP circulated a document to party organza-
 tions at the provincial level ordering the expulsion of party members who be long
 to open or clandestine religious organizations. In November 1996, the PeoYle's Lib-
 eration Army Daily's report on military "spiritual civilization" stated that it is nec-
 essary to conduct education in atheism so that they (the militay) believe in science
 and oppose superstition. Participation in religious activities is forbidden." There is
 no availble evidence indicating whether party or PLA military personnel were ex-
 pelled under the 1995 or 1996 regulations. According to government officials, 20 to
 25 percent of Communist Party officials engage in religious activities, an increase
 over estimates for 1995. Most officials who practice a religion are Buddhist or be-
 lieve in a folk religion. Religious figures are included in national-level government
 organizations. For example, the National People's Congress (NPC) includes several
 religious figures, including Pagbalha Geleg Namai, a Tibetan "living Buddha,"
 who is a vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. Religious groups are
 also represented in the Chinese People's Poitical Consultative Conerence, a forum
 for multiparty cooperation and consultation led by the CCP, which advises the Gov-
 ernment on policy.
 After forcefully suppressing all religious observances and closing all seminaries
 during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the Government began in the late 1970's
 to restore or replace damaged or confiscated churches, temples, mosques, and mon-
 asteries and to allow the reopening of seminaries. Implementation of this policy has
 varied from locality to locality. According to a government white paper on religion
 issued during the year, there are 100 million religious adherents, more than 85,000
 religious sites, over 3,000 religious organizations, 300,000 clergy and 74 religious
 schools and colleges. Official religious organizations administer local Bible schools,
 more than a dozen Catholic and Protestant seminaries, nine institutes to train
 imams and Islamic scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist monks. Students who
 attend these institutes must demonstrate "political reliability," and all graduates
 must pass an examination on their theological and political knowledge to qualify for
 the clergy. The Government permitted some Catholic seminarians, Muslim clerics,
 and Buddhist clergy to go abroad for additional religious studies. In most cases
 funding for these training programs is provided by host country organizations. Unof-
 ficial churches, however, have significant problems training clergy or sending stu-
 dents to study overseas, and many clergy receive limited and inadequate prepara-
 tion.
 The authorities permit officially sanctioned religious organizations to maintain
 international contacts as long as these do not entail foreign control. What con-
 stitutes "control" is not defined. Regulations enacted in 1994 codified many existing
 rules involving foreigners, including a ban on proselytizing by foreigners, but allow
 foreign nationals to preach to foreigners, bring in religious materials for their own
 use, and preach to Chinese at churches, mosques, and temples at the invitation of
 registered religious organizations. Missionaries are currently teaching English on
 college campuses in China with minimum interference from authorities as long as
 their proselytizing is low key. In recent years, some local authorities have subjected
 worship services of alien residents to increased surveillance and restrictions. In one
 major city appointed Chinese clergy supervise worship services. In the northeast,
 however, ethmc Korean Catholics freely practice their faith.
 During the year, there was a new level of openness to international dialog on reli-
 gious issues. China invited an increasing number of foreign religious organizations
 to visit religious sites and talk to official religious leaders and figures. In July a del-
 egation headed by the Director of the State Council Religious Affairs Bureau trav-
 eled abroad and met with foreign church officials and NG0's. In October President
 Jiang Zemin invited a delegation of foreign religious leaders to visit China in 1998.
 
 
 726
 In October the State Council released a white paper on freedom of religious belief.
 The paper provided official information and statistics on religious practices and de-
 fended government policies but stated the premise that legal protection of citizens'
 rights should conform to relevant international documents and conventions. It was
 publicized widely inside and outside China.
 Buddhists make up the largest body of religious believers. The Government esti-
 mates that there are more than 100 million Buddhists, most of whom are from the
 dominant Han ethnic group. It is, however, difficult to accurately estimate the num-
 ber of Buddhists because Buddhists often practice their faith without participating
 in public ceremonies. The Government reports that there are 13,000 Buddhist tem-
 ples and monasteries in China and more than 200,000 nuns and monks. Local gov-
 ernments strictly enforced regulations on places of worship, particularly illegally
 constructed Buddhist temples and shrines. According to an April Hong Kong news-
 paper article, the United Front Work Department ordered officials in all localities
 not to build temples and outdoor statues of Buddha for any reason. According to the
 article, an official survey found that more than 40,000 unauthorized Buddhist tem-
 ples had been discovered in recent years. Some local authorities have called for the
 destruction of Buddhist places of worship, especially newly established sites. The
 city of Miluo in Hunan province, for example, boasted that in the first 4 months
 of the year, it dismantled 798 illegally erected temples and "converted" 31 others
 for other uses. Traditional syncretic folk religion (worship of local gods, heroes, and
 ancestors) which is the religion of 70 percent of the people, has been attacked as
 "feudal superstition" and thousands of religious shrines have been destroyed. None-
 theless, folk religion has revived in recent years, and is unofficially tolerated to
 varying degrees as a loose affiliate of Taoism or as an ethnic minority cultural prac-
 tice. (A discussion of government restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism can be found in
 the Tibet addendum to this report.)
 According to government figures, there are 18 million Muslims, 30,000 Islamic
 places of worship, and more than 40,000 imams. In some areas where ethnic unrest
 has occurred, officials continue to restrict the building of mosques and the religious
 education of youths under the age of 18. After a series of terrorist incidents in
 Xinjiang province, police cracked down on Muslim religious activity and places of
 worship. A number of extrajudicial killings were reported (see Section L.a.). A Janu-
 ary Xinjiang Daily article quoted a provincial official as stating that religion must
 be made to conform with socialism and that officials must "target separatism and
 illegal religious activity." Local authorities issued regulations further restricting re-
 ligious activities and teaching. China permits Muslim citizens to make the haji to
 Mecca. According to government statistics, more than 40,000 Chinese Muslims have
 made the pilgrimage in recent years. Muslim experts, however, state that the num-
 ber is much higher. The Government subsidized these visits in some cases.
 The number of Christians in both official and unofficial churches continues to
 grow rapidly, particularly in rural areas. This has caused concern among govern-
 ment and Communist Party officials who perceive religious gatherings as a chal-
 lenge to their authority, a threat to public order, and an alternative -to Socialist
 thought. There was evidence that authorities in some areas, guided by national pol-
 icy, made strong efforts to crack down on the activities of the unapproved Catholic
 and Protestant churches. The Government officially permits only those Christian
 churches affiliated with either the Catholic Patriotic Association or the (Protestant)
 Three Self Patriotic Movement to operate openly. The Government established both
 organizations in the 1950's to eliminate perceived foreign domination of local Chris-
 tian groups.
 In some areas cooperation between official and unofficial churches has expanded
 so as to blur the line between the two. In other areas, relations between the two
 churches are hostile. The unofficial, Vatican-affiliated Catholic Church claims a
 membership far larger than the 4 million persons registered with the official Catho-
 lic Church. Precise figures are difficult to estimate because many Catholics, particu-
 larly in rural areas, attend both official and unofficial services. According to official
 figures, there are 4,000 Catholic clergy and over 4,600 churches and meeting
 houses. There is no Vatican representative in China. Bishops in the official Catholic
 Church are not ordained by Rome but many have an unofficially acknowledged "re-
 lationship with Rome." The Government maintains that there are between 10 and
 15 million registered Protestants, 18,000 clergy, over 12,000 churches, and some
 25,000 meeting places. Government officials have noted a rise in Protestant wor-
 shipers in the past year, but have not revised statistics to reflect this upward trend.
 According to foreign experts, perhaps 30 million persons worship privately in house
 churches that are independent of government control. One informed Chinese source
 has put the number at 50 to 60 million.
 
 
 727
 This increase in worshipers has resulted in a corresponding increase in the de-
 mand for Bibles. In 1997 the Government supervised the printing of more than 3
 million Bibles, a small increase over 1996. A printing company funded by overseas
 Christian organizations also prints approximately 500,000 Bibles a year. Although
 Bibles can be purchased at some bookstores they are not readily available and can-
 not be ordered directly from publishing houses by individuals. However, they are
 available for purchase at many Chinese Christian Council-affiliated churches. Some
 underground Christians hesitate to buy Bibles at official churches because such
 transactions often involve receipts identifying the purchaser. Foreign experts con-
 fn-m reports of chronic shortages of Bibles as well as logistical problems in dissemi-
 nating Bibles to churches, especially churches in rural areas, but note that the situ-
 ationhas improved in recent years due to the increase in distribution channels, in-
 cluding to house churches.
 Efforts to register unauthorized groups are being carried out by police and reli-
 gious affairs officials concurrently with other law enforcement actions. Police closed
 many "underground" mosques, temples, and seminaries, and hundreds of Protestant
 "house churc h" groups, many with significant memberships, properties, financial re-
 sources, and networks. Police were particularly active during sensitive periods, such
 as in the aftermath of Deng Xiaoping's death in February and the reversion of Hong
 Kong in July. Many leaders of unauthorized groups were targets of harassment, in-
 terrogations, and detention (see Section 1.d.).
 In some areas security authorities used bribes, threats, demolition of unregistered
 property, extortion of "frnes," and interrogation to harass religious figures and fol-
 lowers. Implementing regulations, provincial work reports, and other government
 and party documents continue to exhort officials to vigorously enforce government
 � poicy regarding unregistered churches. Authorities particularly targeted unofficial
 religious groups in Beijing and the provinces of Henan, Anhui, Shanxi, and
 Zheiang, where there are rapidly growing numbers of unregistered Protestants, and
 Hebei, a center of unregistered atholics. In some cases, public security officials
 have used detention or arrest and reform-through-education sentences to enforce
 regulations. In March Henan police detained evangelist Xu Yongze and eight of his
 associates in an attempt to close down his church network, They were detained
 without charge and without access to family or counsel, and reportedly suffered
 beatings. In September Xu was sentenced to 10-years' reform through laber for dis-
 turbing public order. In October his wife and two of his associates were given ad-
 ministrative penalties of 1 to 2V2 years of reeducation through labor. The Govern-
 ment responded to a foreign government's requests for information on Xu's case by
 stating that Xu had promoted a cult and violated the law by preaching that the
 apocalypse was near and asking worshipers to wail in public spaces for several con-
 secutive days.
 In Hebei, where perhaps half of China's Catholics reside, friction between unoffi-
 cial Catholics and local authorities continued as police again prevented worshipers
 from making an annual spring pilgrimage to Donglu to visit a religious icon by
 erecting roadblocks and checkpoints. Harassment of unofficial Catholics continued
 in the Baoding area, near Beijing. During the year, Hebei authorities forced many
 underground priests and believers to make the choice of either joining the "patriotic"
 church or facing punishment such as fines, job loss, and, in some cases, barring chil-
 dren from school. In October the Cardinal Kung Foundation reported that Baoding
 Bishop Su Zhimin was placed under detention by local security officials after the
 closure of his unofficial seminary. Authorities asserted that Bishop Su had not been
 detained and is free. In December he was sighted in Shanghai with government au-
 thorities. There was no independent confirmation of his status at year's end.
 In March Shanghai public security authorities broke into the home of Shanghai
 underground Catholic Church Bishop Joseph Fan Zhongliang and seized religious
 materils and currency. Prior to the incident Bishop Fan had been conducting mass
 for hundreds of underground followers in his apartment. Subsequently he continued
 services but for only 20 or so believers. Since the raid the police assigned an official
 to live across the hall from Fan and to monitor his activities. Police also harassed
 and detained several underground church lay people in the Shanghai area. In Janu-
 ary local police in Jiangxi province detained unofficial Catholic worshipers near the
 township of Chongren, preventing perhaps 10,000 people from gathering for reli-
 gious observances.
 There has been an upsurge of apocalyptic teaching in orthodox as well as hetero-
 dox millennial sects as the year 2000 approaches. Such religious groups, which
 preach beliefs outside the bounds of officially approved doctrine, are being singled
 out for harassment. A Ningxia Daily account detailing the reasons for arresting
 three missionaries variously cited their membership in an "heretical" organization,
 attending an illegal gathering, preaching that Jesus can heal, and conducting activi-
 
 
 ties that disrupted the public order. In 1997 police continued their efforts to close
 down an underground evangelical sect called the "Shouters," a branch of a pre-1949
 indigenous Protestant group. The sect has been deemed an antigovernment,
 counterrevolutionary organization, and since the early 1980's, authorities repeatedly
 havedetained, fined, and imprisoned its members. An indigenous offshoot of Bud-
 dhism, the Yi Guan Dao, which was banned in 1949, has become newly active in
 the 1990's. In a June press conference, the head of the Religious Affairs Bureau
 spoke of a "government crackdown on a small number of cults, which threaten the
 social and public interest."
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pafriation.-The effectiveness of the Government's identification card system, used
 to control and restrict the location of individual residences, continued to erode. Esti-
 mates of the "floating population" of economic migrants leaving their home areas
 to seek work elsewhere in the country range from tens of millions to over 100 mil-
 lion. This group comprises not only migrant workers, but also includes a growing
 number of middle-class professionals attracted to large cities by better paying jobs
 in their fields. This itinerant population enjoys increased economic opportunities but
 lacks official residence status, which provides full access to social services and edu-
 cation. Unless-such persons obtain resident status they must pay a premium for
 these services.
 Under the "staying at prison employment" system applicable to recidivists incar-
 cerated in reeducation-through-labor camps, authorities have denied certain inmates
 permission to return to their homes. Those inmates sentenced to more than 5 years
 in reeducation-through-labor camps may also lose their legal right to return home.
 For those assigned to camps far from their residences, this practice constitutes a
 form of internal exile. The number of prisoners subject to this restriction is un-
 known. Authorities have reportedly forced others to accept jobs in state enterprises
 where they can be more closely monitored after their release from prison or deten-
 tion. Other released or paroled prisoners returned home but were not permitted
 freedom of movement. Chen Ziming, who was paroled on medical grounds in Novem-
 ber 1996, remained confined to his home except for police-escorted visits to doctors.
 Zhao Ziyang, a former senior party leader, remains under a form of house arrest.
 Bao Tong was released after being held under house arrest for 11 months at a gov-
 ernment work unit. He and his family, however, were subsequently forced to vacate
 their government quarters, in an area where high-ranking Chinese officials lived,
 and move to a house in the Beijing suburbs. They remain closely monitored.
 The Government routinely permits legal emigration and foreign travel for most
 citizens. Students and business travelers wishing to go abroad can obtain passports
 relatively easily. Permission for couples to travel abroad was sometimes conditioned
 on agreement to delay childbirth; noncompliance triggered fines for the couple or
 their work unit. The Government continued to use political attitudes as a criterion
 in selecting people for government-sponsored study abroad, but it did not control
 privately sponsored students, who constitute the majority of students studying
 abroad, in similar fashion. The Government continued efforts to attract persons who
 have studied overseas back to China. Official media have said that people who have
 joined foreign organizations hostile to China should quit them before returning
 home and refrain while abroad from activities that violate China's law.
 During the year, the Government showed greater willingness to allow dissidents
 to leave the country. In July Tong Yi, the former secretary of Wei Jingsheng, was
 issued a passport and allowed to travel to New York, where she enrolled at Colum-
 bia University. Authorities also issued a passport and exit permit to dissident Chen
 Xiaoping. He is currently at Harvard University. Democracy activist Xu Shuiliang
 was also issued a passport in July. Shanghai dissident Bao Go was granted a visa
 and exit permit and was allowed to leave China in October. Wei Jingsheng was
 granted a medical parole and was allowed to leave the country for medical treat-
 ment in November.-By contrast, authorities confiscated the passprt of film director
 Zhang Yuan, preventing him from traveling to the Cannes Film Festival for the
 screening of his film "East Palace West Palace." There were also instances when the
 authoriti~es refused visas or entry on apparent political grounds. International ob-
 servers reported that they had documents that substantiated claims that border con-
 trol stations keep background records of certain citizens who were to be denied
 entry. Authorities have dismissed reports of blacklists as "sheer rumor." Perhaps
 the most prominent case of a dissident refused reentry is labor activist Han
 Dongfang, whose passport was revoked in 1993 because he allegedly engaged in ac-
 tivities hostile to China while overseas. He remains in Hong ong. Han Xiaorong,
 the wife of Human Rights in China Chairman Li Qing, was reportedly refused
 entry in March, and, in May, Hou Xiaotian was denied entry. Prodemocracy activ-
 ists and politicians in Hong Kong, including leading members of the Democratic
 
 
 729
 Party, were denied permission to travel to China. Foreign academics with contacts
 with China's dissident community have also been refused entry visas.
 Since the late 1980's, China has adopted a de facto policy of tolerance toward the
 small number of persons-fewer than 100 annually-from other nations who have
 registered with the Beijing office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) as asylum seekers. The Government has permitted these persons
 to stay in China while the UNHCR makes determinations as to their status and-
 if the UNHCR determines that they are bona fide refugees--while they await reset-
 tlement in third countries. As yet China has no law or regulations that authorize
 the authorities to grant refugee status, but the Government is reportedly drafing
 working rules on granting such status.
 The Government continued to accept the repatriation of Chinese citizens who had
 entered other countries or territories illegally. The authorities have accepted the re-
 turn of would-be illegal emigrants to the United States,-Hong Kng, and Australia,
 provided that their identity and willingness to return voluntarily can be verified.
 China has worked successfully with Las and Cambodia to facilitate the return
 of resettled individuals who have decided to return to their home countries and it
 is using the UN-CR's good offices to negotiate an agreement with the Vietiamese
 to accept 9,000 persons seeking to repatriate to Vietnam. The Government denies
 having tightened its policy on accepting Vietnamese asylum seekers. In recent
 years, very few such asylum seekers have found resettlement in China.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens lack the means to change their government legally and cannot freely
 choose or change the laws and officials that govern them. Citizens vote directly for
 local nongovernmental village oittees and party-reviewed candidates for dele-
 gate positions in county-level peoples congresses. People's congress delegates at the
 provincial level, however, are selected by county-level peoples congresses, and in
 turn provincial-level people's conresses select delegates to the National People's
 Congress (NPC). Although the C      e approves the candidates, many county and pro-
 vincial elections are competitive, with more candidates running than there are seats
 available.
 According to the Constitution, the NPC is the highest organ of state power. For-
 mally it elects the President and Vice President, selects the Premier and vice r-
 miers, and elects the Chairman of the State Central Military Commission. The I&C
 Standing Committee oversees these elections and determines the agenda and proce-
 dure for the NPC under the direct authority of the Politburo Standing Committee.
 At the 1997 session of the NPC, nearly 40 percent of the delegates-the largest neg-
 ative vote ever-took the unusual stp of voting against or abstaining on the Su-
 preme People's Procuratorate work report. Thirty-twa percent failed to endorse the
 work report of the Supreme People's Cour. Most observers interpreted these votes,
 which expressed delegate unhappiness about the problems of crime and corruption,
 as reflecti~ng the NPC's increased willingness in recent years to question the Govern-
 ment's prormance. The NPC has not in practice demonstrated the power to set
 policy or remove government or part leaders.
 The election and agenda of peoples congresses at all levels remain under the firm
 control of the Communist Party, the paramount source of political authority. A num-
 ber of small "democratic" parties that date from before the Communist takeover in
 1949 play only a minor consultative role and pledge their allegiance to the Com-
 munist Party. The CCP retains a tight rein on political decisionmaking and forbids
 the creation of new political parties.
 There has been continued growth, however, of democratic decisionmaking at the
 local village level. Under the 1987 Organic Law of the Village Committees, all of
 C hina's a pproximately 1 mlion villages are expected to hold competitive, direct
 elections for village committees. Both the Government and foreign observers esti-
 mate that more than 90 percent of these villages have participated in elections for
 local leaders. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the majority of villages have
 carried out at least two rounds of elections. Foreign observers who have monitored
 local elections, including the Carter Centert nd the International Republican Insti-
 tute, have judged the elections they observed, on the whole, to be fair. Although
 many villages have yet to hold truly competitive elections, the central Government
 continued efforts to expand the election process and makee it me competitive and
 fair. Successful village committee elections have included campaigning by multiple
 candidates, platforms, and the use of secret ballots.
 Candidates favored by local authorities have been defeated in some elections, al-
 though in general the party dominates the electoral process and most members of
 the village committees are party members. The final ballot is the culmination of an
 
 
 election process that includes government screening of candidates and an indirect
 vote that eliminates some.candidates. Many local observers caution that the village
 election system is not necessarily a precursor for democracy at higher levels of gov-
 ernment, and village elections-as currently practiced-are under tight political con-
 trols and do not threaten to undermine the implementation of unpopular central
 policies or endanger the leading role of the Communist Party. The elected commit-
 tees are not statutorily part of the Government. The powers of elected village com-
 mittees vary from region to region. Most committees have the authority to mediate
 disputes between villagers, improve public order, authorize small expenditures, and
 implement policies as directey by the indirectly elected representative committees.
 The village committees have no power to tax, set fines or punishments independ-
 ently, or hire or fire village enterprise managers.
 The Government places no restrictions on the participation of women or minority
 groups in the political process. Women freely exercise their right to vote in village
 committee elections, but only a small fraction of elected members are women. The
 Government andparty organizations include approximately 12 million female offi-
 cials. Women an ethnic minorities constitute 21 percent and 15 percent, respec-
 tively, of the National People's Congress. All of China's 56 nationalities are rep-
 resented in the NPC membership. The 15th Party Congress elected 22 women and
 38 members of ethnic minorities to serve on the Central Committee, both increases
 over that of the previous committee. Women and minorities, however, still hold few
 positions of significant influence at the highest rungs of the party or government
 structure. There is currently one woman in the Politburo, and women hold 3 of 41
 ministerial-level positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent domestic NGO's that publicly monitor or comment on
 human rights conditions, although the press has printed with increasing frequency
 stories of officials exceeding their authority and abusing citizens. The Government
 is reluctant to accept criticism of China's human rights situation by other nations
 or international organizations and criticizes reports by international human rights
 monitoring groups, maintaining that they are inaccurate and interfere with China's
 internal affrs.
 The Government vigorously lobbied against a resolution on China's human rights
 record at the 1997 session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights (UNHRC). As
 in previous years, the Chinese delegation introduced a preemptive motion to take
 no action on the resolution. China's motion was passed by the Commission, and
 there was no debate on the China human rights resolution. The Government retali-
 ated against Denmark, which tabled the resolution, by canceling high-level visits be-
 tween the two countries, and threatening other repercussions in Sino-Danish rela-
 tions.
 Since 1991 the Government has promoted limited academic study and discussion
 of concepts of human rights. In 1993 it formed the China Society for Human Rights
 Studies as a "nongovernmental organization." The organization's efforts have fo-
 cused, however, largely on improving China's image abroad by improving its public
 relations handling of the human rights issue and responding directly to criticism of
 the Government's human rights record. The Society published a book that included
 eight white papers on human rights released by the State Council since 1991 as well
 as four commentaries on human rights conditions in the United States. Two of these
 white papers were issued in 1997. In March the State Council released a white
 paper entitled "Progress in China's Human Rights Cause in 1996," and in October
 a white paper on religion.
 Officials no longer dismiss all discussion of human rights as interference in Chi-
 na's internal affairs. The Government showed increased willingness to discuss
 human rights with other nations. It has expanded the number of its bilateral
 human rights dialogs and in some instances taken the initiative by proposing meet-
 ing. Countries that started or resumed human rights dialogues with China in-
 cluded Great Britain, Australia, Norway, Brazil, Japan, and Canada. In September
 China and the European Union announced the resumption of their human rights
 forum, which had been suspended since 1996. Chinese officials met with Amnesty
 International in Norway in July. China has publicly acknowledged the universality
 of human rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, they
 add that there are legitimate, differing approaches to human rights based on each
 country's particular history, social situation, and level of economic development.
 China hosted a 10-day visit in October of the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary De-
 tention. The group held discussions with senior officials at the Foreign and Justice
 Ministries and visited prisons, labor camps, and police detention centers, where its
 
 
 731
 members were allowed to interview some prisoners without government officials
 present.
 China reacted to the U.N. Educational Scientific, and Cultural Organization's
 (UNESCO) decision to award the first UNESCO Gullermo Cano prize for world
 press freedom to jailed dissident and journalist Gao Yu by calling the prize "ille al"
 and threatening to withdraw from UNESCO. In September China denied accredta-
 tion to attend the World Bank meeting in Hong Kong to two international human
 rights organizations that had been critical of its human rights record.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are laws designed to protect women, children, the disabled, and minorities.
 In practice, however, societal discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, and disabil-
 ity persists. The concept of a largely homogeneous Chinese people pervades the
 thinking of the Han majority.
 Women.-Violence against women can be grounds for prosecution under the law.
 Chinese sociologists note that there has been no detailed research on the extent of
 physical violence against women. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that report-
 ing domestic abuse is on the rise, particularly in urban areas, because greater atten-
 tion has been focused on the problem. Informal surveys by women's groups indicate
 that 20 percent of women may have been beaten by their husbands. Actual figures
 may be higher because spousal abuse still goes largely unreported. According to ex-
 perts, the percentage of households in which domestic abuse has occurred is higher
 in rural areas than in urban centers.
 In recognition of the seriousness of spousal abuse, some localities have taken
 measures to address the problem. There is, however, no national spousal abuse law.
 In October a national symposium on domestic violence was held in Beijing. While
 NGO's have taken action to increase awareness of domestic abuse, a severe shortage
 of funds has affected these efforts. In Shanghai a women's shelter was closed after
 12 months because its funding ran out. In September a women's abuse hot line in
 Beijing ceased operating because its grant had elapsed. However, other projects that
 addressed domestic abuse were established. In Shenzhen a hot line was started to
 respond to calls from battered women. In Guangxi province, a radio station featured
 a call-in talk show that addressed women's issues, including domestic violence.
 No statute outlaws sexual harassment in the workplace, a problem that is
 unaddressed in the legal system and often in society. Chinese experts state, how-
 ever, that more women are raising their concerns about sexual harassment because
 of greater awareness of the problem. In May the head of the All China Women's
 Federation called on "Chinese government organizations at all levels" to further and
 more effectively protect women's rights. She also called on government units to
 eliminate gender preference in their hiring practices.
 The increased commercialization of sex and related trafficking in women has
 trapped tens of thousands of women in a cycle of crime and exploitation. These
 women face a high risk of drug addiction, AIDS, and other sexually transmitted dis-
 eases. According to media reports, 80 percent of Beijing's massage parlors offer sex-
 ual services. In 1996 the Beijling muncipal government announced a crackdown on
 massage parlors in the capital. The effect on the sex trade appeared marginal, how-
 ever, as many of the massage parlors continued to operate or moved to areas within
 a short distance of the capital. The long-term effectiveness of any crackdown on this
 lucrative business, which involves organized crime groups and business people, as
 well as the police and milita, is uncertain. Unsafe working conditions are rampant
 among the saunas, massage houses, and hostess bars that have sprung up in num-
 bers in large cities. According to one source, police own and operate brthels employ-
 ing some 70,000 prostitutes in one large area of Shanxi province.
 The abduction of women is a serious problem. The Government continued to con-
 demn and to take steps to prevent and punish the abduction and sale of women for
 marriage or prostitution. In April the Government acknowledged that the kidnaping
 and sale of women was a human rights abuse that warranted severe punishments
 for criminals involved with the trade. Amnesty International's August report on cap-
 ital punishment in China cited numerous cases in which individuals received the
 death penalty for the crime of abducting women. Some research indicates that a key
 reason for the abduction and sale of women is a serious imbalance in sex ratios in
 certain localities (see Section 1.f.). This has created a situation in which the demand
 by men for marriageable women cannot be met by local brides. Some families ad-
 dress the problem by recruiting women in economically less advanced areas. Others
 seek help from criminal gangs, which either kidnap women or trick them by promis-
 ing them jobs and an easier way of life and then transport them far from their home
 areas for delivery to buyers. Once in their new "family," these women are "married"
 
 
 and raped. Some accept their fate and join the new community; others struggle and
 are punished.
 The authorities have enacted laws and conducted educational campaigns in an ef-
 fort to eradicate the traditional preference for sons; however, this preference re-
 mains strong in rural China. A number of provinces have sought to reduce the per-
 ceived higher value of boys in providing old-age support for their parents by estab-
 lishing or improving pensions and retirement homes.
 Crime experts say that many of the kidnapings also occur in provinces, such as
 Sichuan and Guangxi, where the male to female ratio is generally balanced. The
 Government reported that some of its efforts to end the illegal trade were success-
 ful. In June the Government said that the number of women kidnaped in Sichuan
 province had declined for the past 2 years. Guangdong province reported that it had
 sentenced 79.6 percent of the criminals convicted of harming women to more than
 5 years in prison.
 The Constitution states that "women enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres
 of life," including ownership of property, inheritance rights, and access to education.
 In 1992 the NPC enacted legislation on the protection of the rights and interests
 of women, which was designed to assist in curbing gender-based discrimination.
 Women have continued, however, to report discrimination, sexual harassment, un-
 fair dismissal, demotion, and wage discrepancies.
 Women are sometimes the unintended victims of economic reforms. The press re-
 ported that in 1997 59.2 percent of laid-off workers were women. Women between
 the ages of 35 and 50 were the most affected, and the least likely to be retrained.
 In addition, female employees were more likely to be chosen to take pay cuts when
 a plant or company was in financial trouble. In Sichuan where women are bearing
 the brunt of state-owned enterprise layoffs, women have played a key role in labor
 protests and disputes. Discriminatory hiring practices appear to be on the rise as
 unemployment rises. Increasingly, companies are permitted to discriminate b both
 sex and age, although such practices violate labor laws. A recent television broad-
 cast of a job fair in Tianjin revealed repeated instances of job announcements stipu-
 lating that no women over age 30 should apply. Of the over 100 companies rep-
 resented at the job fair, only 3 did not have such restrictions.
 Many employers prefer to hire men to avoid the expense of maternity leave and
 child care, andsome even lower the effective retirement age for female workers to
 40 years of age. (The official retirement age for men is 60 years and for women 55
 years.) Although the law promises equal pay for equal work, a 1990 survey found
 that women's salaries averaged 77 percent of men's. Although dated, these statistics
 still appear to be accurate. Most women employed in industry work in lower skilled
 and lower paid jobs.
 While the gap in the education levels of men and women is narrowing, men con-
 tinue to constitute the majority of the relatively small percentage of the population
 that receives a university-level education. In 1996 5 million students were enrolled
 in colleges and graduate schools. According to the State Education Commission,
 women made up 36.4 percent of these students. Educators in the large cities have
 reported, however, that there is a trend toward greater gender balance in univer-
 sities. Some academics have reported that in some departments women are begin-
 ning to outnumber men-even in some graduate schools. Women with advanced de-
 ees, however, report an inrease in discrimination in the hiring process as the job
 ditribution system has opened up and become more competitive.
 In 1996 the Government outlined its 5-year Plan for the Advancement of Women.
 The main priority is to increase the literacy of rural women, 80 percent of whom
 are wholly or partially illiterate. Overall, women make up about 70 percent of
 illiterates in the country. The All China Women's Federation, the country's largest
 organization devoted to women's issues, stated that one goal of the plan was to de-
 crease the number of female illiterates by 3 million every year. Some women's advo-
 cates, however, were skeptical that the goal could be realized because of a lack of
 resources.
 Children.-The 1992 Law on the Protection of Juveniles forbids infanticide, as
 well as mistreatment or abandonment of children. This law also prohibits discrimi-
 nation against disabled minors, emphasizes the importance of safety and morality,
 and codifies a variety of judicial protections for juvenile offenders. The physical
 abuse of children can be grounds for criminal prosecution. The Constitution provides
 for 9 years of compulsory education for children (see Tibet addendum).
 The extensive health care delivery system has led to improved child health and
 a sharp decline in infant mortality rates. According to 1997 official figures, the in-
 fant mortality rate was 33 per 1,000 in 1996. According to the U.N. Children's Fund
 (UNICEF), in 1995 China's mortality rate for children under 5 years of age was 47
 per 1,000 live births.
 
 
 733
 There were credible reports of female infanticide. The use of ultrasound tests to
 determine gender has also resulted in decisions to terminate pregnancies of female
 fetuses, but no reliable statistics are available to demonstrate the extent of the prob-
 lem. One newspaper article quoted a doctor as saying that as many as 97.5 percent
 of pregnancies terminated in his hospital were of female fetuses. A September World
 Health Organization paper reported that the national ratio of male to female births
 in 1994 was 117 to 100. (The worldwide statistical norm is 106 to 100.) Part of the
 statistical gap may be attributable to female infanticide, sex-selective termination
 of pregnancies, and abandonment or neglect of girls, but some foreign experts be-
 lieve that a larger factor may be underreporting of female births by couples trying
 to evade family planning laws to try to have a son.
 According to the latest available figures, compiled in 1994, the number of children
 abandoned in China each year is approximately 1.7 million, despite the fact that
 under the law child abandonment is punishable by fines and a 5-year prison term.
 The vast majority of those eventually admitted to Chinese orphanages are female
 or disabled and in poor health. Essentially all children put up for foreign adoption
 are girls. The treatment of children at these institutions varies from adequate to
 deplorable. There have been reports of children being restrained for long periods of
 time and being denied basic care and feeding. Accurate determination of infant mor-
 tality rates in orphanages is difficult, but rates appear to be very high at many, es-
 pecially among new arrivals.
 According to several sources, orphanage workers in some facilities reserve basic
 medical care and even nutrition for children who are deemed to have the best
 chances for survival. Some sources report that children whose prospects of survival
 are determined to be poor are placed in rooms separate from other children and sub-
 jected to extreme neglect. Claims that government policies, as opposed to lack of re-
 sources, were to blame for the lack of care of children placed in orphanages could
 not be verified. Human Rights Watch reported in 1996, however, that many institu-
 tions, including those with the highest death rates, have budgets that provide for
 adequate wages, bonuses, and other personnel-related costs, but that budgets for
 children's food, clothing, and other necessities are low throughout the country.
 The Government denies that children in orphanages are mistreated or refused
 medical care but acknowledges that the system is hard pressed to provide for those
 children who are admitted with serious medical problems. Perhaps recognizing the
 need for improvements, the Civil Affairs Ministry announced in April that the Gov-
 ernment's top social welfare priority for 1997 would be to improve conditions in or-
 phanages. Over $30 million was reportedly allocated for this program. A government
 white paper on women and children issued in March stated that the central Govern-
 ment had spent $25.7 million between 1990 and 1994 to improve "children's welfare
 institutions," the official term for orphanages. During the same period, local govern-
 ments apparently allocated almost $18 milion to these institutions.
 Despite government efforts to prevent kidnaping and the buying and selling of
 children, the problem persists in some rural areas.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1990 the Government adopted legislation protecting
 the rights of the country's approximately 60 million disabled persons. According to
 the official press, all local governments subsequently drafted specific measures to
 implement the law. The central Government reported in 1996 that, in the 3 preced-
 ing years, the NPC Standing Committee conducted nationwide inspections to verify
 compliance with the law; it "found that the handicapped generally received good
 services and help in both their dealings with officials and in public life." The press
 publicizes both the plight of the disabled and government efforts to assist them. A
 rehabilitation program launched in 1988 has reportedly treated 2.32 million people
 who suffer from cataracts, polio, or deafness. Beijing city's rehabilitation program
 was said to have trained 5,000 disabled people in 1997, of whom 1,000 were ex-
 pected to obtain jobs within the year.
 However, reality for the disabled lags far behind legal dictates. Misdiagnosis, in-
 adequate medical care, pariah status, and abandonment remain common problems.
 The latest available statistics, compiled in 1993, show that approximately 50 per-
 cent of the disabled lack adequate food and clothing. The same figures show that
 68 percent of the disabled are illiterate; 67 percent require family support; 49 per-
 cent are unemployed; only 6 percent of blind and deaf children enter school; and
 only 0.33 percent of mentally retarded children enter school.
 Deng Pufang, son of the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, heads the China
 Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, the government organization tasked with assist-
 ing the disabled. In a June speech, Deng Pufang said that the Government had
 helped 600,000 disabled citizens solve their food and clothing problems in 1996. The
 Government reportedly spent some $24 million in 1996 to carry out these poverty-
 relief measures. In May the official press noted that the Government's goal was to
 
 
 734
 clothe and feed all of the country's disabled by the end of the century, as well as
 to provide rehabilitation services for 3 million disabled citizens, educate 80 percent
 of disabled children, and find jobs for 80 percent of disabled adults. The Government
 requires all state enterprises to hire a certain number of disabled workers, but au-
 thorities estimate that nearly half of all disabled persons are jobless. According to
 Beijing municipal authorities, however, 75 percent of the disabled population in the
 capital have jobs.
 The Maternal and Child Health Care Law forbids the marriage of persons with
 certain specified contagious diseases or certain acute mental illnesses such as schiz-
 ophrenia. If doctors find that a couple is at risk of transmitting disabling congenital
 defects to their children, the couple may marry only if they agree to use birth con-
 trol or undergo sterilization. This law mandates premarital and prenatal examina-
 tion for genetic or contagious diseases, but it specifies that medically advised termi-
 nation of pregnancy or sterilization requires the signed consent of the patients or
 their guardians.
 Standards adopted in 1994 for making roads and buildings accessible to the dis-
 abled are subject to the 1990 Law on the Handicapped, which calls for their "grad-
 ual" implementation. Lax compliance with the law has resulted in only limited ac-
 cess to most buildings.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to 1995 government statistics, the
 total population of the country's 55 ethnic minorities was 108.46 million, or 8.98
 percent of the national population. Most minority groups reside in areas they have
 traditionally inhabited, many of which are mountainous or remote. The Govern-
 ment's policy on minorities calls for preferential treatment in marriage reglations,
 family planning, university admission, and employment. Programs provide low-in-
 terest loans, subsidies, and special development funds for minority areas. Minori-
 ties, in practice, are discriminated against.
 Government development policies have helped improve minority living standards.
 Official figures state that the Government invested $12.6 billion in infrastructure
 development for minority areas during the period 1991 to 1995. The ninth 5-Year
 Plan announced in March stated that the Government would raise this figure to
 $27.8 billion for the period from 1996 to 2000. According to government statistics,
 between 1991 and 1996 the economies in minority regions grew by nearly 11 percent
 annually, surpassing the national average in each year. Real incomes in minority
 areas, especially for non-Han groups, however, remain well below those in other
 parts of the country. Many development programs have disrupted traditional living
 patterns of minority groups, including Tibetans and the Muslim Uyghur majority
 of western Xinjing. or example there is some evidence that official poverty allevi-
 ation programs include the forced evacuation of persons from the poorest mountain
 areas. Plans to develop tourism in Xinjiang have also often focused on marketing
 and investment opportunities but paid little attention to how minority cultures and
 the environment might be adversely affected. Some projects, however, have been
 dropped for environmental reasons-for example, a proposal to build a railway
 around Lake Tianchi near Urumqi. Since 1949 central government and economic
 policy have resulted in a significant migration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang. In 1997
 there were 8 million Uyghurs and 7 million Han in Xinjiang, up from 300,000 in
 1949.
 According to government statistics, 15.34 million minority students attended
 schools between 1994 and 1996. A March white paper stated that 98.16 percent of
 all school-age children in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were enrolled in
 schools in 1996. In many areas with a significant population of minorities, there are
 two-track school systems using either Mandarin or the local minority language. Stu-
 dents can choose to attend schools in either system. One acknowledged side effect
 of this policy, originally designed to protect and maintain minority cultures, has
 been reinforcement of a segregated education system. Under this divided education
 system, those graduating from minority schools are at a disadvantage in competing
 for jobs in government and business, which require good Chinese-language skills.
 These graduates must take Chinese-language instruction before attending univer-
 sities and colleges (see Tibet addendum).
 The Communist Party has an avowed policy of boosting minority representation
 in the Government and the party. In May the official press reported that there were
 2.48 million minority officials in the Government. According to government statis-
 tics, there are 163,000 minority officials in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
 Minority officials constitute 23.3 percent of the region's total, exceeding the ratio of
 the minority population to Han Chinese in the region. Many members of minorities
 occupy local leadership positions, and a few have positions of influence at the na-
 tionallevel. In most areas, however, ethnic minorities are shut out of positions of
 real political and decisionmaking power. In Xinjiang the job of county party sec-
 
 
 retary is typically reserved for Han Chinese, even in counties that are close to 100
 percent Uyghur. Many minorities resent Han officials holding key positions in mi-
 nority autonomous regions.
 Tensions between ethnic Han citizens and Uyghurs in Xinjiang intensified. In
 February police dispersed a crowd of women in Yining city (see Section L.a.). In re-
 sponse to the subsequent protests of this action, police allegedly ordered to use any
 means necessary to suppress the demonstrators killed at least 10, and perhaps as
 many as 70; many others were wounded or arrested.
 According to some estimates, the migration of ethnic Han into Xinjiang in recent
 decades has caused the Han-Uyghur ratio in the capital of Urumqi to shift from
 20:80 to 80:20, contributing to Uyghur resentment. According to the 1990 census,
 the ethnic Uyghur population was nearly 50 percent of Xinjiang's total population.
 Han control of the region's political and economic institutions has also been a factor
 in the growth of tension. The testing of nuclear weapons in Xinjiang in past years
 is another source of tension because of health concerns and environmental degrada-
 tion. There has been no testing of nuclear weapons in Xinjiang since July 1996,
 after which China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Although govern-
 ment policies have brought tangible economic improvements, Uyghurs maintain that
 they receive only a small share of the benefits. The majority of Uyghurs are poor
 farmers and 25 percent are illiterate. A campaign to stress ethnic unity and to con-
 demn "splitism" and religious extremism began in April. This campaign pervades
 the Chinese-language media and reaches into the province's 1,500 schools. Authori-
 ties maintained tight control over separatist activities, announced tightened security
 and antiterrorist measures, and several campaigns to crack down on opposition dur-
 ing the year.
 The educational system provides Chinese for Han students and the Uyghur lan-
 guage for Uyghur students until fourth grade and then gradually switches to Chi-
 nese as the principal language of instruction. Graduation from the Uyghur school
 system leaves Uyghurs poorly educated, with an inadequate command of the Chi-
 nese language. Possession of separatist publications is not permitted, and, according
 to reports, possession of such materials has resulted in lengthy prison sentences. A
 Uyghur-langage press exists in Xinjiang, but it has a very small circulation, and
 much of the population depends on international broadcasts for information. Ingen-
 eral, central authorities made it clear that they do not tolerate opposition to Com-
 munist Party rule and responded to unrest and terrorist incidents with force and
 heightened security measures.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for "freedom of associa-
 tion," but qualifying language makes it clear that this right is subject to the inter-
 ests of the State and the leadership of the Communist Party. The country's sole offi-
 cially recognized workers' organization, the All China Federation of Trade Unions
 (ACPTU), is controlled by the Communist Party. Independent trade unions are ille-
 gal. The 1993 Trade Union Law required that the establishment of unions at any
 level be submitted to a higher level trade union organization for approval. The
 ACFTH, the highest level organization, has not approved the establishment of inde-
 pendent unions. There were more attempts to form or register independent unions
 in 1997 but none was successful. Under China's planned economy, the ACFTU's
 main task was to improve labor discipline, mobilize workers to achieve party and
 government objectives, and to dispense social welfare funds. As increased efforts to
 reform state-owned enterprises have resulted in greater unemployment, the ACFTU
 has more actively begun to represent workers and defend their rights. In May the
 ACFTU publicly called upon the Government to devote greater resources to unem-
 ployment insurance funds and reemployment projects.
 The ACFTU's primary attention remains focused on workers in the state sector,
 where it has over 90 million members. The Trade Union Law mandates that work-
 ers may decide whether to join the union in their enterprises. By official estimate,
 approximately 8 percent of workers in collective and state-owned enterprises have
 chosen not to join. There have been no reports of repercussions for workers who
 have not joined ACFTU unions. In 1994 the ACFTU actively began recruiting work-
 ers in the private sector, including in township and village enterprises (TVE's), as
 well as in foreign joint ventures. According to official statistics reported in mid-1996,
 4.54 million workers in enterprises with foreign investment, 75 percent of the total,
 were trade union members.
 Despite these recruiting efforts, over half of the nonagricultural work force is still
 largely unorganized and outside the state industrial structure. In TVE's, one of the
 fastest growing sectors of the economy, only a tiny percentage of workers are orga-
 nized in ACFTU affiliates. Although some TVE's have local branches of the ACFTU,
 
 
 736
 most TVE managers maintain that an ACFTU presence is not feasible because their
 employees continue to be classified as "farmers" rather than "workers." Some Com-
 munist Party secretaries in TVE's, however, take it upon themselves to establish
 union representation and then affiliate with the ACFTU.
 Credible reports indicate that the Government has attempted to stamp out illegal
 union activity. Li Bifeng, a veteran Sichuan dissident, is reportedly in hiding afe r
 sending a letter to local authorities protesting the ban on three-wheel motorized taxi
 cabs in Dujiangyan. Labor activist Liu Nianchun, who was detained in 1994 and
 1995, was sentenced to 3 years of reeducation through labor in 1996. Labor rights
 activists Li Wenming and Guo Baosheng, after each spending over 3 years in prison,
 were both sentenced on May 30 to 31/2 years in prison for subversion. Both were
 released late in the year upon completion of their terms.
 In October China signed the International Convention on Economic, Social and
 Cultural Rights. This Convention, which has not yet been ratified by the NPC, pro-
 vides for the right to form independent unions, to strike, and to demonstrate. Since
 the signing of this convention, a group of Chinese activists has started a campaign
 to promote independent labor unions. In December labor activists Qin Yongmin and
 Xu Wenli publicly issued a prunion letter calling on state workers to form inde-
 pendent unions. Authorities encouraged Qin Yongmin to depart China, but he re-
 used to do so.
 Beginning in 1993, the Ministry of Labor stopped officially denying the existence
 of strikes. Strikes still are not officially sanctioned, and accurate statistics on strike
 incidents are not available. There have been numerous reports from both foreign
 and Chinese sources that, despite the ban, there has been an increase in the num-
 ber of work stoppages. In the spring, workers in the port of Dalian staged a slow-
 down to protest a reduction in the number of workers. There were other incidents
 in which workers held sanctioned, brief, and orderly demonstrations in the north-
 east. In the southwest there was a series of strikes, including a large protest in
 Mianyang, Sichuan province. Estimates of the number of peaple reportedly arrested
 following this incident ranged from several hundred to several thousand. More than
 500 laid-off workers demonstrated in front of Dujiangyan city's government building
 in late August. According to a Sichuan provincial spokesman, "there were severa
 waves of demonstrations in Chengdu (the capital of Sichuan) on September 2." In
 Nanhai, Guangdong province, approximately 300 workers staged a sit-in to demand
 back wages . These demonstrations and strikes were directed at specific enterrises
 or local governments and did not target the central Government or national eco-
 nonic policies.
 The Trade Union Law assigns unions the role of mediators or go-betweens with
 management in cases of work stoppages or slowdowns. In addition, a workers' dis-
 pute settlement procedure, in effect since 1987, provides for mediation, two levels
 of arbitration committees, and a final appeal to the courts. The Ministry of Labor
 has established a nationwide organizational network for handling labor disputes,
 consisting of 270,000 enterprise labor dispute mediation commissions and 3,159
 labor dispute arbitration commissions. There are 1,569,000 full- and part-time en-
 terprise mediators and more than 17,000 labor arbitrators. The Ministry of Labor
 stated in July that the country is in a period of frequent labor disputes. The Min-
 istry said that in 1996 it dealt with about 196,700 cases of infringements of the
 labor law, an increase of 264 percent over 1995. Employees were reportedly paid
 over $160 million in back wages. According to Ministry of Labor officials, the major-
 ity of arbitration cases are filed by contract workers or their employers.
 There are no provisions allowing for individual workers or unofficial worker orga-
 nizations to affiliate with international bodies. The ACFTU, however, has actively
 tried to foster relations with other international trade unions, the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in particular. In September a delega-
 tion of ICFTU members traveled to Beijing to meet with ACFTU officials.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1995 National Labor Law
 permits collective bargaining for workers in all types of enterprises. The law also
 provides for workers and employers at all types of enterprises to sign individual as
 well as collective contracts. Collective contracts are to be worked out between
 ACFTU or worker representatives and management and specify such matters as
 working conditions, wage distribution, and hours of work. Individual contracts are
 then to be drawn up in line with the terms of the collective contract. Collective con-
 tracts must be submitted to local government authorities for approval within 15
 days. According to an official report, 96 percent of urban state-sector workers had
 signed contracts by the end of 1996.
 According to union and labor officials, there have been only a few experiments in
 collective bargaining. Official sources have explained that sufficient ideological and
 practical difficulties remain to preclude drawing clear distinctions between labor
 
 
 737
 and capital in the state-owned enterprise sector. In September the Ministry of Per-
 sonnel launched a program to train its supervisors in collective bargaining tech-
 niques.
 Ile Ministry of Labor sets a total wage bill for each collective and state-owned
 enterprise according to four criteria: 1) as a percentage of profits, 2) as a contract
 amount with the local labor bureau, 3) as a state-set amount for money-losing enter-
 prises, or 4) as an enterprise-set amount subject to Labor Ministry review. Individ-
 ual enterprises determine how to divide the total among workers, a decision usually
 made by the enterprise manager in consultation with the enterprise party chief and
 the ACFTU representative. In practice, however only a small number of workers
 with high technical skills can negotiate effectively on salary and fringe benefits.
 Worker congresses are held once or twice a year in all unionized enterprises. They
 are attended either by all enterprise employees or their representatives, who discuss
 union plans, the enterprise budget, factory management, and the distribution of
 benefits. Since 1989 union leaders have attempted to make worker congresses more
 responsive to the basic welfare concerns of ordinary workers and reduced the em-
 phasis on purely ideological concerns. In spite of the renewed emphasis on party
 control over the unions in the post-Tiananmen period, worker congresses have main-
 tained some enhanced powers, most notably the right to examine and discuss bread-
 and-butter issues affecting the enterprise, including the distribution of benefits, sal-
 ary reform, and the right to remove incompetent managers.
 The use of these rights varies widely, however. Many worker congresses continue
 to act largely as rubber stamps for deals hammered out by the manager, union rep-
 resntative, and the party secretary. In smaller enterprises it is not unusual to find
 these three posts held by the same person. The Trade Union Law prohibits
 antiunion discrimination and specifies that union representatives may not be trans-
 ferred or terminated by enterprise management during their term of office. Union-
 ized foreign businesses genera ly report pragmatic relations with ACFTU represent-
 atives.
 Laws governing working conditions in special economic zones (SEZ's) are not sig-
 nificantly different from those in the rest of the country. Wages in the SEZ's, how-
 ever, and in southeastern China generally, are significantly higher than in other
 parts of the country because high investment has created a great demand for avail-
 able labor. As in other areas of the country, officials admit that some foreign inves-
 tors in SEZ's are able to negotiate "sweetheart" deals with local partners that effec-
 tively bypass labor regulations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 and bonded labor by children and enforces the prohibition effectively.
 Some penal facilities ontract with regular industries for prisoners to perform
 light manufacturing and assembly work. In 1991 the Government published a reit-
 eration of its regulations barring the export of prison-made goods.
 In 1992 the U.S. and Chinese Governments signed a Memorandum of Under-
 standing (MOU)prohibiting trade in prison labor products. A statement of coopera-
 tion (SOC) detai     specific working procedures for implementation of the MOU
 was signed in 1994. Although the signing of the SOC initially helped to foster a
 more productive relationship with the authorities, cooperation has been limited in
 the past few years. U.S. Customs has formally requested to visit 20 sites suspected
 of exporting forced labor products to the United States. The Government has grant-
 ed permission to visit 13 of the sites. There were repeated delays in arranging site
 visits during most of 1997. In a positive development in November the Government
 granted permission to visit two more facilities.
 In addition to prisons and reform-through-labor facilities, which hold inmates sen-
 tenced through judicial procedures, the Government also maintains a network of re-
 education-through-labor camps, where inmates are sentenced through nonjudicial
 procedures (see Section i.e.). Inmates of reeducation-through-labor facilities are gen-
 erally required to work, but the authorities assert that the facilities are not prisons
 and have denied access to them under the 1992 prison labor MOU with the United
 States. Reports from international human rights organizations and the foreign press
 indicate that at least some persons in pretrial detention are also required to work.
 Most anecdotal reports conclude that work conditions in the penal system's light
 manufacturing factories are similar to those in other factories, but conditions on the
 penal systems farms and in mines can be very harsh. As in many Chinese work
 places, safety is a low priority. There are no available figures for deaths and injuries
 In prison industries.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Na-
 tional Labor Law specifies that "no employing unit shall be allowed to recruit juve-
 niles under the age of 16," 2 years older than the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) standard of 14 for developing countries. Administrative review, fines, and rev-
 
 
 ocation of business licenses of those businesses that hire minors are specified in the
 Labor Law. The law also provides for children to receive 9 years of compulsory edu-
 cation and to receive their subsistence from parents or guardians. Laborers between
 the ages of 16 and 18 are referred to as "juvenile workers," and are prohibited from
 enaging in certain forms of physical work, including labor in mines.
 Neither the ILO nor UNICEF believe that there is a significant child labor prob-
 lem in China. Good public awareness, a cheap, abundant supply of legal young adult
 workers, nearly universal primary schooling, and labor law enforcement all serve to
 reduce opportunities and incentives to hire child workers. Given this ample supply
 of adult laborers, most employers in China choose not to risk fines and possible ar-
 rest by hiring underage workers. Furthermore, many foreign businesses in China's
 more developed areas follow codes of conduct that set standards for labor conditions
 and provide for independent inspections.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces the
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for the enforcement of labor-related regula-
 tions. The Labor Law mandates the establishment of labor inspection corps at all
 administrative levels above county government. The rapid growth of the nonstate
 sector, however, has outpaced the evolution of government regulatory structures and
 resulted in inadequate labor inspection and enforcement regimes. In poorer, isolated
 areas, child labor in agriculture is widespread, given the few employment options
 available to minors who have have completed their primary school education at ap-
 proximately 13 years of age. Rising dropout rates at secondary schools in some prov-
 inces and anecdotal reports suggest that children may increasingly be entering un-
 regulated sectors of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law codifies many of the general
 principles of labor reform, setting out provisions on employment, labor contracts,
 working hours, wages, skill development and training, social insurance, dispute res-
 olution, legal responsibility, supervision, and inspection. There is no national mini-
 mum wage. Rather, the Labor Law allows local governments to determine their own
 standards on minimum wages. In general, minimum wage level determinations are
 higher than the local poverty relief ceiling but lower than the current wage level
 of the average worker.
 In December the monthly minimum wage in Beijing, set in December 1996, re-
 mained $32.50 (270 rmb). In the Shenzhen and Zhuhai SEZ's in south China, the
 monthly minimum wage was approximately $29 (240 rmb). For other parts of
 Guangdong province, the minimum monthly wage was $39 (320 rmb). In November
 the Government instructed all provinces to develop a minimum wage rate. These
 rates vary from province to province. For example, the monthly minimum wage rate
 in Hebei province is $17 (140 rmb) in urban areas and $12 (100 rmb) in rural re-
 gions. In contrast, Jiangsu province wage rate is $34 (280 rmb) for urban areas and
 $25 (210 rmb) for all rural regions. Although these wage levels may be slightly high-
 er than average living expenditures according to some official statistics, they would
 provide only a very basic standard of living for a worker and family. Minimum wage
 figures do not, however, include free or heavily subsidized benefits that some state-
 sector employers may provide in kind, such as housing, medical care, and education.
 In poor rural areas, monthly minimum wage levels are as low as $12. Official gov-
 ernment estimates put the number of people living in absolute poverty at 58 million;
 World Bank estimates range as high as 350 million.
 The Government reduced the national standard workweek in 1995 from 44 hours
 to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The Labor Law mandates a 24-hour rest period
 weekly and does not allow overtime work in excess of 3 hours a day or 36 hours
 a month. It also sets forth a required scale of remuneration for overtime work. En-
 forcement of regulations governing overtime work varies according to region and
 type of enterprise.
 Occupational health and safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns.
 Every work unit must designate a health and safety officer, and the ILO has estab-
 lished a training program for these officials. Although the Constitution does not pro-
 vide for the right to strike, the Trade Union Law explicitly recognizes the right of
 unions to "suggest that staff and workers withdraw from sites of danger" and par-
 ticipate in accident investigations. It is unclear, however, to what extent workers
 can actually remove themselves from such dangerous situations without risking loss
 of employment.
 Pressures for increased output, lack of financial resources to maintain equipment,
 lack of concern by management, and workers' traditionally poor understanding of
 safety issues have contributed to a continuing high rate of accidents. In 1996 accord-
 ing to Ministry of Labor statistics, the number of industrial accidents dropped. Total
 accidents stood at 18,181, 13.5 percent less than in 1995, with total fatalities at
 
 
 739
 17,231, a 13.9 percent drop from 1995. Of these, 9,974 occurred as a result of mine
 accidents. According to the Ministry of Public Health, over 75 million workers are
 at risk from occupational respiratory diseases such as pneumoconiosis due to poor
 working conditions. Less than half of rural enterprises meet national dust and poi-
 son standards. Many factories using harmful products, such as asbestos, fail not
 only to protect their workers against the ill effects of such products, but also to in-
 form them about the potential hazards.
 Poor enforcement by local officials of occupational safety and health regulations
 continues to put workers' lives at risk. Work safety issues have, however, attracted
 the attention of senior government leaders. In 1997 the Ministry of Labor was close
 to completion of new national occupational safety and health legislation. The Min-
 istry ofLabor has been working with the ILO and others to improve safety and in-
 spection procedures.
