 BELARUS
 Belarus has a constitutional government with executive, legislative, and judicial
 branches, but the President exercised total control over most aspects of the Govern-
 ment by the end of the year. Since his election as the first President in July 1994,
 Aleksandr Lukashenko has steadily amassed power in the executive branch. The
 President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and all executive heads of the country's
 six provinces. Presidential decrees have the force of law, except--in theory-in those
 cases restricted by the Constitution and Parliament. A new Parliament was seated
 in January, but the President restricted it from carrying out nearly all of its con-
 stitutional duties and dissolved it following a controversial constitutional referen-
 dum in November. The Troika of Foreign Ministers of the Organization for Security
 and Cooperation in Europe concluded that the circumstances of the referendum de-
 prived it "of any legitimacy." The President repeatedly ignored limits on the author-
 ity of the executive ranch. The judiciary is not independent.
 The Committee for State Security (KGB) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD),
 both answerable to the President, remained the chief law enforcement and police
 organs. Under President Lukashenko's direction, the Presidential Guard (intially
 created to protect senior officials) expanded its role and used force against the Presi-
 dent's political enemies with no judicial or legislative oversight. Members of the se-
 curity forces committed numerous human rights abuses.
 The economy is still largely state controlled and continued its steady decline since
 the breakup of the Soviet Union. Only limited, small-scale privatization has oc-
 curred, and although most prices were liberalized, the prices of staple food products
 are controlled by the Government. Most state enterprises have not been restruc-
 tured, and many are operating at a fraction of their capacity. Industry and construc-
 tion employ 40 percent of the labor force; agriculture employs 20 percent. According
 to official statistics, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of 1995 was
 $1,000; however, actual per capita GDP probably is higher since many economic ac-
 tivities are unreported. Major exports include machinery, transport equipment, and
 chemicals.
 The Government's human rights record worsened significantly as the President
 continued to lead Belarus back toward Soviet-era authoritarian practices. The Gov-
 ernment severely limits citizens' right to change their government. Lukashenko
 used a November constitutional referendum, which the international community
 generally regarded as illegitimate, to consolidate and extend his power. He used the
 results of the referendum to disband the Parliament (Supreme Soviet) and form a
 new legislature subordinate to his rule. The constitutional referendum, which was
 riddled with violations of democratic norms, also extended his term of office by 2
 years and further subordinated the judiciary to his rule. He also announced that he
 would be a cabinet member for life.
 The constitutional referendum occurred in a repressive political environment and
 with pervasive government control of the media. Through this control, the Govern-
 ment denied the voters access to the views of the opposition-including members of
 Parliament and of the Constitutional Court. The judiciary is not independent, and
 is largely unable to act as a check on the executive branch and its agents.

 Executive branch abuse of its monopolies on the security apparatus and on the
 mass media increased. Security forces reportedly regularly beat detainees and pris-
 oners. On occasion security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. The se-
 curity services monitored the activities of opposition politicians and other segments
 of the population closely. Formations of MVD troops used force to break up political
 demonstrations and made mass arrests following one protest. Severe hazing contin-
 ued in many military units. Prison conditions are poor. Prolonged detention and
 delays in trials were common. Restrictions on freedoms of speech, the press, and
 peaceful assembly all increased. Although the Government generally respected free-
 dom of association, there were serious exceptions. Restrictions on the freedoms of
 religion and of movement continued. Discrimination and domestic violence against
 women remained significant problems. The Government sharply curtailed the rights
 of workers to organize and bargain collectively.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN EIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Extra *dicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or other
 extrajudicial killings. The Government did not apologize for the September 1995
 downing of a sport balloon by the Belarusian Air Defense Force, which resulted in
 the deaths of two American citizens, despite the May conclusion of the International
 Civil Aviation Organization's investigation that the tragedy was the result of a vari-
 ety of factors, including failures and errors by Belarusian civil aviation and military
 authorities.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the 1994 Constitution and the new Constitution adopted as a result of the No-
 vember referendum provide for the inviolability of the person and specifically pro-
 hibit torture, as well- as cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment. However, police
 and prison guards reportedly regularly beat detainees and prisoners. Law enforce-
 ment and prison officials may use physical force against detainees and prisoners if
 the latter are violent, have refused to obey the instructions of the prison administra-
 tion, or have "maliciously violated the terms of their sentences." Law enforcement
 sources as well as former detainees report that investigators physically abused de-
 tainees in order to secure confessions. Although such behavior is against the law,
 the Government seldom, if ever, punishes people who commit such abuses.
 Police beat and detained journalists covering an April 26 antigovernment rally
 (see Sections 1.d. and 2.a.).
 The Ministry of Defense announced that "dedovshchina," the practice of hazing
 new recruits, would no longer be tolerated. This practice of severe harassment and
 abuse of new draftees by senior soldiers to maintain strict discipline has abated
 somewhat, but there are reports that hazing continues in many units.
 Prison conditions are poor, marked by severe overcrowding, shortages of food and
 medicine, and the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis. Conditions
 at prison hospitals are similarly poor.
 Human rights monitors were not granted sufficient access to prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Belarus has only slightly amended its So-
 iet-era law on detention. On occasion security forces arbitrarily arrested and de-
 tained citizens. The Criminal Procedure Code provides that police authorities may
 detain aperson suspected of a crime for 3 days without a warrant. This period may
 be extended for upto 10 days, pending further investigation of a crime. On the basis
 of a local prosecutor's authority, detainees may be kept in pretrial detention for up
 to 3 months. Regional and republic level prosecutors may request extensions up to
 a maximum of 18 months. The law permits citizens to appeal the legality of an ar-
 rest either to the court or to the prosecutor's office. According to judicial sources,
 nearly 90 percent of all arrests are now contested.
 By law a judge must initiate a trial within 3 weeks from the time charges are
 filed. However, the overloaded court system often does not meet this requirement,
 and months may pass before a defendant is finally brought to court.
 Detainees may be allowed unlimited access to their legal counsel, and, according
 to the 1994 Constitution, if they cannot afford counsel, a lawyer is to be appinted
 free of charge. Lawyers are not appointed free of charge in "minor" cases, however,
 and prisoners without the means to hire their own counsel have received sentences
 of up to 5 years without consulting an attorney.
 Prisoners and lawyers both report restrictions on consultations, and investigators
 may prohibit consultations between a lawyer and a client. Some detainees reported
 that investigators coerced them to sign statements waiving the right to an attorney
 during interrogation. The Government has failed to budget sufficient funds for de-
 
 
 851
 
 fense attorneys representing the indigent, and defense attorneys' fees are prohibi-
 tively expensive for many defendants. The law does not provide for the right to a
 prompt judicial determination of the legality of detention. Since there are no legal
 provisions for bail and because there is no effective judicial oversight of prosecutors'
 actions, pretrial detention has in some instances lasted longer than 3 years some-
 times without the accused knowing the charge against him. Two opposition leaders
 detained for activities in conjunction with the Apr  26 protest were released on
 their own recognizance to await trial after their month-long hunger strike threat-
 ened their lives (see Section 1.e.).
 The constitutional right of access to counsel and the requirement to charge detain-
 ees are frequently ignored. Witnesses at criminal trials who gave evidence to police
 without access to an attorney were subsequently charged based on their testimony.
 On April 26, opposition Member of Parliament Pavel Znavets was detained after
 a raid on Belarusian Popular Front headquarters and held incommunicado for more
 than 24 hours despite parliamentary immunity from arrest. Security forces refused
 to answer parliamentary inquiries about the circumstances surrounding his deten-
 tion. The Supreme Soviet formed a commission to investigate the matter. It deter-
 mined that Znavets had parliamentary immunity and should not have been de-
 tained. The matter has been dropped.
 Ukrainian nationalists detained in conjunction with an April 26 antigovernment
 rally were publicly criticized on national television before their trial began. A state-
 employed cameraman, posing as an interrogator, questioned the detainees, and offi-
 cial television broadcast their interrogation as part of the Government's campaign
 to justify the extreme police reaction to the protest.
 On the evening of April 26, hours after the conclusion of the "Path of Chernobyl"
 antigovernment protest, police arbitrarily rounded up groups of youths on the
 streets of Minsk. Anatoly Lisun, who has been deaf and mute since birth, was de-
 tained for 3 days for "shouting antipresidential slogans." In all police rounded up
 over 100 people on the streets of Minsk. Detainees were held in a Minsk prison with
 no facilities for consulting lawyers or visits from family members. For more than
 30 days foreign diplomats were refused access to their citizens detained in conjunc-
 tion with the April 26 protest.
 In October authorities reportedly detained miners who sought to attend an opposi-
 tion congress (see Section 2.b.).
 Two leaders of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front, who had played a promi-
 nent role in organizing protest demonstrations in March and April, evaded a secu-
 rity forces dragnet andfled the country. Both were granted political asylum abroad.
 Beginning in 1996 there were reports of people being apprehended by unidenti-
 fied individuals and held incommunicado for varying periods. Those conducting the
 apprehensions were presumed to be members of the government security services,
 since the detentions occurred during opposition demonstrations.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent and is largely
 unable to act as a check on the executive branch and its agents. The Supreme Coun-
 cil passed legislation to support the independence of the judiciary in 1995, but these
 reforms were not implemented. Without the implementation of major structural re-
 forms, the independence of the judiciary from outside pressure cannot be realized.
 The November constitutional referendum further subordinated the judiciary to
 Lukashenko's rule by giving the President the power to appoint 6 of the 12 members
 of the Constitutional Court, including the chairman. The remaining 6 are appointed
 by the Senate, which itself is at least partially under the control of the President
 by virtue of his power to directly appoint 8 of the 64 Senators and indirectly to in-
 fluence the election of the remainder.
 The criminal justice system, following the former Soviet model, has three tiers:
 district courts, regional courts, and the Supreme Court. Several modifications have
 been made, brought about by passage of the new Constitution, including direct pres-
 idential appointment of all district level and military judges. The President also ap-
 points the chairmen of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Su-
 preme Economic Court. A Constitutional Court was established in 1994 to adju-
 dicate serious constitutional issues, but it has no means to enforce its decisions.
 Parliament selects judges for republic-level courts on the basis of recommenda-
 tions from the Ministry of Justice, based in part on examination results. However,
 many current judges and prosecutors were appointed in Soviet times when political
 influence pervaded the criminal justice system as it does today. Judges are depend-
 ent on the Ministry of Justice or sustaining the court infrastructure and on local
 executive branch officials for providing their personal housing. Organized crime has
 had a significant impact on court decisions, There have been reports of judges grant-
 ing lenient sentences to defendants "connected" with organized crime.
 
 
 852
 Prosecutors, like the courts, are organized into offices at the district regional, and
 republic levels. They are ultimately responsible to, and serve at the pleasure of, the
 Procurator General, who according to the Constitution adopted by the November ref-
 erendum is appointed by the Senate. The previous Constitution also gave the legis-
 lature authority to appoint the Prosecutor Gneral.
 By law trials are Puic, although they may be closed on grounds of national secu-
 rity. Defendants have the legal right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses, and
 present evidence on their own behalf. These rights are not always respected in prac-
 tice. Defendants also have the right to be represented by counsel, another right not
 always respected in practice (see Section 1.d.). Trials for those detained on mis-
 demeanor charges following the April 26 protests were held assemkly-line style at
 the prison, and[ some defendants did not have the opportunity to call witnesses on
 their behalf.
 While the Constitution establishes a presumption of innocence, conviction rates
 have not changed from the Soviet era. Nearly 99 percent of completed cases result
 in convictions. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions back to
 the prosecutor for additional investigation," and prosecutors also withdraw cases
 not lkely to result in conviction.
 Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal, and now nearly 60 per-
 cent of all criminal cases are appealed. On appeals, neither defendants nor wit-
 nesses appear before the court; the court merely reviews the protocol and other doc-
 uments from the lower court's trial, and appeals rarely result in reversals of ver-
 dicts.
 Two leaders of the Belarusian Popular Front, Yuri Khadyko and Vyacheslav
 Sivchik, were detained on April 26 and charged with two felonies: Creating a public
 disturbance and interfering with the actions of police officers. After a hunger strike
 that lasted nearly a month and broad appeals for their release, both were released
 on condition that they remain in Minsk until their trial, which has been repeatedly
 postponed.
 Andrei Romashevsky, Vice President of the Belarusian Beer Lovers' Party, was
 detained following the April 26 demonstration and charged with "malicious
 hooliganism" for desecrating state symbols. Following the May 1995 referendum
 that approved the "new," Soviet-style Belarusian flag, Romashevsky burned that
 banner, yet he was only detained 1 year later, following his participation in a stu-
 dent antigovernment rally in May. After serving nearly 3 months in pretrial deten-
 tion, Romashevsky was given 1-year probation and a 2-year suspended sentence.
 The nationalist poet Slavomir Adamovich was detained on April 18 for publishing
 a poem titled "To Kill a President" and charged with inciting a terrorist act. His
 trial was continuing in criminal court at year's end.
 Vladimir Dzyuba, news editor of Belarusian Radio 2, was detained after the April
 26 rally and served a 3-day sentence for "petty hooliganism." Immediately afterhis
 release, he was again detained and given a second sentence of 15 days, reportedly
 after the judge was pressured by the executive branch for giving Dzyuba too lenient
 a sentence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-Govern-
 ment monitoring of residences and telephones increased. The KGB is widely be-
 lieved to enter homes without warrants, conduct unauthorized searches, and also to
 read mail. Human rights organizations believe that their correspondence is rou-
 tinely monitored by the security services. The KGB, the MVD, and certain border
 guard detachments have the right to request permission to install wiretaps but le-
 gally must obtain a prosecutos permission before installation. The Presidential
 Guard formed in 1995 reportedly conducted surveillance activities of the President's
 olitical opponents. There is no judicial or legislative oversight of the Presidential
 uard's budget or activities, and the executive branch has repeatedly thwarted at-
 tempts to exercise such oversight.
 The Government makes no secret of the security service's activities or capabilities
 and conducts active surveillance of opponents of the Lukashenko Government. In
 February a telephone installed in the residence of the newly elected Speaker of the
 Parliament was found to be wiretapped. In September the Chairman of the Con-
 stitutional Court announced that he had received information from a source within
 the Presidential Guard that President Lukashenko had given instructions to record
 the Justice's telephone conversations, both at home and at work, as well as to collect
 "compromising materials" on the leader of the country's highest court.
 In a February 26 address to government and industry leaders, the President open-
 ly referred to a "special services" report detailing trade union meetings with inter-
 national labor organizations. The President attempted to discredit trade union lead-
 ers, accusing them of plotting to "destabilize the domestic political situation."
 
 
 853
 
 Nearly all opposition political figures assumed that the Government monitors
 their activities and conversations. The Lukashenko Government did nothing to re-
 fute these assumptions. Indeed, government officials do not appear to be exempt
 from monitoring. Lukashenko declared to a television audience that he was con-
 fident of then-Prime Minister Chigir's loyalty because he knew what Chigir said in
 private to his wife.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 but the Government does not respect this right in practice. The executive branch,
 through the head of the President's Chief Directorate for Public Information, further
 increased direct suppression of freedom of expression through its near total monop-
 oly on the means ofprduction and distribution of mass media and by restricting
 the access of independent media to official sources of information. The Government
 increased economic pressure on the independent media by pressuring advertisers to
 withdraw advertisements and by ordering intrusive, prolonged inspections of their
 financial activities.
 The defamation law makes no distinction between private and public persons for
 the purposes of lawsuits for defamation of character. A public figure who has been
 criticized for poor performance in office may ask the public prosecutor to sue the
 newspaper that printed the criticism.
 In January the President signed a decree ordering that all editors in chief of
 state-supported newspapers would henceforth be official state employees and would
 become members of the appropriate level government council. Another decree grant-
 ed the Ministry of Press authority to assign graduates of state-supported journalism
 schools to work in state-owned media organizations as a means ofpayment for their
 schooling.
 In December 1995, on instructions from President Lukashenko, the state publish-
 ing house refused to renew printing contracts with the four leading independent
 newspapers. These publications continued to circulate in Belarus, but they are still
 denied access to the state-controlled system of distribution and publishing facilities.
 The Belarusian Television and Radio Company (B-TR) maintained its total mo-
 nopoly as the only nationwide television station. B-TR Director Grigory Kisel in-
 structed the state television company to cease broadcasting the opening session of
 Parliament. Despite parliamentary resolutions calling for time on state television,
 B-TR did not broadcast the Constitutional Court's annual address to the nation,
 which was highly critical of many of President Lukashenko's actions. On April 18,
 the Parliament adopted a resolution that claimed that the B-TR "regularly broad-
 cast information which discredited the activities of the highest legislative body." On
 September 27, in response to what it termed consistently tendentious coverage, Par-
 liament withdrew B-TR's press accreditation. (Russian television networks continue
 to have access to Supreme Council sessions.)
 The Government regularly restricted the access of independent media to official
 sources of information. On many occasions, representatives of the independent
 media were not granted accreditation to government press conferences. The Cabinet
 of Ministers announced on February 8 that the Russian news agency Interfax would
 not be granted further access to information for "grossly distorting" the meaning of
 testimony by the Prime Minister before Parliament. In accordance with a presi-
 dential decree, the Government broke the lease on the editorial offices of the inde-
 pendent news agency "Belapan" and the opposition newspaper "Svaboda" and forced
 them to move without compensation.
 Police beat journalists attempting to cover the April 26 antigovernment rally dur-
 ing the melee that followed the raly, and detained two journalists. Radio Liberty
 correspondent Eduard Terlitsky and Cezary Golinski of the Polish daily "Gazeta
 Wyboreza" were seriously injured.
 Journalists covering a peaceful May Day rally were harassed and roughly handled
 by unidentified security officers in civilian clothing, reportedly members of the Pres-
 idential Guard service. The film of two journalists was exposed and videotapes were
 removed from the camera of the Moscow-based NTV correspondent. The prosecutor's
 office initiated an investigation, but it has not produced results. Journalists claimed
 that the incidents were an attempt to intimidate them and influence their coverage
 of future civil disturbances.
 On the night of June 20-21, two men reportedly broke into the apartment of
 Radio Liberty correspondent Yuri Drakokhrust and physically abused his wife
 Galina. Drakokhrust, who was away on a business trip, was a vocal critic of the
 Lukashenko administration. Galina Drakokhrust claimed that the men used a key
 to enter the apartment, stole nothing, and insisted that she "tell her husband" what
 happened.
 
 
 854
 The Government used the State Tax Inspectorate and the "President's Control
 Board" to harass the independent media. The publisher of Belarus' leading inde-
 pendent newspapers claimed that the tax inspectorate had received instructions to
 keep looking through the books until they find a reason to close them down." The
 bank accounts of five independent newspapers were frozen for period of about 1
 month but were no longer frozen at year's end.
 The Government closed down Radio 101.2, Minsk's only independent Belarusian
 language radio station, on September 1. After the Government initially claimed that
 the antenna interfered with security force communications, the President admitted
 that 'a government transmitter and government frequencies * * * would not be
 used for antigovernment policies." In fact Radio 101.2 purchased the transmitter
 and antenna, but due to government prohibitions on private ownership of broadcast
 equipment, transferred title of the equipment to the Ministry of Communications
 and was renting the equipment back from the Government. In October Belarusian
 authorities closed down Radio NBK, the only independent station in Grodno, for al-
 leged financial irregularities. State television and radio consistently denied access
 to the opposition, including the Speaker of the Supreme Soviet, prior to the Novem-
 ber referendum despite repeated appeals by the Parliament. An analysis of media
 coverage during the November 9-24 referendum by the European Institute for
 Media concluded that of the 2,000 minutes devoted to referendum reporting on tele-
 vision, 90 percent openly suported the President's position; the other 10 percent
 was considered non iased. adio coverage during the same period similarly con-
 tained no coveraeq that could be considered supportive of the opposition to the ref-
 erendum or the Parliament.
 The observance of academic freedom is mixed. University students and academics
 alike are free to pursue virtually any course of study or research. After enjoying con-
 siderable freedom to develop curricula in the first years following independence,
 educators are now more restrained.
 On February 26, Vladimir Zametalin, President Lukashenko's Chief of Socio-Polit-
 ical Information, sent a letter to all academic institutions requiring a full report on
 all educators' publications, membership in social organizations (including political
 party affiliation), and any prizes and grants won from both foreign and domestic or-
 ganizations.
 During an April 4 press conference, President Lukashenko accused educators of
 inciting students to oppose his Government's plans for closer integration with Rus-
 sia. Lukashenko warned academics that "we know who you are, and not to hide
 behind the youths whom they "throw out" to the demonstrations. Addressing teach-
 ers on October 5, the President called for the reintroduction of "ideological edu-
 cation," without which, he claimed, students were more disposed to participate in
 "nationalist riots.&"
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly. The Soviet Law on Demonstrations, which is still valid, requires
 an application to be made at least 10 days in advance to local officials. The local
 government must respond either positively or negatively not later than 5 days prior
 to the scheduled event. Public demonstrations occurred frequently but always under
 strict government control. Throughout a series of antigovernment demonstrations in
 the spring, the Government appeared to be following a policy of seeking confronta-
 tion with protestors, and police regularly used force to disperse crowds. The Govern-
 ment continued to restrict citizens right to assemble throughout the year, but begin-
 ning with a May 1 demonstration authorities instituted a more balanced policy-
 reinforced, at times, by a heavy police presence, and no further serious clashes with
 demonstrators occurred.
 The Government issued permits for rallies on March 24 and April 26, but (accord-
 ing to opposition members) placed unreasonable restrictions on the location and
 path of the rallies. The Government placed formations of internal troops dressed in
 riot gear in the likely path of the marchers and used truncheons and tear gas in
 attempts to repel crowds. During the April 26 demonstration, the crowd responded
 with rocks and bottles and overturned two police cars. After the rally, police round-
 ed up over 100 people on the streets of Minsk and raided the headquarters of the
 Belarusian Popular Front.
 For most of the year, the Government denied permission for rallies to be held
 near Minsk's Independence Square and the President's office building; however, dur-
 ing  the  November    referendum  authorities  allowed  both  opposition  and
 propresidential demonstrators to remain in the square for a week-long vigil. In June
 the Association of Independent Industrial Trade Unions was denied permission to
 picket the President's office building but was granted permission to picket the Par-
 liament.
 
 
 855
 Members of the Independent Miners' Union who attempted to walk from Soligorsk
 to Minsk to attend an October 18-19 opposition congress were repeatedly detained
 en route. After being released on October 21, 5 of the original 17 miners who set
 out reached Minak on October 23. University instructors were told not to let stu-
 dents leave after class in order to hold down participation in an October 19 dem-
 onstration held in opposition to the concurrent All-Belarusian People's Congress or-
 ganized by President I~ukashenko.
 Both the 1994 Constitution and the Constitution adopted by the November ref-
 erendum provide for freedom of association; however the Government did not fully
 respect this right in practice. According to members of parties in opposition to the
 President, opposition groups frequently are denied permission to meet in public
 buildings. Employees at state-run enterprises are discouraged from subscribing to
 independent journals and were bused to rallies in support of the President. The
 Government regularly used the nationalist Belarusian Popular Front as a scapegoat,
 raided  its  headquarters   confiscated  leaflets  that  would  have  publicized
 "unsanctioned rallies," and in June froze the organization's bank account. In addi-
 tion the Government's suspension of the Free Trade Union of Belarus continued (see
 Section 6.a.).
 At year's end there were 34 registered political parties. A 1995 decision by the
 Ministry of Justice required existing public associations to reregister. During the re-
 registration process, the Ministry frequently found cause to deny reregistration to
 many organizations, effectively reducing the number of public associations in
 Belarus from 700 to 400 by year's end. According to the Belarus League for Human
 Rights some government officials admitted that the process was illegal and, there-
 fore, alowed some groups to continue operating under their original registration.
 Nongovernmental organizations can legally be established, but the Ministry of Jus-
 tice scrutinizes their registration applications and frequently finds cause not to reg-
 ister them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally respects this right in practice. However, a July 1995 Cabinet
 of Ministers directive sharply limits the activity of foreign religious workers. Citi-
 zens are not prohibited from proselytizing, but foreign missionaries may not engage
 in religious activities outside the institutions that invited them. Only religious orga-
 nizations already registered in Belarus may invite foreign clergy. This new directive
 hampered foreign religious workers' efforts to proselytize; it seeks to limit them to
 providing humanitarian aid oniy.
 The Cabinet of Ministers regulation is seen as a means of enhancing the position
 of the Orthodox Church with respect to the faster-growing Roman Catholic and
 Protestant churches and also as a means of preventing religious movements outside
 the mainstream from spreading. The President granted special tax and other finan-
 cial advantages to the Orthodox Church, which other denominations do not enjoy,
 and has declared the preservation and development of Orthodox Christianity a
 "moral necessity." In 1995, 50 Polish Roman Catholic priests were reportedly denied
 registration as foreign religious workers. There were no reports of such denial of
 registration in 1996. Bishops must receive permission from the State Committee on
 Religious Affairs before transferring a foreign priest to another parish. The head of
 the Orthodox Church, who is closely associated with the President, frequently
 speaks critically of missionaries.
 Some difficulties still exist in transferring church property from state control back
 to the former owners. There has been very limited and inconsistent progress on the
 repatriation of former Jewish property.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-According to the Constitution, citizens are free to travel within the
 country and to live and work where they wish. All adults are still issued internal
 passports, which serve as primary identity documents and are required for travel,
 permanent housing, and hotel registration.
 The right to choose one's place of residence, although provided by law, remains
 restricted in practice. Despite its formal abolition by the Soviet government in Octo-
 ber 1991, the "propiska" (pass) system survives in Belarus. All citizens are required
 to register their places of residence and may not change them without official per-
 mission. The authorities no longer explicitly limit the number of residence permits
 in Minsk and the five regional centers of Brest, Grodno, Mogilev, Vitebsk, and
 Gomel. However, in order to register, a citizen must already have employment in
 the city. To be employed in the city, however, one must already be registered.
 Police checkpoints at the approaches to all major cities are manned by police and,
 at times, by soldiers in full combat gear who randomly inspect vehicles. Citizens
 who appear to be of Central Asian descent report that they are stopped much more
 frequently than others.
 
 
 Government regulations on entry and exit require citizens who wish to travel
 abroad to first receive an overseas passport and a "global" exit visa, which is valid
 for from 1 to 5 years. Once a traveler has these documents, the law does not restrict
 travel. However a severe shortage of overseas passports has led to a backlog in is-
 suance. In an address on June 20, President Lucashenko announced that "from July
 1 forward, not one citizen will travel beyond the borders of our State without notify-
 ing the authorities," but no new restrictions on travel were introduced. At the end
 of the year, the Government took measures aimed at limiting the travel of opposi-
 tion politicians. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in December that those
 parliamentarians who did not join the new legislature could no longer travel on
 their diplomatic passports. Although the diplomatic passports were not confiscated,
 the border guards reportedly had a "black list" of opposition members who were to
 be denied exit from the country if using a diplomatic passport.
 According to government data, no citizen was denied permission to emigrate.
 However legislation restricting emigration by those with access to "state secrets"
 remained in effect, and any citizen involved in a criminal investigation was also in-
 eligible to emigrate. Prospetive emigrants who have been refused the right to emi-
 grate may appeal to the courts.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. How-
 ever, there is no law regulating the status of refugees, and the Government has no
 policy on first asylum. The Government does little to assist refugees. The Constitu-
 tion states that the State "may grant refuge to persons being persecuted in other
 states for their political and religious convictions or on account of their nationality."
 The UNHCR estimates that there are 170,000 refugees in Belarus. Although the
 UNHCR reports that the delay in establishing a state migration service has made
 the life of these individuals "very difficult," there were no reports of forced expulsion
 of those having a valid claim to refugee status or of persons to countries where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government severely limits the right of citizens to change their government.
 The 1994 Constitution calls for a republic with strong executive and legislative
 branches as well as an independent judiciary. The President controls the Cabinet
 of Ministers and appoints province governors, who in turn appoint local authorities.
 Presidentially appointed local officials, not the elected city councils, exercise power
 in municipalities. In practice the President restricted the activity and authority of
 the Parliament and the Constitutional Court and successfully resisted repeated at-
 tempts to confine his authority to constitutionally prescribed bounds.
 During the November 9-24 period, the executive branch held a controversial con-
 stitutional referendum that was neither free nor fair. Many members of Parliament
 and of the Constitutional Court actively opposed Lukashenko's proposals for both
 substantive and procedural reasons. They asserted substantively that the referen-
 dum gave Lukashenko control over the legislative and judicial branches of govern-
 ment and extended his term in office; and procedurally that it was an unconstitu-
 tional means for eliminating the Constitution's checks and balances and granting
 the President virtuallk unlimited powers.
 In the period leading up to the referendum, opponents of Lukashenko's proposals
 were denied access to the media, election officials failed to record the names of early
 voters, and no texts of the proposed constitution were made available to voters until
 several days after people began voting. As a result of these irregularities, the head
 of the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced prior to the event that he
 would not be able to certify the results of the referendum. President Lukashenko
 promptly fired him, although the Constitution in force at the time gave authority
 to appoint and dismiss the CEC chairman exclusively to the Parliament. Members
 of the security forces then forcibly removed him from his office. Shortly thereafter,
 the Prime Minister resigned in protest of President Lukashenko's refusal to cancel
 the widely criticized referendum.
 Most of the international community chose not to send'election monitors to ob-
 serve the referendum, because of the illegitimacy of the entire process. Human
 rights organizations including the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the Com-
 mittee to Protect Journalists, and Human Rights Watch protested the conduct of the
 referendum.
 The Constitutional Court had ruled that the issues posed in President
 Lukashenko's referendum could not be legally decided through a referendum, and
 that its results should be purely advisory, consistent with the Constitution. How-
 ever, after winning the referendum-according to the Government's results-Presi-
 
 
 dent Lukashenko began to implement it immediately. The new Constitution estab-
 lishes a bicameral legislature. Its 110-member lower house was formed out of the
 membership of the existing Supreme Soviet; deputies volunteered or were bribed by
 premises of free housing and other benefits to serve in the new body. The 64-mem-
 ber upper house was created by a combination of presidential appointments and
 elections by the 7 oblast councils and the Minsk City Council. Many electoral dis-
 tricts were left unrepresented in the new legislature as a result of the transition.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics and govern-
 ment. However, with the exception of the judiciary, social barriers to women in poli-
 tics are strong, and men hold virtually a  leadership positions. Only 9 of the 199
 members of the now defunct Supreme Soviet were women. Lukashenko has said
 that the new legislature should include 30 percent women. The President appointed
 a woman as chair of the National Bank, and there are two female ministers in the
 Government-the Ministers of Health and of Social Welfare.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights monitors reported that the Government presented some obstacles
 when they tried to investigate alleged human rights violations. Belarus' human
 rights record drew the attention of many international human rights organizations,
 and there are several local human rights groups active in the country. In general,
 however, human rights monitors noted government willingness to discuss human
 rights, and international organizations were not hindered in visiting Belarus. The
 Ministry of Justice attempted to force the Belarus League for Human Rights to
 change its charter during the course of reregistration. However, the League argued
 that this effort was illegal, secured high-level support for this position, and contin-
 ues to operate under its original registration.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "all are equal before the law and have a right, with-
 out any discrimination, to equal protection of their rights and legitimate interests,"
 but it does not specifically prohibit discrimination based on factors such as race, sex,
 or religion.
 The Law on Citizenship, passed by the Parliament, grants citizenship to any per-
 son living permanently on the territory of Belarus as of October 19, 1991. Those who
 arrived in Belarus after that date and wish to become citizens are required to sub-
 mit an application for citizenship, take an oath to support the Constitution, have
 a legal source of income, and have lived in the country for 7 years. Parliament
 passed a new Law on Immigration and Migration in 1995 that provides numerical
 limits on new citizens but failed to budget funds for its implementation.
 Women.-Although statistics are not available, domestic violence against women
 is a significant problem. Knowledgeable sources indicate that police generally are
 not hesitant to enforce laws against violence and that the courts are not reluctant
 to impose sentences. The main problem, according to women's groups, is a general
 reluctance among women to report incidents of domestic violence.
 The law requires equal wages for equal work, and in practice women are paid the
 same as men. However, they have significantly less opportunity for advancement to
 the upper ranks of management and government.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare and health, par-
 ticularly as related to the consequences of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, and,
 with the help of foreign donors, gives them special attention. The Government pro-
 vides education; children begin school at the age of 6 and are required to complete
 9 years, although the Government makes 11 years of education available. Families
 with children receive government benefits. A World Bank study found that the ma-
 jority of those living in poverty are families with multiple children or single moth-
 ers.
 There does not appear to be a societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-A law mandating accessibility to transport, residences,
 businesses, and offices for the disabled came into force in 1992. However, facilities,
 including transport and office buildings, often are not accessible to the disabled. The
 Government, facing a deteriorating economic situation, failed to budget sufficient
 funds to implement these laws. However, when the Government slashed subsidies
 for most sectors of society, most subsidies for the disabled remained in force.
 Religious Minorities.--Societal anti-Semitism exists, but it is not usually mani-
 fested openly. Instances of anti-Semitism included the desecration of Jewish ceme-
 teries and monuments in Gomel, Borisov, Minsk, and other cities. In addition state-
 
 
 858
 
 owned newspapers have published anti-Semitic articles, and anti-Semitic incidents
 did not evoke a government reaction.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution upholds the right of workers, ex-
 cept state security and military personnel, to form and join independent unions on
 a voluntary basis and to carry out actions in defense of workers rights, including
 the right to strike. However, these rights are not generally recognized in practice.
 The Government suspended the activities of the Free Trade Union of Belarus (SPB)
 in conjunction with a 1995 Minsk metro strike. International labor organizations,
 including the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, joined Belarusian
 independent trade unions in presenting a case to the International Labor Organiza-
 tion, alleging violations of the right to strike, arrests of trade union leaders, and
 restrictive legislation on freedom of association.
 The independent trade union movement is still in its infancy, and the Govern-
 ment is hindering its activities. Although several independent trade unions exist,
 the Belarusian branch of the former Soviet Union's All-Union Central Council of
 Trade Unions-currently the Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus (FTUB)-is by
 far the largest trade union organization. This trade union of 5 million members is
 not considered independent since it often follows government orders. However, one
 of the member associations of the FTUB, the Association of Independent Industrial
 Trade Unions of Belarus (AUITUB), has begun          to  break  away  from  the
 progovernment line of the FTUB and is speaking out in defense of its members'
 rights.
 Workers are often automatically inducted into the FTUB, and their union dues
 are deducted from their wages. Independent labor leaders believe that the official
 trade unions' control over social functions usually performed by the State (such as
 pension funds) is an obstacle to the growth of true, independent trade unions.
 The two major independent trade unions are the Free Trade Union of Belarus
 (SPB) and the Belarusian Independent Trade Union (BNP). The BNP and the SPB
 formed the Congress of Free Trade Unions of Belarus, which coordinates the activi-
 ties of the two largest unions of more than 16,000 members and serves as a resource
 center for the free trade union movement.
 Although the SPB was reregistered following the 1995 Minsk metro strike, a pres-
 idential decree "suspending the activities" of the SPB continues to prevent it from
 cariyingout its functions. The Ministry of Justice circulated a letter to enterprises
 where the SPB has local unions instructing them that the SPB "does not have the
 right to act."
 A strike planned for February 28 by the AIITUB to protest delays in paying work-
 ers' wages was forbidden by the President's administration and by the Minsk City
 Council, which claimed that "since workers' demands had been met," there was no
 reason to approve plans for the strike. Throughout the year, workers staged 1-day
 strikes to protest delays in receiving wages.
 The SPB invited Polish Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski to Belarus to
 meet with workers at the Minsk automated lines plant, but Krzaklewski was denied
 access to the plant despite having a valid entry permit. Krzaklewski met with work-
 ers outside the territory of the plant on May 14. Shortly thereafter, he and two col-
 leagues were detained, denied access to the Polish consul for several hours, and
 ejected from Belarus for "conducting an unauthorized mass meeting."
 Unions may freely affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation dating from the
 Soviet era provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively. Since the econ-
 omy is still largely in the hands of the State, unions usually seek redress at the
 political level. Workers and independent unions have recourse to the court system.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1994 Constitution prohibits
 forced labor, and it is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Current labor law establishes 16
 years of age as the statutory minimum age for employment of children. With the
 written consent of one parent (or legal guardian), a child of 14 years may conclude
 a labor contract. Reportedly, the Prosecutor General's office enforces this law effec-
 tively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The President's administration sets a mini-
 mum wage, which was raised once in response to inflation. As of October 1, the
 monthly minimum wage was less than $10 (120,000 Belarusian rubles). The mini-
 mum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The Labor Code sets a limit of 40 hours of work per week and provides for at
 least one 24-hour rest period per week. Because of the difficult economic situation,
 an increasing number of workers find themselves working considerably less than 40
 
 
 859
 hours per week. Factories often require workers to take unpaid furloughs due to
 shortages of raw materials and energy, and lack of demand for factory output.
 The law establishes minimum conditions for workplace safety and worker health;
 however, these standards are often ignored. Workers at many heavy machinery
 plants do not wear even minimal safety gear, such as gloves, hard hats, or welding
 glasses. A State Labor Inspectorate exists but does not have the authority to enforce
 compliance, and violations are often ignored. There is no provision in law allowing
 workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without risking their
 jobs.
