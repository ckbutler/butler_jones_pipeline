 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is governed by a military junta, composed of the
 ranking flag officers of the three services and led by the
 President, who is a former Commander-in-Chief of the army. The
 institutions of the Government of Uruguay include the
 Presidency, various military service bodies, a Council of
 Ministers, and an appointed Council of State which acts as the
 legislature. The President and junta or the three service
 commanders make the most important national policy decisions.
 Currently, the military rules as a government of transition,
 having publicly committed itself to support a constitutional
 process in 1983/84 which will lead to national elections in
 1984 and the return to constitutional, elected government by
 March 1985.
 Uruguay is one of the more advanced of the developing
 countries, with a per capita domestic product of approximately
 $3,500 in 1981. Although the economy is currently experiencing
 a severe recession, the Government has maintained its basic
 commitment to an open economic model within the free market
 system. A major program of economic reforms begun in 1978
 commited Uruguay to an export-led program of development based
 on encouraging and diversifying exports, reducing protectionist
 tariffs and inflation, and increasing governmental efficiency.
 Uruguay had long been a democracy with advanced social welfare
 policies. The late 1960's, however, were a period marked by a
 national political malaise and economic stagnation that
 culminated in the breakdown of institutions, and urban
 terrorism by the Marxist-oriented Tupamaros. Uruguay's
 civillian leaders, unable to govern effectively, drifted into a
 reliance on authoritarian practices. In 1972, an elected
 government passed a national security law which limited
 individual rights, and expanded police and military powers. In
 1973, conflicts between the legislature and the armed forces
 over the anti-subversion campaign led to the closure of the
 Congress by the military and a shift to military rule. The
 military removed the civilian president in 1976 and formed a
 military government with civilian participation. The new junta
 outlawed extreme leftist parties as well as the Christian
 Democratic Party, and suspended the political activities of the
 traditional centrist political parties. Anti-terrorist
 activities during 1971-1973, conducted with little regard for
 individual rights, resulted in the virtual elimination of the
 Tupamaros. Additional "security arrests' in 1976-77
 concentrated on communists and far-left activists. The period
 1976 to 1979 was marked by the suspension of political rights
 and the loss of an independent judiciary.
 Since 1978, violations of individual rights have declined,
 although the institutional framework under which the violations
 occurred still remains. In 1982, the Government made
 approximately 100 "national security' arrests, a slight
 reduction compared to previous years, although above the 1981
 level. The number of prisoners held on political or national
 security grounds declined to 958 as of October 1982, compared
 to 1,014 in 1981. The Government ordered an end to the use of
 torture in 1979, although charges of prisoner mistreatment
 continue. Prison conditions are harsh and abuses occur. The
 Government frequently detains *national security* prisoners for
 several weeks beyond the expiration date of their sentences.
 Civilian political activity took a significant step forward in
 November 1982. The traditional Colorado and Blanco parties
 held internal elections to choose party leaders with 60 percent
 of the registered populace voting in a peaceful and orderly
 
 
 645
 election. The elections marked an important step toward the
 return to elected civilian rule promised in 1985. During the
 campaign, freedom of assembly, speech, and press were
 liberalized. The Government, nevertheless, maintained control
 of the process, suppressing several publications and arresting
 19 individuals -- 12 for allegedly trying to form an
 unauthorized political party and seven for 'mockery of
 constitutional institutions.'
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There was no evidence of killings for political motives in
 Uruguay during 1982. Neither terrorists nor paramilitary
 forces were active during this year. Three national security
 prisoners died in custody. The Government attributed two of
 these deaths to suicide and one to natural causes.
 b. Disappearances
 Since 1978, no permanent disappearances have been documented.
 There were a few cases however, in which the Government
 detained individuals for several months without revealing their
 whereabouts. Families were sometimes not informed of the
 arrest of individuals detained for security reasons until
 initial investigations were completed, a process which often
 takes several months.
 c. Torture
 The 1972-77 period witnessed widespread use of torture to
 obtain information. Following internal measures taken in 1979
 to curb the use of torture, credible reports of physical abuse
 have declined. Some outside observers and human rights groups
 report that harsh mistreatment continues to be employed,
 although there are also indications from relatives of prisoners
 that physical treatment has improved in the course of the
 year. Four female prisoners alleged that they were beaten by
 prison guards in February 1982 but extensive inquiries have not
 substantiated the charges.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The death penalty and cruel punishment were outlawed by the
 1967 Constitution. Prisoners, relatives, and others allege
 that psychological intimidation, physical abuse, and harassment
 of prisoners sometimes take place in Uruguayan jails. Such
 treatment is reportedly most common during the initial phases
 of detention and interrogation. The treatment meted out to an
 individual frequently is determined by the nature of the
 charges, the prominence of the person, the security unit
 handling the case, and the place of detention.
 Human rights organizations have expressed concern over health
 and living conditions in the prisons, particularly in respect
 to the medical treatment of prisoners with chronic illnesses.
 Most political prisoners are held in two military prisons,
 Libertad for men tand Punta de Rieles for women. They are
 permitted normally to see close relatives every two weeks under
 restricted conditions and to receive parcels and funds for
 canteen purchases. Overall, health care is comparable to the
 national norm and prison diets, although monotonous and
 limited, are adequate to maintain health.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus and other constitutional guarantees have been
 effectively suspended since 1972 for cases involving national
 security. Uruguayan authorities insist that all national
 security prisoners were arrested for violent crimes or other
 illegal subversive activities, which include the crimes of
 
 
 646
 "undermining the morale of the armed forces' and "disrespect
 for military authorities.'
 Since April 1972, approximately 6,300 persons have been turned
 over to the military justice system. Of this number, over
 1,300 were subsequently released without trial. An additional
 4,000 were discharged after serving part or all of their
 sentences. In late 1982, 958 political/national security
 detainees remained in prison, compared with 1,014 held at the
 end of 1981. About 300 of the present group of 958 prisoners
 have been convicted of violent crimes, such as bombing or
 kidnapping. A small but undetermined number of individuals are
 detained at any given time without charges under interim
 national security measures which allow detentions without trial.
 During 1982, about 150 political prisoners were released.
 There were 100 new "national security' arrests reported in
 1982. Releases included those freed on parole, with
 restrictions on their movement and right to travel abroad, and
 others whose release was conditioned upon leaving Uruguay.
 Many paroled prisoners flee to other countries. The
 authorities on occasion have rearrested released prisoners for
 prosecution on new charges and detained others under interim
 security measures after the completion of sentences until they
 agree to leave Uruguay.
 Amnesty International in its 1982 report which covers 1981 said
 that '330 prisoners were adopted by Amnesty International as
 prisoners of conscience, or were being investigated as possible
 prisoners of conscience'.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Independence of the judiciary was formally restored in 1981,
 but implementing laws and regulations are still being written
 and the full independence of the civilian judiciary has not
 been re-established.   As is normal in Latin America, both the
 civilian and the military court systems use written
 proceedings. The judge makes decisions on the basis of briefs
 and often confronts the accused only during arraignment and
 sentencing. The evidence, arguments and records are normally
 not available to the public. Strict regulations are applied.
 Detainees are free to choose their own counsel, but usually
 accept court-appointed defenders. Counsel does not have
 pre-indictment access to clients or full access to the
 evidence. The defense role is limited largely to sentence
 bargaining and appeals for early release.
 An individual accused of subversive activities is subject to
 trial under the military justice system, which is closed to
 public scrutiny and often arbitrary. Human rights
 organizations and commissions have consistently charged that
 the military judicial system fails to guarantee due process and
 adequate protection of the defendant. The military tribunals
 impose procedural restrictions that limit the defendant's
 ability to mount an effective defense. Standards governing the
 admissibility of evidence are less rigorous than under ordinary
 penal code. Sentences imposed on political/security prisoners
 are often lengthy, more than 10 years. Although rarely done,
 the decisions of the military courts may be appealed to the
 Supreme Court. There were no open proceedings before the
 Supreme Court in 1982.
 Since 1978, Uruguayan authorities have accelerated the work of
 the military court system. The backlog of prisoners awaiting
 indictment has been largely eliminated.  The number of persons
 not yet sentenced declined from 400 in 1979 to about 50 in
 1982, including some of the more prominent prisoners who are
 still awaiting final sentencing after nearly a decade in
 custody.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 
 
 647.
 Guarantees of inviolability of the home are respected in
 non-security cases but are suspended under the interim security
 measures for persons suspected of terrorism, subversion, or
 other national security violations. Recent reports of
 government intrusion into the lives of private citizens include
 an allegation that the Government planted listening devices in
 the office of a rural federation critical of the government
 economic policy. Politicians and others report that they are
 subjected to police surveillance.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including;
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The information media are restricted, but the trend toward
 greater freedom of expression, begun in 1980, continues. A
 number of weekly and monthly publications, some opposed to the
 Government, circulate widely in Uruguay. The press operates
 under a system of self-censorship, monitored by the National
 Office of Public Relations. While the junta has not published
 specific rules explaining what can and cannot be published, it
 has warned journalists to avoid criticism of the armed forces
 and government policies and to avoid reference to proscribed
 politicians. These warnings are occasionally ignored without
 penalty, but on other occasions the Government has reacted by
 closing publications.
 Despite the overall positive trend, the Government in 1982
 reacted to press criticism with increased frequency and
 severity as the election period approached. During 1981, the
 normal period of closure was four issues. During the first
 half of 1982, five publications were closed for eight issues.
 The Government closed one weekly for 24 issues, and two other
 magazines permanently. The editor of one weekly was detained
 for one week in September, on charges relating to an article
 published in 1981. Several editors and authors were questioned
 or warned by the police and judicial authorities to moderate
 their criticism of the government.
 While the authorities took more punitive actions against the
 press in 1982, there was a significant net improvement in the
 overall flow of information, opinion, and criticism. Virtually
 all major political groups actually participating in the 1982
 elections published their own weeklies. A Blanco Party
 newspaper, closed by the Government in July, was replaced by
 two weeklies and a monthly. Articles in the press cover a
 range of topics previously considered untouchable.
 Freedom of speech, particularly during public assemblies, was
 less restricted than in previous years when such freedom was
 virtually non-existent. During the election campaign in 1982,
 as during the 1980 constitutional plebiscite politicians were
 allowed to speak to large crowds and to discuss a variety of
 new topics. The Government, however, reacted strongly to what
 it considered excessive public attacks, jailing five
 politicians who were barred from further participation in the
 1982 elections and the 1983 party conventions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The political party statute and its implementing regulations
 established the right of public assembly and campaign
 activities. In preparation for the internal party elections in
 November 1982, numerous political factions opened headquarters
 and held meetings, rallies, and parades. The parties were
 required to file for police permission prior to rallies and
 were restricted from downtown Montevideo, except for a massive
 victory rally after the elections. There was some variance in
 the interpretation of the rules governing assembly in some of
 the towns in the interior. Freedom of assembly and association
 was extended during the months before the party elections,
 except to proscribed parties such as the Christian Democrats,
 Socialists, and Communists, and individual proscribed.
 
 
 648
 politicians.
 The Government through the Ministry of Education exercises
 centralized control over primary, secondary and university
 education. The Ministry appoints the university rector and
 approves course materials at all levels.
 The Government began to relax some of the constraints on labor
 organizing and collective bargaining in 1978 and democratic
 trade unions and their national confederation started to revive
 slowly. A new labor code guaranteeing the right to organize
 and to bargain collectively was enacted in 1981, but with
 significant labor controls. The right to strike, expected to
 be restored in 1982, remained suspended. The Government
 closely controls all labor activities to ensure that there is
 no revival of the communist-dominated national labor
 confederation of the early 1970s and previous years.
 The International Labor Organization in 1981 expressed
 satisfaction with improvements made in the Uruguayan labor code
 in that year. In 1982, the Labor Ministry reported that some
 50 labor unions were legally recognized and over 100 were in
 the process of seeking legal recognition through the third
 quarter of 1982. No federations or confederations had been
 registered by that date.
 Private associations operate normally, with few restrictions,
 but do not participate in political activities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Uruguay is a secular state. Religious freedom is
 constitutionally guaranteed and respected. There were no
 reported incidents of anti-Semitism in 1982, as had occurred in
 previous years. The Korean-origin Unification Church has been
 allowed to register and operate despite vocal opposition from
 certain critical elements in Uruguay.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are few restrictions on freedom of movement. A high
 percentage of the population, estimated at over 10 percent, has
 emigrated in the last decade. The Government sometimes delays
 or denies renewal of passports to persons suspected of national
 security offenses. There have been no known forcible
 repatriations since 1978. A small number of national security
 prisoners, including some dual nationals, have been required to
 leave Uruguay as a condition for their release from prison.
 Proscribed individuals and those who departed Uruguay
 illegally, would have difficulty returning. About 10 Polish
 seamen applied for refugee status in Uruguay in 1982. They
 have been allowed to remain but are still awaiting formal
 determination of status.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The armed forces in Uruguay rule through several organizations,
 including the Junta of Generals, the National Security Council,
 and the Joints Chiefs of Staff. The President of Uruguay is
 served by 12 ministers, two of whom are military officers.
 Military officers, both active and retired, hold senior-level
 government positions once held by civilians. Military
 spokesmen have declared that, while the country is in a process
 of transition to democratic civilian rule, there will be no
 sharing of power -- the reins will stay firmly in the hands of
 the military until power is transferred in March 1985.
 Military spokesmen have also announced the determination of the
 armed forces to retain a predominant influence on all issues
 affecting national security after civilian rule is restored.
 They reject any possibility of investigations into military
 acts committed during the 'internal war* of the 1970s.
 
 
 649
 On November 28, 1982 the Uruguayans voted in party elections,
 the first formal elections [aside from the 1980 plebiscite]
 since 1971, choosing 500 convention delegates for each of three
 traditional parties. While government officials were not
 elected, this contest was an important step in the process of
 return to democracy. The vote was peaceful, orderly, and with
 a significant turnout. During 1983, the delegates will choose
 political representatives to negotiate a new constitution with
 the military and participate in party conventions to nominate
 candidates who will run for office in the 1984 general
 elections.
 The three parties which were allowed to participate in the 1982
 elections included the two traditionally strongest parties --
 the Blancos (National Party) and the Colorados -- which
 together accounted for approximately 82 percent of the vote in
 the 1971 elections, and in the past have often accounted for
 about 90 percent of the electorate. Minor parties, including
 the Communists, Socialists, and Christian Democrats, were not
 allowed to participate. A small number of major leaders of the
 traditonal parties were also not allowed to run. Numerous
 factions within the Blancos and Colorados, some expressing
 strong disagreement with the military government, took part and
 opposition groups won a large majority. The campaign was
 active. Rival factions within the parties concentrated on
 organization and turning out the vote.   Nationwide, there were
 almost 30,000 candidates for the three national conventions and
 the local conventions in each department. Convention delegate
 candidates ran on lists by department. There were 274 lists in
 the 19 departments.
 Holding of a government job is subject to a test of political
 loyalty to the existing government system. Few individuals,
 however, lost their jobs in 1982 because of political activity.
 Women in Uruguay are accorded equality before the law. They
 attend the national university and pursue professional careers
 in large numbers. A female cabinet officer was appointed in
 1981 for the second time in Uruguayan history. Another woman
 was appointed in 1981 as Uruguay's first female Supreme Court
 Justice. Overall, equality of pay is not always granted,
 especially to ordinary workers in the private sector. There
 are also some barriers to equality stemming from traditional
 social patterns and restricted employment opportunities.
 Overall, the position of women in Uruguay compares favorably
 with the norm in Latin America.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non -
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Uruguay amended its constitution in 1976 to permit
 international monitoring of human rights under certain strict
 conditions. Since 1976 it has responded to inquiries made in
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which considered
 Uruguay under its confidential procedures. In connection with
 the work of the Commission, a special representative of the
 Secretary-General of the United Nations visited Uruguay in
 February 1982. The Government also cooperated with the
 International Labor Organization regarding trade union
 practices. Generally, however, the Government either ignores
 the charges of these international organizations or takes a
 defensive attitude, arguing that these international
 organizations or special circumstances of its internal war
 against subversion should be taken into account. It has not
 agreed to permit the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to
 visit Uruguay.
 Other organizations, including B'nai B'rith, Canadian
 parliamentarians, and important European groups have visited
 and/or maintained a dialogue with the Uruguayan Government on
 human rights issues. The International Committee for Red Cross
 held talks in 1982 with the Uruguayan authorities on renewing
 
 
 650
 prison visits, discontinued in 1980.
 The few human rights organizations in Uruguay have been
 restricted in their activities by the Government. An office of
 Paz y Justicia, not connected to the Vatican Commission on
 Justice and Peace, opened in Uruguay in 1981. The Jesuit
 priest who ran the office in 1982, contributed to a magazine
 which had published some controversial articles. The priest
 was called for questioning but was not detained. The
 Government closed the magazine, objecting to its praise of the
 Nicaraguan Sandinista regime. Amnesty International's 1982
 report, which covered 1981, stated that the organization's
 concerns in Uruguay were "the large number of prisoners of
 conscience; harsh and inhumane prison conditions; and the use
 of emergency powers to deprive detainees of legal safeguards
 before military courts whose procedures did not conform to
 internationally recognized standards for a fair trial.'
 Freedom House's 1982 report classified Uruguay as "Partly Free.'
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Uruguay compares favorably with the rest of Latin America, and
 often with the developed countries as well, on a broad spectrum
 of socio-economic indicators. With a per capita gross domestic
 product of $3,500 in 1981, Uruguayan average income is
 relatively high. Indices of income distribution show that
 income is more equally distributed in Uruguay than in most
 developing countries. Hence, the incidence of extreme poverty
 is low and virtually all of the population enjoys an adequate
 diet and at least minimal standards of living.
 The availability and standards of medical care also are
 considerably above the rest of Latin America. There is high
 life expectancy at birth (70.7 years in 1980) and low infant
 mortality (37.4 per 1,000 live births in 1981). In 1975, 84
 percent of the population had access to safe water and the
 quality of public sanitation compared favorably with that of
 other developing countries. Health care is free to the poor
 and available at nominal cost to others. The caloric supply
 available for consumption in Uruguay was 114 percent of
 nutritional requirements in 1977.
 Uruguay has a 94 percent literacy rate [1976]. Virtually all
 children receive a primary school education. Total adjusted
 primary school enrollment ratio was 105 in 1978. Secondary
 school attendance also is relatively high, and university
 education is free. Male students outnumber females in higher
 education by a small margin. There is no variation by sex at
 primary and secondary level.
 For half a century, social welfare and wider income
 distribution were prime objectives of economic policy. Income
 in the postwar period was as evenly spread in Uruguay as in
 Western Europe. However, the country's economic policies were
 not successful in stimulating economic growth. Private sector
 activity contracted in the period 1955-1974 and overall output
 stagnated while inflation soared. Since 1974, under new
 policies, the economy has grown significantly, with a per
 capita output of 28 percent. Nonetheless, it was accompanied
 by a sharp decline in real wages and a narrowing in the
 distribution of income. Real wages began to increase in
 mid-1980, but dropped again in 1982. Economic growth declined
 again to one percent in 1981 and 6.1 percent negative during
 the first quarter of 1982. Inflation declined to approximately
 20 percent in 1982; however, a severe recession raised
 unemployment to over 11 percent.
