 The People's Republic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian
 one-party state ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
 Following the -Beijing massacre in.early June, the Government
 reinforced totalitarian measures to control political views.
 A closed inner circle of a few senior leaders exercises
 ultimate power over the nation, with Deng Xiaoping the first
 among equals, Some of these party elders hold positions
 within the Politburo, the Central Military Commission, or
 other organs; Others hold no formal positions of authority
 but still wield considerable influence.
 The Government maintains control through a nationwide security
 network which includes the Ministry of State Security; the
 Ministay of Public Security; the Ministry of National Defense;
 state judicial, procuratorial, and penal systems; and through
 traditional societal pressure. In 1989 the security network
 was responsible for widespread human rights abuses, especially
 in Beijing and Xizang (Tibet).
 Despite 10 years of economic reforms intended to expand the
 role of market forces, China's centrally planned economy still
 retains price controls and allocation of some key goods by
 administrative directive. The Government has decentralized
 some economic decisionmaking authority and endorsed the
 development of a small private sector, particularly in retail
 sales and services. As part of a comprehensive economic
 austerity and restructuring program initiated in late 1988,
 the Government took a more aggressive approach in scrutinizing
 private firms, punishing tax evaders, and attempting to limit
 the incomes of private entrepreneurs. The central authorities
 also withdrew some of the economic decisionmaking power
 deleg-ated to lower levels.
 The human rights climate in China deteriorated dramatically in
 1989. On March 5-7, People's Armed Police (PAP) used
 indiscriminate and excessive force in suppressing
 demonstrations in Lhasa, Tibet, killing scores of persons.
 These killings and other serious human rights abuses, however,
 were dwarfed when the leadership ordered the People's
 Liberation Army (PLA) and other security forces to suppress
 forcefully a peaceful, student-led movement seeking greater
 freedom for China's people. At least several hundred, and
 possibly thousands, of people were killed in Beijing on June
 3-4. The Beijing massacre was followed by a drastic,
 country-wide crackdown on participants, supporters, and
 sympathizers. Thousands were arrested and about a score are
 known to have been executed, following trials which fell far
 short of international standards, for alleged crimes committed
 during the unrest. There have also been persistent but
 unconfirmed reports of numerous unannounced executions. At
 year's end the crackdown was still continuing. The Government
 attempted to defend its actions by a massive disinformation
 campaign, expulsion and harassment of foreign journalists, a
 ban on the sale of books by dissidents, and the jamming of the
 Voice of America and some other foreign radio stations.
 Virtually all internationally recognized human rights
 discussed in this report are restricted, many of them severely.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 By far the most serious instance of extrajudicial killing in
 China in 1989 was the June 3-4 massacre in Beijing. Credible
 evidence indicates that the leadership deliberately ordered
 the use of lethal force to suppress peaceful demonstrations.
 The excessive force employed resulted in the deaths of many
 unarmed civilians. As noted above, estimates of the number
 killed vary widely, and an exact accounting may never be
 possible.
 In early March, the PAP shot and killed scores of Tibetan
 monks and their supporters during demonstrations in Lhasa.
 Hundreds more were injured as police used indiscriminate and
 excessive force to quell protests in support of Tibetan
 independence.
 Many independent observers believe that the number of persons
 actually executed in connection with the 1989 demonstrations
 throughout the country is far higher than those officially
 announced to date. Confirmation of such executions is not
 available, and Chinese officials have refused to respond to
 diplomatic requests for information.
 According to reliable sources, 2 persons were killed and 150
 injured, 10 seriously, during an April police raid on an
 underground Catholic church service in Shijiazhuang, Hebei
 Province,
 b. Disappearance
 The Government, as a matter of course, does not publicly
 announce the names of those detained or arrested. In view of
 the large number detained after the Beijing massacre, concerns
 have arisen over the fate of those detainees whose status has
 not been clarified.
 There were credible reports of numerous raids on university
 campuses, private residences, workers' dormitories, think
 tanks, and hotels in the weeks following the June 3-4 massacre
 by both the. PLA and various security bureaus. Large numbers
 of persons who participated in or supported the spring
 demonstrations were detained. While most of these detentions
 occurred soon after the June massacre, the crackdown continued
 months later. When universities reopened, returning students
 were investigated, and some students were detained by security
 forces. The Government acknowledges that some students, such
 as Liu Gang, Zhou Fengsuo, Ma Shaofang, and others on the list
 of 21 most wanted, have been arrested; however, it has not
 publicly charged, or acknowledged holding, the majority of
 students reportedly detained whose whereabouts are unknown.
 Some workers at a computer firm that supported deposed CCP
 General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, journalists from Beijing-based
 newspapers, and intellectuals also remain unaccounted for.
 Since announcing a total of about 2,500 detentions by the end
 of June, the Government has refused to comment on the number
 of additional detentions since that time or to provide any
 information on those detained.
 
 
 804
 CHfIA
 Detention of leaders of unofficial religious groups continued
 in 1989, often with no notification to followers or family
 members. -At least two dozen bishops, priests, and laymen of
 the underground Catholic church were detained during the year,
 and the status of several of them remained unknown at year's
 end.
 The whereabouts and status of many Tibetans detained during
 demonstrations in Lhasa are also unknown. A security official
 told a Western journalist in October that 400 had been
 arrested after the March demonstrations and that 323 were
 subsequently released. Other reports from Tibet cite
 significantly higher figures.
 c.- Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Reports of torture and degrading treatment of persons detained
 for committing so-called counterrevolutionary crimes have been
 persistent and consistent. Many Chinese citizens who
 participated in the demonstrations suffered beatings and other
 forms of ill-treatment in police efforts to extract
 information about others who may have been involved in the
 demonstrations. A person involved in erecting the Goddess of
 Democracy statue in Tiananmen Square was reportedly detained,
 beaten, and-forced to implicate others. He remains under
 detention, and it is not known if he has been officially
 charged. As of year's end, there were continuing reliable
 reports of beatings of political detainees in the Beijing area
 by security forces.
 In Tibet officials have rebuffed diplomatic requests to visit
 prisons and to discuss individual human rights cases. Since
 the suppression of the March 5-7 demonstrations in Lhasa,
 there have been persistent and convincing reports of torture
 of those detained or arrested. A March 1989 report by U.S.
 Congressional staff related accounts, based on interviews with
 refugees from Tibet, of cruel and unusual punishment of
 Tibetans.
 Conditions in Chinese prisons are invariably harsh and
 frequently degrading. According to press reports, more than
 200 students and intellectuals are being held in the Qincheng
 maximum-security prison north of Beijing. Prisoners are
 reportedly packed eight to a cell. A person imprisoned prior
 to the June massacre reported beatings in prisons in western
 China. Prisoners, both criminal and political, are subjected
 to severe psychological pressure to confess their "errors."
 Those who resist are sometimes beaten and denied family
 contact. According to an official of the Supreme People's
 Procuratorate, cases under investigation concerning illegal
 arrests and the extraction of confessions by torture rose 57.7
 percent during the first 6 months of 1989 as compared with the
 same period in 1988. The People's Procuratorates agreed to
 hear 21,838 cases involving charges of torture. Of these, 838
 were major'criminal cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 China's Criminal Procedure Law proscribes arbitrary arrest or
 detention. According to the law, interrogation should take
 place within 24 hours of detention, and the detainee's family
 or work unit should be informed of the reasons for it and the
 place of detention. Articles 43-52 of the Criminal Procedure
 Law, however, permit the police to delay notifying the family
 
 
 805
 CHINA
 and work unit "in circumstances where notification would
 hinder the investigation." NFrequently family members are not
 informed when individuals are detained for political reasons.
 A detainee may be held legally for up to 10 days prior to
 formal arrest. In some cases, however, detainees have been
 held for months without charge.
 Under Article 19 of "The Regulations of the PRC on
 Administrative Penalties for Public Security," police have the
 authority to assign persons accused of disturbing the peace,
 fabricating rumors, hindering government officials from
 performing their official duties, and other minor public order
 offenses to "labor education" camps for up to 3 years.
 According to an article in the off-icial press in October, some
 2 million Chinese citizens have been sent to these camps in
 the past 10 years.
 Sentences imposed by criminal courts may be served in prisons
 or in "reform through labor" camps, whose function is not
 fully explained in the legal code. Many of these are in
 remote areas such as Xinjiang or Qinghai. Upon release from
 these camps, many prisoners reportedly have been denied
 permission to return to their homes and forced to remain in
 these underpopulated regions. This amounts to a form of
 internal exile.
 Some of those detained since the June massacre may be charged
 with "crimes of counterrevolution," under Articles 90-104 of
 the Criminal Law. These articles are cast in such broad terms
 that they empower the State to detain people for a wide range
 of activities considered in violation of the law. Those
 detained for committing "crimes of counterrevolution" are
 treated in theory the same as those detained for other crimes,
 and their cases are supposed to be handled in accordance with
 the Criminal Procedure Law. The imposition of martial law in
 parts of Beijing in late May permitted martial law authorities
 to issue orders and detain people independent of the authority
 of the local Beijing government. Large numbers of people may
 be detained for long periods of time without any public
 notification while the PLA and police conduct their
 investigations.
 In 1989 the number of persons accused of political offenses
 rose dramatically as a result of the spring demonstrations.
 The number of people initially detained and the number who
 remain under detention has not been released. Estimates of
 the number of detainees after June 4 vary from the 2,500
 officially announced in late June to over 100,000 according to
 some journalists and human rights groups. Western press
 reports in December quoted "well-informed" government sources
 as putting the figure at 10,000.
 Most of those detained appear to be manual workers. A number
 of prominent intellectuals were also detained, including
 journalist Dai Qing, former Democracy Wall prisoner Ren
 Wanding, reformist Party official Bao Tong, and several
 student leaders.
 Some applicants for foreign visas have reportedly been
 detained and interrogated for at least several days.
 Several hundred people connected with the March 5-7
 proindependence demonstrations in Lhasa were subsequently
 detained. The Tibet Daily published on September 14 and 25
 the.names of 14 Tibetan Buddhist nuns who were detained and
 
 
 806
 sentenced to 2 to 3 years of "labor education" for
 demonstrating in Lhasa on September 2 and 22. The nuns were
 detained for shouting in a public area slogans demanding
 independence for Tibet and were accused by the police of
 engaging in "separatist activity." The police detained the
 nuns and immediately adjudicated their cases under their own
 authority. Because of the secrecy surrounding these matters
 and the Government's refusal to discuss them, reliable
 estimates of the total number of political prisoners in Tibet,
 as in the rest of China, are not obtainable.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 China's judiciary is not independent but is controlled by the
 CCP. The highest court is the Supreme People's Court. The
 next level is the High Provincial People.'s Court, followed by
 the Inteimediate Local People's Court, and then the Basic
 Local County People's Court. Separate and special military,
 maritime, and railway courts function directly under the
 Supreme People's Court.
 In recent years the CCP and the Government have moved toward
 establishment of a more independent legal system. There have
 been efforts to define broadly stated laws more narrowly,
 including the provisions of the law on "crimes of
 counterrevolution," to make clear what are criminally
 indictable offenses. Programs have been set up to provide
 professional training for judges through overseas training
 courses to acquaint them with legal procedures in the West.
 Since June, however, the impetus for legal reform has waned.
 Due process rights are stipulated under the Constitution but
 are often ignored in practice. The law requires that all
 trials be held in public, except those involving state
 secrets, .juveniles, and "personal secrets." It also states
 that a defendant may be held in custody during investigation
 prior to the trial for a maximum of 2 months, although a
 1-month extension may be requested from the next highest
 procuratorate. The procuratorate then has 1 1/2 months to
 decide whether or not to prosecute the case. An additional
 month is permitted if "supplementary investigation" is
 needed. Any further delay requires approval of the Standing
 Committee of the NPC. In practice, the period of pretrial
 detention can be much longer. Two American citizens arrested
 for alleged fraud and forgery were held for 7 months before a
 decision was made not to prosecute.
 The procuratorate sends to trial only those persons it
 determines are guilty. Persons appearing before the court are
 presumed guilty, and trials are thus, in effect, sentencing
 hearings. Defense lawyers almost never contest their client's
 guilt; their function is generally confined to requesting
 clemency. There is an appeal process, but initial decisions
 are rarely'overturned, and sentences can actually be
 increased. Defendants are expected to "show the right
 attitude" by confessing their crime, and, because they are
 presumed guilty, those who fail to confess are treated more
 harshly.
 The Government has publicly announced the executions of a
 score of persons who were tried and found guilty of crimes
 directly linked to the spring demonstrations. For example,
 three were executed in Shanghai on June 22 allegedly for
 
 
 807
 CHINA
 burning a train, seven in Beijing on June 22 allegedly for
 "setting fire to military trucks, stealing military goods, and
 assaulting soldiers," and two in Chengdu in July allegedly for
 arson. A factory worker in Jinan was sentenced to death in
 late October for allegedly setting fire to a car, three in
 Chengdu in November for burning a cinema, and two in Beijing
 in December for beating a policeman to death.
 The Government has repeatedly argued that those executed were
 "legally" found guilty of destroying government property or
 other internationally recognized crimes, and not of political
 offenses. The executions in Shanghai at least tend to belie
 the Government's assertion. On June 6, during demonstrations
 protesting the massacre of civilians in Beijing, a train ran
 over a group of demonstrators in the Shanghai suburbs, killing
 six. Angered by this, hundreds of people reportedly stormed
 that train or the next train nearing the station and burned
 it. A railway court convicted and sentenced to death three
 people for burning the train. No one was detained in
 connection with the death of the six demonstrators. The
 Government contended that the defendants were accorded their
 full rights. Serious doubts about the fairness of the trial
 remain, however, including the excessive sentences, the
 selection of these three persons for prosecution from among
 the hundreds involved, the hurried nature of the trial, and
 the mental competence of at least one of the defendants.
 Given the near total lack of procedural safeguards in these
 trials, government claims that the accused received "due
 process" are not credible.
 Those arrested for crimes of counterrevolution frequently are
 tried in secret and family members are not informed of the
 charges or details of the case. Credible reports suggest that
 even years after the conviction and imprisonment of a person
 considered a dissident, family members still do not know the
 details of the alleged crime.
 A number of political prisoners jailed in previous cycles of
 repression, notably "Democracy Wall" dissident Wei Jingsheng,
 remain in prison. Yang Wei, a former student in the United
 States who was jailed for 2 years for activities during the
 1986 demonstrations, was released in January but detained
 again in July for involvement in the spring protests. Among
 those who have been tried and convicted for clearly political
 offenses during 1989 are Xiao Bin, who received a 10-year
 sentence for "spreading rumors" about the demonstrations to
 the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television; Zhang
 Weiping, sentenced to 9 years' imprisonment for telephoning
 information on Hangzhou protests to the Voice of America
 (VOA); and Chen Zhixiang, a teacher in Guangzhou who was given
 10 years for painting a "counterrevolutionary" slogan.
 Persistent reports claim that many others, perhaps several
 hundred, have been secretly convicted of similar political
 offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law requires that search warrants be issued before
 authorities may search premises, but it is often ignored. It
 is unlikely the army and the security forces obtained warrants
 prior to their raids on homes and businesses to arrest
 "counterrevolutionaries" for their role in the democracy
 demonstrations.
 
 
 808
 Personal and family life are extensively monitored and
 regulated'by authorities. Most persons depend on their work
 unit for employment, housing, ration coupons, permission to
 marry or have a child, and other aspects of ordinary life.
 The work unit, along with the neighborhood watch committee,
 monitors activities and attitudes. In the wake of the
 demonstrations, 'authorities have redefined the function of the
 neighborhood watch committees, requiring them to work more
 closely with the'Public-Security Bureau. Mail is often opened
 and read, telephones monitored, and television cameras located
 at some key intersections, in luxury hotels, and in some
 buildings. After the post-Tiananmen crackdown began, the
 authorities produced television footage from clandestine
 cameras showing alleged Taiwan spies observing the Tiananmen
 Square 'demonstrations, and student leader Wuer Kaixi and other
 demonstrators eating at the Beijing Hotel.
 The Government strictly regulates dealings between Chinese
 citizens and foreigners. Virtually all foreigners are forced
 to live separately in designated residential compounds, and
 all Chinese entering the foreign areas are closely monitored
 by guards and video cameras on roofs and in elevators.
 Residences of foreign diplomats, journalists, and businessmen
 are assumed to be electronically and physically monitored.
 The Chinese Government maintains a comprehensive and highly
 intrusive family planning program. Individual and family
 decisions about bearing children are controlled by the State,
 with severe sanctions against those who deviate from official
 guidelines. The Central Government sets an annual nationwide
 goal for the number of births to be authorized. This is then
 apportioned among provinces, and further down through
 prefecture, county, town, and district levels. Ultimately,
 each work unit (village, factory, or government office)
 receives a target figure for births over the next few years.
 As the allotments are quite small, couples wishing to have a
 second child often must wait many years before receiving
 permission. In some areas, newly married couples have also
 been required to wait years before having their first child.
 While strongly encouraging all couples to have only one child,
 Chinese policy allows two or more children for many rural
 families. Members of ethnic minorities, particularly in
 remote areas, are also generally not subject to the same
 strict limitations imposed on the Han majority.
 Implementation of the policy varies widely from place to place
 and from year to year. In many areas, couples apparently are
 able to have several children without incurring any penalty,
 while in other areas enforcement has been excessively harsh.
 Periodic campaigns exhort all Chinese to have fewer children,
 to have them later in life, and to space them more widely.
 When national targets are not met, officials call for stricter
 implementation, and some have advocated more coercive methods
 than central government policy currently authorizes. Local
 officials have great discretion in how, and how severely, the
 policy is implemented.
 Under China's national Marriage Law, women may not legally
 marry before age 20; men before age 22. In practice, early
 marriages are discouraged, and the press frequently extols the
 virtues of later marriage. Lack of available housing and
 other social concerns are often cited as additional reasons to
 delay marriage.
 
 
 810
 consent of a mentally competent relative but acknowledge that
 heavy psychological pressure may be employed to obtain
 consent. As of December 1989, provincial officials said that
 1,714 persons had been identified-as requiring sterilization,
 and 731 operations had been performed. According to a Health
 Ministry official, the Government is drafting a new law to
 extend the ban nationwide.
 Despite a decade of efforts, officials acknowledge that
 population growth has significantly exceeded the national
 targets and that the goal of holding China's population to 1.2'
 billion by the end of the century will not be met. This
 realization, together with a recent escalation of official
 rhetoric, have led some observers to suggest that China may be
 enteriig a new cycle of strict enforcement of family planning
 policies, after a period of relative relaxation.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 On June 3-4, in order to clear peaceful demonstrators who had
 occupied Tiananmen Square for several weeks, PLA troops fired
 heavily and indiscriminately at crowds in the approaches to
 and around Tiananmen Square, resulting in at least hundreds of
 deaths and thousands of injuries. Some were crushed by
 military vehicles driven into the crowd. The PLA also
 suffered scores of casualties as enraged citizens fought
 back. According to Western diplomats, some PLA casualties
 also resulted from soldiers accidentally shooting or injuring
 other soldiers. While it is difficult to know precisely how
 many civilians died or were injured, the numbers are certainly
 far greater than those cited by authorities. Mayor Chen
 Xitong, in a speech-before the National People's Congress
 Standing Committee on June 30, said over 200 civilians were
 killed, including 36 students, and 3,000 injured, with "dozens
 of soldiers and police killed and 6,000 injured." Hospitals
 and human rights groups, however, provided much higher
 estimates. Visiting several hospitals in Beijing after the
 June 3-4 massacre, diplomats and other observers viewed scores
 of dead civilians, including women and children, with bullet
 wounds and other injuries, and heard from medical personnel
 the hardships the hospitals faced in treating the dead and
 injured. At one hospital, doctors said that on June 3, 50
 civilians had died from bullet wounds in their hospital alone.
 The authorities clearly used excessive deadly force against
 the demonstrators. While they used tear gas and rubber
 bullets briefly in some areas of Beijing, the PLA and security
 forces relied primarily on lethal force rather than
 traditional riot control techniques to clear demonstrators
 from the roads leading to Tiananmen Square. Foreign diplomats
 and their families did not escape the heavy-handed actions of
 the PLA. On June 7, PLA soldiers, allegedly returning fire
 from a sniper, shot at a diplomatic housing complex, spraying
 scores of apartments with gunfire but causing no casualties.
 Chinese authorities have produced no evidence that a sniper
 was actuel1y present in the compound and firing at the PLA.
 Security forces used excessive force in breaking up a
 religious ceremony and demonstration by members of the
 underground Catholic Church near Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province
 in April, leaving 2 civilians dead and at least 150 injured.
 
 
 809
 CHINA
 Couples are not allowed free choice about whether to practice
 family planning, how many children they may have, or when they
 may have them. In practice, most couples have little choice
 concerning the form of birth control to use.
 The population control policy relies primarily on heavy doses
 of education and propaganda, augmented by severe psychological
 pressure on those who resist. Disciplinary measures against
 couples who violate the policy include stiff fines (often as
 high as a year's salary), withholding of social services,
 demotion, and other administrative punishments. If a unit
 exceeds its allocation, punishment may be meted out to the
 offending couples, to unit officials, and to the unit as a
 whole. Some local officials have reportedly destroyed or
 confiscated the private property of families with 6nauthorized
 children if fines are not paid. In 1988 a Chinese couple
 studying in the United States, Dr. Li Quanbang and Ms. Ping
 Hong, were threatened with severe punishment if Ms. Ping
 refused to abort her second child before returning to China.
 Ms. Ping's employer warned her that, if she returned, she
 would have to have an abortion even in the third trimester of
 pregnancy. If she insisted on having the child, she would be
 placed on probation and the entire factory would be punished.
 Eventually the authorities relented, but the U.S. Government
 determined that the Li family and a few other Chinese couples
 who faced similar situations had demonstrated a well-founded
 fear of persecution and granted them asylum in the United
 States.
 Physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization is
 not authorized, but continues to occur as officials strive to
 meet population targets. Reports of forced abortions and
 sterilizations continue, though well below the levels of the
 early 1980's. In early 1989, a U.S. Congressional staff
 delegation interviewed Tibetan refugees in Nepal. They, and
 some previous news stories, reported harrowing accounts of
 abuses in Tibet.
 Chinese officials have consistently maintained that China does
 not condone forced abortion and sterilization and that
 officials who commit such abuses are punished. They admit,
 however, that such punishment is rare and have refused to
 provide documentation of any punishments.
 Female infanticide also persists in some rural areas.
 Insistence that local officials meet population goals has
 contributed to the reemergence of this traditional practice,
 generally by parents who hope to have more sons without
 incurring official punishment. There are allegations that
 some Chinese officials and doctors have participated in
 infanticide or in abortions so late in pregnancy as to be
 tantamount to infanticide. The Chinese Government strongly
 opposes infanticide, to the point of prosecuting offenders,
 but has been unable to eradicate it.
 One recent development in China's population control policy
 was the passage in November 1988 of a set of eugenic
 regulations in Gansu province prohibiting people with severe
 mental handicaps from having children. Provincial officials
 estimate the rules will affect some 26,000 persons whose
 intelligence quotient is judged to be 49 or lower. Should any
 of these persons decide to marry, one spouse must undergo
 sterilization. For those already married, one partner must be
 sterilized and any pregnancies compulsorily aborted.
 Officials claim that permission for any operation requires the

 In another major incident involving the use of excessive force
 during demonstrations in Lhasa on-March 5-7, police shot and
 killed scores of Tibetan monks and their supporters.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and self-expression are severely
 restricted. Limited criticism of government policies and
 officials is tolerated and had increased in recent years.
 However, the limits were tightened again after June 4.
 Citizens are not permitted to criticize senior leaders or to
 express opinions contrary to the "Four Cardinal Principles":
 Marxism/Lenirism/Mao Zedong Thought as th4 theoretical
 foundation of the State, socialism as its goal, Communist
 Party leadership, and the "people's democratic dictatorship"
 (which includes the right to use force against "counter-
 revolutionaries").
 Those who violate these guidelines frequently are severely
 punished. Xiao Bin, a worker in Dalian, was sentenced to 10
 years' imprisonment for expressing personal views on the
 Beijing massacre to an ABC news crew, and Zhang Weiping, a
 student, was sentenced to 9 years' imprisonment for informing
 VOA about antigovernment demonstrations.
 Renowned scientist and dissident Fang Lizhi sent senior leader
 Deng Xiaoping an open letter on January 6 appealing for
 amnesty for political prisoners. On February 16, 33 prominent
 intellectuals signed an open letter to the national leadership
 supporting Fang's call for amnesty. The Government attacked
 the letter in the official press on February 23 and later
 characterized it as an act of "counterrevolution." Some
 signatories have since fled China while others have been
 detained. Security forces stepped up surveillance of Fang and
 restricted his movements. He and his wife Li Shuxian were
 physically prevented from attending a banquet in Beijing
 hosted by President and Mrs. Bush. In June Fang and Li took
 refuge in the U.S. Embassy, after which the Government charged
 them with criminal "counterrevolutionary" activity and named
 them as key "conspirators" in the student demonstrations.
 Television and radio are strictly controlled by the Government
 and used to propagate the party's version of events. In the
 wake of the June 3-4 events, the authorities began a massive
 disinformation campaign, asserting that the spring
 demonstrations had evolved into a counterrevolutionary
 rebellion led by a few conspirators. State Council spokesman
 Yuan Mu claimed on June 16 that only 300 had died on June 3-4,
 half of them PLA soldiers. Regular programming was replaced
 by special programs giving the CCP's version of events. These
 programs were broadcast several times a day for weeks.  In
 July China Central Television (CCTV) broadcast a four-part
 program conveying the official version of the massacre.
 Events were altered to suggest that the troops had been called
 in to "quell a riot" rather than that troops fired on peaceful
 demonstrators who then reacted in a rage. Again on September
 23, CCTV televised a special program countering charges by
 activists in the United States and featuring comments by Liu
 Xiaobo, detained since June, denying that anyone had died in
 Tiananmen Square. In the wake of the massacre, television
 news constantly replayed assertions-of government officials
 
 
 812
 CHINA
 such as Yuan Mu and selected remarks by the handful of foreign
 observers supportive of the Government position.
 Following the imposition of martial law in Beijing, the
 Chinese cut off the satellite feed for U.S. network news
 services. Security authorities and PLA soldiers on the night
 of June 3-4 detained two U.S. reporters along with a number of
 other foreign journalists. In the aftermath, authorities
 severely restricted the movements of foreign journalists,
 harassing and expelling several of them.
 After an 11-year moratorium, the Government resumed jamming
 VOA Chinese-language broadcasts on May 21. The official press
 has harshly attacked VOA reports, claiming that they were part
 of a Western conspiracy to subvert China. Chinese authorities
 confiscated film from foreigners leaving the country and
 insisted on developing it for review and censorship.
 Restrictions on the publication of books and other printed
 material, which had generally eased during the 1980's, have
 become much more stringent since June. Print media, like the
 broadcast media, have been used to disseminate disinformation
 about the spring demonstrations and the Government's crackdown.
 A number of journalists were detained or otherwise officially
 harassed in 1989. During the demonstrations, then Shanghai
 Party Secretary Jiang Zemin sacked the editor of the World
 Economic Herald, Qin Benli, and closed the newspaper,
 silencing one of the country's few independent journalistic
 voices. Since June, Qin has been under investigation.- His
 Beijing bureau chief was arrested and several staff writers
 are still detained. Other journalists apparently still under
 detention include personnel from the government mouthpiece
 People's Daily, the official English-language China Daily,
 Guangming Daily, and Radio Beijing. Others have been
 dismissed from their jobs for printing material at variance
 with the party line, including editor Tan Wenrui and director
 Qian Liren of People's Daily, publisher Zhang Li and editor Li
 Jiawei of the Sichuan Provincial Social Science Academy
 Publishing House, Editor-in-chief Yao Xihua of the Guangming
 Daily, Editor-in-Chief Li Xiaoshi and Deputy Editor-in-Chief
 Sun Changjiang of the Science and Technology Daily.
 On July 17 the Government temporarily removed from the
 newsstands foreign language newspapers, magazines, and
 publications in order to limit access by Chinese citizens to
 foreign news and to consolidate government control over the
 importation and distribution of foreign printed material.
 While the ban was lifted at the end of August, tighter control
 on distribution has enabled authorities to censor foreign
 language material more effectively. For example, several
 issues of the Far Eastern Economic Review were withheld from
 newsstands or had offending articles removed. More recently,
 foreign media reports on the overthrow of Romanian dictator
 Ceaucescu have been barred from distribution.
 The Government reportedly has also banned publications by
 activists and other authors considered unacceptable. Writings
 by astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wffe Li Shuxian,
 investigative journalist Liu Binyan, playwright Su Xiaokang,
 intellectuals such as Su Shaozhi, Bao Tong, Jin Guantao, Ge
 Yang, Cao Siyuan, Li Honglin, Zhang Xianyang, Dai Qing, Liu
 Xiaobo, Yan Jiaqi, and dozens of others have reportedly been
 banned. Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the
 Politburo, on August 24 announced a campaign to "clean up and
 
 
 813
 CHIN~A
 rectify" the publishing and audiovisual industries. Li said
 the campaign was aimed at curbing publications advocating
 "bourgeois liberalization" (Western social, political, and
 cultural ideas) and pornography.
 In the wake of the student demonstrations, the Government has
 worked to reimpose more rigid ideological control over the
 school system. The State Education Commission ordered that
 30,000 fewer first-year students be admitted to universities
 for the fall 1989 semester. The cuts were primarily among
 those seeking to study the social sciences. The number of
 students studying Western philosophy, political science, and
 management were reduced. The entire first-year class at
 Beijing University, a main center for the demonstrations, was
 sent to an isolated camp for a year of military training and
 ideological indoctrination. (The Government said this program
 might be expanded to include additional universities in the
 future.) Some recent college graduates are being sent from
 Beijing to the countryside or to factories for ideological
 training. On July 1, a State Education Commission official
 told the Chinese press that "students' level of patriotism and
 willingness to serve their country should be major criteria"
 in decisions on who should be permitted to study overseas.
 Required study of the writings of Communist theoreticians has
 been sharply increased.
 Investigations into press activities have led to intimidation
 of journalists and broadcasters, stronger press control, and a
 complete halt, for now, of press reform. The Government has
 made it clear that the press must support the party line and
 cannot question the "Four Cardinal Principles." The detention
 of journalists and broadcasters described in earlier sections
 reinforced the Government's message.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Article 35 of the Constitution guarantees the right "of
 assembly, of association, of procession, and of
 demonstration," but such activities may not infringe "upon the
 interests of the State" (Article 51). In an effort to prevent
 students from again demonstrating or occupying Tiananmen
 Square, the National People's Congress Standing Committee on
 October 31 adopted a law governing assemblies, parades, and
 demonstrations that significantly-limits the right of
 individuals or groups to organize mass political activities.
 The law, in theory, guarantees the right to assemble and
 demonstrate but stipulates that parades and demonstrations
 must abide by the Constitution and laws and may not "infringe
 on the interests of the State, society, and collectives or the
 legitimate freedoms and rights of other citizens." In
 practice, this proscribes any protests against socialism or
 the leadership. Moreover, this stipulation could be used to
 ban protests that disrupt traffic, interfere with business, or
 occupy public places, and all acts that could be interpreted
 as "infringing" on the freedoms of other citizens. Also
 banned are demonstrations that advocate national separatism or
 jeopardize national unity.
 The law does not apply to "traditional cultural, recreational,
 or sports activities; normal religious activities; nor
 traditional, nongovernmental activities among the people."
 Also exempt are celebrations held by the State and assemblies
 held by "state organs, political parties, social groups,
 enterprises, or institutions in accordance with the law or
 
 
 814
 CHINiA
 their organic charters." Presumably, local authorities retain
 the power to determine what are "normal" religious activities;
 unapproved gatherings, such as evangelical Tevivals, religious
 retreats, and outdoor masses could be restricted or banned.
 Similarly, local officials would decide when "traditional"
 cultural activities carry unacceptable political oertones
 related to such sensitive issues as national separatism.
 Procedures for obtaining a permit are extremely restrictive
 and constructed in such a way as to discourage exercise of the
 right of assembly. Demonstration organizers must apply for a
 permit at least 5 days before the event, specifying the
 purpose, type of demonstration, slogans to be used, the number
 of participants and vehicles, the routes and times of the
 march, the number and type of audio equipment, and the names,
 addresses, and occupations of sponsors. Marches are generally
 to be confined to the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. except with
 special permission. The law reserves to local officials the
 right to change the time, location, and route of a
 demonstration, even after giving approval, requiring only that
 they "promptly notify" the sponsors. Citizens cannot organize
 or participate in demonstrations outside their own locality,
 nor can government employees organize or participate in
 protests that "go against their responsibilities and
 obligations prescribed in relevant laws and regulations."
 Professional and other mass associations are for the most part
 organized and controlled by the Communist Party. Other new
 regulations require all oxganizations to be officially
 registered and approved, including societies, research units,
 foundations, and chambers of commerce. Ostensibly aimed at
 secret societies end criminal gangs, the regulations are also
 used to prevent the formation of unauthorized political or
 labor organizations, such as the student and worker groups
 that emerged before and-during the spring prodemocracy
 protests. The regulations van also be used to close down
 unregistered house churches or discussion groups that local
 leaders deem potentially subversive.
 In parts of Beijing, martial law was imposed on May 20 and
 remained in effect until-lifted in January 1990. Under
 martial law, groups of people were not permitted to gather and
 demonstrations were strictly forbidden. Martial law has also
 been in effect in Lhasa since demonstrations broke out there
 in early March. In areas where martial law is not in effect,
 authorities also have adopted a stricter policy toward
 allowing groups of-people to assemble. Informants and
 security forces maintain a close watch on groups formed
 outside the Party establishment, particularly unauthorized
 religious groups and other associations. Associations
 recognized by the State are permitted to maintain relations
 with recognized international bodies, but these contacts are
 monitored and limited by the Government.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is subject to tight constraints. While the
 Constitution affirms toleration of religious beliefs, the
 Government severely restricts religious practice outside the
 officially recognized and government-controlled religious
 institutions. Religious proselytizing is restricted to
 officially sanctioned places of worship or to the homes of
 
 
 815
 persons properly registered with an officially recognized
 religious institution. Religious conversion is tolerated
 (though generally not for Communist Party members).
 By far the largest group of religious believers in China are
 Buddhists who belong to the dominant Han ethnic group. Han
 Buddhist leaders generally cooperate with the Government and
 have experienced few reported difficulties. Daoism, widely
 practiced in southern coastal provinces, is officially
 respected as an important part of traditional Chinese culture,
 but many of its practices conflict with government strictures
 against superstition and waste of arable land and have been
 heavily criticized. China permits Muslim citizens to make the
 hajj to Mecca, and over 2,000 Chinese, most subsidized by the
 Chinese Government or by overseas Muslims, make the journey
 annually.
 The Government insists that no religious institution may be
 subject to foreign domination or influence. In order to
 eliminate perceived foreign domination of Christian groups in
 the past, the Government in the 1950's established the
 Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA) and the Protestant Three
 Self Movement (TSM). The CPA ordains its own bishops and
 priests, generally follows pre-Vatican II practices, and
 rejects papal authority. Proselytizing by foreign groups is
 forbidden. Americans and other foreigners have been expelled
 for distributing Bibles or proselytizing. Twelve Americans
 were detained in Kunming on June 23 and were later expelled
 for having imported religious materials. Officially
 sanctioned religious organizations are permitted to maintain
 international contacts as long as these do not entail foreign
 control. The TSM and its Buddhist and Muslim counterparts
 have established extensive networks of international support.
 The CPA has no official ties to Catholic churches outside
 China, but its leaders frequently visit Catholic and other
 religious leaders abroad.
 Tibetan Buddhism is also tightly controlled. Religious
 activity is thriving with some government support, though the
 number of monasteries and monks remains far below the pre-1949
 level. The Government does not tolerate religious
 manifestations that advocate Tibetan independence. The
 Government recognizes the Dalai Lama as a major religious
 figure, but condemns his political activities and his
 leadership of a "government in exile." As with other
 religions, Tibetan Buddhist activities are subject to
 government monitoring and control. The Government exercised a
 considerable degree of control over the late Tibetan Buddhist
 Panchen Lama, the second most revered religious figure in
 Tibetan Buddhism. Following his death early in 1989, the
 State Council approved procedures for selecting the
 "reincarnated" Panchen Lama which will give the Government a
 prominent role.
 After forcefully suppressing all religious observance during
 the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the Government began in the
 late 1970's to restore or replace confiscated churches,
 temples, mosques, and monasteries. The official religious
 organizations administer more than a dozen Catholic and
 Protestant seminaries, nine institutes to train imams and
 Islamic scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist monks. The
 Government supervises the publication of religious material
 for distribution, to ensure that it conforms to religious
 beliefs and philosophical positions-sanctioned by the
 Government.
 
 
 816
 There are active underground religious movements which pose an
 alternative to the state-regulated churches and temples. The
 Catholic underground church claims a membership far larger
 than the 3.5 million officially registered with the CPA,
 though actual figures are unknown. It has its own bishops and
 priests and conducts its own services. Protestants also
 conduct private services independent of government control;
 some of these groups are apparently quite dynamic. The
 Christian underground movement imports religious materials,
 including Bibles, from abroad. Underground church officials
 reject legally published material because it does not conform
 to their beliefs. The Government generally-tolerates but
 sometimes actively suppresses nonsanctioned religious groups.
 Security forces, have raided illegal underground services,
 resulting in arrests, injuries, and even deaths, as in the
 raid on an underground -atholic service in Hebei in April in
 which 2 persons were reportedly killed and 150 were injured.
 A large number of Catholic leaders and somewhat fewer
 Protestants have spent long periods in prison. Most long-term
 Catholic prisoners had been released by late 1987, but
 detentions continue. Bishops Julius Jia Guozhi, Joseph Fan
 Xueyan, Pietro Liu Guandong, Giuseppe Li Side, Jiang Liren,
 Mattia Lu Zhensheng, Filippo Yang Lipo, Paolo Li Zhenrong,
 Bartolomeo Yu Chengdi, and other priests in the underground
 Catholic Church as well as underground Protestant leaders were
 reportedly detained during 1989 for varying periods of time.
 Underground Catholic Bishop Casimir Wang Milu has not been
 seen since his arrest in 1986 afid is presumed to be in
 prison. As of year's end, no information was available on at
 least 20 Catholic priests detained by security forces in
 Hebei, Gansu, Sichuan, and Fujian provinces. International
 human rights groups report that at least 30 underground
 Protestant leaders may also be in detention.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government uses an identification (ID) card system to
 restrict the movement of Chinese citizens within the country.
 Citizens are registered as residents of a particular
 jurisdiction and assigned to a specific work unit. Movement
 within the country or change of workplace can, in most cases,
 be done only with government permission and agreement by the
 work unit. Those workers on short-term work contracts with a
 work unit have more leeway in movement. On expiration of a
 contract, the worker may be able to negotiate a position in
 another area or continue his contract. Significant numbers of
 farmers have moved from the countryside to cities in search of
 employment. Authorities are trying to limit the migration,
 but they estimate there are at least a million unregistered
 persons in Shanghai and Guangzhou and 700,000 in Beijing.
 Measures undertaken in connection with the Government's
 current austerity program will result in large-scale
 unemployment and authorities reportedly intend to enforce
 their return to the countryside.
 After the June disorders, the Ministry of Public Security
 ordered full national implementation of regulations on
 carrying and checking residents' identification cards as of
 September 15. The cards have been under partial and
 experimental use for several years.
 
 
 817
 CHIA
 Under the new procedures, citizens are required to carry their
 ID cards at all times when out of doors and must present them
 on demand of authorities. They must also present ID cards
 when registering for voting, residence, military service,
 marriage, or school entrance; applying for employment,
 licenses, loans, notarization of documents, social insurance
 or relief, travel to restricted areas or to leave the country;
 participating in lawsuits; picking up mail or claiming
 remittances; boarding an airplane; or registering in a hotel.
 More stringent scrutiny of ID cards will close loopholes
 through which many Chinese have slipped in recent years. Some
 have used the relative freedom of travel to act as business
 middlemen and fixers, often involved in quasi-legal or illegal
 cash-and-carry deals, money changing, and black market
 activity. Also likely to be caught in the tighter net are
 itinerant preachers and evangelists, many of whom lack a
 permanent residence. Recent Chinese press reports decry
 incidents in which people caught without their ID card were
 subjected to extortion by police or shaken down by criminals
 posing as police.
 Existing restrictions on foreign travel were tightened in
 1989. In the wake of the Beijing massacre, the Government has
 implemented more restrictive criteria for passport issuance.
 Procedures reportedly include obtaining a political "bill of
 good health" from the work unit and its party committee and
 submitting to background checks by the Public Security Bureau
 (and, in Beijing, the martial law command). Passport
 applicants are screened to determine the applicant's political
 loyalty and his role in the spring demonstrations. The double
 exit permit system implemented on June 20 was designed to
 support this objective. In Shanghai, dissident Zhang Cai was
 detained at the airport when trying to board a flight out of
 China. There are also reports that some Chinese who marry
 foreigners and wish to emigrate have had to repay the cost of
 their education in order to obtain a passport.
 The Government has imposed restrictions on overseas studies.
 New regulations reportedly require tighter ideological
 screening, and perhaps several years' work experience, as
 prerequisites for permission to study overseas.' Furthermore,
 lower limits will be set on the number of publicly funded
 students sent abroad to study humanities, with the emphasis
 instead going to more practical studies such as the sciences
 and specialized training.
 China has continued to relax restrictions on internal travel
 by foreigners. Since last year it has increased the number of
 cities open to foreign visitors from 504 to 626. Tibet, the
 capital of which remains under martial law, has begun again to
 allow tourism. Tourists, however, must travel in groups of at
 least three, obtain prior permission, and travel with
 officially designated travel agencies. Most requests by
 foreign diplomats for travel to Tibet since March have been
 denied.
 China encourages its citizens who are legally overseas
 studying or doing research to return to assist in China's
 development. Some 35,000 Chinese citizens are currently
 studying or conducting research in the United States. The
 State Education Commission declared on December 8 that
 scholars returning from overseas would not be held accountable
 for participation in prodemocracy activities while abroad.
 However, many of these scholars claim that they or their
 
 
 818
 CHINA
 families have been subject to threats of reprisals by Chinese
 officials.
 The Chinese Government accepts repatriation of PRC citizens
 who have entered other countries or territories illegally.
 The Hong Kong Government says it returned to the PRC 11,392
 illegal immigrants in the first 9 months of 1989, compared to
 21,001 in 1988. None of those returned were believed to be
 considered by the PRC Government to have been participants in
 or supporters of the spring demonstrations. To retaliate
 against the Hong Kong Government for having allowed-dissident
 swimmer Yang Yang to depart for the United States, the PRC
 temporarily suspended repatriation for 2 weeks in October.
 Japanese authorities have decided to proceed with repatriation
 of illegal immigrants from China who entered Japan by sea
 during the summer of 1989. It remains unclear what
 punishment, if any, these PRC citizens will face once they
 have been repatriated.
 China accepted more than 280,000 refugees and displaced
 persons from Vietnam and Laos between 1978 and 1982. These
 refugees were predominantly ethnic..Han Chinese or married to
 ethnic Chinese. In recent years, the Government~has adopted a
 stricter policy of "no new admissions." Thus, Chinese
 authorities currently discourage Vietnamese refugees from
 settling in China. There have been persistent reports that
 local authorities along China's southern coast help to provide
 food, water, and fuel to Vietnamese migrants so they may
 proceed to Hong Kong, and in some cases, to Japan and Korea.
 There also have been credible reports that Vietnamese refugees
 reaching China's interior provinces have been forcibly
 repatriated. Other credible reports suggest that the PRC has
 also repatriated persons of other nationalities seeking
 refugee status. Although China signed the Comprehensive Plan
 of Action (CPA)-negotiated at the International Conference on
 Indochinese Refugees in Geneva in June 1989, it is unclear
 whether China considers itself a-CPA "participating state."
 China has yet to create formal mechanisms to enforce CPA
 provisions, and its policy on the principle of first asylum
 remains ambiguous.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 The people of China do not have the right or the ability
 peacefully and legally to change their government. Chinese
 citizens can neither freely choose nor change the laws and
 officials which govern them. China is ruled by the CCP, the
 paramount source of political authority. Within the party, a
 closed inner circle of a few senior leaders exercise ultimate
 power over the nation. Most hold key positions within the
 six-member Standing Committee of the Politburo, the Central
 Military Commission, or other organs. Former senior leaders
 continue to influence government policy. Deng Xiaoping
 remains first among equals in this group despite his formal
 retirement in October. The senior party leadership determines
 policy, which is then implemented by the Government.
 According to the 1982 Constitution, the National People's
 Congress (NPC) is the highest organ of state power. It
 nominally selects the President and Vice President, decides on
 the choice of the Premier, and elects the Chairman of the
 Central Military Commission. It had been granted, and had
 begun to exercise, increasing independence and influence
 during the late 1980's. Debates had become much more open,
 and several important government proposals were sent back for
 
 
 819
 further study. During the May-June crisis, some NPC members
 attempted to convene an extraordinary meeting of the body to
 revoke the Government's declaration of martial law in Beijing,
 but were unable to do so. Since that time, the NPC has
 generally resumed its previous role of ratifying decisions
 already made by the senior leadership.
 The Government neither tolerates dissent nor accepts
 challenges to its authority. The authorities denounce as
 "counterrevolutionary" proposals to limit the power of the
 Party or to alter the nation's ideology. The Government's
 handling of the spring demonstrations, the killing of its
 citizens, its subsequent crackdown on dissent, and its massive
 disinformation campaign aimed at rewriting history demonstrate
 the senior leadership's determination to retain power.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 China rejects the concept of universal human rights despite
 its adherence to the United Nations Charter, which mandates
 respect for and promotion of human rights. Chinese official
 commentators in recent months have increasingly argued that
 each nation has the right to define human rights as it
 pertains to the human conditions existing within that
 country. No nation or international organization, they say,
 has the "legal right" to apply its definition of human rights
 to conditions in other countries. Officials strongly reject
 any criticism of China's human rights situation by
 international human rights organizations and other nations,
 and they assert that international groups and foreign nations
 use human rights as a means to interfere in China's internal
 affairs.
 A resolution passed by the U. N. Human Rights Commission's
 (UNHRC) Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and
 Protection of Minorities in August, calling on the Secretary
 General to collect information on the human rights situation
 in China, was denounced by the Chinese Government as brazen
 interference in its internal affairs. China defended its use
 of force in suppressing the demonstrations in June
 legalistically, citing the legitimate right of the Chinese
 authorities "to maintain law and order." It has also rejected
 Amnesty International's August 1989 report condemning the June
 massacre, and it has harshly and aggressively attacked the VOA
 for its coverage of and commentary on the June events.
 In October the Government denounced the awarding of the Nobel
 Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama, who has been an outspoken
 critic of human rights violations in Tibet, as "gross
 interference in China's internal affairs" and as "hurting the
 feelings of the Chinese people." A Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs spokesman on October 7 said that awarding the Nobel
 Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama "constitutes open support to the
 Dalai Lama and the Tibetan separatists in their activities to
 undermine and split China."
 There are no organizations within China which specifically
 monitor or comment on human rights conditions. The Government
 crushed an incipient human rights monitoring group--Amnesty
 89--following the June crackdown and has made it clear that it
 will not tolerate the existence of such a group. It has
 reacted with equal defensiveness to international accusations
 of human rights violations in Tibet. Authorities have refused
 
 
 820
 to respond to charges of human rights violations in connection
 with the killing of demonstrators in Lhasa on March 5-7. They
 have generally not permitted reporters or human rights workers
 to visit Tibet, have refused diplomatic requests to discuss
 human rights issues, and have generally denied diplomats
 access to Tibet.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While laws designed to protect women and minorities exist, in
 practice discrimination persists in housing, jobs, education,
 and other aspects of life based on sex, religion, race, and
 class.' The 1982 Constitution states that "women in the
 People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all
 spheres of life," and it promises, among other things, equal
 pay for equal work. In fact, however, the general status of
 women is not equal to that of men, and there was no
 significant improvement in upholding women's rights or in the
 working conditions of women in 1989. By many standards, the
 status of women has regressed in recent years. Within the
 work force, 83 percent of the 220 million women employed
 perform physical labor. Seventy-seven p~rcent of employed
 women work in agriculture, 13 percent in industry, and 4
 percent in the service trade. In industry, most women are
 employed in lower skilled and lower paid occupations. The
 number of professional women is low. Women who graduate from
 college are less likely than men to be placed in prestigious
 positions. There is a significant wage gap between men and
 women performing the same tasks.
 China's recent enterprise and labor reforms have sought to
 streamline enterprises and give workers greater job mobility.
 Women apparently bear the brunt of these reforms in terms of
 job insecurity and cutbacks in welfare programs. Many
 employers have admitted they prefer to hire men, citing the
 avoidance of maternity leave and child care provisions as
 their chief reason. Complaints from women of discrimination,
 unfair dismissal, demotion, or wage cuts when they needed
 maternity leave have risen significantly. There has been an
 increasing number of reports of young women in the special
 economic zones being fired when they become pregnant or reach
 child-bearing age. The New China News Agency reported that
 during factory efficiency drives in the second half of 1987,
 over 60 percent of "redundancies" were women. To combat the
 problem, on July 25, 1988, the State Council issued a
 regulation on female employees' legal rights, stating that
 work units will not be allowed to discriminate against women
 or reduce their maternity benefits, but there is no evidence
 that the regulation has been implemented effectively.
 while the gap in the education levels of men and women is
 narrowing, the majority of the educated, particularly the
 highly educated, are men. Women now make up 37.4 percent of
 high scho5l students and 25.7 percent of university students.
 Similarly, a disproportionate number of government-funded
 scholarships for overseas study go to men. Women also
 reportedly need higher scores than men to gain admission to
 select universities.
 There are reports of violence against women, particularly wife
 beating, selling of women for wives, abuse of female children,
 and female infanticide in some rural areas--practices the
 Government condemns and attempts to curb. The Chinese have
 
 
 821
 admitted that there is very little legal recourse to curb what
 is a traditional tolerance for abuse of women. Selling women
 for wives is a growing problem; in December the Government
 began a campaign against the practice, labeling it one of "six
 evils" to be eradicated. Official statistics are lacking but
 unofficial estimates are in the tens of thousands. A New York
 Times article quoted a confidential government document in
 September that cited the rising cost of traditional rural
 weddings (more than $2,500) versus the cost of buying a wife
 ($500 to $800) as one reason for the practice. Female
 children are seen, particularly in the countryside, as
 unproductive. They will leave the family and not provide
 assistance for the parents' retirement (as sons are expected
 to do). Some provincial and local authorities have attempted
 to ease this traditional bias by facilitating establishment of
 retirement homes. Many female children are forced to work
 long hours at an early age and are sometimes beaten if chores
 are not completed. Numerous reports tell of young girls being
 removed from school at the age of 8 or 9 to work in rural
 enterprises or the fields so that their families can "make
 some money from them before they leave home."
 Chinese authorities have not succeeded in stopping abductions
 and the trading of women and children. People's Daily
 reported on November 15 that between 1981 and 1988 some 16,000
 women and 900 children who were abducted in Shandong Province
 were saved by authorities. Of the more than 14,000 arrested
 --for abductr-hg women and children, 22 percent or 3,100 were
 sentenced to prison. The number of abductions nationwide is
 not known, but the statistics from.Shandong would indicate
 that the number is high.
 The economic progress of minorities is viewed by the
 Government as one of its significant achievements. Ethnic
 minorities benefit from special treatment in marriage and
 family planning, employment, and university admission.
 Nevertheless, discrimination based on ethnic origin persists.
 The concept of a largely homogeneous ethnic race of the Han
 people pervades the general thinking of the majority Han
 Chinese. Less than 7 percent of the population belong to one
 of the 55 designated ethnic minorities. Most reside in areas
 they have traditionally inhabited. Their standards of living
 remain far below the national average. Despite the CCP's
 avowed policy of increasing minority representation in the
 Government and in the CCP, ethnic minorities are effectively
 shut out of all but a few leadership positions and play a
 minor role in decisionmaking. Some minorities resent Han
 officials holding key positions in minority areas. Tibetans
 in Tibet and Uighurs in Xinjiang have demonstrated against Han
 Chinese authority. PLA troops are stationed in these areas,
 and martial law remains in place in Lhasa. During an
 inspection tour of Xinjiang August 26, Minister for Public
 Security Wang Fang accused Uighur separatists of fomenting
 local instability.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The PRC's 1982 Constitution guarantees "freedom of
 association," but the guarantee is heavily qualified by
 references to the interest of the State and the leadership of
 the CCP, and, in fact, workers do not have the right to form
 or join independent unions of their own choosing. Union
 membership is theoretically voluntary for individual
 
 
 822
 employees, but each enterprise must have a union and each
 union must join the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 (ACFTU), nominally an independent organization, but in fact
 -closely controlled by the CCP and 'the only legal national
 federation. Virtually all state-sector workers and nearly 90
 percent of all urban sector workers belong to ACFTU chapters.
 The right to strike, which had been included in China's 1975
 and 1978 Constitutions, was removed from the 1982 Constitution
 on the grounds that the political system had eradicated class
 contradictions between the proletariat and capitalists.
 However, in 1983 the ACFTU Chairman stated that if a trade
 union and its labor protection safety officers found that a
 workplaCe was too dangerous, the union should organize the
 workers to leave the hazardous areas. Thus, authorities
 usually view strikes as justified only when they respond to
 problems such as a sudden deterioration in safety conditions.
 Nevertheless, strikes and, more commonly, work slowdowns do
 occur. In the first half of 1988, 49 strikes were reported
 officially. The number for 1989 is unknown, but reports of
 job actions in support of prodemocracy demonstrations in the
 spring of 1989 were widespread. Strikes and slowdowns
 generally occur over distribution of benefits or safety
 concerns at individual enterprises. They are usually resolved
 without the need for intervention from outside the
 enterprise. The usual role of the trade union in such strikes
 is to persuade the workers to return to their jobs.
 .Duri-ng-the countrywide political demonstrations in the spring
 of 1989, "Workers' Autonomous Federations" (WAF) were formed
 in major cities. The Beijing WAF claimed to represent over
 100,000 workers from 40 industries in the capital. WAF
 leaders.insisted they wanted to organize'legally and did not
 oppose the rule of the CCP. The concerns of the WAF included
 bureauaratIc corruption, wage disparities between workers and
 plant managers, the absence of workplace democracy, the lack
 of genuine workers' representation in the policymaking
 process, and poor safety and working conditions. Established
 primarily to mobilize and express workers' sympathy for the
 demands of student demonstrators, the WAF did not have time to
 build-organizations at the enterprise level. Thus, although
 there aTe~woTkers who purport to carry on the work of the WAF,
 the June crackdown appaxently destroyed the federations. Many
 obseTvers beli-eve concern over growing worker support for
 students' demands prompted the-Government to order troops into
 Tiananmen Square en June 3-4. According to international
 eyewitnesses,-most of the Beijing WAF leaders were killed
 during the massacre.
 After-June 4, workers became a primary target of government
 reprisals. The Hong Kong Trade Union Education Center
 (--HKTUEC) compiled a list of 211 workers arrested in connection
 with the demonstrations. According to the HKTUEC, 89 were
 held on charges related only to their participation in the
 autonomous.federations. All of those known to have been
 -executed for offenses linked to the demonstrations were manual
 workers.
 At the ACFTU annual conference in December, its appointed
 president declared that "trade unions must implement
 resolutely the party's line and general and specific
 policies." A senior party official, addressing the
 conference, demanded that party committees at all levels
 "exercise centralized leadership" over the union movement. He
 explicitly ruled out the formation of independent unions:
 
 
 823
 organizations that contravene the "Four Cardinal Principles,"
 put forward proposals contrary to party policy, or threaten
 state stability, would be "dealt with according to'the law
 immediately."
 The ACFTU claims to have contacts with trade unions in over
 120 countries or regions and has stated that it will establish
 links with foreign unions regardless of whether they are
 affiliated with Western, Communist, or other federations.
 However, its relations with the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU) have been strained. China has ratified
 neither ILO Convention 87 regarding Freedom of Association nor.
 Convention 98 on Collective Bargaining. The ICFTU vigorously
 protested Chinese violation of worker rights at the ILO
 Conference in Geneva shortly after the Beijing massacre. In
 November, the ILO's Governing Body approved stiff detailed
 questions on the death of workers during the massacre,
 arrests, death sentences, and executions, and government
 allegations against the WAF.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Government does not permit collective bargaining. The
 terms and conditions of employment, including wages, are
 unilaterally determined through administrative regulations
 which are treated as confidential material and are not
 publicly available. Without legal status as a collective
 bargaining-body, the ACFTU's role has been restricted to
 consultation in decisionmaking on-wages and wage reforms.
 Trade unions have limited themselves to channeling workers'
 complaints to the management of individual enterprises or
 municipal labor bureaus.
 Clause 33 of the "Provisional Directive on Private Enterprises
 in the PRC" issued on June 3, 1988 states that trade unions in
 private enterprises have the right to represent employees and
 to sign collective agreements with the enterprise. Depending
 on how it is implemented, this could form a basis for
 important new trade union rights in China.
 Under the labor contract system, which now covers
 approximately 10 percent of the work force, Individual workers
 may negotiate with management over-contract terms. In
 practice,-however, very few are able to negotiate effectively
 on salary and fringe benefits. At its October 1988 National
 Congress, the ACFTU leadership recognized that it would need
 to be more responsive to worker demands for benefits and
 improved safety conditions or face worker demands for a more
 independent union. In reaction to the creation of the WAF,
 the party began efforts to reassert control at every level of
 the union structure. Thus, unions enjoy less freedom of
 action than they have had for the last several years.
 Labor practices in the Special Economic Zones do not vary
 substantially from national practice. Although there are
 reports of child laborers working in the Special Economic
 Zones, the practice appears more prevalent in small
 enterprises in the rural areas. Wages in the Special Economic
 Zones, like those in other Chinese enterprises, are set by the
 factory management in consultation with the factory Worker
 Congress. In general, wages in foreign-invested joint
 ventures tend to be higher than in Chinese enterprises.

 CINA
 Although Chinese workers still do not have complete mobility,
 foreign-invested joint ventures are given greater freedom to
 recruit workers than their Chinese counterparts are allowed.
 Like Chinese state-run and collective enterprises, joint
 ventures are required to have unions and to provide office
 space and facilities for union activities.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 China is still considering ratification of ILO Convention 105
 on Forced Labor. Assignment of minor offenders to punitive
 "education through labor" camps without benefit of trial would
 appear to violate the Convention. Prisons and labor reform
 camps are expected to be partially self-supporting and thus
 require productive and profitable labor, with little
 compensation, from their inmates. Some observers consider the
 recent directives requiring students to perform manual labor
 during the school year and university graduates to work for'a
 year or more in "grassroots units" before pursuing careers or
 graduate study as another form of compulsory labor., More
 broadly, the longstanding practice of unilaterally assigning
 school graduates at all levels to specific jobs and
 effectively trapping them in those jobs through the worker's
 dependence on the work unit deprives workers of any
 significant degree of choice in employment.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Regulations promulgated in 1987 prohibit the employment of
 school-age minors who have not completed the compulsory 9
 years of education. The employment of child labor is
 pervasive, however, particularly in the rural areas and
 reportedly in the special economic zones. In addition, many
 private enterprises regularly employ children, often falsely
 representing them as the children of the enterprise owner.
 The problem is most serious in Guangdong Province, where a
 recent State Statistical Bureau survey found that only 71
 percent of the province's school-age children were attending
 school. As noted (Section 5), there have also been increasing
 reports of children, particularly girls, being removed from
 school at the age of 8 or 9 to work in the fields. In
 September 1988, the Ministry of Labor issued a circular
 designed to curb pervasiye child labor problems. It imposes
 severe fines, withdrawal of business licenses, or jail for
 employers who hire child laborers under 16 years of age.
 According to Ministry of Labor officials, however, the
 circular cannot be fully implemented until a national
 conference is convened sometime in 1990 to discuss the problem
 of child labor. Guangdong has not yet promulgated any
 regulations to enforce the 1987 directive.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 China has not yet adopted a labor code, and deliberations on a
 draft labor law appear to have been derailed by the post-June
 crackdown.' There is no minimum wage in China, although
 administrative regulations apparently fix the minimum at
 between $9 and $13 per month. A large proportion of a
 worker's income comes in the form of bonuses or subsidies
 added to a basic wage rate. For example, many foreign
 investors have found that basic salary costs may make up as
 little as 20 to 30 percent of overall costs per employee. As
 part of a comprehensive economic austerity program initiated
 in late 1988, the Government is attempting to reduce the
 amount of bonuses paid to workers.

 The maximum and normal workweek is 48 hours, of which 3 to 12
 hours are generally spent in political study or "education" on
 current social issues. The time spent in political study
 increased sharply in the second half of 1989, particularly in
 work units whose members had been active in the spring
 demonstrations.
 At factories and construction sites, occupational health and
 safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns. Every
 work unit of any size must designate a health and safety
 officer; the ILO has established a training program for these
 officials. Even so, general health and safety conditions in
 the workplace are extremely poor. The safety consciousness of
 both workers and managers is generally very low. State
 procurators deal annually with thousands of negligence and
 accident cases involving criminal or civil liability. The
 absence of a national labor code, however, makes enforcement
 of safety regulations extremely difficult.
