 Fiji
 Fiji's multiracial society is about evenly divided between
 indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians, with each community
 constituting approximately 47 percent-of the total population.
 Indians dominate the economy and professions and are prominent
 in the public service.
 Fiji was a parliamentary democracy until May 1987, when the
 army deposed a newly elected government in a bloodless coup.
 Coup leader Lt. Col. (now Major General) Sitiveni Rabuka cited
 Indian predominance in that government as a primary reason for
 the coup. An interim civilian government, formed in December
 1987 when Rabuka's military regime voluntarily stepped down,
 is headed by Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who held
 that office for 17 years prior to the April 1987 elections.
 At year's end, the Cabinet consisted primarily of civilians
 but included Military Forces (FMF) Commander Rabuka and four
 other military officers. The military remained very
 influential, especially in security matters.
 Sugar is the mainstay of Fiji's economy, with tourism the
 second largest foreign exchange earner. The economy suffered
 a-severe decline in the wake of the first coup in May 1987,
 but has made significant progress toward recovery. The
 Government is promoting light manufacturing for export as a
 long-term means of reducing dependence on sugar and tourism.
 Human rights were less constrained in 1989 than in the
 previous year, but freedom of the press and assembly remained
 restricted, and the right of citizens peacefully to change the
 government remains unclear. Discrimination against Indians
 and women also remained a problem.
 The major human rights issue in 1989 involved efforts to draft
 a-new constitution. The interim Government and the Fijian
 community made it clear that the constitution, when adopted,
 will guarantee the political predominance of indigenous
 Fijians. A September 1988 draft proposed an electoral system
 heavily weighted in favor of the indigenous Fijians and
 containing numerous provisions unacceptable to the Indian
 community, including one interpreted as establishing
 Christianity as a state religion. The Government subsequently
 formed an independent, multiracial committee to canvass public
 views. After hearing many criticisms of the draft, the
 Constitution Inquiry and Advisory Committee (CIAC) in
 September 1989 called for extensive revisions to make the
 document more democratic and remove or dilute several
 provisions opposed by the Indian community.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political killings by the Government
 or any political group.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions or disappearances.
 
 
 841
 Fil
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden under Fiji's Fundamental Freedoms Decree
 and is not practiced. Physical abuse of detainees occurs but
 is neither usual nor condoned. An escaped prisoner died
 during recapture several months ago; one guard was convicted
 of assault and battery but acquitted on the murder charge. The
 current situation represents a marked improvement over 1987,
 when there were numerous credible reports of physical abuse of
 detainees. Corporal punishment is allowed; strokes of the
 cane are administered under medical supervision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Reports of arbitrary arrest or detention declined markedly in
 1989. However, antigovernment political activists were
 occasionally detained for questioning at the airport when
 entering or leaving the country. Those detained included the
 deposed Prime Minister and at least one of his Ministers.
 Detentions lasted a few hours at most; detainees were
 reportedly abused verbally but not physically. In one case, a
 political figure was arrested on a minor fraud charge on a
 Friday and not allowed bail until the following Monday.
 Exile is not practiced formally. It was reported that the
 authorities have a short list of Fiji citizens restricted from
 return to Fiji, but this remained unconfirmed. No Fiji
 citizens were denied reentry in 1989.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system, reorganized after Fiji's withdrawal from the
 Commonwealth of Nations in September 1987, remains modeled on
 the British system. Magistrates' courts try minor offenses.
 A high court has original jurisdiction in serious cases. An
 appeals court and a Supreme Court complete the legal
 structure. The Chief Justice chairs all three higher courts.
 No special courts exist; military courts try only members of
 the armed forces. The judiciary is independent, as
 demonstrated by a magistrate's decision to discharge without
 conviction about 20 political activists prosecuted for an
 anticoup demonstration. Due process rights are similar to
 those found in English common law. Right to a public trial is
 guaranteed, defendants have a right to counsel, and there is a
 public defender's office. Right of appeal is maintained. In
 practice, many trials and appeals have been delayed due to
 understaffing of the court system.  Since habeas corpus and
 bail are normal procedure, most defendants have not
 experienced undue imprisonment before trial. There are no
 political prisoners in Fiji.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, privacy of the home is respected. The Internal
 Security Decree of 1988, adopted following discovery of a
 smuggled arms cache, allowed warrantless searches, but since
 its suspension in November 1988 the practice has stopped.
 Search warrants are required for searches in criminal cases.
 Surveillance of persons believed to represent a security
 threat is carried out to some degree. Many political
 
 
 842
 dissidents believe their telephones and mail are monitored,
 but concrete evidence is lacking.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech has largely been restored. Political
 figures and private citizens can and do speak out against the
 Government. No arrests for making any kind of public
 statement were reported in 1989.
 Privately owned broadcast and print media operate without
 prior censorship but with considerable self-restraint under
 pressure from the authorities. Newspapers refrain from
 printing editorials severely critical of the Government and do
 little investigative reporting. Statements about the
 political situation by opposition figures and foreign
 governments are reported, however. The letters column of the
 Fiji Times frequently carries political statements from
 members of the deposed government and other persons and groups
 opposed to the Government and the draft constitution. While
 the press is still less than fully free, the situation is
 improved over 1987, when the newspapers were closed for 6
 weeks. Journalists reportedly receive frequent phone calls
 from government officials complaining about stories. However,
 no journalists were detained in 1989; in 1988 two journalists
 were detained in connection with published stories. Foreign
 reporters are required to obtain a visa to enter Fiji. Some
 reporters and television crews have been denied visas.
 Fiji is home to the University of the South Pacific (USP), a
 regional institution. Prior to the coups and immediately
 thereafter, the USP was a center of opposition political
 activity. The Government made it clear that it wants the USP,
 especially its expatriate staff, out of Fijian domestic
 politics, and some politically active expatriate staff members
 were denied extension of their work permits.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly for political purposes is allowed but restricted.
 Public gatherings require permission from the authorities, and
 permits for large outdoor political meetings or demonstrations
 generally 're not'granted. Permission was refused for an
 anti-French demonstration during the visit of the Prime
 Minister of France, and a political activist was detained
 briefly at the airport when she was found with an anti-French
 poster just before his arrival. A group of about 20 people
 arrested and-charged with parading without a permit for a
 demonstration in downtown Suva in 1988 were discharged without
 conviction in early 1989.
 Political parties are currently operating, and party
 headquarters, including those of the deposed coalition
 parties, remain open. Organizations of a political nature are
 allowed to operate~and issue-public statements. The
 Government refuses to negotiate with the political parties
 from the deposed coalition government.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 
 
 843
 Fiji
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed and honored in practice.
 The revised draft constitution underscores the importance of
 Christianity to Fiji and the Fijian people but guarantees
 protection for all religions. Since the 1987 coups, most
 commercial activities on Sundays have been banned. The Sunday
 bans were relaxed substantially in mid-1989 to allow public
 transportation and restaurants to operate and to allow
 agricultural activities and some sports to continue. This
 provoked a vehement protest from rightwing Methodist clergy,
 who support reimposition of strict Sunday bans such as were in
 effect after the September 1987 coup. Methodist clergymen
 organized protest demonstrations, which led to some arrests.
 The Sunday bans are opposed by Indians and urban residents,
 but are popular among rural Fijians. Some Christian leaders
 oppose any Sunday bans. Despite statements by General Rabuka
 about "Christianizing" the Indian community, there has been no
 attempt to translate this idea into public policy. No
 significant restrictions affect foreign clergy, missionary
 activity, charitable works, religious publishing and
 education, or other typical nonpolitical activities of
 religious organizations.
 One foreign priest was deported in 1989 over the strenuous
 objections of many of his parishioners. No official reason
 was given, but it is generally believed he was deported as a
 result of having participated in antigovernment political
 activity, especially a public demonstration in 1988.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country. Opposition politicians and labor leaders were able
 to travel abroad and return to Fiji in 1988-89, in contrast to
 the situation which prevailed under the military government in
 September-November 1987. Fiji citizens are free to emigrate.
 According to the best available estimates, between 20,000 and
 25,000 have done so since May 1987. Most of the emigrants are
 Indians, many of them professionals, but Fijians and others
 have also left. Several thousand have claimed refugee status,
 especially when applying for admission to Canada, but neither
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees nor any government has
 recognized those claims. There are no refugees in Fiji, and
 no forced resettlement programs.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of all citizens to change their government through
 genuinely democratic means remained uncertain in 1989. Fiji
 is governed by an interim government comprising a Prime
 Minister and a Cabinet appointed by the President. At year's
 end, the Cabinet included senior politicians from Prime
 Minister Mara's Alliance Party as well as technocrats, five
 army officers, and some ethnic Fijian nationalists. There
 were two Indian Ministers. At year's end, the Government was
 scheduled to step down in January 1990 and hand over power to
 a second interim government, which would implement a
 constitution and take the country into elections. It was
 expected that the new Cabinet would be headed by Ratu Mara.
 Military members of the Cabinet were expected either to resign
 their commissions or to return to barracks.
 
 
 844
 The proposed constitution provides for a bicameral
 Parliament. Fijians would hold 37 of 69 seats in the lower
 house. One seat would be reserved for Rotuma, a Polynesian
 island culturally distinct from the rest of Fiji. Indians
 would hold 27 seats, other ethnic groups 4. An upper house
 with the power to veto legislation would be dominated by
 Fijian traditional chiefs. A president chosen by the Great
 Council of Chiefs (GCC) would act as head of state, but a
 prime minister and cabinet would hold most executive power.
 The GCC is an all-Fijian advisory body composed of Fiji's
 highest traditional chiefs. Provincial representatives to the
 GCC are designated by provincial councils. The GCC has no
 administrative role in government, but its approval is a sign
 of legitimacy within the ethnic Fijian community. The
 President and Prime Minister are both members of the GCC by
 virtue of their high traditional positions. According to the
 interim government, the revised draft constitution is intended
 to ensure political dominance by the indigenous Fijians, while
 reinstating a form of parliamentary democracy and ensuring
 protection for Indian communal interests. Indian political
 leaders dispute this rationale, saying nothing less than fully
 proportional representation is acceptable. The CIAC-proposed
 revisions do provide additional protections for the Indian
 community compared to the 1988 draft. For example,
 constitutional amendment procedures would prevent the Fijian
 members of Parliament from amending the constitution without
 the concurrence of at least part of the Indian contingent; the
 previous-draft would have permitted the Fijians to pass
 amendments without Indian support.
 Elections are to be held by secret ballot, with voting only by
 communal constituencies. This latter aspect is a major change
 from the 1970 constitution, which provided for a complex
 system of cross-voting allowing Indians a say in the selection
 of some Fijian representatives and vice versa. The revised
 draft calls for elections every 4 years but the Government may
 call an election at any time.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups as such in Fiji, but
 the women's rights movement, the labor movement, and various
 political groups are involved in promoting a number of human
 rights causes. The Government regards externally based
 investigations of the pQlitical and human rights situation in
 Fiji as a violation of its sovereignty. It did allow a visit
 by a delegation from the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU) in late 1989.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The stated purpose of the 1987 military coups was to ensure
 the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and to
 protect their traditional way of life and communal control of
 land. To this end a number of measures have been taken that
 favor the Fijian community over the other ethnic groups. The
 most obvious is the reapportionment of the new Parliament to
 guarantee a preponderance of Fijians. The Government is also
 committed to raising the proportion of Fijians and Rotumans in
 the public service to 50 percent or more at all levels. Many
 Fijians felt that the precoup public service discriminated in
 
 
 845
 FLi
 favor of Indians, who controlled most of middle management
 because of their higher educational level. Current promotion
 and hiring policies in the public service favor ethnic
 Fijians. The CIAC recommended deleting a provision in the
 1988 draft constitution that would have reserved certain
 senior positions for ethnic Fijians.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue. About 85 percent
 of the land is held communally by indigenous Fijians. Most
 cash crop farmers are Indians, who lease their land from the
 Fijian villages. Individual title to land is not an
 indigenous concept; lands owned currently by the crown (6
 percent) and by individuals (9 percent) were transferred from
 customary owners during the colonial period. The present land
 ownership arrangements were instituted to protect the
 interests of the indigenous Fijians. Many Indians,
 particularly farmers, feel that the absence of secure land
 tenure discriminates against them. The military coups were
 prompted, in part, by Fijian fears that Indians sought to take
 away their land.
 A major complaint from ethnic Indians is inadequate protection
 against harassment and crime, at least some of which is
 racially motivated. In the latter part of the year, five
 Indian temples and a mosque were subjected to acts of arson or
 other desecration by a group of Fijian youths. Arrests have
 been made, and at year's end investigations were continuing.
 Gangs of Fijian youths sometimes stone or invade Indian homes,
 stealing property and/or shouting racial abuse. The
 perpetrators escape more often than not, and the Indian
 community believes the authorities do not pay adequate
 attention to the problem.
 Corporal punishment is the norm in Fiji schools, and it can be
 applied quite harshly. Some observers believe that in the
 current racial atmosphere, some Fijian teachers are applying
 harsher punishments to Indian students, and vice versa. This
 trend may be linked to the above-noted increase in racial
 violence by young people.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have
 functioned primarily in traditional roles, although some women
 rise to high places in the public service, politics, and
 business. Women can attain high status in Fiji's traditional
 chiefly system, although it is unusual. The Prime Minister's
 wife is, in her own right, Fiji's second highest-ranking
 traditional chief. In general, women in the Fijian community
 are more likely to rise to prominence in their own right than
 are women in the Indian community. Women have full rights of'
 property ownership and inheritance, and a number have become
 successful entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than
 men, a discrepancy that is especially notable in the garment
 industry. Garment workers, most of whom are female, are
 subject to a special minimum wage considerably lower than that
 in other sectors. Reliable current statistics on
 representation of women in traditional men's occupations,
 business management, and the professions are unavailable,
 However, relatively few women are employed in these areas.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement. A recent
 area of focus has been violence against women. The movement
 has pressed for more serious treatment of rape in the courts.
 The crime tends to draw prison sentences of only a few years.
 An admonition by the Chief Justice late in 1988 has resulted
 in some increase in the average prison term for rape. The law
 
 
 846
 Fiji
 allows corporal punishment for rape, but this is generally
 used only in cases of offenses against minors. Domestic
 violence is also a problem in Fiji and is a second major focus
 of the women's movement. The authorities are generally
 reluctant to intervene in cases.of domestic violence unless it
 is necessary to save the woman's life. Few cases result in
 prosecution, as the victim generally does not press charges.
 The Government has-not been active in dealing with domestic
 violence. Suva has a privately funded Women's Crisis Centre
 which offers counseling and assistance to women in cases of
 rape, domestic violence, and other problems, such as child
 support payments.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to form and join unions, elect their own
 representatives, publicize their views on labor matters, and
 determine their own policies. Strikes are legal. At least a
 dozen well-publicized strikes took place in 1989. Unions must
 register with, but are not controlled by, the Government. The
 central labor body, -the Fiji Trades Union Congress (FTUC), is
 closely associated-wi-th the opposition Fiji Labour Party and
 the deposed-Bevadra government. -The labor movement is led
 largely by ethnic Indians. Persons with close ties to the
 Government have started rival unions primarily for ethnic
 Fijians; these unions are more amenable, to political
 cooperation with the Government. The.-FTUC is free to
 associate-internationally and it belongs to the ICFTU.
 The Committee on Freedom of Association of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) at its November 1989 meeting found
 that Fijian law and practice excessively restricted-trade
 union's abilities to hold union meetings and public gatherings.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bdrgain Collectively
 Fiji law recognizes the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union if
 more than half the employees in a workplace have joined.
 Recognition is- determined by union membership numbers rather
 than by an-election. The Government will order a recalcitrant
 employer to recognize a union, although union leaders accused
 the Government-of failing to apply the law correctly in one
 recent case. Key sectors of the economy including sugar and
 tourism are organized, and collective bargaining is-the norm.
 Currently, nationwide wage guidelines are in effect. -These
 guidelines replaced a mandatory, wage cut and freeze put into
 effect after the 1987 coups. The Government authorized a 6
 percent across-the-board wage increase in 1989. The ILO's
 Committee of Experts at its 1989 session noted that Fiji's
 wage controls did not conform with the provisions of ILO
 Convention 98 on collective bargaining and asked the
 Governmenf to indicate when it intends to take measures to
 lift the legal restrictions on the free negotiation of wages.
 Fiji's practice for wage bargaining has been to set national
 wage guidelines after consultations between the Government,
 employers, and unions. Wage negotiation on an industry-by-
 industry basis is not practiced, and a government proposal to
 introduce such negotiations has been resisted by employers and
 unions. Union leaders fear that straight market-based wage
 
 
 847
 FIJI
 bargaining would open unacceptably large wage gaps between
 skilled and unskilled workers.
 Prior to the coups, a tripartite forum of employers, unions,
 and government oversaw labor negotiations. The tripartite
 forum has been abolished; its restoration is a key demand of
 the FTUC. The Government has agreed to consider reestablishing
 the forum, but at year's end had not done so. Legislation
 protects workers from summary dismissal without just cause.
 The courts often rule in favor of workers in such cases.
 Trade union members arid properties are respected, however,
 there have been a few incidents of vandalism against the homes
 and cars of union leaders. The incidents, which were well
 organized, remain unsolved. There is no evidence to link such
 actions to the Government. The unions are generally
 successful in preventing discrimination against workers for
 union activities. Labor legislation is applied uniformly
 throughout the country, including in export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor does not exist in Fiji. Both the 1970
 Constitution and the draft constitution give protection from
 forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under 12 may not be employed in any capacity.
 Children (under age 15) and "young persons" (age 15-17) may
 not be employed in industry or work with machinery.
 Enforcement generally is effective, with the possible
 exception of family members working on family farms or
 businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No national minimum wage has been established. Certain
 sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Employment
 and Industrial Relations. These are in the $0.75-$1.00 per
 hour range, except in the garment industry where it is only
 about 35 cents. In late September, the Government and
 employers agreed to raise this to about 45 cents; a date for
 implementation had not been set as of year's end. The minimum
 wage will support a barely adequate standard of living, except
 in the garment industry, where the starting wage is based on
 the assumption that workers are young people or married women
 living at home and not expecting to support a household. The
 more productive workers in the garment industry earn $1.00 an
 hour or more, a living wage.
 Fiji has no regulation specifying maximum hours of work for
 adult males. Women are prohibited from night work in industry
 and underground work in mines. Certain industries, notably
 transportation and shipping, have problems in this area.
 Excessive working hours for drivers have contributed to a
 number of fatal bus accidents. Indians, who generally require
 a cash income to survive, are more vulnerable to pressure to
 work long hours than Fijians. Many Fijians can and will
 return to their villages rather than work what they consider
 excessive hours.
 Fiji has workplace safety regulations, a workmen's compensation
 act, and an accident compensation plan. A tribunal sets
 awards for workers injured on the job. Government enforcement
 
 
 848
 of safety standards suffers from a lack of trained enforcement
 personnel, but the unions-do a reasonable job of monitoring
 safety standards in organized workplaces. A 1989 study of
 working conditions in the garment-industries-resulted in the
 Government ordering many employers to improve working
 conditions. Union leaders complained that the Government's
 action was too mild and that the employers should have been
 subject to criminal prosecution.

 EDITORIAL NOTE
 This volume continues the series first published in a reprinted
 edition in 1982 and containing Country Reports on Human Rights
 Practices from 1977 through 1980 (except 1978 when no such report
 was prepared), and the less regular Reports on Human Rights Prac-
 tices in Countries Receiving United States Aid for 1976 and 1978.
 The practice of the Department of State to submit to Congress the
 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices on an annual basis-has
 contifiued through the 1980s and into the 1990s. This does not seem
 to be the case with the Reports on Human Rights in Countries
 Receiving United States Aid. The last of these reports was submitted
 by the Department of State to Congress in 1979.
 This reprint series continues to publish these reports for the later
 years as they become available.
