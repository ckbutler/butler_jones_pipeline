 FINLAND
 Finland is a republic with close historical and cultural ties
 to Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. It is one of Western
 Europe's larger countries, covering 337,000 square kilometers
 -- one third lying north of the Arctic Circle. In population,
 it is one of Europe's smallest and least dense, with 4.8
 million inhabitants or 16 persons per square kilometer.
 Finland was part of the Kingdom of Sweden between 1155 and
 1809, and from 1809 to 1917 it was an autonomous grand duchy of
 Russia. Finland declared its independence in 1917 and was
 recognized by the U.S. in 1919.
 The Finnish people elect a 200-member unicameral Parliament
 every four years. Executive power is exercised jointly by a
 President elected to six year terms and by a ministerial
 cabinet responsible to the Parliament. The cabinet must enjoy
 the confidence of a majority of Parliament, and for "special
 legislation" a qualified (two-thirds) majority is necessary.
 At present, there are eight political parties represented in
 the Parliament and ten parties on local municipal councils.
 Finland has a mixed economy, with state-owned, publicly-owned
 and privately-owned companies. Finland has some 60,000
 privately-owned companies employing roughly 1.2 million
 persons. Companies owned by state and local authorities
 account for about a quarter of the country's industrial
 production.
 During the past year, Finland elected its first President in
 history from the Social Democratic Party. The new President,
 who was acting President during the last three months of 1981,
 received 43 percent of the popular vote and was elected on the
 first ballot in the Finnish Electoral College.
 Finland's respect for human rights is reflected in its
 Constitution, its laws, and in the customs and practices of its
 institutions. Concern for the integrity of the person is
 protected both in theory and in practice by two co-equal public
 investigatory institutions. the chancellor of justice (i.e., a
 public prosecutor) and the parliamentary ombudsman. These two
 officials head legal staffs charged with investigation of
 complaints from private citizens concerning official
 misconduct.
 Finland has been in the forefront in providing protection to
 women and minorities. The Swedish-speaking minority enjoys
 protection of language and cultural heritage and participates
 fully in the economic life of the country. Finland was the
 second country in the world to give women the vote (1906).
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed constitutionally and
 respected in practice. Finland shares with its Nordic
 neighbors a comprehensive social welfare system which includes
 free education and medical care.
 Finland is an ethnically homogenous nation with no immigrant
 population of any consequence. Few tensions exist between the
 Finnish-speaking majority and the language minorities of
 Swedish speakers, Lapps, Jews, and Gypsies. The trend in the
 development of human rights in Finland appears to be in the
 direction of somewhat greater attention to the "economic
 rights" of individuals both at home and in international
 affairs.
 The country has developed a modern industrial economy with a
 strong and democratic labor movement.

 Finland is a supporter of international human rights
 objectives. It is a party to most of the existing
 international agreements on the subject and has made special
 efforts to implement and incorporate the provisions of these
 agreements into its laws.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Killing
 Killing for political motives-by Government or opposition
 political organizations'does.nat-occur in Finland. There have
 been no allegations of- such-conduct. kn Finland. since -World War II.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no reported cases of disappearances occurring in
 Finland as a result of action by the Government. or by elements
 of opposition political groups. There are no cases of
 abduction or clandestine detention by official, quasi-official,
 or opposition forces.
 c. Torture
 There have been no reported cases in Finland of torture.
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and-respected in
 practice. The most relevant laws protecting the individual
 from torture are contained in-the Police Acts.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. By
 law, prisoners must be treated justly, with respect for their
 human dignity and without distinction made on the basis of
 race, color, sex, language, nationality, religious or political
 conviction, social position, or wealth.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. The circumstances of an arrest
 are examined initially when an accused is brought to trial, and
 should the arrest be shown to have been false or should the
 accused be acquitted, the accused is entitled to collect civil
 damages from the same court. At present, there is no pre-trial
 examination of an arrest. Within ten days of detention, an
 accused must be brought before a judge for formal charging. In
 exceptional cases, a suspect may be detained up to 17 days
 without being charged. However, prison and police authorities
 function under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice and
 Ministry of Interior, either of which may order the release of
 a prisoner detained without charges. In addition, the
 Parliamentary ombudsman makes regular inspection tours of all
 prisons and reports to the Parliament on his observations. He
 has the authority to take immediate action, if he believes it
 necessary. Preventive detention is authorized only during a
 declared state of war for narrowly defined offenses such as
 treason, mutiny, and trafficking in weapons. Procedural
 safeguards are mandated.

 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Finnish citizens and aliens have the right to
 effective counsel. Charges must be clearly stated and the state
 will pay for counsel of one's choice in cases of indigence.
 Finnish law provides that court trials and judgments are public
 and open to the casual observer. Courts may decide that a
 trial will be held behind closed doors in juvenile,
 matrimonial, and guardianship cases, as well as when publicity
 would offend morality or endanger the national security.
 Security cases differ from other cases in that judgment also
 may be restricted and sanctions imposed if it is made public.
 In an ongoing treason trial in Finland, one which is being
 heard before a civilian court and involves a newspaperman and
 an army lieutenant, only the fact of the trial has been made
 public, even though both defendents are free on personal bond.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and the
 legislature. It may hear appeals of any government decision
 made by both civilian and military authorities except that,
 under a law currently being reviewed in Parliament, in the
 event of a police-ordered expulsion of an alien, the Ministry
 of Interior's decision is final and may not be appealed.
 Civilians may not be tried by military courts except in time of
 war. There are no separate "security" courts in Finland.
 Provisional tribunals are expressly prohibited.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home, including prohibition of
 eavesdropping and mail tampering, is guaranteed by the Finnish
 Constitution and is respected in practice. Search warrants may
 be issued only by judicial authorities empowered to issue
 warrants of arrest for crimes punishable by imprisonment of
 more than six months.... The Ministry of Interior or the
 Chancellor of Justice may also authorize a search, subject to
 subsequent judicial scrutiny and possible civil and criminal
 penalties for abuse of this power (including compensation to
 the victims). No search warrants are necessary for traffic
 offenses, and police routinely test motorists for alcohol use.
 The security police are legally subject to the above
 restrictions and respect them in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.  Freedom of Speech and Press
 Civilian:and political liberties are guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. There is no censorship, and prior
 restraint is expressly prohibited in Finland. The right of a
 citizen-to own and operate a printing press is constitutionally
 protected. The Finnish Government owns all broadcast media and
 leases some TV time to a commercial TV service, which produces
 its own news and features programming. Although Finnish media
 are traditionally said to exercise a certain restraint in
 directly criticizing "friendly countries", there are no
 sanctions, harassment, or intimidation. In recent history, a
 bombing attack on the communist newspaper "Tiedonantaja" by an
 ultra-right-wing group in 1976 was investigated by the police
 and the perpetrators arrested, tried, and sentenced. There has
 been no such incident since that time.
 
 
 893
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of association is guaranteed by the Finnish
 Constitution (any group may hold a meeting without a permit
 upon six hours' notice to local authorities). If the purpose
 of the association is to influence political issues, only
 Finnish citizens may belong.  Under the terms of the Peace
 Treaty of 1947, Nazi-like political groups are proscribed.
 Trade union organization and activity are protected
 constitutionally.  In 1970, public employees were also given
 the right to join unions and to strike. Non-Nordic aliens may
 not join trade unions unless they obtain permission from the
 Government. Trade unions are significant within the Finnish
 economy and are organized at the national level with locals in
 each enterprise. Comprehensive incomes policy agreements have
 been negotiated since 1968 and have established wage, vacation,
 tax, and social policy. All unions are independent of the
 Government, but industrial labor unions traditionally maintain
 ties with the Social Democratic and Communist parties. The
 Finnish Government encourages voluntary organizations and
 subsidizes many private groups formed to achieve a public
 purpose. There are no restrictions on these organizations, and
 they are permitted to maintain relations with other
 international groups in both socialist'and Western countries.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: Evangelical Lutheran and
 Orthodox. Voluntary taxes are collected by the Government from
 members to support these churches. In addition, Finland has
 other Protestant and Catholic denominations, as well as small
 Moslem and Jewish populations. There are no restrictions on
 the exercise of religious freedom in Finland. Over 93 percent
 of the population are members of the Lutheran Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Finns have the right to voluntary repatriation,
 which is protected by the Constitution. There is no
 restriction on emigration, except that minor children must have
 a parent's consent to leave the country.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Finland is a multi-party democracy in which political power is
 divided between the Parliament and the President. In Finland,
 women and minorities participate fully in the political
 process. There are 49 women members of Parliament and three
 women in the Finnish cabinet. Opposition parties function
 freely, and in parliamentary and municipal elections almost all
 seats are hotly contested.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Finland participates actively in international human rights
 organizations and has not been the subject of an international
 investigation.of alleged human rights violations. Within
 Finland, several organizations monitor human rights
 performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the
 government-sponsored Equality Council, the Women Rights Union,
 a branch office of Amnesty International, the United Nations
 
 
 League, and the League for Human Rights and Freedoms. These
 organizations tend to focus on alleged human rights violations
 in countries other than Finland.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Finland has a modern industrial economy with privately-owned,
 cooperative, and state-owned enterprises operating within a
 market economy system. The Government follows an economic
 policy aimed at maximizing economic stability and equalizing
 distribution of income along broad lines among individuals
 residing in urban and rural sectors.
 With about 0.1 percent of the world's population, Finland
 produces 0.3 percent of the world's output and has 0.8 percent
 of the world's trade. Exports amount to one quarter of
 Finland's $4 billion gross national product. Finland has a
 comprehensive social welfare system available to all citizens
 without regard to race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or
 political affiliation. Services provided by the state include
 free medical care, assistance with purchase andrental of
 housing, unemployment benefits, child care assistance, family
 allowances, insurance, and care for the old and infirm.
 Finland enjoys a virtual 100 percent literacy rate. Finland's
 Constitution guarantees to all citizens the right to own
 property and be fully compensated for property taken for public
 use. Finland also guarantees to all its citizens the right to
 just remuneration and a safe workplace. By law, all persons in
 Finland are paid equal salaries for equal work. Finland enjoys
 a high standard of living with an estimated per capita income
 for 1982 of $10,200. Employment, inflation, and declining
 competitiveness of Finnish exports were problems in 1982. A
 reduction of the rate at which prices were rising did occur
 throughout 1982,.which made the rate of inflation before
 devaluation around 7 percent.
