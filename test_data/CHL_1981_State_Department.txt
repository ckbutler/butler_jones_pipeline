 CHILE
 In September 1973, as the result of severe economic
 dislocation and increasing violence, broad opposition
 developed to the elected Allende government. The
 armed forces broke with their tradition of non-interference
 in politics and overthrew the government. The trauma
 of the Allende period and the view that his policies
 were leading to a Marxist state continue to influence
 the attitudes of many Chileans. In the period 1973-
 77, the regime undertook to curb dissent through a
 series of repressive measures. These included mass
 arrests, torture, exile and the disappearance of hundreds
 of persons.
 The human rights situation in Chile has improved signifi-
 cantly since 1977. No confirmed "disappearances"
 have occurred since October of that year and, although
 there continue to be sworn statements reporting the
 use of force in some interrogations, treatment of
 prisoners and general police procedures have improved.
 However, arrests and expulsions for non-violent political
 activities continued to occur in 1981. Political
 parties remain formally dissolved, and basic freedoms
 of speech and assembly are restricted, although some
 political activity, criticism and press discussion
 are tolerated. Labor union activity continues to
 be under some restraints, but collective bargaining
 and a limited right to strike were restored in 1979
 under a new labor law. The continuing "state of emergency,"
 which creates a situation similar to that under a
 "state of siege," is extended regularly every six
 months and gives the government extraordinary authority
 to deal with an extremist threat, although the same
 powers are often used against non-violent dissenters
 as well. The right to procedural and substantive
 safeguards under the law was weakened in 1981 by certain
 transitory provisions of the new constitution which
 entered into force on March 11. These provisions,
 particularly article 24, provide a constitutional
 basis for executive branch actions, some of which
 had previously been open to judicial appeal: the
 power to order individuals into internal exile for
 periods of up to three months; arrest people for up
 to five days without judicial warrant; extend the
 authorized period of detention without formal charges
 from five to 20 days in cases of terrorist activities
 involving death, injury or kidnapping; and restrict
 the rights of assembly and freedom of information.
 These measures are not subject to judicial review.
 In several instances, however, the courts and press
 have taken positions defending human rights.
 The March 1981 constitution, approved in the controversial
 September 1980 plebiscite by a two-thirds majority,
 provides for a transition period of eight years under
 military government, with President Augusto Pinochet
 remaining in power. The protection of individual
 rights spelled out in the new constitution is diminished
 by the executive powers in the transitory provisions
 described above. Further, some constitutional provisions,
 including elections for the senate and chamber of
 deputies, will take effect only after the end of the
 eight-year transition. In the meantime, the military
 junta exercises the legislative power of the state.

 Following two years of relative calm, Chile suffered
 a moderate increase in extremist violence during 1980
 and 1981. Assassination attempts, armed robberies,
 attacks and bombings resulted in the death or wounding
 of at least 17 government security personnel. Groups
 associated with the Movement of the Revolutionary
 Left (MIR) -- some of whom reportedly received Cuban
 training -- claimed responsibility for many of these
 incidents, but their involvement in other similar
 incidents has not been established.
 With respect to socio-economic policy, the present
 government has embarked on a program to reduce the
 role of government, to open the economy to world market
 competition and to reform fiscal policy. The persistence
 of high inflation, including the hyperinflation of
 more than than 600 percent in 1973, and the difficult
 economic circumstances brought on by international
 conditions of the mid-1970's (high oil and low copper
 prices), forced government officials in 1975 to implement
 a series of austerity measures which accelerated the
 transition to a free market economy. Beginning in
 1976, GNP growth averaged more than seven percent
 in real terms. Inflation declined to 9.5 percent
 for 1981, and the official unemployment rate for greater
 Santiago was about 9.5 per cent by the end of 1981.
 High growth rates and better tax collection have enabled
 the government to increase social spending both as
 a percentage of the budget and by comparison (in real
 terms) with previous periods in Chilean history.
 Social spending is now more carefully focused on poorer
 segments of the population. Important efforts in
 health and nutrition programs have substantially cut
 infant mortality over the decade. The government
 has increased real spending on education but, in line
 with the effort to target social spending on the more
 needy, the percentage allocated to pre-primary, primary
 and intermediate levels has been increased relative
 to higher education.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 19 of the 1981 constitution prohibits "use
 of all illegal pressure" and "guarantees to all persons
 the right to life and to the physical and psychic
 integrity of the individual." High-level government
 officials publicly and privately deny that the use
 of torture by government agents is authorized. In
 1981, 68 persons (compared to 100 in 1980) filed complaints
 with the courts alleging torture -- with most individuals
 alleging psychological duress, beatings and the use
 of electric shock during interrogations. While the
 courts have required investigations of some cases,
 to date none have been substantiated by government
 investigators. Most complaints of torture were against
 the National Center for Information (CNI).
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Human rights sources report a number of cases: of serious
 mistreatment during 1981. While most detainees do
 not claim to have been mistreated, some persons detained
 
 
 371
 during peaceful demonstrations or on suspicion of
 proscribed political activities have complained of
 beatings and being forced to remain unclothed for
 extended periods of time.
 Until January 1981, persons detained in prison for
 political or terrorist activities were normally separated
 from common criminals, in keeping with an informal
 agreement between the Chilean government and an ad
 hoc working group of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC). Since January 1981, in keeping
 with the government's position that there are no political
 prisoners in Chile, all prisoners have been treated
 equally, with rights of visitation and communication
 with family, friends, legal counsel and representatives
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 c. Disappearances
 The last reported disappearance occurred in 1977.
 About 635 cases from the period 1973-1977 remain unresolved.
 The Chilean supreme court appointed special judges
 in 1979 to investigate many of these disappearances.
 None of the cases have been resolved. The investigations
 continue in some cases, action has been suspended
 in numerous others and still others have been referred
 to military justice officials when the military or
 police are believed to have been involved. Some families
 of the disappeared have appealed the suspension or
 referral to the military courts. To date, the appeals
 have had little effect in resolving the whereabouts
 of those who have disappeared.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 When people are detained for political activities,
 friends or relatives normally report the detentions,
 the press publicizes them and the government eventually
 acknowledges them. Although the government denies
 holding political prisoners, 218 persons are in the
 judicial process charged with seditious activity;
 137 are in jail and 81 are out on bail. Most are
 accused of violating either the internal security
 law or the arms control law, or both. Of 525 security
 arrests in Santiago in 1981, 460 persons were released
 without charges for lack of sufficient evidence, although
 75 of them were held more than the specified five
 days.
 While the CNI has only limited legal authority to
 arrest people on its own initiative, in practice it
 has been able to obtain vaguely-worded warrants which
 give it considerable latitude in making searches or
 arrests. Public concern has, however, led to greater
 care by security agents in identifying themselves
 and in displaying warrants when detaining people.
 People detained for participating in banned public
 demonstrations or illegal meetings reportedly are
 often held for the full five days permitted under
 executive discretion. They may then be released (the
 large majority of reported cases), sent into internal
 or external exile or charged with internal security
 violations. In those cases reaching the courts, the
 investigating judges may take up to five more days
 to deliberate but, in practice, they have
 
 
 372
 rarely issued indictments.
 In theory, the right of habeas corpus (writ of amparo)
 exists and, under the new constitution, the courts
 have become firmer in demanding a prompt accounting
 from the government. In May 1981 the courts began
 to request copies of arrest warrants and to insist
 that only they had the constitutional right to decide
 whether or not a case should proceed. Although the
 gains so far have been mainly theoretical, in that
 the courts normally uphold government arrests of political
 dissidents, they do mark a greater assertiveness on
 the part of the courts.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Chile's civilian judges are career officials, and
 most have served in the judiciary since before the
 present military government took power in 1973. Since
 1978 most violations of the present ban on political
 activity and most cases relating to alleged human
 rights abuses have been handled in the civilian court
 system. First instance jurisdiction for the prosecution
 of proscribed political activities lies with regular
 lower-level criminal courts, whose proceedings are
 conducted in accordance with Chile's civil code tradition.
 As throughout Latin America, there is no trial by
 jury; reliance is on the written record. In the criminal
 courts of first instance, a judge serves multiple
 functions: as prosecutor; as defense attorney, at
 times; and, ultimately, as the one who decides the
 innocence or guilt of the accused. These decisions
 may be appealed up to the supreme court.
 Arms control violations go before a military prosecutor;
 he carries out the investigation and then makes rec-
 ommendations to a military judge, who issues the decision.
 Appeals may be made to a military court of two civilian
 judges and three professional military judges and,
 in the last resort, to the supreme court. Defendants
 have the rights of any Chilean citizen before the
 law, including the right to legal counsel. Criticisms
 of the functioning of the courts focus not on their
 procedures, but, rather, on the general unwillingness
 of judges to assert a vigorously independent role
 or, with rare exceptions, to challenge effectively
 the legality of actions by the executive under emergency
 powers.
 The government issued a decree in February 1981 granting
 jurisdiction over attacks on government personnel
 to a military council of war acting under wartime
 procedures which limit defendants' rights. The decree
 was invoked in the case of self-described MIR terrorist
 Guillermo Rodriguez Morales, accused of ordering the
 killing of a CNI employee. Rodriguez was sentenced
 to life imprisonment but has appealed to the supreme
 court the procedures under which the council of war
 was held.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The 1981 constitution prohibits searches of the home
 and interception of private communications and documents
 except as determined by law. Provisions in the penal
 code require search warrants issued by either a judge
 
 
 373
 or military prosecutor for specific locations. In
 practice, however, such searches are carried out under
 a general order issued by the judge or prosecutor.
 Human rights organizations report that in a number
 of searches legal requirements, such as the display
 of a warrant, have not been observed by authorities.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 8 of the 1981 constitution states that: "Any
 action by an individual or group intended to propagate
 doctrines which are antagonistic to the family, or.
 which advocate violence or a concept of society, the
 state or the judicial order, of a totalitarian character
 or based on class warfare, is illegal and contrary
 to the institutional legal code of the republic."
 In curbing dissent, the government usually cites other
 more specific legal provisions and decrees outlawing
 Marxism and the advocacy of violent revolution.
 Among other things, article 24 of the transitory provisions
 of the 1981 constitution, like the 1925 constitution,
 gives the president authority to banish internally
 persons for up to three months without charges, court
 review or the right of appeal. In 1981, 60 individuals
 were internally exiled (compared to 106 in 1980),
 most to distant villages, for illegal political activities.
 Virtually all public meetings require prior approval
 of the local military zone commander. In practice,
 it is reported that permission is regularly denied
 when the subject is politically sensitive, although
 small opposition party meetings have generally been
 tolerated.
 The media are technically free from official prior
 censorship, but, in practice, the government informally
 and regularly advises publications and broadcasters
 when they are considered out of line with government
 policy. Thus, self-censorship is widely practiced,
 with most editors careful about the content of material,
 although articles critical of the government appear
 regularly in several leading publications. Using
 the broad executive powers of transitional article
 24 of the new constitution, the minister of interior
 can restrict coverage of acts of terrorism and of
 internal security cases, forbid publicity of private
 activities of government officials and prevent the
 publication or distribution of new periodicals.
 The government owns the only nationwide television
 network. Other stations are operated by universities
 and cover substantial parts of the country. While
 the directors of these television stations theoretically
 have autonomy, they use considerable discretion and
 do not permit criticism of the government. There
 are several periodicals and at least two radio stations
 critical of the regime; these give major voice to
 the opposition viewpoint. 'Non-Marxist" books and
 pamphlets critical of the government are permitted
 free circulation. Individuals distributing "subversive"
 (i.e., Marxist) literature are subject to arrest.
 The Inter-American Press Association continues to
 
 
 374
 note that there have been improvements in press freedom
 in Chile, but points out-that restrictions on new
 publications and on reporting of terrorist acts are
 inconsistent with full press freedom. Chile, predominantly
 a Catholic country, respects freedom of religion.
 A number of Protestant denominations and other sects
 are active. The Jewish community reports full freedom
 and tolerance.
 In 1979 the right to elect student government representatives
 was restored at the universities. Most rectors of
 the universities are military men. Vice rectors are
 university professionals. However, Chilean academics
 have protested a law passed in 1981 which virtually
 prohibits all political activity in the country's
 state-supported universities.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Chileans are free to leave their country. Some one
 million Chileans live abroad, principally for economic
 reasons. Over half this number have resided for many
 years in Argentina. In the judgment of international
 organizations dealing with refugees, the volume of
 skilled and unskilled workers returning to Chile now
 slightly exceeds the number leaving -- a reflection
 of the improvement in the Chilean economy.
 Many thousands fled Chile when the current government
 took power; hundreds sought asylum in foreign embassies,
 many others were convicted of internal security violations
 and had jail sentences commuted to exile. The government
 was eventually willing to grant safe conduct passes
 to people who obtained asylum and wanted to leave
 Chile.
 Government decrees require those who are exiled or
 who are considered to have left Chile illegally to
 file a petition with a Chilean consul, if they seek
 to return, and to promise to refrain from political
 activity. The interior ministry reviews all petitions
 and rejects those from people who are considered to
 have engaged in anti-government activities abroad.
 The government has released no current figures on
 petitions received, rejected, approved or pending
 but local representatives of international refugee
 organizations estimate the yearly number of returnees
 at 800-1,000 persons. In most cases the courts have
 upheld interior ministry decisions barring individuals
 from returning. In a small number of cases, the government
 has permitted barred individuals to return, generally
 for short periods and on humanitarian grounds.
 Chile has accepted a few refugees in recent years
 and makes regular, modest financial contributions
 to international organizations aiding refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Some portions of the 1981 constitution are currently
 in force. Many others, including provisions relating
 to politico-civic rights and protections, are deferred
 until 1989. President Pinochet has sole possession
 of the executive power. The junta has legislative
 authority, subject to presidential approval.
 
 
 Partisan political'activity is banned. In 1973 the
 government-dissolved the parties forming the Unidad
 Popular Political Front and all other Marxist parties.
 A 1977 decree law dissolved all remaining parties.
 There was universal suffrage in the September 1980
 plebiscite -(voting is required by law), which resulted
 .in approval of a new constitution as drafted by the
 government',and the continuation in office of President
 --Pinochet for'eight additional years.. Opposition elements,
 however, criticized the absence of-electoral registers
 or other acceptable safeguards.
 Notwithstanding.the formal ban on political activity,
 the non-Marxist parties are able to continue operating
 on-a limited but open basis. Some socialists and
 splinter leftist groups maneuver among themselves
 with government acquiescence. Communists who are
 found engaging in political activities are generally
 ,detained for violating the internal security code
 or the 1973 law prohibiting Marxist activity.
 Most trade union rights, suspended after the military
 takeover in 1973, were legalized in July 1979 by the
 "labor plan" (a series of decree laws forming a labor
 code), or its subsequent technical additions and revisions,
 although in many instances these rights are limited.
 The trade union movement had no practical input into
 the formulation of the labor plan or into its.subsequent
 . technical revisions.
 Trade union organizations normally can elect their
 leaders-instead of.having them appointed by the. government.
 In individual unions, however,.elections are not obligatory,
 -and in some instances appointed leaders have managed
 to defer elections despite rank-and-file sentiment
 to the contrary. As elections continue to be held,
 the number of appointed leaders is diminishing.
 Collective bargaining has resumed for the large majority
 of.private sector workers -- albeit in a somewhat
 restricted fashion. The scope of what can be bargained
 for has narrowed considerably to include only wages,
 benefits.paid in cash-or in kind and certain common
 conditions.of employment, such as safety. Workers
 are guaranteed their existing wage.and benefit package,
 plus any increase in .the consumer price index. For
 1981 the projected average real increase should be
 about nine percent.
 According to government statements, the civil service
 will be allowed to form associations rather than unions
 and will-not have.the right to bargain collectively
 or to strike. The maritime sector, initially excluded
 from the labor.:plan, was included in it with the promulgation
 of-special laws in June and September 1981 (seamen
 and dock workers, respectively). The dock workers
 national unions, as previously constituted, will disappear
 by. March 1982, .perhaps to be replaced by small independent
 unions established in individual private companies
 which will contract ship handling services.
 The government must publish a yearly list of "strategic"
 entities which are forbidden to strike but are allowed
 to bargain collectively. Approximately 30 were listed
 in 1980 and 1981. Most are public utilities, the
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 25
 
 
 376
 only major exception being the giant Chuquicamata
 copper mine. For these companies, failure to reach
 agreement during negotiations leads to binding arbitration.
 For workers who can bargain collectively and can strike,
 the right to strike is limited; after the 60th day
 of a strike, all striking workers are considered to
 have resigned their jobs. Also legal for the first
 time is management's ability to hire strikebreakers,
 an effective strike deterrent given the present high
 unemployment rate.
 There is no special grievance procedure system in
 Chile. With the 1981 abolition of the labor courts,
 labor cases are now handled by civil courts. Strikes
 are only permitted in the case of a failed collective
 negotiation.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 In July 1978 the government allowed members of a special
 ad hoc working group of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC) to conduct a long-delayed visit
 to Chile. Although the group subsequently disbanded,
 a special rapporteur was tasked to submit human rights
 reports on Chile to the commission and to the United
 Nations General Assembly. The Chilean government
 has officially communicated to United Nations authorities
 yearly since 1979 its objection to, and refusal to
 cooperate with, continuing special consideration of
 Chile by the UNHRC under ad hoc procedures, such as
 the use of a rapporteur, contending that these measures
 have no legal or moral validity.
 The Intergovernmental Committee for Migration has
 been active in Chile, conducting a program giving
 convicted political prisoners an opportunity to serve
 out their sentences in exile. The government cooperated
 in making this program possible. Counting all categories
 of refugees, the committee has moved some 20,000 people
 out of Chile since the 1973 coup.
 Amnesty International, the Lawyer's Committee for
 International Human Rights and other non-governmental
 organizations have expressed special concern over
 Chile. During 1981 the first two organizations issued
 reports alleging a relative increase in human rights
 violations in Chile and criticizing the government
 for its failure to protect the rights of detainees
 or people who have disappeared. Although the government
 contends that virtually all of the reports produced
 by these foreign organizations exaggerate the scope
 and volume of abuses, it has permitted visits by their
 representatives.
 The Catholic church, along with the representatives
 of several other religious communities, has taken
 the lead in defending human rights and implementing
 social action programs. This has resulted in visible
 tensions between the government and the church, and
 disagreement with the church position by more conservative
 Catholics. Church activists and human rights lawyers
 have been anonymously threatened.
 
 
 377
 The Chilean Commission for Human Rights, now three
 years old, has also publicized abuses and spoken out
 strongly against them. It and the other human rights
 groups operate openly, albeit cautiously, in Chile.
 Some members have experienced harassment in the form
 of arrests and searches and, in August, the Human
 Rights Commission president, Jaime Castillo, was expelled
 from Chile, allegedly for political activity. A group
 of six alleged members of the proscribed Christian
 Left (Izquierda Cristiana) political organization, arrested
 in December, included two Human Rights Commission
 officials.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Government intervention in the economy reached a peak
 during the Allende years (1971-1973) with disastrous
 economic results that helped bring about military
 intervention in 1973. The major economic policy changes
 implemented by the present government included opening
 up the economy to foreign competition by lowering
 tariffs in steps to a basic level of ten percent;
 selling hundreds of nationalized companies to the
 private sector and requiring those companies remaining
 under state control to operate competitively without
 subsidies; ending price controls and many cumbersome
 government regulations; eliminating the fiscal deficit;
 overhauling the tax system; liberalizing capital flows;
 and granting foreign investment the same treatment
 as domestic capital and permitting liberal profit
 remittances.
 From 1976 to 1980, real gross domestic product (GDP)
 growth averaged more than seven percent per year,
 considerably above the historical average. In 1979
 per capita GNP. was estimated at $1,690. In 1981 real
 growth is expected to be about five percent, despite
 the international economic slowdown. At the same
 time, inflation has been brought down to an estimated
 9.5 percent for 1981. By the end of 1980, real wages
 had more than doubled from the low average of 1973.
 The official umemployment rate, of about 9.5 percent
 in Santiago for the last quarter of 1981, is down
 from 19.6 percent at the bottom of the 1975-76 depression.
 Chile's free market-oriented economic policies establish
 a subsidiary role for the state, which has declared
 the elimination of "extreme poverty" to be a primary
 socio-economic objective. This goal was made more
 difficult by the austerity measures imposed in 1975
 and by the government's determination to reduce the
 size of the public sector. Since then, the level
 of social expenditures has recovered. In 1980, 53.4
 percent of total government expenditure was devoted
 to social programs, $268 per capita, the highest figure
 (in constant dollars) in Chilean history. About 58
 percent of the 1981 budget has been allocated to social
 programs. indirect (off budget) subsidization is
 generally frowned upon within the context of the market
 economic model. Nevertheless, tariff structures for
 public utilities like electricity, water and bottled
 gas are structured progressively so that the smaller
 quantities consumed by the poor are cheaper. Similarly,
 rents on inexpensive housing are legally restricted
 to no more than 11 percent of assessed valuation.
 Estimates of Chileans living under conditions of "extreme
 poverty" range from 13.6 to 23 percent of the population.
 
 
 378
 Health and nutrition programs have reduced malnutrition
 in the infantile population treated under the national
 health service (some one million children under six
 years of age), from 15.4 percent in 1975 to 12.2 percent
 in 1979, and, in the incidence of advanced malnutrition,
 from 0.7 percent to 0.2 percent. This improvement
 stems, in part, from government food programs, the
 establishment of new nursery schools and nutrition
 classes for parents. By 1979, 84 percent of the population
 had access to safe water. There also has been a steady
 decline in infant mortality from 79.3 per thousand
 live births in 1970 to an estimated 27 in 1981, and
 in maternal mortality at childbirth from 1.68 to 0.73
 per thousand live births over the period 1970-79.
 From 1970 to 1979 the overall death rate per thousand
 declined from 8.9 to 6.8, and average life expectancy
 increased from 63.2 to 66.9 years.
 The social security system which was, by all accounts,
 inequitable, in 1981 underwent a major government
 overhaul. This involved the re-structuring of social
 security contributions to the various semi-public
 pension funds to conform to benefits received, and
 the institution of private pension and health care
 systems. Participation in the new, private plan becomes
 compulsory for new entrants to the labor force after
 1982. Pension contributions are paid to a private,
 government regulated pension fund administrator who
 invests the capital on behalf of the individual contributor.
 Except for a minimum pension (currently about $95/month)
 guaranteed by the government against all circumstances,
 pension benefits are ultimately tied to overall economic
 performance. An individual's contribution for health
 services may be made to a private institution or the
 government health service. The government maintains
 that the element of choice insures private medical
 services as good as or better than those available
 through government health services.
 The government has increased funding for all levels
 of education, particularly to pre-primary, primary
 and intermediate levels.   Although universities still
 receive by far the greater subsidy per student, current
 policy is designed to reduce the extent of subsidization
 for the small, generally less needy, university segment
 of the population. A government loan program was
 instituted in 1981 to help finance individual students'
 university education.
 Housing construction reached a high point of 50,000
 units annually in late 1980, but it will have to rise
 considerably if the government's commitment to the
 construction of 900,000 units by the end of the decade
 is to be met.
 Despite Chile's high literacy rate and high primary
 school enrollment ratios, the average number of years
 of school attended is 4.7. Government programs are
 attempting to improve this average by linking special
 family welfare payments for the children of the poor
 to their school attendance. Programs for adult education
 have been augmented with particular emphasis on literacy
 (in 1970, the adult literacy rate was 88 percent).
 In 1980 a new literacy campaign was instituted with
 the objective of bringing literacy to 400,000 persons
 over a tive-year period and providing 150,000 adults
 with additional primary education. Public education
 is now being decentralized through the transfer of
 federal educational institutions to municipal governments.
 At the same time, tuition-free private (mostly Catholic)
 schools have received increased government financial
 support.
