 FRANCE
 France is a constitutional democracy with a directly elected President and Na-
 tional Assembly and an independent judiciary.
 The law enforcement and internal security apparatus consists of a Gendarmerie,
 national police, and municipal police forces in major cities, all of which are under
 effective civilian control.
 The highly developed, diversified, and primarily market-based economy provides
 residents with a high standard of living.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Ra-
 cially motivated attacks by extremists doubled, from 207 in 1994 to 454 in 1995 (lat-
 est available data). The Government has taken important steps to combat violence
 against women and children. Women continue to face wage discrimination. A series
 of apparently politically motivated terrorist bombings killed over a dozen persons in
 Corsica.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Fxtrqfudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials.
 Law enforcement officers have in the past used excessive force-particularly di-
 rected against immigrants-resulting in deaths, but there is no evidence of a pat-
 tern of such abuses.-In February a Paris court found a police officer guilty of invol-
 untary homicide in the 1993 death of Makome M'Bowole, a 17-year-old youth from
 Zaire shot during an interrogation at a Paris police station. Judges sentenced the
 officer to 8 years in prison, the longest sentence ever given to a police officer con-
 victed of this crime. In May in a case involving the 1993 shooting death of 17-year-
 old Rachid Ardjouni, the Court of Appeal reduced the sentence imposed against a
 police officer found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Amnesty International criti-
 cized the court's dedsion to expunge the conviction from the officer's criminal record,
 permitting him to continue to serve as a police officer carrying a firearm. Judicial
 and administrative inquiries have also been opened by the Government into the
 1995 shooting death of 8-year-old Serbian refugee Todor Bogdanovic. Border police
 in the Bogdanovic case have been accused of using excessive force in attempting to
 halt a convoy of refugees who ran a border check point. The judicial inquiry into
 the December 1993 shooting and killing of 19-year-old Algerian Mourad Tchier by
 a police officer near Lyon continued at year's end. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on
 Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary executions, in a 1996 report, cited the Tchier
 case in expressing his concern over what he characterized as the increasing use of
 excessive force by law enforcement officers. A judicial inquiry into the January 1994
 death of an 18-year-old Algerian youth, Ibrahim Sy, shot by a gendarme near
 Rouen, continued at year's end.
 Reza Mazoulman, an Iranian Deputy Education Minister under the Shah, was
 shot and killed in Paris in May. Two Iranian nationals are suspected in the shoot-
 ing: One is being held in Germany awaiting extradition to France; the other is sus-
 pected of having fled to Iran.
 In six cases, extreme rightwing youths attacked and killed members of minority
 ethnic groups (see Section 5).
 
 
 938
 In Corsica there were over a dozen killings and an average of one bombing a day,
 some of which were politically motivated.
 On December 3, an apparently politically motivated terrorist bombing in the Paris
 Metro killed 2 people and injured 97. A third bombing victim died from his wounds
 a few days later.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices and the authorities punish officials who employ
 them. However, there were credible reports that law enforcement officers used ex-
 cessive force, particularly against immigrants. Isolated instances of police mis-
 conduct occurred, but there is no evidence of a pattern of such abuses.
 Three Marseille police officers have been suspended and charged with illegal de-
 tention, premeditated assault, and theft in the 1995 beating of Algerian/French na-
 tional Sid Ahmed Amiri. The officers have been released on bail pending trial. In
 January an officer of the intervention squad of the French anticrirmial brigade was
 given a 4-month prison sentence (which was suspended) and fined for the 1994 as-
 sault and battery against Didier la Rouche. In 1995 an officer in the border police
 was sentenced in Nice to 24 months' imprisonment with 16 months suspended, for
 the 1993 sexual assault of Moufida Ksouri, a French citizen of Tunisian origin. The
 Government has also opened an administrative inquiry into allegations that Tahi-
 tian trade union leader Hiro Tefaareve and 15 others were arrested and beaten in
 1995 by members of the Gendarmerie Nationale following protests over the resump-
 tion of French nuclear testing in the Pacific.
 Prison conditions generally exceed international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors. Most prisons provide opportunities for
 paid employment as well as recreational facilities. In a report released in January
 the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture criticized overcrowding and
 unhygiemc conditions in Paris' municipal jail cells. In its 1995 report, the French
 organization, "International Observer of Prisons (IOP)" noted an increasing number
 of deaths in detention attributable to neglectful surveillance and supervision. In one
 case, a prison guard was charged and he d pending trial for not assis ting an inmate
 who was being assaulted by four other prisoners. The report also criticized over-
 crowding in some prisons and a record number of 107 inmate suicides in 1995 (at-
 est available data). OP also observed that the promise of greater access to health
 care for prisoners offered by the passage of 1994 legislation has not been realized,
 because most prisons have delayed application of needed reforms.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exdie.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 In narcotica trafficking convictions, courts often assess a customs fine based on
 the estimated street value of the drugs, in addition to a jail sentence. At the end
 of their jail terms, prisoners who cannot pay the fine are detained for up to 2 years
 while customs officials attempt to reach the largest possible settlement. This prac-
 tice has been criticized by the-European Court of Justice.
 A 1994 case continues against 6 of 26 resident non-French Muslims detained by
 police on suspicion of supporting Algerian terrorists. Twenty of the detainees had
 been deported after severalweek~s' detention.
 There are no provisions for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this prvision in practice.
 The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. There is
 a system of local courts, 35 regional courts of appeal, and the highest criminal court,
 the Court of Cassation, which considers appeals on procedural grounds only.
 There were no reports of poitical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, and the Government respects these right in practice. An independent press,
 an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to en-
 sure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 In August the elected Mayor of Orange in southern France, a member of the far-
 righat  a  l Ft (FN) political party, used his police powers to halt the distribu-
 tion of anti-FN literature in Orange. The measures taken by the Mayor were
 premptly suspended by an administrative tribunal. A few weeks later, another
 mayor in the town of La Grande-Motte (also in southern France) again temporarily
 suspended the distribution of anti-FN literature just before the start of a 1-week FN
 
 
 939
 
 convention. This action was also promptly suspended. There have been other re-
 ported incidents of similar efforts to suppress anti-FN speech.
 In November a criminal court sentenced two singers to 3 to 6 months in prison
 and imposed a 6-month ban on their performing. The charges stemmed from a 1995
 concert where the group "NTM7 performed a song in which they advocated the mur-
 der of police officers. At year's end, neither singer had begun serving a jail sentence,
 since their cases were under appeal.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for separation of church and state, and
 the Government respects this right in practice.
 The State subsidizes private schools, including those that are church-affiliated.
 Central or local governments also own and provide upkeep for other religious build-
 ings cor    edfore 1905, the date of the law separating church andstate. Cul-
 tural associations with religious affliations may also _quah   for government sub-
 sidies. Contrary to practice in the rest of France, the Jewishi, Lutheran, Reformed,
 and Roman Catholic religions in three departments of Alsace and Lorraine enoy
 special legal status. Adherents of these four religions may choose to have a portion
 of their income tax allocated to their church in a system administered by the central
 Government.
 Debate continues over whether denying some Muslim girls the right to wear
 headcarves in public schools constitutes a violation of the right to pracice their re-
 ligion. In 1989 the highest administrative court ruled that the "ostentatious" wear-
 ing of these headcarves violated a law prohibiting proselytizing in schools. After
 much media attention--mainly unfavorable--to the wearing of such headscarves, in
 1994 the Ministry of Education issued a directive that prohibits the wearing of "os-
 tentatious political and religious symbols" in schools. The directive does not specify
 the "symbls" in question, leaving school administrators considerable authority to
 do so. The highest administrative court affirmed in 1995 that simply wearing a
 headscarf does not provide grounds for exclusion from school.
 In 1995 the higest admistrative court ruled that Jewish students could be ex-
 cused from attending classes on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. The court said that
 a 1991 law laying out the rights and responsibilities of students in public schools
 could not be used to prevent authorized absence from school for religious worship
 or the celebration of a religious holiday.
 In November a former leader of the Scientologists in Lyon was convicted of invol-
 untary homicide and fraud, sentenced to 18 months in prison, and fined about
 $100,000. The charges stemmed from a 1988 suicide of one of the church's members.
 The court found that the psychological pressure by the Scientologists caused the
 member's suicide, but    c     scall avoided ruling on the issue of whether Scientelogy
 is a religion. Other Scientologists were also convicted of fraud related to this inci-
 dent, fined, and given susponded sentences. The convictions are being appealed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 atriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 Frane provides first asylum and provided it to a   dproximately 17,200 persons in
 1996. The Government cooperates with the United ations High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humantarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no
 reports orofoe   tro    persons to a country where they fearedpersecution.
 The pace of deportations of tegal aliens has increased, with reportedly double the
 number of charter flights returning illegal aliens to their homelands, compared with
 the previous year. In July and Augat, approximately 300 undocumented aliens oc-
 cupied St. Bernard's Church in  aria, proe sting against toughened immigration
 laws and asking to be allowed to remain in France. Ten staged a hunger at ve. Ul-
 timately, the Government forcibly entered the church and arrested the rotestors,
 drawing praise and criticism from different sectors of political opinion. More than
 a dozen of the protestors were deported, but m     ot were released within a few days
 of their arrest and remain at liserty while their individual cases are considered.
 There is no evidence that those deported had valid claims of refugee or legal status
 in France. In fact, at one point, the Government had reviewed the files of the St.
 Bernard protesters and authorized 48 of them to remain, primarily those with
 French citizen children.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right s Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to peacefully change their gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 
 
 940
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics or govern-
 ment, but they remain significantly underrepresented in public offices, especially at
 the national level. Four of 32 cabinet members, 18 of 321 Senators, and 32 of 577
 Deputies in the National Assembly are women. To increase women's participation,
 some parties have established quotas for them on electoral lists or in party manage-
 ment.
 The citizens of the "collective territory" of Mayotte and the territories of French
 Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia determine their legal and politi-
 cal relationships to France by means of referendums, and they elect Deputies and
 Senators to the French Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights organizations operate free-
 ly, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government
 officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. The National Con-
 sultative Commission on Human Rights (NCCHR)-which has nongovernmental as
 well as government members-also monitors complaints and advises the Govern-
 ment on policies and legislation. It is an independent body in the Office of the Prime
 Minister.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or po-
 litical opinion, and the Government effectively enforces them.
 Women.-The penal code prohibits abuse as well as violence against women. Wife
 beating is a felony. The penalty for rape ranges from 5 to 20 years in prison, with
 no differentiation between spousal and other rape. There were 6,540 reported rapes
 or sexual assaults in 1995 (latest available data). Some 15,700 incidents of wife
 beating (including 98 which resulted in death) were reported to police in 1993 (latest
 available data). The Government offers shelter, ounseling, and financial assistane,
 and operates a telephone hot line. The welcome centers or battered women added
 500 staff members in 1995. About 60 private associations also help battered women.
 While the law requires that women receive equal pay for equal work, this require-
 ment is often not the reality. A 1994 study (latest available data) found a mean dis-
 crepancy between wages o women and men of 20 percent in the private sector and
 18 percent in the public sector. The same study found that the unemployment rate
 for women averaged about 4 points higher than that for men. The law prohibits sex-
 based job discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. Thus far these
 laws have encountered difficulties in implementation. Women s rights groups criti-
 cize the scope of the law as narrow, and the fines and compensatory damages as
 often modest. For example, the law limits sexual harassment claims to cir-
 cumstances where there is a supervisor-subordinate relationship, but fails to ad-
 dress harassment by colleagues or a hostile work environment.
 Children.--The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. The Ministry for Family Affairs oversees implementation of the government's
 programs for children. There are strict laws against child abuse, particularly when
 committed by a parent or guardian. In 1994 (latest available data) there were
 15,000 reported cases of mistreatment (physical violence, sexual abuse, mental cru-
 elty, or severe negligence) against children. Special sections of the national police
 and judiciary are c arged with handling these cases. The Government provides
 counseling, financial aid, foster homes, and orphanages, depending on the extent of
 the problem. Various associations also help minors seek justice in cases of mistreat-
 ment by parents.
 Some immigrants from countries where female genital mutilation (FGM) is cus-
 tomary subject their children to this practice, which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. The
 authorities have prosecuted some cases involving FGM ant have undertaken a cam-
 paignto inform imirants that FM is ontrary to the law and will be prosecuted.
 People With Dibiits.-There is no disciation against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the prvision of other state services. The Government
 announced several measures in 1995 to boost employment opportunities for the dis-
 abled. A 1991 law requires new public buildings to be accessible to the physically
 disabled, but most older buildings and public transportation are not accessible.
 Religious Minoritis.-The annual NC      report (see Section 4) released in
 March noted a 50 percent decrease in the number of threats or attacks against
 Jews, from 169 in 1994 to78 in 1995 (latest available data). However, in July a
 
 
 941
 
 former skinhead and neo-Nazi group member confessed to the 1990 desecration of
 a Jewish cemetery in the southeastern city of Carpentras. The Government is vigor-
 ously prosecuting those responsible, but the revelation of neo-Nazi involvement in
 this incident, in which 34 Jewish tombs were vandalized and freshly buried corpses
 unearthed and impaled, has further contributed to the perception that racist/anti-
 Semitic violence is a serious problem.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoritics.-Anti-immigrant sentiments sparked inci-
 dents including occasional attacks by skinhead on members of the large ArablMus-
 Urn and black African ommunities. The annual NCCHR report noted hat racist at-
 tacks and threats had doubled in 1 year, from 207 in 1994 to 454 in 1995 (latest
 available data). The number of deaths attributed by the NCCHR to racist anti-immi-
 grant violence increased from two deaths in 1994 to six deaths in 1995 (latest avail-
 able data). The racial attacks that resulted in deaths include the following cases.
 Three FN youths await trial in the 1995 killing in Marseille of Ibrahim All, a 17-
 year-old shot in the back when FN youths opened fire on a dozen Comoriens during
 a political rally. Three skinheads have been arrested and still await trial for the
 1995 death of Brahim Bouraam, a young Moroccan bystander pushed off a auay
 during another FN political rally. Another skinhead was arrested for theft in May
 1995 and confessed that one of his friends had killed a Tunisian in April 1995 in
 Le Havre, by throwing him into the harbor. In May 1995, an FN militant stabbed
 an Algerian to death after an altercation in Cherbourg. Another right-wing militant
 awaits trial for beating to death a North African immigrant in September 1995 in
 Bayonne.
 The Government strongly condemns such actions and attacks, has strict
 antidefamation laws, and prosecutes perpetrators whenever possible. Government
 programs attempt to combat racism and anti-Semitism by promoting public aware-
 ness and bringing together local officials, police, and citizen groups. There are also
 antiracist educational programs in some public school systems.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 for all workers. Trade unions exercise significant economic and political influence,
 although only about 10 percent of the work force is unionized. Unions have legally
 mandated roles (as do employers) in the administration of social institutions, includ-
 ing social security (health care and most retirement systems), the unemployment in-
 surance ystem, labor courts, and the economic and social council, a constitutionally
 mandated consultative body.
 Unions are independent of the Government, and most are not aligned with any
 political party. Many of the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor and its
 unions, however, be ong to the Communist Party. Unions can freely join federations
 and confederations, including international bodies.
 Workers, including civil servants, are free to strike except when a strike threatens
 public safety. One-fourth of all salaried employees work for the Government: Strikes
 m the public sector tend to be fairly numerous and receive extensive media cov-
 erage. nMay an estimated 7,000 workers demonstrated nationwide to demand a
 shorter workweek without a reduction in pay. In June an estimated 14,000 workers
 demonstrated nationwide to protest government-proposed cutbacks in public sector
 jobs and services. An estimated 150,000 workers joined a nationwide strike on Octo-
 ber 17 to protest government austerity reforms expected to result in especially large
 cuts in education, defense, communications, and aviation. In October journalists also
 staged a day-Ion strike to protest a government roposal to repeal a tax exemption
 for journalists.  12-day trckers' strike in late November to  emand early retire-
 ment, a shorter workweek, and pay increases caused serious disruptions in highway
 and port traffic and in gasoline supplies nationwide.
 The law prohibits retaliation against strikers and strike leaders, and the Govern-
 ment effectively enforces this provision.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Coectively-Workers, including those in
 the three small export processing zones, have the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively. The law stricty prohibits antiunion discrimination; employers found guilty
 of such activity are required to correct it, including the reinstatement of workers
 fired for union activities.
 1982 law requires at least annual bargaining in thepublic and private sector
 on wages, hours, and working conditions at both plant and indutry levels but does
 not require that negotiations result in a signed contract. In case of an impasse, gov-
 ernment mediators may impose solutions that are binding unless formally rejected
 by either aide within a week. If no new agreement can be reached, the contract from
 the previous year remains valid. Over 90 percent of the private sector work force
 is covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated at national or local levels.
 
 
 Trilateral consultations (unions, management, and government) also take place on
 such subjects as the minimum wage, temporary work, social security, and unem.
 ployment benefits. Labor tribunals, composed of worker and employer representa-
 tive are available to resolve complaints.
 The law requires businesses with more than 50 employees to establish a works
 council, through which workers are consulted on training, working conditions, profit-
 sharing, and similar issues. Works councils, which are open to both union and non-
 union employees, are elected every 2 years.
 The Constitution's provisions for trade union rights extend to Frances overseas
 departments and territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and the Government effectively enforces this provision. In its 1993
 report, however, the International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts
 (COE) questioned the French practice of obliging prisoners to work for private enter-
 pises at less than the national minimum wage. In 1995 the Government officially
 responded to the COE, poiting out that prisoners participate in a work program
 on a voluntary-nt a mandatory-basis, tat more prisoners request work tan can
 be accommodated, and that the work is designed to prepare prisoners for reentry
 into the labor force.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-With a few exceptions for those
 enrolled in certain apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Generally, work considered arduous or work between the hours of 10
 p.m. and 5 a.m. may not be performed by minors under age 18. Laws prohibiting
 child employment are effectively enforced through periodic checks by labor inspec-
 tors, who have the authority to take employers to court for noncompliance with the
 law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The administratively determined minimum
 wage, revised whenever the cost-of-living index rises 2 percentage points, is suffi-
 cient to prvide a decent standard of living for a worker and famly. The wage was
 changed to $7.23 (F 37.91) per hour as of July 1.
 _The legal workweek is 39 hours, with a minimum break of 24 hours per week.
 Overtime is restricted to 9 hours per week.
 The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility for policing occupational health
 and safety laws. Standards are high and effectively enforced. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations. The law requires each
 enterprise with 50 or more employees to establish an occupational health and safety
 committee. Over 75 prent of all enterprises, covering more than 75 percent of all
 employees, have fully functioning health and safety committees.
