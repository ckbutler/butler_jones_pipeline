 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a longstanding, stable, constitutional democracy with a unicameral
 Legislative Assembly directly elected in free multiparty elections every 4 years. Jose
 Maria Figueres of the National Liberation Party won the presidency in the February
 1994 elections, in which approximately 80 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. The
 Government respects constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished the military forces. The Ministry of Public Secu-
 rity-which includes the Border Guard, the Rural Guard, and the antidrug police-
 and the Ministry of the Presidency share responsibility for law enforcement and na-
 tional security. The Judicial Police, under the Supreme Court, conduct investiga-
 tions, while the San Jose Metropolitan Police and the Transit Police within the Min-
 istry of Public Works and Transportation also have limited police powers. Public se-
 curity forces generally observe procedural safeguards established by law and the
 Constitution.
 The market-based economy is based primarily on agriculture, light industry, and
 tourism. The pace of economic growth slowed from a 2.5 percent increase in 1995
 to a rojected rise of 1 to 1.5 percent in 1996. The Government also faced a growing
 ricdeficit in 1995 equivalent to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). De-
 spite several tax increases in 1995, the projected public sector deficit for 1996 was
 equivalent to 3 percent of GDP. The Constitution protects the right to own private
 property; however, domestic and foreign property owners encounter difficulty gain-
 ing adequate, timely compensation for lands expropriated for national parks and
 those set aside for indigenous people or invaded by squatters.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of individual rights and freedoms. The Government
 fully respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide
 effective means of dealing with instances of abuse of individual rights. Nonetheless,
 the judicial system moves very slowly in processing criminal cases, resulting in
 lengthy pretrial detention for some suspects. There were two reported instances of
 physical abuse by police. The Government has identified domestic violence as a seri-
 ous problem and sponsored a public awareness program to deter such abuse. Abuse
 of children also remains a problem. Traditional patterns of unequal opportunity for
 women and racial minorities remain, in spite of continuing government and media
 efforts to advocate change.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 Although labor demonstrations in August in the port of Limon were peaceful, the
 police used tear gas to disperse a rock-throwing crowd that had barricaded a road
 
 
 408
 near Limon. The use of tear gas resulted in injuries and the death of an asthmatic
 woman asphyxiated in a nearby house.
 The 1992 "Cobra Command" case was finally resolved. A court convicted 3 former
 members of the Cobra Command-a now-defunct antinarcotics unit of the Rural
 Guard-for the 1992 murder of 2 suspected drug traffickers, the rape of 2 indige-
 nous women, and the illegal detention and harassment of 11 indigenous people.
 These crimes occurred during an unsuccessful search for marijuana plantations in
 the Talamanca region. The court cleared eight former members of the unit of all
 criminal charges- the authorities could not locate one former member. The court
 sentenced two o? the three guilty Cobra Command members to terms of 42 years
 and 32 years, for rape, murder, and illegal detention. The third was sentenced to
 5 years for rape.
 At the end of the year, the three policemen accused in the 1994 Ciro Monge case
 and the seven accused in the 1993 Malcom case remained free on bail and awaiting
 trial. The authorities scheduled the trial in the Ciro Monge case for September 1997
 but had not set a date for the other trial.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and holds invalid any state-
 ment obtained through violence. The authorities generally abide by these prohibi-
 tions. An effective mechanism for lodging and recording complaints of police mis-
 conduct exists. In 1995, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 1,262
 cases of police abuse of authority or misconduct were reported. The Ombudsman's
 office investigates complaints and, where appropriate, initiates suits against offi-
 cials. In August the authorities charged three police officers with false arrest as a
 result of a January 1994 complaint brought by the Ombudsman himself. According
 to the complaint, the officers arrested the Ombudsman after he had questioned the
 conduct of one of the officers at the scene of a traffic accident. The courts sentenced
 the three officers to 3 years in prison for false arifest, but suspended the sentences
 and put them on 5 years' probation and imposed a 6-month prohibition from public
 or private security employment.
 In January a man accused three Rural Guard members of intimidating a woman
 and threatening to shoot him when he tried to help her. At year's end, the authori-
 ties were investigating the case and had suspended the three policemen. In March
 a Nicaraguan complained to authorities that three policemen had beaten and ille-
 gally detained him earlier that month. In this case the authorities also suspended
 the accused policemen and were investigating the case.
 A large percentage of police personnel owe their appointments to political patron-
 age. The Figueres administration continued implementation of the 1994 Police Code
 designed to professionalize and depoliticize the police force. The Government's long-
 term plan is to establish permanent, professional cadres, eventually resulting in a
 nonpolitically appointed career force. The basic course for new police recruits in-
 cludes training using a human rights manual developed by the Ministry of Public
 Security.
 Prisoners generally receive humane treatment. While guards rarely abuse pris-
 oners physically, there are credible reports that prisoners are sometimes subjected
 to other forms of abuse such as extortion. The Prison Rights Ombudsman inves-
 tigates complaints and refers serious cases of abuse to the Public Prosecutor. Peni-
 tentiary overcrowding is a growing problem, with the prison population about 83
 percent above planned capacity. filegal narcotics are readily available in the prisons,
 and drug use is common, In March the Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber
 issued an order to the San Sebastian prison in San Jose--at 123 percent over capac-
 ity the third most crowded prison in the country--giving the institution 1 year to
 achieve minimally acceptable conditions for the prisoners.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and law prohibit arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally respects these prohi-
 bitions.
 The law requires issuance of judicial warrants before making arrests. The Con-
 stitution entitles a detainee to a judicial determination of the legality of the deten-
 tion during arraignment before a court officer within 24 hours of arrest. The au-
 thorities generally respect these rights.
 The law provides for the right to release on bail, and the authorities observe it
 in practice. Generally, the authorities do not hold detainees incommunicado. With
 judicial authorization, the authorities may hold suspects for 48 hours after arrest
 or, under special circumstances, for up to 10 days.
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment.
 
 
 409
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution and law provide for an independ-
 ent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Constitu-
 tion provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary vigorously
 enforces this right.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts, known as tribunals.
 The Legilative Assembly elects the 22 Supreme Court Magistrates to 8-year terms,
 subject to automatic renewal unless the Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds
 majority. Accused persons may select attorneys to represent them, and the law pro-
 vides for access to counsel at state expense for the indigent.
 Persons accused of serious offenses and held without bail, however, sometimes re-
 main in pretrial custody for long periods. Lengthy legal procedures, numerous ap-
 peals, and large numbers of detainees cause delays and case backlogs. There were
 1,281 accused persons, representing 28 percent of the prison population, jailed
 awaiting trial as of Sptember
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction. The law re-
 quires judicial warrants to search private homes. Judges may approve use of wire-
 taps in limited circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 ent press, a generally effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political sys-
 tem combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic free-
 dor.
 There are 9 major privately owne newspapers, several periodicals, 6 privately
 owned television stations, andover 70 privately owned radio stations, all of which
 pursue indepondent editorial policies. While the media generally criticize the Gov-
 ernment freely, there were unconfirmed allegations that the Government withheld
 advertising from some publications in order to influence or limit reporting. The As-
 sembly passed a "right of response" law that provides persons criticized in the
 media an opportunity to reply with equal attention and at equal length. Critics
 charge that this law could have a chilling effect on press criticism of elected officials.
 The Office of Control of Public Spectacles rates films and has the authority to re-
 strict or prohibit their showing; it has similar powers over television programs and
 stage plays. Nonetheless foreign and particularly American films spanning the U.S.
 ratmg system are offered to the public. A tribunal reviews appeals of the office's ac-
 tions. In January the Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber ruled unconstitu-
 tional a 1989 decision by the office to prohibit public showing of the film "The Last
 Temptation of Christ." This ofim, and the graphic depiction of violence and sex in
 popular television and movies, have generated bested debate. In May over 70 promi-
 nent citizens, decrying ilolence, hate, and prnograph  in the mass media, signed
 a public letter to the President urging him to enfoe   Article 28 of the Constitution,
 which authorizes the prohibition of acts which "are harmful to morality or public
 order."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. While the Constitution establishes
 Roman Catholicism as the state religion, people of all denominations freely practice
 their religion without government interference. Foreign missionaries and clergy of
 all denominations work and jproselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. Ther are no restrictions on travel within the country, on
 emigration, or the right of return.
 There is a long tradition of providing refuge to people from other Latin American
 countries. In a controversial decision, the Government in March granted political
 asylum to former vice president of Ecuador Alberto Dahik. In October 1995 while
 still vice president, Dahik fled from Ecuador to Costa Rica to avoid arrest on
 charges of misuse of public funds. Dahik claimed the charges were fabricated by his
 ptieeies In   Jne  eGovernment   allowtt ed eneueanti c itzneusEsoa
 Uga to eter th   contry totpply to p   roitical asyl m. Ugaz, a memri  of the
 Boivarian Revolutionary Movement, had sought refuge in the Costa Rican embassy
 in Caracas, claiming persons with connections to the Venezuelan police had kid-
 
 
 naped and tortured him. By year's end, the Government had not yet reached a deci-
 sion in Ugaz' case.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Govern-
 ment makes a distinction between political asylum and refugee status; the issue of
 the provision of first asylum did not arise. The Constitution specifically prohibits re-
 patriation of anyone subject to potential persecution, and there were no reports of
 forced expulsion of persons to a country where they feared persecution. The authori-
 ties regularly repatriated undocumented Nicaraguans, most of whom entered the
 country primarily for economic reasons. In August nine Nicaraguans accused border
 police officials in Los Chiles of using undue force when repatriating them. The Gov-
 ernment is investigating the allegations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the rght to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through free and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot every 4 years. The inde-
 pendent Supreme Electoral Tribunal ensures the integrity of elections, and the au-
 thorities and citizens respect election results. The Constitution bars the President
 from seeking reelection, and Assembly members may seek reelection only after at
 least one term out of office. In the 1994 elections, President Figueres' National Lib-
 eration Party gained a plurality in the Legislative Assembly, winning 28 of 57 seats.
 The Social Christian Unity Party won 25 seats, the Democratic Force won 2 seats,
 and 2 provincial parties each garnered 1 seat. After an intraparty dispute, one of
 the Democratic Force legislators formed a new party in February. As a result, the
 Democratic Force now has one seat, and the new party-the New Democratic
 Party-has one seat.
 Women encounter no legal impediments to their participation in politics. While
 they are underrepresented in leadership positions o the Government and political
 parties, this situation has begun to change. A woman serves concurrently as Vice
 President and as a cabinet minister, another woman is Minister of Public Security.
 In addition, six vice ministers, nine Legislative Assembly members, and five direc-
 tors of autonomous institutions are women. In June the opposition Social Christian
 Unity Party reformed its statutes to mandate that a minimum of 40 percent of posts
 in party councils be occupied by women. Lorena Vasquez became the party's first
 female Secretary General. The ruling National Liberation Party is also considering
 statutory reforms to increase female participation in party decisionmaking.
 Indigenous people may participate freely in politics and government. In practice,
 they have not played significant roles in these areas, except on issues direct y affect-
 ing their welfare, largely because of their relatively small numbers and physical iso-
 lation. Costa Rica's 30,000 blacks, largely resident on the Caribbean coast, enjoy full
 rights of citizenship, including the protection of laws against racial discrimination.
 The Legislative Assembly includes one black member, one vice minister is black.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Various human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigat-
 ing and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are
 cooperative and responsive to their views. The Costa Rican Commission for Human
 Rights, the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America, and
 the Family and Friends of Political Prisoners of Costa Rica, monitor and report on
 human rights.
 Several international organizations concerned with human rights, including the
 Inter-American Institute for Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human
 Rights, are located in San Jose.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution pronounces all persons equal before the law, and the Govern-
 ment generally respects these provisions.
 Women.-The Government has identified domestic violence against women and
 children as a serious societal problem. The authorities have incorporated training
 on handling domestic violence cases in the basic training course for new police per-
 sonnel. In _April the Legislative.Assembly passed the Law Against Domestic Vio-
 lence, which classifies certain acts of domestic violence as crimes and mandates
 their prosecution. Previously, courts had sometimes treated such acts as mere in-
 fringements of the law and not serious enough to merit prosecution. The law re-
 quires public hospitals to report cases of female victims of domestic violence. Tele-
 
 
 411
 vision coverage of this issue has increased in news reporting, public service an-
 nouncements, and feature programs.
 Women constitute 49.5 percent of the population. The 1990 Law for the Promotion
 of the Social Equality of Women not oily prohibits discrimination against women
 but obligates the Government to promote political economic, social, and cultural
 equality. In March the Government's National (enter for the Development of
 Women and the Family presented its 3-year National Plan for Equality of Oppor-
 tunity between Women and Men. The plan is based in great measure on the Plat-
 form for Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.
 According to the 1993 census, 30 percent of working-age women earn wages out-
 side the home, ompared with 79 percent of workng-age men. One-fiM of al fami-
 lies depend primarly on the earnings of women. Most women work in the services
 sector, with others working in industry and agriculture. While laws require that
 women and men receive equalpay for equal work, average salaries for women re-
 main somewhat below those of male counterparts. Accordig to the 1995 report on
 human development prepared by the United Nations Development Program, women
 receive about 83 percent of the salary of men for equal work. The average life ex-
 pectancy for women increased by 12 years since the early 1970's to 77 years, higher
 than the 72-year average for men.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare through
 well-funded systems of public education and medical care.The Government spends
 more than 4 percent of GDP on education and over 5 percent on medical care. Ac-
 cordingly, the country has a high rate of literacy (94 percent) and a low rate of in-
 fant mortality (13.4 persons per 1,000). The law requires 6 years of primary and
 3 years of secondary education for all children. There is no difference m the treat-
 ment of girls and boys in education or in health care services. The autonomous Na-
 tional Institute for Chidrn (PANI) oversees implementation of the Governments
 progr   for children. The Catholic Church is building a home both for teenage
 mothers and for children with AIDS, which the Church will operate with help from
 the PA I.
 In recent years, the PAN has increased public awareness of crimes against chil-
 dren. In the first 6 months of 1995, the most recent year for which statistics are
 available, the Institute intervened in 3,800 cases of abandonment, 1,158 cases of
 physical abuse, 1,318 cases of sexual abuse, and 116 cases of psychological abuse
 of children. Abuses appear to be more prevalent among impoverished, less-educateda
 families. Traditional attitudes and the inclination to treat such crimes as mis-
 demeanors sometimes hamper legal proceedings against those who commit crimes
 against children.
 In February the PAMI announced a comprehensive plan to improve the conditions
 of the poorest children. According to Institute estimates, 17 percent of children be-
 tween the ages of 5 and 17 are involved in incme-producing activities, and 25,000
 childrenwork rather than attend school. The Government, lice sources,and rep-
 resentatives of the United Nations Children Fund acknowledge that child prostitu-
 tion is a growing problem but say the exact magnitude of the problem is a yetun-
 determined. Official sources assert that unofficial studies which estimate tat from
 2,000 to 3,000 children are involved in prostitution in San Jose are "not scientif-
 ically verified."
 People With Disabiities.In May the Law of Eual Opportunity for Persons with
 Disabilities went into effect. It prohibits discrimination, provides for health care
 services, and mandates provision of access to buildings for persons with disabilities.
 A number of public and private institutions have made individual efforts to improve
 access.
 Indigenous People-The population of about 3.3 million includes nearly 29,000 in-
 digenous pople among 8 ethnic groups. Most live in traditional communities on 22
 reserves which because of their remote location, often lack access to schools, health
 care, electricit, and potable water. The Government, through the National Indige-
 nous Commission, completed distribution of identification cards to facilitate access
 to public medical facilities. The Government also built a medical clinic and several
 community health cen eters in indigenous areas. The Ombudsman has established an
 office to investigate violations   of he  tof indigenous people.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law specifiesthe right of workers to join unions
 of their choosing without prior authorization, although barners exi  m practi o.
 About 15 percent of the work force is unionized, almost entirely in the public sector.
 Unions operate independently of government control.
 Some trade union leaders contend that "solidarity" associations, in which employ-
 ers provide access to credit unions and savings plans in return for agreement to
 
 
 avoid strikes and other types of confrontation, infringe upon the right of association.
 After the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Associa-
 tion ruled that solidarity associations and their involvement in trade union activi-
 ties violated freedom of association, the Government amended the Labor Code in
 1993. The following year, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE) ruled that these and
 other planned changes fostered greater freedom of association. In 1995 the COE en-
 couraged the Government to approve legislation to allow unions to administer com-
 pensation funds for dismissed workers and to repeal labor code provisions restrict-
 ing the right to strike in certain nonessential public, agricultural, and forestry sec-
 tors. This recommendation remained under government consideration at year's end.
 There are no restrictions on the right of private sector workers to strike, but very
 few workers in this sector belong to unions. Accordingly, p rivate sector strikes rare-
 ly occur. The Constitution and Labor Code restrict the right of public sector workers
 to strike. In August stevedores and other workers from Lion province staged sev-
 eral work stoppages and protests to protest lowered wages, lack of work, and insuffi-
 cient infrastructure. In September the Government signed an agreement with the
 activist group "Struggling Limon" to address the needs of this area, site of the coun-
 try's principal rt.
 Unions may form federations and confederations and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right to organize. Specific provisions of the 1993 labor code reforms provide protec-
 tion from dismissal for union organizers and members during union formation. The
 revised provisions require employers found guilty of discrimination to reinstate
 workers lired for union activities.
 Public sector workers cannot engage in collective bargaining because the Public
 Administration Act of 1978 makes labor law inapplicable in relations between the
 Government and its employees. Private sector umons have the legal right to engage
 in collective bargaining.
 All labor regulations apply fully to the country's nine export processing zones
 (EPZs). The Labor Ministry oversees labor regulations within the EPZ's, but ac-
 knowledged that it has only 1 inspector for every 30,000 workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no known instances of such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution provides special
 employment protection for women and children and establishes the minimum work-
 ing age at 12 years, with special regulations in force for workers under the age of
 15 Children between 15 and 18 years of age can work a maximum of 7 hours daily
 and 42 hours weekly, while children between the ages of 12 and 15 can work a max-
 imum of 5 hours daily and 30 hours weekly. The PANI, in cooperation with the
 Labor Ministry, effectively enforces these regulations in the formal sector. After two
 adolescents died from chemical poisoning while working on banana plantations in
 1993, the authorities prohibited employment of youths under the age of 18 in the
 banana industry. Nonetheless, child labor remains an integral part of the large in-
 formal economy. According to a PANI survey, about 152,000 children worked during
 1995, of whom nearly 93,000 had prior PANI approval.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides for a minimum
 wage. A National Wage Council, composed of three members each from government,
 business, and labor, sets minimum wage and salary levels for all sectors. Monthly
 minimum wages, last adjusted in July for the private sector, range from $122
 (25,636 colones) for domestic servants to $591 (124,255 colones) for certain profes-
 sionals. Public sector negotiations, based on private sector minimum wages, nor-
 eally follow the settlement of private sector negotiations. The Ministry of Labor ef-
 fectively enforces minimum wages in the San Jose area, but less effectively in rural
 areas. Worker with families at the lower end of the wage scale, as well as those
 in the middle class, encounter difficulty in keeping up with the rising cost of living.
 The Constitution sets workday hours, overtime remuneration, days of rest, and
 annual vacation rights. Although often circumvented in practice, it also requires
 compensation for discharge without due cause. Generally, workers may work a max-
 imum of 8 hours during the day and 6 at night, up to weekly totals of 48 and 36
 hours, respectively. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime premium of 50 per-
 cent of regular wages for work in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural work-
 ers do not receive overtime, however, if they voluntarily work beyond their normal
 hours. Little evidence exists that employers coerce employees to perform such over-
 time.
 For several years, the ILO COE asked the Government to enact provisions regard-
 ing accident prevention for seafarers, as required by ILO Convention 134 on the
 "Prevention of Accidents (Seafarers)." The COE had not yet received the requested
 regulations at years end.
 
 
 413
 A 1967 law on health and safety in the workplace requires industrial, agricul-
 tural, and commercial firms with 10 or more workers to establish a joint manage-
 ment-labor committee on workplace conditions and allows the Government to in-
 spect workplaces and to fine employers for violations. Most firns subject to the law
 establish such committees but either do not use the committees or neglect to turn
 them into effective instruments for improving workplace conditions. While workers
 have the right to leave work if conditions become dangerous, workers who do so may
 find their jobs in jeopardy unless they file written complaints with the Labor Min-
 istry. Due partly to budgetary constraints, the Ministry h as not fielded enough labor
 inspectors to ensure consistent maintenance of minimum conditions of safety and
 sanitation, especially outside San Jose.
