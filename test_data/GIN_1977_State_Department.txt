 GUINEA
 Guinea is a one-party socialist state.   Sekou Toure,
 has been its only President since Guinea's decision to
 break from the French community and declare its inde-
 pendence in 1958. France's precipitate departure
 seriously injured the economy of the new nation. A
 sea-borne invasion by Portuguese mercenaries in
 November 1970 exacerbated Guinea's concerns for its
 external security and led to a zealous investigation
 of all suspected traitors to the nation. Sekou Toure's
 socialist philosophy and policies emphasize ideological
 commitment as an incentive for production rather than
 material rewards. The Government of Guinea views domi-
 nation of blacks by whites in southern Africa as
 Africa's primary human rights problem. Within Guinea
 the social goals set by the official party-state take
 precedence over the integrity of the person and civil
 liberties.   Past threats to Guinea's security,
 especially the Portuguese backed invasion, have rein-
 forced this attitude. There have been several reports
 of use of torture in the early 1970s. Recent inci-
 dents are difficult to document. Arbitrary detention
 for political offenses continues.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 .Jean Paul Alata's book "African Prison" and a 1977 re-
 port by the International League for Human Rights de-
 scribe cases of torture during the early 1970's. It
 allegedly was used under high-level sanction when tai-
 lored confessions were required. Not only Guineans but
 foreigners reportedly were tortured. Some reportedly
 died under torture. Evidence is lacking about the
 more recent period. Amnesty International stated in
 1977 that it continues to receive reports of systematic
 use of torture to extract confessions and of deaths
 from such torture. We have no first-hand information
 that would enable us to reach an independent judge-
 ment on these allegations.
 
 
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Amnesty International has reported that prison condi-
 tions are said to be "extremely bad." Reports persist
 that prisoners are in some cases deprived of food and
 water. Some prisoners have reportedly died under these
 conditions. It is a reasonable assumption that prison
 conditions in Guinea, one of the poorest of the
 developing countries'in the world, are well below
 western standards. Public beatings for thievery or
 other offenses have occasionally occurred, primarily to
 deter crime by harsh example. Those forced to confess
 to political crimes are publicly denounced in a degrad-
 ing manner.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The government occasionally purges those suspected of
 plotting against it. Public officials who fall into
 disfavor are subject to detention. The number of
 "political" prisoners currently in detention has been
 estimated at less than 1,000. This figure includes
 some former senior government officials. Amnesty
 International reported that the total number of polit-
 ical prisoners in Guinea in 1977 may be conservatively
 estimated at 1,000. Given the lack of solid data avail-
 able to us, we are not in a position to accept or
 reject this figure. The Guinean official gazette an-
 nounced the release of 128 prisoners in September 1976,
 150 more in January 1977 and an additional 89 between
 February and July 1977. These apparently included
 political prisoners. Additional prisoners were reported
 released during the May 14, 1977 celebration of the
 30th anniversary of the Guinean Democratic Party,
 reportedly including some political prisoners. Fol-
 lowing the August 1977 market women's riots, several
 hundred were briefly detained but all were released.
 Some 62 political prisoners were released in December
 1977. These include some former high-level officials.
 The International League for Human Rights (ILHR) has
 submitted a detailed complaint about Guinea to the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). The
 document is on behalf of French citizens imprisoned be-
 tween 1970 and 1975 and several hundred imprisoned
 Guineans.
 
 
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Constitutional and statutory provisions for judicial
 procedures exist but do not seem to be consistently
 applied. Guinean law does not permit professional
 lawyers in private practice but provides for selection
 of well-educated private citizens to act as ad hoc
 defense attorneys. Some political cases may involve
 a public show trial in which the verdict has been
 determined on the basis of a prior "confession" and
 the presiding officials use the occasion for mass
 political education. Other political trials are held
 in camera.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Police apparently enter homes in pursuit of suspects
 and to obtain evidence with constitutional safeguards
 taking second place to professed security concerns.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Government policy is directed towards improving the
 economic well-being of the people. A strong attempt
 is made to improve food production, health and edu-
 cation. Ideology is a predominant factor in public
 policy formation, however, and frequently limits options
 otherwise open for orderly, rational economic develop-
 ment. In the past, limited contact with the outside
 world has retarded development of adequate housing,
 education and health care.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought,.Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The government discourages dissent from its political
 and ideological tenets. Intellectual inquiry contrary
 to the prevailing ideology is not encouraged. Islam
 is officially encouraged, and Christianity tolerated.
 Assembly is subjected to police controls. The press
 
 
 is government controlled and few publications are avail-
 able. Labor unions are firmly controlled by the govern-
 ment.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Movement is subject to an extensive police and paper-
 work system. Legal entry into and exit'from the
 country is strictly controlled. However, the borders
 are porous and more than one million Guineansare be-
 lieved to have departed since 1958 because of political
 or economic conditions.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The people are regularly exhorted to adhere to a contin-
 uing "revolution" which the single party-state conducts
 in their name. There is little freedom to dissent or
 not to take part in regime-directed political activity
 which guides most aspects of economic and administrative
 life. However, President Toure sees many petitioners
 and supplicants, and the government contends that the
 party-state structure and popular referendums provide
 adequate reflection of people's wishes.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 An international investigation was made of the 1970
 mercenary attack on Guinea, and the Guinean Government
 has expressed willingness for outsiders to observe
 ita humanitarian practices. No such on-the-spot
 investigation is known to have taken place as yet.
 Information which has come out through relatives of
 political prisoners, exiles and released political
 prisoners form the basis of reports such as that the
 ILHR submitted to the UNHRC. The Guinean Government
 considers the ILER report to be slander. In 1977
 Amnesty International stated that it had attempted
 to make initial contact with the Guinean authorities
 with a view to intervening on behalf of political
 prisoners in Guinea and sending a mission to that
 country. We are not aware of the Guinean government's
 response to, if any, to Amnesty International initia-
 tives.
