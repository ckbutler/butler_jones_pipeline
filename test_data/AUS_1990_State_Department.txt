 AUSTRALIA
 With a long history as a multiparty parliamentary democracy,
 Australia operates within a federal system of government.
 National elections were held on March 24, 1990 and must take
 place again by July 10, 1993.
 Federal, state, and local police carry out their functions in
 accordance with civil law, which respects and safeguards
 individual human rights. The law is observed in practice.
 Australia has a developed economy, largely based on mining and
 agriculture but with growing manufacturing and service
 sectors, and provides most Australians with a high per capita
 income. A wide range of government programs offers assistance
 for the minority of relatively disadvantaged citizens, but
 fiscal restraints are beginning to limit the extent of that
 assistance. Individuals are free to hold private property,
 pursue their economic and personal interests, associate with
 others, and organize trade unions.
 Basic human rights are assured by law and respected in
 practice in Australia. The Government's commitment to the
 promotion of, and respect for, human rights is firm,
 domestically and internationally. The 1990 Federal election
 campaign gave women's and Aboriginal issues renewed attention
 and highlighted ongoing multicultural and women's rights
 initiatives, including a nationwide campaign to reduce
 domestic violence. Events in Asia highlighted concerns over
 the status of Cambodian boat people and Chinese students in
 Australia. Aboriginals remained the most economically and
 socially disadvantaged minority in the country, but gained an
 opportunity to manage their own affairs through a nationwide
 framework of elected councilors and commissioners. As the
 Royal Commission investigating deaths of Aboriginals in
 custody neared the end of its review, the Federal Government
 pointed to implementation of the Commission's 1988 interim
 recommendations as having helped to reduce deaths
 significantly. However, a disproportionately high level of
 Aboriginal imprisonment continued. The Federal Government
 repeated its call for a legal delineation of Aboriginal rights,
 while a number of Aboriginal groups gained expanded land
 ownership and legal rights from state and local governments.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or by
 political organizations does not occur.
 The Royal Commission's 1988 interim report on Aboriginal
 deaths in custody cited over 100 such deaths in the 1980's.
 There have been 14 more since the report was published. The
 report found that in several cases police and prison wardens
 "actively caused" such deaths. Legislative and procedural
 changes in response to the Commission's findings have helped
 to reduce significantly the rate of deaths in custody.
 b. Disappearange
 There have been no instances of political disappearances.

 AUSTRALIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this
 prohibition is generally respected. However, there is
 credible evidence that Aboriginals in custody are frequently
 mistreated. Federal and state authorities continued efforts
 to address the problem of Aboriginal deaths and mistreatment
 in custody.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 This prohibition is respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law provides for the right to a fair public trial
 before an independent judiciary. Defendants have full rights
 to due process including a presumption of innocence, an
 unimpeded right of counsel (at public expense for indigents),
 a right to confront witnesses, and a right to appeal. These
 rights are respected in practice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. The Government
 does not interfere with the privacy of family, home, or
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The democratic political system, an effective judiciary, and
 diverse, vigorous, and independent news media combine to
 ensure freedom of speech and press and full academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Australia does not have a bill of rights, but it is a party to
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
 which provides for freedom of assembly and expression. These
 freedoms are respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Australians have complete freedom of religion. A provision in
 the Constitution precludes the adoption of an official state
 religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Australia imposes no restrictions on movement within or
 outside of the country. The rights of emigration and
 repatriation are also protected. Although the legal status of
 some 200 Cambodian boat people had not been determined by
 year's end, the Federal Government announced a new policy in
 June that granted special temporary residence status to
 Chinese afraid to return to their homeland following the 1989
 Tiananmen Square massacre.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Australians elect representatives to a two-chamber Federal
 Parliament as well as to numerous state and local bodies
 through free and open elections.
 Candidates are drawn from three major parties and a number of
 minor parties. Voting, by secret ballot, is compulsory in
 general elections for Australians 18 years of age and older;
 persons may abstain or invalidate their ballots, but eligible
 voters who do not at least collect ballots may be fined.
 Elections are held at varying intervals as prescribed by
 federal, state, and local laws.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A wide range of local nongovernmental organizations concerned
 with human rights operate freely and the Government permits
 unimpeded access for all international groups investigating
 alleged human rights violations. As a matter of policy, the
 Government responds to any communication from the United
 Nations alleging violations of human rights in Australia.
 Australia actively promotes human rights on the international
 level as a reelected member of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and as a member of the United Nations Working Group
 on Indigenous Populations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By law, Australians have equal access to government services
 without reference to race, sex, religion, language, or social
 status. Basic food, shelter, health care, education, and
 social security benefits are guaranteed for all. The Racial
 Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination on grounds
 of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
 However, Aboriginals, who comprise about 1.5 percent of the
 nation's population, continue to suffer widespread
 discrimination. Acknowledging that the Aboriginal population
 is the most disadvantaged group in terms of education,
 housing, health, and employment, the federal and state
 governments provide services, in addition to the broad range
 of programs available to all Australians, specifically aimed
 at improving Aboriginal socioeconomic conditions.
 The Federal Government's Aboriginal and Torres Straits
 Islander Commission (ATSIC), established by Parliament in late
 1989, replaced the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the
 Aboriginal Development Commission in March 1990. In November,
 a special nationwide election filled 800 all-Aboriginal
 positions on the 60 ATSIC regional councils. The newly
 elected councilors must select 20 national commissioners by
 March 1991. Critics contend that ATSIC was forced on
 Aboriginals without proper consultation and some land councils
 called for a boycott of the ATSIC election. Opponents also
 claimed that ATSIC's precise function and relation to existing
 assistance programs have been inadequately defined and that
 the new commissioners may not be able to manage its multi-
 million dollar budget effectively. Supporters maintain that
 ATSIC will enable Aboriginals to manage their own affairs on a
 coordinated national and regional basis for the first time.

 AUSTRALIA
 In 1990 the Federal Government and the opposition expressed
 bipartisan interest in a more formal delineation of Aboriginal
 rights. The Government included funds in its 1990-1991 budget
 to pursue an as-yet-undefined instrument of reconciliation
 with Aboriginals, with an informal deadline of the centennial
 of Federation in 2001. On land rights issues, Aboriginals in
 the Northern Territory voted in a precedent-setting plebiscite
 for the creation of a new land council, a federal court
 granted another land council access to confidential Federal
 Cabinet documents to support a 3-year legal battle to end
 uranium mining on Aboriginal land, and the Queensland State
 Government, for the first time, turned over a large parcel of
 pastoral land to its traditional Aboriginal owners.
 The Royal Commission investigating Aboriginal deaths in police
 custody had its 3-year mandate extended from December 1990 to
 March 1991 to complete its final report. According to the
 Federal Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and Justice and the
 Commission itself, state and local government implementation
 of the Commission's 1988 interim recommendations may have
 helped to reduce significantly the number of Aboriginal deaths
 in custody. Measures such as providing alternatives to
 incarceration for drunkenness, recruiting more Aboriginal
 police officers, and making law enforcement officials more
 sensitive to Aboriginal concerns were reportedly the most
 effective. The Commission and human rights groups continued
 to question the disproportionate number of Aboriginals in
 jails and prisons, however, and controversy over a police raid
 on an Aboriginal neighborhood in Sydney in February, in which
 police used excessive force, highlighted concerns about
 Aboriginal-police relations. In September, citing provisions
 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to safeguard the
 health and welfare of indigenous peopIe, Aboriginals in four
 states sued the Federal Government for failing to control
 alcohol manufacture and distribution to Aboriginals.
 Domestic violence, which mainly affects females, and may
 involve as many as one in three Australian families, continued
 to attract government and public concern. It was one of the
 issues highlighted by the Federal Government's announcement
 during the election campaign of a 3-year, multimillion dollar
 health, education, and family support initiative targeted at
 women. The initiative also called for closer federal-state
 cooperation on a range of women's issues, including reducing
 domestic violence. The national domestic violence education
 program, which, according to government research and women's
 rights organizations, successfully raised overall awareness
 about the problem in 1989, shifted its emphasis in 1990 to
 changing attitudes in particular socioeconomic groups (e.g.,
 Aboriginals, who have a higher incidence of domestic
 violence). Improving training for law enforcement and
 community workers and expanding crisis-support services were
 also emphasized.
 The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on
 the basis of sex, marital status, or pregnancy. In 1986 the
 Government passed affirmative action legislation obliging
 employers to provide equal employment and promotion
 opportunities for female employees. Women's rights and
 welfare are promoted by a number of women's rights groups and
 the Federal Government's Office of the Status of Women.
 
 
 AUSTRALIA
 In 1990 the Federal Government continued its commitment to
 promote intercultural understanding and to address more
 effectively the needs of ethnic groups through a national
 multicultural agenda. In September, aided by the ongoing
 Federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
 investigation into racial violence, lengthy prison sentences
 ended the violent anti-Oriental and anti-Jewish activities of
 a Western Australia-based white supremacy organization.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.
 Australian law and practice provide workers, including public
 servants, full freedom to establish and join trade unions, to
 choose their union representatives, to formulate union
 programs, to associate directly with their counterparts in
 other nations, and to participate in international labor
 organizations. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the
 principal labor organization in Australia, is affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. A few
 individual unions are also affiliated with the Communist-
 controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Unions represent about 48 percent of the work force and are
 extremely active and influential. Union representatives
 constitute 60 percent of the delegates at national conferences
 of the governing Australian Labor Party. However, unions
 remain independent of government control. Australian workers
 enjoy the right to strike, which is well established in
 practice. However, a 1989 ruling of the Victoria Supreme
 Court declaring the airline pilots' union liable for damages
 arising from the pilots' dispute with the airlines underscored
 that the right to strike is not protected under domestic law.
 Strikes are frequent although generally of short duration. In
 general, industrial disputes are resolved either through
 direct employer-union negotiations or under the auspices of
 the various state and federal industrial relations commissions
 whose mandate includes resolution of disputes through
 conciliation and arbitration.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Australian workers are granted the right, by law and in
 practice, to organize and bargain collectively and to be
 represented in negotiating the prevention and settlement of
 disputes with employers. Workers are also protected by law
 and in practice from antiunion discrimination. A pattern of
 centralized wage negotiations with quasi-judicial arbitration
 and settlement, supplemented by industry-wide or company-
 by-company collective bargaining, has generally prevailed
 since the establishment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and
 Arbitration Commission in 1904. The Industrial Relations Act
 of 1988 made important technical changes in the basic system,
 creating a new Industrial Relations Commission with expanded
 scope for performing essentially the same tasks as its
 predecessor.
 Workers in Australia's one export processing zone, located
 outside Darwin in the Northern Territory, exercise the same
 rights of association, organization, and collective bargaining
 as workers elsewhere in the country. There was some
 controversy in 1990 over the labor practices of a People's
 Republic of China-based firm which employed Chinese guest
 workers in the zone. That firm is no longer operating.

 AUSTRALIA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Australia has ratified and fully respects International Labor
 Organization Convention 105 prohibiting forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Although there is no federally mandated minimum age for
 employment, state-imposed compulsory education requirements,
 monitored and enforced by state educational authorities,
 prevent most children from joining the work force until they
 are 15 to 16 years of age. In addition, Federal and State
 Ministries of Labor monitor and enforce a complicated network
 of legislation (which often varies from state to state)
 governing such interactive factors as minimum school-leaving
 age, minimum age to claim unemployment benefits, and minimum
 age to engage in specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Australia has long had a tradition that workers should be
 guaranteed a decent standard of living. Although a formal
 federal minimum wage exists in theory, it is not used.
 Instead, most workers are covered by differing minimum wage
 rates for individual trades and professions which are embodied
 in a comprehensive system of "awards" sanctioned by various
 State and Federal Industrial Relations Commissions. The
 lowest current Federal award of $227 per 38-hour week is for
 clothing workers. Combined with other regularly provided
 benefits and government entitlements for low-income families,
 this wage provides a decent standard of living. In addition,
 a complex body of regulations and commission decisions
 prescribes a 40-hour (or less) week, paid vacations, sick
 leave, and health and safety standards in the workplace, as
 well as other benefits for the overwhelming majority of
 Australian workers. Compliance with these and other
 regulations is actively monitored and enforced byFederal and
 State Ministries of Labor.
