 WESTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty of the Western Sahara remains the subject of a dispute between
 the Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front, an organization seeking inde-
 pendence for the region. The Moroccan Government sent troops and settlers into the
 northern two-thirds of the Western Sahara after Spain withdrew from the area in
 1975 and extended its administration over the southern province of Oued Ed Dahab
 after Mauritania renounced its claim in 1979. The Moroccan Government has under-
 taken a sizable economic development program in the Western Sahara as part of
 its long-term efforts to strengthen Moroccan claims to the territory.
 Since 1973 the Polisario Front has challenged the claims of Spain, Mauritania,
 and Morocco to the territory. Moroccan and Polisario forces fought intermittently
 from 1975 to the 1991 ceasefire and deployment to the area of a United Nations
 (U.N.) peacekeeping contingent, known by its French initials, MINURSO.
 In 1975 the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion on the sta-
 tus of the Western Sahara. The Court held that while the region's tribes had histori-
 cal ties to Morocco, the ties were insufficient to warrant recognition of Moroccan
 sovereignty. According to the court, the people of the Western Sahara, called
 Sahrawis, are entitled to self-determination. Most Sahrawis live in the area con-
 trolled by Morocco, but there is a sizable refugee population near the border with
 Morocco, in Algeria, and, to a lesser extent, in Mauritania. The bulk of the Sahrawi
 population lives within the area delineated by a Moroccan-constructed berm, which
 encloses most of the territory.
 Efforts by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to resolve the sovereignty
 question collapsed in 1984 when the OAU recognized the Saharan Arab Democratic
 Republic, the civilian arm of the Polisario Front. Morocco withdrew from the OAU
 in protest.
 In 1988 Morocco and the Polisario Front accepted the United Nations' plan for a
 referendum that would allow the Sahrawis to decide between integration with Mo-
 rocco or independence for the territory. The referendum was scheduled for January
 1992, but was postponed because the parties were unable to agree on a common list
 of eligible voters-despite the previous acceptance by both parties of an updated ver-
 sion of the Spanish census of 1974 as the base for voter eligibility. A complicated
 formula for determining voter eligibility was ultimately devised, and in August
 1994, MINURSO personnel began to hold identification sessions for voter applicants.
 The voter identification process ended in December 1995 and, after several fruit-
 less efforts to persuade the two parties to cooperate, the U.N. Security Council for-
 mally suspended the identification process in May. The U.N. and friendly govern-
 ments have continued to urge the two parties to seek a political solution to the con-
 flict. In March U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed former U.S. Secretary
 of State James Baker as his personal envoy to examine possible approaches for a
 peaceful settlement. Baker visited the region in March, and negotiations between
 the Moroccan Government and the Polisario began in May. In September represent-
 atives of Morocco and the Polisario met in Houston in the United States, andagreed
 to a series of compromise agreements on the 1991 U.N. Settlement Plan to hold a
 referendum under U.N. auspices. According to the Houston Accords, identification
 of potential voters, the referendum campaign, and vote must take place by Decem-
 ber 1998.
 Since 1977 the Saharan provinces of Laayoune, Smara, and Boujdour have par-
 ticipated in local elections organized and controlled by the Moroccan Government.
 The southern province of Oued Ed Dahab has participated in Moroccan-controlled
 elections since 1983. Sahrawis whose political views are aligned with Rabat fill all
 the seats allotted to the Western Sahara in the Moroccan Parliament.
 The civilian population living in the Western Sahara under Moroccan administra-
 tion is subject to Moroccan law. U.N. observers and foreign human rights groups
 report that Sahrawis have difficulty obtaining Moroccan passports, that the Govern-
 
 
 1543
 ment monitors the political views of Sahrawis more closely than those of Moroccan
 citizens, and that the police and paramilitary-authorities react especially harshly
 against those suspected of supporting independence and the Polisano Front. Access
 to the territory is limited by the Moroccan Government, and international human
 rights organizations and impartial journalists have sometimes experienced difficulty
 in securing admission.
 After years of denying that Sahrawis were imprisoned in Morocco for Polisario-
 related military or political activity, the Government of Morocco released 300 such
 prisoners in 1991. Entire families and Sahrawis who had disappeared in the mid-
 1970's were among those released. The Government of Morocco has failed to conduct
 a public inquiry or to explain how and why those released spent up to 16 years in
 incommunicado detention without charge or trial.
 There are a number of other Sahrawis who remain imprisoned for peaceful pro-
 tests which urged Saharan independence. Kelthoum     el-Ouanat and five other
 Sahrawis -were released in May 1996. El-Ouanat had been sentenced to a 20-year
 term after being arrested in October 1992 following a demonstration in Smara. Prior
 to her trial, she had been held in secret detention for up to 10 months during which
 time she reportedly was beaten, tortured, and sexually abused.
 In May 1995, 8 Sahrawi youths were arrested for demonstrating for Sahrawi inde-
 pendence; in June 1995, they were given 20-year sentences. The sentences were
 later commuted to 1 year by the King, and the 8 Sahrawis were released in July
 1996, 14 months after having been taken into custody. They report that they con-
 tinue to be closely monitored by the Moroccan police.
 There are credible reports that 10 Sahrawis were arrested, beaten, and kept in
 seclusion in May 1996 following demonstrations in several cities of the Western Sa-
 hara in support of Sahrawi independence. Reportedly these 10 demonstrators have
 been sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from 18 months to 17 years.
 The Polisario Front claims that the Government continues to hold several hun-
 dred Sahrawis as political prisoners and approximately 300 prisoners of war
 (POW's). The Government formally denies that any Sahrawi noncombatants remain
 in detention. On October 31, 1996, Morocco released 66 Sahrawi combatants who
 were flown to the Tindouf area of Algeria under International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) auspices. They were accompanied by foreign diplomats. The Govern-
 ment also claims that 30,000 Sahrawi refugees are detained against their will by
 the Polisario in camps around Tindouf, Algeria. The Polisario denies this charge.
 There are credible reports that the number of refugees in Tindouf far exceeds
 30,000, but the allegation that they wish to leave has not been substantiated.
 The ICRC also reports that the Polisario now holds approximately 1,900 Moroccan
 POW's. A group of 185 POW's was repatriated to Morocco in a humanitarian airlift
 conducted under ICRC auspices in November 1995. In April Polisario leaders offered
 to release 85 Moroccan POW's as a good will gesture during U.N. envoy Baker's first
 meetings in Tindouf, but details of their release have not been arranged between
 Morocco and the Polisario.
 Both the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front refuse to repatriate the
 remaining POW's, claiming that the U.N. settlement plan calls for the release of
 POW's only after the identification process is complete.
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in militarily sensitive
 areas. Elsewhere, security forces subject travelers to arbitrary questioning and de-
 tention.
 There is little organized labor activity in the Western Sahara. The same labor
 laws that apply in Morocco are applied in the Moroccan-controlled areas of the
 Western Sahara. Moroccan unions are present in the Moroccan-controlled Western
 Sahara but are moribund. The 15 percent of the territory outside Moroccan control
 does not have any major population centers or economic activity beyond nomadic
 herding. The Polisario-sponsored labor union, the Sario Federation of Labor, is not
 active in the Western Sahara.
 There were no strikes, other job actions, or collective bargaining ageements dur-
 ing the year. Most union members are employees of the Moroccan Government or
 state-owned organizations. They are paid 85 percent more than their counterparts
 outside the Western Sahara as an inducement to Moroccan citizens to go there.
 Workers in the Western Sahara are exempt from income and value-added taxes and
 receive subsidies on such commodities as flour, oil, sugar, fuel, and utilities.
 Moroccan law prohibits forced labor, which does not appear to exist in the West-
 ern Sahara.
 Regulations on the minimum age of employment are the same as in Morocco.
 Child labor appears to be less common than in Morocco, primarily because of the
 absence of industries most likely to employ children, such as rug knotting and gar-
 ment making. A government work program for adults, the Promotion Nationale, pro-
 
 
 1544
 vides families with enough income that children need not be hired out as domestic
 servants. Children in the few remaining nomadic groups presumably work as shep-
 herds along with other group members.
 The minimum wage and maximum hours of work are the same as in Morocco. In
 practice, however, workers in some fish processing plants may work as much as 12
 hours per day, 6 days per week, well beyond the 10-hour day, 48-hour week maxi-
 mum stipulated in Moroccan law. Occupational health and safety standards are the
 same as those enforced in Morocco. They are rudimentary, except for a prohibition
 on the employment of women in dangerous occupations.
 OMAN
 The Sultanate of Oman is a monarchy which has been ruled by the Al Bu Sa'id
 family since the middle of the 18th century. It has no political parties or directly
 elected representative institutions. The current Sultan, Qaboos Bin Sa'id Al Sa'id,
 acceded to the throne in 1970. Although the Sultan retains frm control over all im-
 portant policy issues, he has brought tribal leaders-even those who took up arms
 against his family's rule-as well as other notables into the Government. In accord-
 ance with tradition and cultural norms, much decisionmaking is by consensus
 among these leaders. In 1991 the Sultan established the 59-seat Consultative Coun-
 cil, or Majlis Ash-Shura, which replaced an older advisory body. The Government
 selects Council members from lists of nominees proposed by each of the 59 wilayats
 (regions). After the first national census in 1993, the Sultan expanded the member-
 ship of the new Council to 80 seats. In 1997 it was expanded further to 82 seats.
 The Council has no formal legislative powers but may question government min-
 isters, even during unrehearsed televised hearings, and recommend changes to new
 laws on economic and social policy, sometimes leading to amendments to proposed
 decrees. In December the Sultan appointed 41 persons as members of the new Coun-
 cil of State (Majlis Al-Dawla), which with the current Consultative Council forms
 the bicameral body known as the Majlis Oman (Council of Oman). In late 1996, the
 Sultan promulgated by decree the country's "Basic Law," which provides for citizens'
 basic rights in writing for the first time. The courts are subordinate to the Sultan
 and sub ect to his influence.
 The internal and external security apparatus falls under the authority of the Min-
 istry of Palace Office which coordinates all intelligence and security policies. The In-
 ternal Security Service investigates all matters related to internal security. The
 Royal Oman Police, whose head also has cabinet status, performs regular police du-
 ties, provides security at airports, serves as the country's immigration agency, and
 maintains a small coast guard. There are credible reports that security forces occa-
 sionally abuse detainees.
 Since 1970 Oman has used its modest oil revenue to make impressive economic
 progress and improve public access to health care, education, and social services.
 Oman has a mixed economy with significant government participation in industry,
 transportation, and communications. The Government seeks to diversify the econ-
 omy and stimulate private investment.
 The Government continues to restrict or deny important human rights. Human
 rights abuses include arbitrary arrest, mistreatment of detainees, prolonged deten-
 tion without charge, and the denial of due process. The Government restricts free-
 dom of expression and association and does not ensure full rights for workers and
 women. As a practical matter, the people do not have the right to change their gov-
 ernment.
 The 1996 Basic Law provides for many basic human rights, e.g., an independent
 judiciary, freedom of association, speech, and press. The Basic Law permits the Gov-
 ernment 2 years, until 1998, to adopt the necessary implementing decrees but, as
 a practical matter, implementation may be extended to the year 2000.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Security forces abuse some detainees, particularly during interrogation. The abuse
 does not appear to be systematic and often varies depending upon the social status
 of the victim, the official involved, and the location of the incident (e.g., whether it
 
 
 1545
 occurs in a rural or an urban area). Despite reported official efforts to prevent such
 abuse, incidents still occur. Security officials sometimes beat detainees but are often
 careful to conceal evidence of abuse by employing such tactics as restricting blows
 to less visible areas of the body. Detainees are sometimes left in isolation with
 promises of release or improved treatment as a further means to elicit confessions
 or information. Although judges have the right to order investigations of allegations
 of mistreatment, there is no recent evidence that any officer has been punished for
 abusing detainees. The 1996 Basic Law, yet to be implemented, specifically prohibits
 "physical or moral torture" and stipulates that all confessions obtained by such
 methods will be considered null and void. There was no evidence of torture in 1997.
 However, in the recent past, techniques reportedly range from sleep deprivation to
 harsher measures such as hanging a bound victim from a steel bar in such a way
 that the wrists must support the full weight of the body.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons. Neverthe-
 less, prison conditions appear to meet minimum international standards. Access to
 some prisoners is severely restricted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The police may obtain warrants prior to
 making arrests but are not required by law to do so. The authorities must obtain
 court orders to hold suspects in pretrial detention. Within 24 hours of arrest, the
 police are required to file charges or ask a magistrate judge to order continued de-
 tention. In practice, however, the police do not always follow these procedures.
 Judges may order detentions for 14 days to allow investigation and may grant ex-
 tensions if necessary. There is a system of bail. The 1996 Basic Law provides for
 certain legal and procedural rights for detainees.
 Police handling of arrests and detentions constitutes incommunicado detention in
 some instances. The police do not always notify a detainee's family or, in the case
 of a foreign worker, the worker's sponsor of the detention. Sometimes notification
 is made only just prior to the detainee's release. The authorities post a list of per-
 sons scheduled for trial near the magistrate court building in Muscat. The police
 do not always permit attorneys and family members to visit detainees. Judges occa-
 sionally intercede to ensure that security officials allow such visits.
 The Government does not practice exile as a form of punishment. The 1996 Basic
 Law prohibits exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL--The 1996 Basic Law affirms the independence of
 the judiciary; however the various courts are subordinate to the Sultan and subject
 to his influence. The Sultan appoints all judges, acts as a court of final appeal, and
 intercedes in cases of particular interest, especially in national security cases. How-
 ever, there have been no reported instances in which the Sultan has overturned a
 decision of the magistrate courts or the commercial court.
 The judiciary comprises the magistrate courts, which adjudicate misdemeanors
 and criminal matters; the Islamic, or Shari'a, courts, which adjudicate personal sta-
 tus cases such as divorce and inheritance; the commercial court; the Labor Welfare
 Board; and the Rent Dispute Committee, which hears tenant-landlord disputes.
 In May the Government promulgated into law the provisions of the 1996 Basic
 Law pertaining to "family law", i.e., law that falls under the purview of the Shari'a
 courts. The effect of this new law has been to regularize the nature of the cases and
 the range of corresponding judgments within the Shari'a court system.
 A State Security Court tries cases involving national security and criminal cases
 that the Government decides require expeditious or especially sensitive handling.
 Magistrate court judges have presided over trials in the State Security Court. De-
 fendants tried by the Security Court are not permitted to have legal representation
 present. The timing and the location of the Court's proceedings are not publicly dis-
 closed. The Court does not follow legal procedures as strictly as the magistrate
 courts, although prominent civilian jurists form the panel. The Sultan has exercised
 his powers of leniency, including in political cases.
 The Criminal Code does not specify the rights of the accused. There are no writ-
 ten rules of evidence, codified procedures for entering cases into the criminal sys-
 tem, or any legal provision for a public trial. Criminal procedures have developed
 by tradition and precedents in the magistrate courts. In criminal cases, the police
 provide defendants with the written charges against them; defendants are presumed
 innocent and have the right to present evidence and confront witnesses. The pros-
 ecution and the defense question witnesses through the judge, who is usually the
 only person to question witnesses in court.
 There are no jury trials. A single judge tries misdemeanors; a panel of three
 judges tries felonies and security offenses. Magistrate court judges must be citizens.
 Public prosecutors are senior police officers. They may bring additional charges after
 defense attorneys have inspected the charge sheet or during trial.
 
 
 1546
 A detainee may hire an attorney but has no explicit right to be represented by
 counsel. The Government does not pay for the legal representation of indigents.
 However, the 1996 Basic Law affirms both right to counsel and government-funded
 legal representation for indigents. Judges often pronounce the verdict and sentence
 within 1 day after the completion of a trial. Defendants may appeal jail sentences
 longer than three months and fines over the equivalent of $1,300 to a three-judge
 panel. defendants accused of national security offenses and serious felonies do not
 ave the right of appeal. Death sentences, which are rare, cannot be carried out
 without the Sultan's approval.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The po-
 lice are not requiied by law to obtain search warrants. There is a widespread belief
 that the Government eavesdrops on both oral and written communications, and
 Omanis are guarded in both areas. Citizens must obtain permission from the Min-
 istry of Interior to marry foreigners, except to nationals from the Gulf Cooperation
 Council (GCC) countries. Such permission is not automatically granted. Delays or
 denial of permission have resulted in secret marriages within Oman. Marriages in
 foreign countries can lead to denial of entry into Oman of the foreign spouse and
 prevent a legitimate child from claiming citizenship rights.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law prohibits criticism of the Sultan in any
 form or medium. The authorities tolerate criticism of government officials and agen-
 cies, but such criticism rarely receives media coverage. The announced 1996 Basic
 Law provides for freedom of opinion expressed in words, writing, or all other media
 within the limits of the law.
 The 1984 Press and Publication Law authorizes the Government to censor all do-
 mestic and imported publications. Ministry of Information censors may act against
 any material regarded as politically, culturally, or sexually offensive. However, jour-
 nalists and writers generally censor themselves to avoid government harassment.
 Editorials reflect the Government's views, although the authorities tolerate some
 criticism on foreign affairs issues. The Government discourages in-depth reporting
 on controversial domestic issues and seeks to influence privately owned dailies and
 periodicals by subsidizing their operating costs.
 The Government prohibits the entry onto the market of foreign newspapers and
 magazines containing reports or statements deemed critical of Oman. However, one
 foreign publication carrying an article critical of the Sultan and the Government
 was sold in Oman in September. Customs officials sometimes confiscate video cas-
 sette tapes and erase offensive material. The tapes may or may not be returned to
 their owners. Government censorship decisions are periodically changed without ap-
 parent reason. The lifting of the boycott against Israel has eliminated prohibitions
 on publications from or about Israel that meet other censorship standards. There
 is a general perception that the confiscation of books and tapes at the border from
 private individuals and restrictions on popular novels has somewhat eased. How-
 ever, it has reportedly become more difficult to obtain permission to distribute books
 that censors decide have factual errors about Oman (including outdated maps) in
 the local market.
 The Government controls the local radio and television companies. They do not
 air any politically controversial material. The Government does not allow the estab-
 lishment of privately owned radio and television companies. However, the availabil-
 ity of satellite dishes has made foreign broadcast information accessible to the pub-
 lic. The Government, through its national telecommunications company, provides
 full, uncensored Internet access to citizens and foreigners.
 The appropriate government authority, such as Sultan Qaboos University, the po-
 lice, or the relevant ministry must approve public cultural events, including plays,
 concerts, lectures, and seminars. Most organizations avoid controversial issues due
 to fear that the authorities may cancel their events. Academic freedom is restricted,
 particularly regarding controversial matters, including politics. Professors may be
 dismissed for going beyond acceptable boundaries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law does not guarantee
 freedom of assembly. All public gatherings require government sponsorship. The au-
 thorities do not always enforce this requirement, and gatherings sometimes take
 place without formal government approval. Regulations implemented in 1994 re-
 stricting most types of public gatherings remain in effect. The 1996 Basic Law pro-
 vides for limited freedom of assembly.
 Current law states that the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor must approve
 the establishment of all associations and their bylaws. Despite this ruling, some
 groups are allowed to function without formal registration. The Government uses
 
 
 1547
 
 the power to license associations as a means to control the political environment.
 It does not license groups regarded as a threat to the predominant social or political
 views of the Sultanate. Formal registration of associations for expatriates is limited
 to a maximum of one association for any nationality. The 1996 -Basic Law's provi-
 sions-not yet in effect-regulate the formation of associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion, which is affirmed by the 1996
 Basic Law. The 1996 Basic Law provides that Islamic law (Shari'a) is the basis for
 legislation and preserves the freedom to practice religious rites, in accordance with
 tradition, provided that does not breach public order. Discrimination against indi-
 viduals on the basis of religion or sect is prohibited. Implementing decrees for the
 1996 Basic Law have not yet been established.
 Most Omanis are Ibadhi or Sunni Muslims, but there is also a minority of Shi'a
 Muslims. Non-Muslims are free to worship at churches and temples built on land
 donated by the Sultan. There are many Christian denominations which utilize two
 ? lots of donated land on which two Catholic and two Protestant churches have been
 uilt. Hindu temples also exist on government provided land. Other land has been
 made available to Catholic and Protestant missions in Sohar and Salalah.
 The Government prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing Muslims. It also pro-
 hibits non-Muslim groups from publishing religious material, although material
 printed abroad may be brought into the country. Members of all religions and sects
 are free to maintain links with coreligionists abroad and undertake foreign travel
 for religious purposes. Due to government restrictions on public gatherings, there
 has been a substantial curtailment of non-Muslim religious celebrations in recent
 years.
 The-police monitor mosque sermons to ensure that the preachers do not discuss
 political topics and stay within the state-approved orthodoxy of Islam. The Govern-
 ment expects all imams to preach sermons within the parameters of standardized
 texts distributed monthly by the Ministry of Justice, Awqaf, and Islamic Affairs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel by citizens within the country
 except to military areas. Foreigners, other than diplomats, must obtain a govern-
 ment pass to cross border points. To obtain a passport and depart the country, a
 woman must have authorization from her husband, father, or nearest male relative.
 However, a woman having an Omani identity card, which must be obtained via
 male authorization, may travel to certain Gulf Cooperation Council countries with-
 out a passport.
 Until the promulgation of the Basic Law, the Government did not have a policy
 on refugees, or a tradition of harboring stateless or undocumented aliens. The 1996
 Basic Law prohibits the extradition of political refugees. The issue of the provision
 of first asylum did not arise in 1997. Oman offered temporary refuge to several
 thousand Yemenis in 1994 displaced by a civil war. They returned to Yemen follow-
 ing the war's end. Tight control over the entry of foreigners into the country has
 effectively screened out would-be refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Oman is an autocracy in which the Sultan retains the ultimate authority on all
 important foreign and domestic issues. The country has no formal democratic politi-
 cal institutions, and its citizens do not have the ability peacefully to change their
 leaders or the political system.
 The Sultan promulgated Oman's first defacto written constitution, known as the
 Basic Law, in November, 1996. Although it has immediate force of law, laws and
 regulations to implement its provisions are to be phased in by the year 2000. The
 law does not provide for political parties or direct elections. Citizens have indirect
 access to senior officials through the traditional practice of petitioning their patrons,
 usually the local governor, or wali, for redress of grievances. Successful redress de-
 pends on the effectiveness of the patron's access to appropriate decisionmakers. The
 Sultan appoints the governors. The Sultan makes an annual 3-week tour of the
 country, accompanied by his ministers. The tour allows the Sultan to listen directly
 to his subjects' problems.
 In 1991 Sultan Qaboos established a Consultative Council, or Majlis Ash-Shura.
 In 1994 he expanded the number of Council seats to 80 from the original 59, a move
 that allocated 2 members for districts with a higher population. Due to the 1994-
 1997 population increase, the number of seats was further expanded to 82 for the
 October elections. The Government selects the Council members from several nomi-
 nees, both male and female, elected by prominent persons in each district. In the
 October elections, over 50,000 Omani men and women, 3 percent of the total popu-
 lation, were eligible to vote in all districts throughout the country. These voters (or
 
 
 1548
 electors) had volunteered for the position, their police records were checked by the
 Government, and they were subject to government approval. In some cases, nomi-
 nees with the most votes might not win appointment to the Council, if the Sultan
 decides not to appoint them. The Council has no formal legislative powers, which
 remain concentrated in the Sultan's hands. However, it serves as a conduit of infor-
 mation between the people and the government ministries. No serving government
 official is eligible to be a council member. The Council may question government
 ministers in public or in private, review all draft laws on social and economic policy,
 and recommend legislative changes to the Sultan, who makes the final decision. In
 mid-December the Sultan announced the appointment of 41 persons to the new
 Majlis Al-Dawla (Council of State). The precise responsibilities of the Council of
 State and its relationship to the existing Consultative Council remain to be clarified.
 As provide for in the 1996 Basic Law, the Council of State and the Consultative
 Council together will form the Majlis Oman, or Council of Oman.
 The Sultan has publicly advocated a greater role for women in both the public
 and private sectors. In the October elections, the Government selected two women
 to serve oni the Consultative Council. In December the Sultan appointed 4 women
 to the 41-member Majlis A1-Dawla.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government prohibits the establishment of human rights groups. The exist-
 ing restrictions on the freedom of speech and association do not permit any activity
 or speech critical of the Government. There were no known requests by inter-
 national human rights organizations to visit Oman.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1996 Basic Law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, ethnic origin,
 race, religion, language, sect, place of residence, and social class. However, decrees
 to implement its provisions have not been promulgated. Institutional and cultural
 discrimination based on gender, race, religion, social status, and disability exists.
 Women.-There is no evidence of a pattern of spousal abuse although observers
 say that allegations of such abuse in the Shari'a Courts are not uncommon. Defini-
 tive information is scant and difficult to collect. Doctors do not have a legal respon-
 sibility to report either spouse or child abuse cases to the courts. Battered women
 may file a complaint with the police but more often seek family intervention to pro-
 tect them from violent domestic situations. Likewise, families seek to intervene to
 keep such problems out of public view. There have been reports that employers or
 male coworkers have sexually harassed foreign females employed in such positions
 as domestic servants and hospital nurses. Foreign women employed as domestic
 servants and garment workers have complained that their employers have withheld
 their salaries and that government officials have been unresponsive to their griev-
 ances. Individuals known to be abusing domestics are not always brought to account
 for their actions. Several foreign women have had to ask their governments' em-
 bassy for shelter to escape abuse.
 Most women live within the confines of their homes. They continue to face many
 forms of discrimination. Illiteracy among older women hampers their ability to own
 property, participate in the modern sector of the economy, or even inform them-
 selves of their rights. Government officials frequently deny women land grants or
 housing loans and prefer to conduct business with a woman's husband or other male
 relative.
 Some aspects of Islamic tradition also discriminate against women. Islamic law
 favors male heirs in adjudicating inheritance claims. Many women are reluctant to
 take an inheritance dispute to court for fear of alienating the family.
 However, since 1970 conditions for women have improved dramatically in several
 areas. Whereas in 1970 no schools existed for girls, the most recent figures available
 from the Ministry of Education report an enrollment rate nearing 90 percent for all
 girls eligible for elementary school. In the 1996-97 school year, female students con-
 stituted approximately 50 percent of the total number of students attending public
 schools. Despite the addition of an extra 500 male students in September, women
 still constitute roughly half of the 5,000 students at Sultan Qabeos University. In
 November 542 women and 327 men received bachelors degrees as members of the
 eighth graduating class, while 5 women and 2 men received masters degrees. The
 university has a quota system with the apparent goal of increasing the number of
 men studying certain specialties. Reportedly, women are being limited to 50 percent
 of the seats in the medical department and are not permitted to pursue degrees in
 
 
 1549
 engineering and archeology. The quotas are expected to allow women to constitute
 a majority in some other departments.
 Women have also made gains in the work force. Some educated women have at-
 tained positions of authority in government, business, and the media. Approximately
 20 percent of all civil servants are women. In both the public and private sectors,
 women are entitled to maternity leave and equal pay for equal work. The bureauc-
 racy, the country's largest employer of women, observes such regulations, as do
 many private sector employers. Still, many educated women face job discrimination
 because prospective employers fear they might resign to marry or raise families.
 Several women employees in the Government have complained that they have been
 denied promotion in favor of less capable men. Government grants for study abroad
 are limited almost exclusively to males.
 Children.-The Government has made the health, education, and general welfare
 of children a budgetary priority. Primary school education is free and universal but
 not compulsory. Most children attend school through secondary school, to age 18.
 No significant sectors or groups within the population are prevented from receiving
 .an education. The infant mortality rate continues to decline, and comprehensive im-
 munization rates have risen. There is no pattern of familial or other child abuse.
 Government officials have publicly called for greater awareness and prevention of
 child abuse. A few communities in the interior and in the Dhofar region still prac-
 tice female genital mutilation (FMG). FMG is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. Experts be-
 lieve that the number of such cases is small and declining annually. Oman ratified
 the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1996 with reservations relating
 to freedom of children to- choose a religion and government spending limits.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has mandated parking spaces and
 some ramps for wheelchair access in private and government office buildings and
 shopping centers. Compliance is voluntary. Students in wheelchairs have easy ac-
 cess toSultan Qaboos University. The Government has-established several rehabili-
 tation centers for disabled children. Disabled persons, including the blind, work in
 government offices. Free government medical assistance to all citizens includes
 physical therapy and prosthetics support for the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-Some members of the Shi'a Muslim minority claim they
 face discrimination in employment and educational opportunities. Some -members of
 this same community, however, occupy prominent positions. in both the private and
 public sectors.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Citizens of east African origin complain that
 they frequently face job discrimination in both the public and private sectors. Some
 public institutions reportedly favor hiring members of one or another regional, trib-
 al, or religious group. However, no group is banned from employment.
 Members of the Shihuh tribe in the strategic province of Musandam have charged
 that security authorities have harassed and detained tribe members who complain
 about alleged inattention or mistreatment by the central Government.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government has not yet promulgated a new
 labor law that was first drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor in 1994.
 In the last quarter of 1996, the Consultative Council recommended some changes,
 but the Government has not yet issued a new labor law. Government officials have
 said that the new labor law will be consistent with international labor standards.
 The current law stipulates that "it is absolutely forbidden to provoke a strike for
 any reason."
 Labor unrest is rare. Although strikes are technically illegal, workers sometimes
 stage job actions. In general these disputes are settled without police intervention.
 In 1994 the Government joined the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The current law does not pro-
 vide for the right to collective bargaining. It requires, however, that employers of
 more than 50 workers form a joint labor-management committee as a communica-
 tion forum between the two groups. The implementation of this provision is uneven,
 and the effectiveness of these committees is questionable. In general the committees
 discuss such questions as living conditions at company-provided housing. They are
 not authorized to discuss wages, hours, or conditions of employment. Such issues
 are specified in the work contracts signed individually by workers and employers
 and must be consistent with the guidelines of the Ministry of Social Affairs and
 Labor.
 The current law defines conditions of employment for some Omanis and foreign
 workers. It covers domestic servants and construction workers but not temporary
 workers or those with work contracts that expire within 3 months. Foreign workers
 
 
 1550
 constitute at least 50 percent of the work force and as much as 80 percent of the
 modem-sector work force.
 Work rules must be approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor and
 posted conspicuously in the workplace by employers of 10 or more workers. Simi-
 larly, any employer with 50 or more workers must establish a grievance procedure.
 Regardless of the size of the company, any employee, including foreign workers, may
 file a grievance with the Labor Welfa  Board. Sometimes worker representatives
 ile collective grievances, but most grievances are filed by individual workers. Lower
 paid workers use the procedure regularly. Plaintiffs and defendants in such cases
 maybe represented bylegal counsel.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1973 Labor Law prohibits
 forced or bonded labor by adults or children. Instances of forced or bonded child
 labor are unknown. The 1996 Basic Law affirms that forced or bonded labor for any
 person is prohibited. However, governmental investigative and enforcement mecha-
 nisms are lacking. Foreign workers sometimes find themselves in situations
 amounting to forced labor. In such cases, employers withhold letters of release, a
 document releasing the worker from his employment contract, which allow him to
 switch jobs. Without the letter, a foreign worker must continue to work for his cur-
 rent employer or become technically unemployed-which is sufficient grounds for de-
 portation. Many foreign workers are not aware of their right to take such disputes
 before the Labor Welfare Board. Others are reluctant to file complaints for fear of
 retribution from unscrupulous employers. In most cases, the Board releases the
 grievant from service and awards compensation for time worked under compulsion.
 Employers face no other penalty than to reimburse the worker's back wages.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The 1973
 Labor Law prohibits children under the age of 13 from working, and specifically pro-
 hibits force or bonded labor by all persons (see Section 6.c.). The Ministry of Social
 Affairs and Labor enforces this prohibition. In practice, however, the enforcement
 often does not extend to some small family businesses which employ underage chil-
 dren, particularly in the agricultural and fisheries sectors. Children between 13 and
 16 years of age may be employed but must obtain the Ministry's permission to work
 overtime, at night, on weekends or holidays, or perform strenuous labor. Child labor
 does not exist in any industries.
 Although primary school education is not compulsory, most children attend school
 to age 18.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor issues
 minimum wage guidelines for various categories of workers. The minimum wage for
 nonprofessional workers is about $156 (60 rials) per month. Minimum wage guide-
 lines do not cover domestic servants, farmers, government employees, or workers in
 small businesses. Many foreigners work in fields exempt from the minimum wage
 statute. The Government is lax in enforcing minimum wage guidelines for foreign
 workers employed in menial jobs. However, foreign workers with high skills are fre-
 quently paid more than their Omani counterparts.
 The minimum wage is sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a work-
 er and family. The compensation for foreign manual laborers and clerks is sufficient
 to cover living expenses and to permit savings to be sent home.
 The private sector workweek is 40 to 45 hours and includes a rest period from
 Thursday afternoon through Friday. Government officials have a 35-hour workweek.
 While the law does not designate the number of days in a workweek, it requires
 at least one 24-hour rest period per week and mandates overtime pay for hours in
 excess of 48 per week. Government regulations on hours of employment are not al-
 ways enforced. Employees who have worked extra hours without compensation may
 file a complaint before the Labor Welfare Board, but the Board's rulings are not
 binding.
 Every worker has the right to 15 days of annual leave during the first 3 years
 of employment and 30 days per year thereafter. Employers provide many foreign na-
 tionals, including maids, with annual or biannual round-trip tickets to their coun-
 tries of oigin.
 All employers are required by law to provide first aid facilities. Work sites with
 over 100 employees must have a nurse. Employees covered under the labor law may
 recover compensation for injury or illness sustained on the job through employer-
 provided medical insurance. The health and safety standard codes are enforced by
 inspectors from the Department of Health and Safety of the Directorate of Labor.
 As required by law, they make on-site inspections.
 The law states that employers must not place their employees in situations in-
 volving dangerous work. However, the law does not specifically grant a worker the
 
 
 1551
 right to remove himself from dangerous work without jeopardy to his continued em-
 ployment.
