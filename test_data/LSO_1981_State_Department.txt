 LESOTHO
 Lesotho, a nation with a highly literate population and
 a tradition of political activism, has a history of
 simmering political unrest marked by occasional inci-
 dents of violence. The present government came to
 power when Lesotho gained independence in 1966. After
 the elections in 1970, the government annulled the
 results and suspended the constitution. Ensuing protests
 were suppressed but opposition continued. In 1974,
 after averting a feeble coup, government authori-
 ties made several arrests and the principal opposition
 leader fled the country. About twenty persons were
 convicted of various crimes in connection with the coup
 attemptl others were acquitted. All are now free.
 Though the government suspended written guarantees of
 individual rights in 1970 when it suspended the con-
 stitution, the existence of an independent and impartial
 judiciary has mitigated violations of human rights. In
 recent years, the government has embarked on a strategy
 of national reconciliation. This has included lifting
 the state of emergency, appointing members of the three
 opposition parties to key cabinet positions and the
 interim national assembly, and in 1981 passing legisla-
 tion providing for a referendum on elections.
 Not satisfied with these moves, the main opposition group,
 the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP), has turned to
 violence with a series of bombings and sabotage attempts.
 These began in April 1979. In November of that year, a
 village chief and an eighteen year-old girl in northern
 Lesotho were killed by members of the opposition. Sub-
 sequent police operations conducted in villages
 considered sympathetic to the exiles reportedly led to
 several deaths and prompted over seven hundred villagers
 to seek refuge in neighboring South Africa. Interned in
 a refugee camp there, most of these persons have returned
 to Lesotho.
 In 1980 and 1981 there were further armed attacks on
 villages along the South African border and bombings
 and mortar attacks in Maseru (the capital). There have
 been few casualties and property damage has not been
 significant. The government has responded by increasing
 police patrols in troubled areas and detaining and
 questioning persons considered to be opposition
 sympathizers. At the same time amnesty has been offered
 those opposition leaders who wish to return to Lesotho
 and work peacefully with the current government. A
 few have accepted the offer and returned to the country
 unmolested.
 In 1981 there was an escalation of attacks on people
 and property by the BCP. The military wing of the BCP,
 the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA), exploded bombs and
 used firearms in attacking homes of government supporters,
 police posts in areas bordering on South Africa and hotels
 in Maseru. In three instances the LLA launched mortar
 attacks on the city of Maseru. Damage to property,
 fatalities and injuries from these attacks have been
 minimal. Also in the past year, one prominent oppos-
 ition figure was killed and at least one fled from
 Lesotho.
 The Government of Lesotho has charged that the Govern-
 ment of South Africa gives support to the BCP's armed

 attacks against Lesotho and that elements of South Africa's
 security forces have carried out bombing attacks against
 supporters of anti-South Africa Government groups who have
 sought refuge in Lesotho. Neither allegation has been
 proven.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No law -specifically forbids torture, but prohibition of
 its use derives from common law through court established
 precedents. Public law (section 233, subsection 1) states
 that confessions may not be extracted under duress. The
 courts have construed this as a prohibition against
 torture or assault by the police and have extended this
 construction to protect those detained under the Security
 Act. No instances of torture were alleged in 1981.
 b. Cruel, .Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is
 forbidden by law. No instance of such practices has been
 alleged in recent years. Prison conditions in Lesotho
 are acceptable, and prisoners are humanely treated.
 c. Disappearances
 Under emergency security legislation adopted in 1974,
 persons can be arrested without charge and detained for
 renewable periods of 60 days. The law does not oblige the
 government to inform the public or the family of the
 detainee. Recent detentions, however, have been
 well publicized in both the South African press and
 Lesotho's Sesotho language press. No one is known to
 have disappeared permanently. Most detainees have been
 held 10-14 days.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the provisions of the Security Act, detainees may
 be held incommunicado up to 60 days. Detention may not be
 challenged in the courts. The legislation contains
 no provision for public acknowledgment of a person's
 detention.
 In response to armed attacks the government has detained
 and questioned several persons associated with the
 opposition party. In such cases, the detainees have
 usually been held for two weeks and then released without
 any further restrictions upon their activities. All
 those imprisoned for participating in the 1974 coup
 attempt have been released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No trial is accorded to persons detained under the
 emergency security legislation unless formal charges are
 brought against them. All other persons arrested
 are accorded a public trial with the right to legal
 counsel. The judiciary in Lesotho retains its
 independence and integrity; a public trial, including
 rights of appeal, was granted to the leaders of the
 unsuccessful 1974 coup attempt.

 f. Invasion of the Home
 In 1981 there were allegations by the oposition party
 that police authorities invaded the homes of those sus-
 pected of assisting people engaged in armed attacks
 against the government. Warrants are required for
 ordinary police officials to enter private homes, but
 senior police officers may enter homes without warrants
 at their discretion.
 2. Respect for-Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Lesotho has no restrictions on religion but the Security
 Act restricts freedom of speech. Free assembly is not
 guaranteed; consequently political organizations must
 receive permission of the government before they can
 meet. However, the Sesotho language newspapers published
 by the Roman Catholic and Lesotho Evangelical churches
 remain free to criticize the government. The government
 does, however, reward cooperation with sinecures and
 scholarships.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on domestic travel and few on.
 emigration. International passport fees vary with the
 cost of repatriation from the countries for which they
 are valid. For the U.S., the cost is $1,170. Local
 passports are valid for the Republic of South Africa,
 Botswana and Swaziland and cost five rand. Obtaining the
 required police security clearance has proved difficult
 for some opponents of the government. However, in one
 instance in 1981 an outspoken member of the opposition
 was granted travel documentation. Lesotho has acceded to
 the 1951 Convention on Refugees and the 1967 protocol.
 South African refugees and exiles have been taken in
 and are well treated.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political activity has been restricted since 1970, when
 the government suspended the constitution and declared a
 state of emergency. In 1973 an interim national assembly
 was established. While all members are appointed by the
 government, they include representatives of the opposition
 and important local interest groups as well as some tradi-
 tional chiefs. This process gradually has been expanded
 until virtually all national political groups have some
 representation in the government. Parliament approves
 the annual budget and proposes and passes legislation.
 No plans for elections have been announced, but legis-
 lation was passed in 1981 providing for a referendum
 on elections.
 On the local level, citizens can participate in the
 political process through village development committees
 and through the traditional public meeting, the "pitso."
 Labor unions are allowed to bargain collectively with
 employers and enter into contracts, but are discouraged
 from political activity. The government recognizes the
 right to strike, and strikes have taken place. Women
 have equal suffrage rights. The small minority of white
 citizens of Lesotho experience no apparent discrimination.

 3.: Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Lesotho does not deny that violations
 of human rights have occurred and discusses past
 repressive measures openly. The government has
 allowed outside investigations of alleged human rights
 violations. In mid-1978 it met with representatives of
 Amnesty International to discuss the few persons still
 imprisoned at that time for participation in the 1974 coup
 attempt. In September 1981 it met again with Amnesty
 International to discuss the recent spate of bombings,
 murders and detentions.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Lesotho's economy is intimately entwined with that of
 South Africa. At any one time nearly two hundred
 thousand Basotho (out of an estimated population of
 between 1.2 and 1.3 million) are working in South Africa.
 Remittances from these migrant workers, which represent
 an estimated 45 percent of the national income, are essen-
 tial to the economyl but the absence from Lesotho of the
 prime male work force has a negative effect on prospects
 for development, especially in the agricultural sector.
 The majority of farms in Lesotho are worked by women and
 women hold a significant number of responsible positions
 in the civil service. Per'capita GNP in Lesotho is
 4350.00.
 Since Lesotho's dependence on South Africa for the lion's
 share of its income and for virtually all of its economic
 needs has made it intensely aware of its vulnerability
 to economic disruptions (e.g. United Nations sanctions
 against South Africa) or politically inspired economic
 pressures from its powerful neighbor, the government
 has given priority to projects aimed at reducing its
 dependence on South Africa. The government also
 recognizes the dilemma this priority poses for develop-
 ment and the danger of reducing emphasis on the needs
 of 52 percent of the population that live below the
 absolute poverty level.
 There is corruption at various levels of the Government of
 Lesotho, but this has not been a major factor impeding
 the effectiveness of foreign assistance programs.
 The Government of Lesotho has cooperated with donor
 efforts to focus aid on fundamental problems of
 agriculture, health and education, and has enacted a
 major land reform law to encourage more economic
 holdings and higher production. Life expectancy has
 risen from 43.5 years in 1968 to 50.3 years in 1978, and
 the infant mortality is 111 per 1000 live births. Most
 observers in Lesotho also believe there has been an
 increase in the adult literacy rate over the last ten
 years, even though the statistics indicate the contrary
 (59 percent in 1966 as compared to 55 percent in 1979).
 Lesotho's population growth rate of 2.3 percent is not
 high relative to other least developed countries but is of
 concern to both donors and the government, which have
 lately become involved in the family planning area. The
 percentage of the population with access to safe water has
 risen from 3 percent in 1970 to 17 percent.
