 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is committed to the principles of freedom and
 justice and full personal rights assured for all citizens.
 Australian society adheres firmly to the democratic
 traditions inherited from Great Britain. Political,
 economic and social rights are guaranteed under the
 Australian constitution, legislation and common law.
 The Federal Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 pro-
 hibits all forms of racial discrimination based on
 color, race, ethnic background or place of birth. Con-
 currently with the passage of this Act, Australia rati-
 fied the International Convention on the Elimination
 of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, thereby under-
 taking a commitment to combat racism both at home and
 abroad. The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 notwith-
 standing, which overrides any existing laws that may
 operate with a discriminatory effect, the Queensland
 Government has been accused of administering certain laws
 relating to aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in a way
 that has the effect of discriminating between the rights
 of white and black Australians. This fact is recog-
 nized by the Government of Australia which, through
 the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations,
 is seeking to end such vestiges of discrimination.
 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is neither condoned nor practiced in Australia.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Australian law prohibits such punishment and is respected
 in practice. Writs of habeas corpus are available.
 Preventive detention is not practiced.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Australian law prohibits such action and is respected
 in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 (427)
 
 
 428
 Australian law guarantees the right to a fair hearing,
 the right to a fair public trial and the unimpeded right
 of counsel; these guarantees are respected in practice.
 Defendants are informed in advance of charges and have
 pre-trial access to evidence against them.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Effective legal safeguards exist to prevent arbitrary
 invasion of the home in Australia. No search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Australia has one of. the most comprehensive social
 welfare systems among the Western democratic nations.
 Basic food, shelter, health care and social security
 benefits are guaranteed for the entire population,
 including recent immigrants. Social security and
 welfare accounts for the largest single part of the
 Australian Government's budget expenditures, amounting
 to some 28 percent in the fiscal year ending June 10,
 1979. Public education is universal and free and in-
 cludes special facilities for the handicapped. There is
 a general right of ownership of private property which
 is protected by law.
 Aboriginal rights and development are of constant and
 active concern in Australia. Because of deep cultural
 differences between the aboriginal and European popu-
 lations, the Commonwealth Government experienced great
 difficulty in pursuing its former policy of assimila-
 tion through promoting social change among the aborigi-
 nals so that they would become indistinguishable from
 other Australians in standards of living, occupation,
 and participation in community affairs. By late 1975,
 government policy had changed to one of commitment to
 the principle that aboriginals should be as free as
 other Australians to determine their own varied futures.
 The policy of the Queensland Government, however, con-
 tinues to promote the concept of full integration of
 all indigenous people.
 The Government acknowledges that in general the abori-
 ginal population is disadvantaged in such areas as
 education, housing, health and employment. Through
 the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and other federal
 and state agencies, the government has sought to
 secure for aboriginals access to government service
 equal to that accorded other Australian citizens to-
 gether with additional services appropriate to their
 disadvantaged state. Special programs have been under-
 taken to assist aboriginals in becoming self-sufficient.
 These include encouragement of land ownership, expansion
 of employment opportunities, training programs, support for
 small business acquisition, home ownership and involvement
 
 
 429
 in other development projects. These policies are direc-
 ted toward helping the aboriginals to become economically
 self-sufficient while preserving their distinctive culture.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Inclu-
 ding:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Australian law guarantees all of these basic rights and
 they are respected in practice. There is no government-
 owned press and no press censorship. Members of all
 religious sects are free to observe their practices with-
 out interference from the government.
 In West Australia, 1976 amendments to the Police Act
 restrict a person from organizing or conducting a pro-
 cession, meeting, or assembly in a public place with-
 out the permission of the Commissioner of Police. The
 Conmissioner may not, however, withhold such permission
 unless, he has reason to believe there will be a dis-
 turbance. A few trade unionists in West Australia
 have been arrested and fined for violations of this
 law. In Queensland, laws governing street marches
 have led to confrontation between the police and civil
 rights activists.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside
 Australia, including the right of emigration. Race
 is barred as a criterion for approval or rejection
 of an application to immigrate to Australia and, on a
 per capita basis, Australia's acceptance of Indochinese
 refugees is the highest of any country in the world.
 Since 1975 some 25,000 refugees from Indochina have
 been admitted for permanent residence in Australia.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Commonwealth law guarantees this freedom, which is re-
 spected in practice. Complaints have been made that
 certain amendments to the electoral laws of West Australia
 have the effect of restricting the right of aboriginals
 to vote. These provisions relate to enrollment and
 voting procedures and could be applied in a manner to
 discourage voting by aboriginals and others not fluent
 in English In at least one instance, illiterates were
 prevented from using "how to vote" cards and the outcome
 of the elections was overturned by the Australian courts.
 Women have enjoyed full political and civil rights in Austra-
 lia since the turn of the century.   In practice, however,
 they do not participate in the political and economic life
 of the country to the same extent as men. There are six
 women members of the federal Senate, but no woman serves
 currently in the House of Representatives. The Australian
 trade union is strong, well-organized and active both
 in politics and in industrial relations. The rights to
 organize, strike, bargain collectively and lobby are guar-
 anteed in law and exercised in practice.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State has no knowledge of any requests
 to investigate alleged violations of human rights in
 Australia by international or non-governmental organi-
 zations.
