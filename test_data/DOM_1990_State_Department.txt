 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy with a
 popularly elected president and bicameral congress. In
 practice, the political system heavily favors the executive
 branch. The Supreme Court heads an independent judiciary
 whose members are appointed by the Senate. Political parties
 representing the ideological spectrum from left to right
 freely and actively participated in the May election, the
 seventh since the current democratic process began in 1966.
 President Joaquin Balaguer was inaugurated for a new 4-year
 term in August.
 The National Police (PN), the National Department of
 Investigation (DNI), and the military serve as the security
 services. The PN has general investigative and principal
 arrest authority. The military has investigative and general
 arrest authority for armed forces personnel and can arrest
 suspects apprehended by military patrols. The armed forces
 may be used to back up the PN. The DNI is the principal
 national investigative body for national security concerns and
 does not have arrest authority. Formed in 1988, the National
 Drug Control Directorate coordinates domestic and international
 narcotics programs and brings under a single authority
 elements of the PN, military, and DNI. All security services
 are under control of the Government and are generally
 responsive to civilian authority.
 The Dominican Republic has a mixed economy based primarily on
 agriculture (approximately 15 percent of the gross domestic
 product--GDP) and services. The Government accounts for
 nearly 25 percent of the GDP and controls several major
 industries (such as sugar, the national airline, and
 electricity). Historically, sugar has been the principal
 export, although tourism, export processing zones (EPZ's), and
 remittances from Dominicans living abroad now generate far
 more foreign exchange. The country continues to face the
 burdens of a $4 billion external debt, a 90-percent inflation
 rate (estimate for 1990), a rapidly growing population (2.3
 percent annually), and concomitant high levels of unemployment
 (some 29 percent) and underemployment (perhaps 20-25 percent).
 The principal human rights concerns in the Dominican Republic
 in 1990 included electoral irregularities, retaliation against
 supporters of opposition parties, incidents of excessive force
 and mistreatment of detainees by police, and some violation of
 worker rights, such as antiunion discrimination and forced
 recruitment of Haitian migrant workers by state officials. In
 a 1990 report, the human rights group Americas Watch (AW)
 provided extensive anecdotal evidence of official abuse of the
 human and worker rights of Haitian migrant workers. A survey
 of several state-owned sugar plantations by U.S. officials
 found less evidence of such abuses during 1990 than in
 previous years, a trend that may have been due more to
 increased numbers of Haitian cane cutters voluntarily seeking
 work on the plantations than to any change in government
 policy. The Government has denied that it supported or
 condoned violations of worker rights. In October, President
 Balaguer appeared to take some initial steps to address these
 problems when he formed a commission to revise the labor code
 and issued a presidential decree designed to improve the
 status of Haitian workers.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of political killings in 1990. In
 October, police arrested and severely and repeatedly beat four
 men charged with killing a policeman. One of the prisoners,
 Felipe Lapeix, died from these beatings. At year's end the
 National Police Inspector General was heading a high-level
 police Board of Inquiry into the death. During a general
 strike in August 14 civilians and 1 police officer died. Two
 of the civilian deaths were from secondary causes (heart
 attack and infant suffocation from tear-gas) and the rest
 resulted from gunshot wounds. These wounds were evidently
 from indiscriminate weapon firing, principally by security
 forces, but also (to a much lesser degree) by civilians. The
 police death resulted from an auto accident during pursuit of
 looters. During the general strike of September 23-28, three
 persons died, two by gunshots and one from a thrown rock. One
 of the two gunshot deaths was Jesus Rafael Diplan Martine, a
 top official of the Broad Front of Popular Struggle (FALPO),
 reportedly in a gun battle with police.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of politically motivated
 disappearances in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading-
 Treatment or Punishment
 Several groups-, including legal associations, the Church, and
 human rights organizations, as well as the media made credible
 charges that security forces mistreat prisoners. The police
 have made efforts to follow up charges of significant abuse by
 their officials. As a result, the police report that over
 2,000 policemen were dismissed from the force for abuse of
 their position from October 1989 through November 1990 (the
 period covered by the current chief of police). Of these
 2,000, roughly 70 percent were dismissed for noncriminal
 infractions and 30 percent (who were subsequently brought up
 on criminal charges in court) for serious offenses. There
 were several credible reports that employees of private firms
 were verbally abused and physically threatened by officials at
 the Department of Forestry, which is staffed by military
 personnel, during investigations of alleged illegal logging
 and pollution. In addition, many individuals claimed that the
 Forestry Department was using unduly harsh methods to enforce
 arbitrary and legally questionable decisions. In November
 Congress took up the issue and requested the director of the
 Forestry Department to respond to the charges, a request which
 was ignored. On November 23, President Balaguer publicly
 censured the head of the Forestry Department for exceeding his
 authority, requesting that he be more humane and equitable in
 enforcing forestry laws.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution stipulates that suspects may be detained for
 a maximum of 48 hours for investigation before arraignment,
 after which they must be charged or released. In 1990 there
 continued to be cases in which persons were held beyond the
 
 
 590
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 48-hour limit. The vast majority involved only one or two
 extra days, resulting from the severe limitation of
 administrative resources, the large workload, and the lack of
 coordinated or uniform procedures in the system. The police,
 the Attorney General's office and the national court system
 recognized the problem and began joint efforts in September to
 speed up processing within their own organizations and to
 initiate standard procedures among the three.
 In late October, the deepening economic crisis and increasing
 social unrest resulted in a marked increase of credible
 charges of police and military surveillance, arbitrary
 detention, and failure to comply with the 48-hour detention
 rule. The focus of these activities was on organizers of the
 various strikes and protests against the Government. There
 were also protests, principally from the business sector and
 upper middle class, of improper detention and abusive behavior
 in connection with government efforts to crack down on the
 extensive hard currency black market.
 There were credible reports of persons being held by the
 police even after court-issued release orders had been
 presented. Police and prison officials complained that courts
 were releasing dangerous criminals or letting them off with
 light sentences. One case involved Luis Lizardo Cabrera,
 accused in the terrorist bombing death of a young girl in
 1989. The chief of police stated in September that despite a
 court order to release him, Lizardo would continue to be
 imprisoned because he represented a "danger" to the general
 public. Another case involved 19 members of the Dominican
 Electric Company (CDE) union (Sitracode) who continued to be
 held for several days in August by Santiago police after a
 writ of habeas corpus had been granted by the Santiago Third
 Circuit Court. The Congress took up the question of revamping
 the habeas corpus law in late spring, but without passing new
 legislation. A newly elected Congress took office in August,
 and several Congressmen announced their intention to seek
 constitutional reform in many areas of the Justice system,
 including the habeas corpus law. A new drug bill, passed in
 July, greatly limits the application of habeas corpus to those
 arrested under drug enforcement statutes.
 There continued to be credible charges in 1990 that security
 forces forcibly detained Haitians in connection with efforts
 to compel them to work on state-owned sugar refining complexes
 (see Section 2.d.).
 There were no credible reports of exile of citizens for
 expressing views contrary to or critical of the Government.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system includes a Supreme Court, appellate court,
 and courts of first instance. Judges at all levels are
 appointed by the Senate. They are nominally independent of
 the executive branch and are subject to removal or transfer by
 a majority vote in the Senate. Their terms of office
 correspond roughly to that of the President and other elected
 officials. The newly elected Senate can either designate
 their replacements or reconfirm them.
 There were credible charges that a number of judges and
 prosecutors accept bribes to manipulate the outcome of cases.
 The Government continued to expand its professional training
 programs (begun in 1988) for the police, judges, and
 
 
 591
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 government attorneys. In October, the three branches of the
 justice system formally decided to create a joint professional
 training facility.
 The Constitution provides for public trial. Court-appointed
 lawyers normally are provided at public expense to indigents
 in felony criminal cases, but only rarely in criminal .
 misdemeanor cases. There are chronic delays in the judicial
 process. Although the right to judicial determination of the
 legality of detention exists, preventive detention of those
 awaiting trial is legal and commonly employed, and many of
 those accused remain in prison for lengthy periods awaiting
 trial. This practice, coupled with a lack of administrative
 and financial support for the system, has created a major
 backlog of- cases.
 There are no known political prisoners. There are no special-
 courts for political or national security-cases, and civilians
 may not be tried by a military court, Members of the armed
 forces are tried by military courts, except under specific
 circumstances an only after review-by a military board.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no credible reports of arbitrary governmental
 interference with the private lives of persons or families.
 Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the home are
 observed. A residence may notbe searched except in the
 presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, excluding
 cases-of "hot pursuit" or instances where there is probable
 cause to believe that a crime is actually being committed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These liberties are provided for by law And are respected in
 practice. Dominicans of all political persuasions enjoy
 freedom of speech and regularly exercise it. The numerous
 privately owned radio-rad television stations air all
 political points of view. Dominican newspapers are-privately
 owned and freely reflect independent and opposition points of
 view. There is no government censorship on political
 grounds. Public and private universities enjoy broad academic
 freedom.
 During the days immediately surrounding the May 16 election,
 the Central Electoral Board (JCE-the autonomous agency
 charged with administering the election) took control of the
 broadcast media under the authority of the electoral law. All
 broadcast news of the election came from only the JCE, and
 even international cable programs were suppressed. However,
 the print media were not under the control of the JCE and
 provided full coverage of the election as well as other news
 topics.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and are,
 for the most part, respected in practice. Outdoor public
 marches and meetings require government permits, which are
 routinely granted. During the campaign, rallies by all major
 parties were common, with some attracting more than 100,000
 people. Indoor gatherings of political parties, labor unions,
 
 
 592
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 and other associations have generally not been restricted by
 the Government. However, during a confrontation between the
 State Electric company (CDE) and Sitracode union members,
 police and military units surrounded the union headquarters
 during a meeting on August 24. Some 1,800 persons were
 detained while security forces blocked entry or exit to the
 building. Police claimed that they were seeking to retrieve
 company vehicles assigned to fired employees. The police and
 military finally withdrew with some surrendered- vehicles the
 next day.
 Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors, teachers, and
 others function freely and maintain relations with counterpart
 international bodies of diverse political views. Although
 formed as professional associations, many of these
 organizations take on roles similar to those of labor unions,
 including protest activities, strikes, and collective
 bargaining.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Discrimination on religious grounds is prohibited by the
 Constitution. There are no religious requirements to hold
 public office, no restrictions on the practice of religious
 faiths, and no social discrimination based on religion. The
 Dominican population is predominantly Roman Catholic, and the
 Church's preeminent position is recognized in the Concordat
 between the Dominican Republic and the Holy See. There have
 been no credible reports of government interference with the
 free practice of religion and several non-Roman Catholic
 faiths have well established churches in the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal restrictions on:travel within or outside
 the country for Dominican citizens. In practice, Dominican
 citizens are able frCly to travel within, depart from, and
 return to the country.
 There were continued .credible charges of forced recruitment
 and detention of Haitians to work on sugar plantations in 1990
 (see Section 6.c.).
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy. The
 President, all 150 members of the Senate and Chamber of
 Deputies, and the mayors and city councilmen of over 100
 municipalities are freely elected every 4 years by the
 citizenry by secret ballot and universal suffrage (except for
 active duty military and police, who may not vote). The
 Governors of the 29 provinces are appointed by the President.
 The nation enjoys a functioning multiparty system. Opposition
 groups of the left, right, and center operate openly and
 participated in the May 1990 elections in which 60 percent of
 the registered electorate voted.
 President Balaguer was reelected on May 16 by the narrowest of
 margins, gaining 35 percent of the valid vote, approximately
 one percent more than his opponent. While votes were being
 tabulated following the election, opposition leaders charged
 fraud and asserted that some of their party members were
 
 
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 harassed by the Government. One opposition party offered
 evidence of apparently false voter registration, altered
 documents, and inaccurately tabulated results. The Central
 Electoral Board (JCE) refused to make voting records available
 for inspection, and suspended the voting verification process
 shortly after the election. Between election day and the
 inauguration, 3 months later, the Government dismissed many
 public employees who were members of opposition parties.
 President Balaguer conceded later that there had been election
 irregularities, but-government and ruling party officials
 denied all charges of systematic fraud. Most international
 observers of the electioji concluded that there had been
 irregularities, but that no conclusive proof of fraud was
 presente4.
 In directing the administration of the Government, the
 President exercises- his authority fully. Through use of the
 veto, discretion to act by decree, and influence as the leader
 of his party, he also may take a leading role in enacting laws
 and regulations. The Congress traditionally has had limited
 powers but provides an open forum for the free exchange of
 views and debate. During the first half of 1990, the
 President enjoyed an overwhelming majority in the Senate and a
 near majority in the Chamber of Deputies. However, the
 Congress was largely paralyzed by internal difficulties and
 the election campaign. The election altered the composition
 of both houses so as to reduce presidential influence in
 Congress. In the new legislature, the President's party holds
 only a bare majority in the Senate (16 of 30 seats) and is in
 the minority (42 of 120 seats) in the Chamber of Deputies.\
 t
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no reports that the Government restricted the
 activities of human- rights organizations. Nongovernmental
 human rights organizations operate freely without government
 interference. They include the Dominican Human Rights
 Committee, the Dominican Union for the Defense of Human
 Rights, the Catholic Church, the Lutheran World Foundation,
 the National Committee of Human and Labor Rights, and others.
 AW and other overseas, nongovernmental human rights groups
 visited the Dominican Republic and were able to operate
 without restriction. The major labor confederations also have
 offices and internal organizations which work to defend the
 human rights of union members.
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in international
 and regional human rights bodies and supports efforts to
 promote human rights in international forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on sex and race is prohibited by law.
 Nonetheless, women traditionally have not shared equal social
 and economic status or opportunity with men. This inequality
 is not based in the legal system; in fact, women are
 guaranteed equal protection under the law. In addition, the
 labor code provides special provisions to protect jobs and the
 worker's health during pregnancy. Still, men continue to
 dominate traditional "male" job markets and hold the
 overwhelming majority of leadership positions in all sectors.
 
 
 594
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 It is noteworthy that this is changing, albeit slowly, with
 women beginning to make visible inroads in employment rolls
 and to hold higher and more public leadership positions.
 In the past, violence against women has not received much
 public attention. In the latter half of the year, there were
 serious indications that this problem has been underestimated
 in the Dominican Republic. There is a growing public
 awareness of and sensitivity towards such issues as domestic
 violence and gender discrimination. Much of this new
 awareness resulted from efforts of several groups including
 the Dominican Association of Women Voters, the International
 Round Table, women affairs officers of all the major political
 parties and labor groups, INSTRAW (U.N. Institute for the
 Advancement of Women), Women's Legal Service Central, Women in
 Development, Women and Health Collective of Santo Domingo, and
 Women's Crea House (a halfway home for drug addicts). Also in
 1990, several of the daily newspapers and some local magazines
 changed from carrying occasional stories to featuring regular
 in-depth reporting on violence against women, women's rights,
 and related topics. On October 29, Congress named November 25
 the "National Day of Nonviolence Against Women."
 For historical reasons and because of sharp cultural
 differences, there is prejudice against Haitians in Dominican
 society. This often translates into discrimination against
 those with darker skin (i.e., Haitian appearing) (see Section
 2.d.). Dark-skinned Dominicans, including some of Haitian
 descent, have been successful in a variety of fields,
 including elected political office. Nevertheless, persons of
 recent Haitian descent traditionally fill the lowest economic
 and social niches.
 AW has charged that children of Haitian descent are often
 unable to continue school beyond the sixth grade due to their
 inability to obtain birth and other required legal
 documentation. The Government has stated that many Haitians,
 including Dominican-born children of Haitian parents, have
 never sought to register with the Government. Fear of
 deportation and discrimination by government bureaucrats often
 prevent Haitian migrant families from obtaining proper
 documentation for school-age children. A special program
 begun in October to address status questions for Haitian
 workers may help in resolving this problem (see Section 6.c.).
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the freedom to organize labor
 unions, and also for the right of labor to strike and of the
 private sector to lock out. However, unions operate under the
 handicap of an antiquated labor code that gives unions few
 rights vis-a-vis management and, in practice, gives little
 effective protection to organizers or union officials. In
 October, President Balaguer formed a commission to draft a
 revised labor code to fulfill a pact signed with labor leaders
 in order to avqrt a general strike in September.
 International Labor Organization (ILO) committees in 1990
 noted in the Dominican labor code several restrictions on the
 right to strike, including the blanket prohibition on sympathy
 strikes and political strikes, and provisions for compulsory
 arbitration. The labor code grants the right to strike but
 prohibits strikes in the public sector (including
 
 
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 government-owned enterprises such as the sugar plantations)
 and general strikes. Nevertheless, professional organizations
 representing public service workers do strike, and there were
 major work stoppages in 1990 by doctors, nurses, teachers,
 agronomists, and judges. The October decree to review the
 labor code called specifically for the review of those
 sections which deal with political activity and strikes in the
 public sector. A general strike took place in November  it
 was called by labor confederations and "popular" organizations
 that alleged that the President had failed ta fulfill a
 20-point program which he had agreed to in an attempt to
 prevent the strike in September. The Government labeled the
 strike "subversive," and the Labor Secretary requested the
 revocation of the, official recognition of the labor
 confederations that called it.
 The labor code specifies in detail the steps- required to
 establish a legal union, federation, or confederation. In
 general, this has not been a major impediment for unions to
 obtain recognition, as evidenced by the large number of
 functioning labor organizations. Nevertheless, the Government
 can use a union's failure to comply with every detail as, an
 excuse to withhold recognition, and allegedly uses this
 practice to inhibit union formation in the Export Processing
 Zones (EPZ's).
 Organized labor in the Dominican Republic represents about 12
 percent of the work force and is divided among nine competing
 and highly politicized confederations-and a number of
 independent unions. A sector-wide umbrella labor organization
 formed for the June 1989 general strike fell apart in_1990. A
 new labor umbrell& group of the three- principal national
 federations (and a few small labor groups) coalesced in July
 to coordinate labor's position in the- August general strike
 and to- negotiate with the private sector and- the Government
 following the strike. In October, this group also began to
 disintegrate- as a result of-conflicting goals of the members.
 A number of trade unions are allied with Dominican political
 parties. Labor groups are politically diverse and several are
 associated with regional and international labor organizations,
 including the International Confederatiom of Free Trade
 Unions, the World Confederation of Labor, the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions and the
 Communist regional trade union organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 ILO committees noted in 1990 that the Government still needs
 to strengthen measures protecting workers against antiunion
 discrimination. The labor code clearly stipulates that
 workers cannot be dismissed because of their trade union
 membership or activities. Still, there are complaints that
 this provision is violated and that labor leaders suffer
 discrimination. Article 69 of the code essentially permits an
 employer or employee unilaterally to end an open work contract
 simply with a notice of termination. In September President
 Balaguer agreed with labor leaders to establish a commission
 to examine possible changes to Article 69.
 In 1990 there were two significant problems concerning the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. The first was the
 longstanding charge by labor that the Government illegally and
 systematically denied this right to workers in the EPZ's, even
 though they are covered by the labor code. One of the
 
 
 596
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 fastest-growing economic sectors, the EPZ's employ over 5
 percent of the work force and now represent the third largest
 source of employment after the Government and the sugar
 industry. Yet, there does not appear to be any active,
 recognized union or collectively bargained contract in the 18
 EPZ's, which have over 250 companies and 120,000 workers.
 There were credible reports that labor representatives were
 not allowed access to some of the EPZ's for purposes of
 promoting unionism. Several labor organizations charged that
 information from union recognition applications was given to
 EPZ companies, allowing them to fire union activists and thus
 prevent unionization. Trade union leaders in November alleged
 that attempts to register unions of EPZ companies have
 resulted in the dismissal of the activists from their jobs,
 including in at least one U.S.-owned company. The company
 denied the charge.
 The second problem area resulted from a major confrontation
 between the state-owned Dominican Electric Corporation (CDE)
 and its workers union (Sitracode). The ailing CDE has had
 financial and productivity problems for several years. In
 mid-August, President Balaguer named a new CDE administrator
 who promptly charged Sitracode with sabotage, featherbedding,
 and corruption, and began massive firings of Sitracode leaders
 and activists, although the labor code requires individual
 notice and dismissal for cause. The union responded with
 spontaneous demonstrations. Government security forces moved
 in and arrested several hundred Sitracode members, including
 virtually the entire union leadership. The next week,
 security forces surrounded union headquarters and detained
 some 1,800 union employees (see Section 2). Some were held
 well beyond the 48 hours allowed by law.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law. Unlike in
 previous years, there was no agreement between the Haitian and
 Dominican Governments to import Haitian cane cutters for the
 1989-90 sugar harvest (estimates of the Haitian community in
 the Dominican Republic range from 600,000 to 1,000,000, of
 which 90 percent are said by the Dominican Government to be
 illegal immigrants.)
 AW provided extensive anecdotal evidence that in 1989 and
 again in 1990, the Government and the state-owned sugar
 corporation CEA forcibly recruited Haitian seasonal
 agricultural workers and then restricted them to work on
 specific sugar plantations. In particular, the AW report
 quoted numerous Haitian workers who said that security forces
 and CEA officials paid recruiters to lure the Haitians into
 the Dominican Republic and take them to CEA plantations.
 These workers told of holding pens under military guard,
 confiscation of personal effects, and physical and
 psychological abuse by CEA employees to restrict the workers
 to the plantation. These issues have been under review since
 1983 by a Commission of Inquiry, a direct contacts mission (in
 1988) and a number of other ILO committees, and in each of the
 past 3 years the Committee on the Application of Conventions
 and Recommendations (CACR) censured the Dominican Republic in
 a "special paragraph" in its annual report. In its 1990
 report, deploring the Government's cancellation of a mission
 of a representative of the ILO Director General to witness the
 1989 sugar harvest, the CACR cited the Dominican Republic for
 "continued failure to implement" Convention 105 on the
 abolition of forced labor and a related convention--the most
 
 
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 severe censure available to the CACR. Among the practices
 cited by the CACR was the roundup of illegal Haitians in the
 Dominican Republic by the army and police to work in the
 state-owned sugar plantations, the failure to prohibit
 salaries in the form of vouchers, improper control of the
 weighing of the sugar cane cut by the Haitians, deferred
 payment of part of the salary, the failure of the Government
 to assure that the Haitians are aware of their rights, and the
 failure to provide adequate inspection services in the
 plantations. In several on-site surveys of state sugar
 plantations, and in discussions with Haitian rights activists,
 Church leaders, labor leaders, and Haitian sugar workers, the
 U.S. Embassy found that abuse of Haitian human and worker
 rights in 1990 was not as pervasive as in prior years,
 although'this trend may have beem due more to the abundance of
 Haitians voluntarily seeking work than ta any change in
 government policy. At the end of 1990, the Iominican
 Government invited the ILO to send a new mission to examine
 working conditions in the country-
 In October 1990, President Balaguer issued a decree intended
 to regularize the legal status-of Haitians living in the
 Dominican Republic and to require CEA administrators to sign
 work contracts with the Haitian sugar workers. The contracts
 are supposed to detai-l the rights and privileges of the
 workers, including the right to quit and return to Haiti,.
 However, this decree is essentially a reiteration of labQr
 code provisions which in the past have rarely been enforced in
 practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Dominican labor code prohibits employment of youths under
 14 years of age, and restricts the nighttime employment of
 youths aged 14 to 18. The' labor code also provides that
 employees under age 18 work no more than 8 hours a day, and
 specifies that those 18 years and younger may not be employed
 in dangerous or unhealthy jobs. The high level of
 unemployment, the erosion of real wages by inflation, and the
 lack of a social safety net create pressures on families to
 allow children to generate supplemental income. In addition,
 many children are left to make it on their own. In practice,
 young people, including minors younger than 14 years of age,
 engage in a variety of work which violates the labor
 regulations. There are many youths in the informal economy,
 selling newspapers, washing car windows, shining shoes, or
 begging in the streets. During the last 2 years, the
 Secretariat of Labor has investigated the employment of youths
 in Santo Domingo and Santiago and has attempted to enforce the
 law in cases where companies employ underage workers in
 violation of the law. Some young workers have obtained work
 permits and have been able to continue their employment.
 Those who were unable to obtain permits have been dismissed.
 Some companies have been subjected to small fines for
 violating the law.
 The AW report quoted underage youths who said they were being
 used to harvest sugar cane for CEA. While this practice
 exists, it is not widespread or approved by the Government.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor code establishes that all workers are entitled to 24
 hours of rest after 6 8-hour days of work; in practice, a
 typical workweek is Monday through Friday, plus half a day on
 
 
 598
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Saturday, but longer hours are not, unusual.- Safety and health
 conditions at places of work do not always meet legal
 standards. ILO committees in 1990 criticized the Dominican
 Republic for failing to meet a commitment to set up a national
 labor inspection system covering nearly all occupational
 sectors and for failing to send labor inspection reports to
 the ILO.
 Conditions among agricultural workers are in general much
 worse than among urban workers, with little rest and long
 hours during harvest and planting seasons. Some observers
 alleged that Haitian workers on CEA plantations are sometimes
 not allowed to eat or rest during the day at harvest time and
 are required to work significantly longer than the legal
 48-hour week. In other cases, cane harvesters voluntarily
 work extra hours to increase their income. Although life in
 the sugar fields is hard, many of the problems found in
 Haitian worker villages, or bateys, such as disease and lack
 of schooling, medical facilities, running water, and sewage
 systems, are also found in many parts of the country and are
 not suffered uniquely by Haitians. Nevertheless, both AW and
 a 1990 New York Times article provide credible descriptions of
 CEA plantations that manipulate Haitians into living on credit
 at exorbitant interest rates, that pay unfair wages, and that
 employ security guards who abuse and confine workers to
 barracks. ILO bodies have doubted that it is possible for a
 sugar worker to cut a sufficient tonnage of cane in 8 hours to
 receive the statutory minimum wage for agricultural workers at
 the rates set by CEA. In October 1990, President Balaguer
 ordered the Secretary of Labor to place special
 representatives at CEA plantations to monitor working
 conditions.
 During 1990, inflation seriously eroded real wages. In
 connection with a major economic reform program implemented in
 August, the Government raised public wages by 30 percent while
 reducing subsidies, thus causing prices on some basic goods to
 rise by a considerably higher percentage. The Government also
 announced a 38 percent devaluation (following a 16 percent
 devaluation in April). In September the National Wage Board
 decreed a 60 percent pay raise for private sector workers.
 The net effect of the pay raises and devaluations was that the
 public sector minimum wage fell from $80 in August 1989 to $65
 in August 1990, while the private sector minimum wage remained
 essentially static, changing from about $111 in October 1989
 to about $110 in September 1990.
 According to labor leaders and many private sector
 businessmen, the vast majority of workers receive only the
 minimum wage. The current minimum wage is not sufficient,
 even with high government subsidies on essential goods and
 services (both of which are in increasingly short supply), to
 maintain a small family at a minimally acceptable standard of
 living. The major economic reforms undertaken by the
 Government during August and September significantly raised
 the cost of living.
