 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) is a totalitarian state
 ruled by the Vietnamese Communist Party, the sole source of
 power. Although there were significant leadership changes in
 1986, the ruling group remains essentially those who fought
 the long war of independence from France, took power in the
 north after the country was partitioned in 1954, launched the
 armed effort to gain control of the Republic of Vietnam in the
 early 1960's, and unified Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in
 1975.
 Nationalist movements have characterized Vietnam's history and
 culture for more than 1,000 years. Resistance against
 encroaching Chinese empires to the north and Vietnamese
 expansion at the expense of declining civilizations (the Cham
 and Khmer) to the south and west have had a major effect on
 Vietnamese political values, reinforcing a perception of
 Vietnam as the naturalleader of Indochina and fostering a
 narrow sense of identity in the generally northern-based
 leadership group.
 This cultural and historical background has important
 implications for human rights in Vietnam. Regional,
 religious, ethnic, and other groups outside the Communist core
 are viewed with suspicion. The loyalty of southerners has
 been questioned because of their separate political and
 cultural history. Many religious leaders, despite legally
 guarahteed freedom of religion, have been imprisoned on
 political charges. Ethnic Chinese Vietnamese, who are
 considered a potential fifth column, are closely watched and
 discriminated against. Cham Muslims in the south and the
 tribesmen of the central highlands are targets of government
 campaigns to erase their cultural identities.
 The public security apparatus is pervasive in the surveillance
 and control of the citizenry. Arrests for alleged political
 crimes do not require warrants; the Government can imprison
 those suspected of political crimes in "reeducation camps"
 without trial or charge. Fundamental rights and liberties,
 including freedom of association and the right to privacy, are
 severely restricted. Vietnam also plays the key role in
 determining the state of human rights in neighboring
 Cambodia. Major violations of Cambodian human rights have
 been perpetrated during the Vietnamese occupation.
 The overall human rights situation remained generally
 unchanged in 1987, but in the months following the December
 1986 Sixth Party Congress, some indications of a more tolerant
 government attitude appeared. Before the Congress, the media
 became much more open in revealing failings of the regime,
 paving the way for some of the old guard to step down in favor
 of leaders identified with economic reform. At the Congress
 itself the new party General Secretary promised a more open
 approach and called for substantial reforms. In the year that
 followed, articles critical of government officials became
 common, and signs of a more positive approach to human rights
 were also evident, including a relatively large amnesty for
 political prisoners, and calls for writers to be "courageously"
 critical of government mistakes.

 VIETNAM
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Information on current conditions in reeducation camps is
 scarce (see Section l.c. below), but former reeducation camp
 prisoners have reported summary executions for escape attempts
 and resistance to camp authorities. A former inmate in a
 prison for persons who have attempted to leave Vietnam
 illegally has reported that prisoners who refused to obey
 guards' orders were executed. Other reports indicate that
 inmates have been shot while attempting to escape from the
 camps. Conditions in the camps are difficult; a significant
 number of deaths have resulted from malnutrition, exhaustion,
 and other unnatural causes. There is little current
 information on the activities of minority and ethnic
 Vietnamese resistance groups fighting government authority
 within Vietnam. In the past, these groups have targeted
 Vietnamese military units and, less often, public security and
 administrative officials. The number of such attacks in
 recent years appears to be very small.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of systematic political kidnaping by
 government security organizations since the period immediately
 following the fall of the Saigon Government in 1975, when
 thousands were taken into custody extralegally. There have
 been no reports of disappearances or hostage-taking by forces
 resisting government authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There are credible and consistent reports from refugees
 concerning the severity of the conditions fQr prisoners in the
 reeducation camps and prisons. These conditions have often
 resulted in acute suffering and permanent physical impairment.
 Prisoners face severe and often arbitrary punishment for minor
 infractions of camp rules, substandard nutrition, and poor or
 nonexistent medical care. Refugees have reported that as of
 1985 prison authorities provided a food ration of two bowls of
 rice with salt per day. Prisoners' families made up the
 shortfall; those without help from relatives suffered greatly.
 Refugees have also reported that some prisoners were shackled
 together at night to make escape more difficult.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 For major crimes, including, alleged political offenses, public
 security officials may legally apprehend and search suspects
 without a warrant, then hold them for an indefinite period.
 Refugees have reported that authorities sometimes wait several
 months before notifying relatives of those arrested.
 For routine crimes, a suspect may be apprehended on a warrant
 which stipulates the nature of the crime and which authorizes
 detention for 2 months prior to trial. A 2-month extension of
 the detention period may be obtained on application. There is
 no provision for bail or legal counsel prior to trial. Those
 suspected of political crimes may be sent to reeducation camps
 for an indefinite period without trial or formal charge. The
 
 
 830
 VIETNAM
 Government continues to hold large numbers of persons in the
 camps, which are an integral part of the prison system.
 Camp populations are composed of ordinary criminals,
 prostitutes, drug addicts, political prisoners, persons
 apprehended attempting to flee the country, intellectuals,
 former military chaplains, and clergy from both Buddhist and
 Christian groups, as well as former officials and military
 officers associated with the Republic of Vietnam. The
 Government'uses the camps to remove from society those persons
 whom it sees as dissident elements, particularly leaders. In
 the camps, the authorities attempt: to produce conformity
 through confinement, hard labor, self-criticism, and
 indoctrination. Allegations of the use of torture continue.
 Many d4taihees have indeterminate sentences and face the
 prospect of indefinite penal labor.
 Although, according to one report, basic sentences for many
 former Republic of Vietnam officials range from 2 through 7
 years, sentencing appears to be arbitrary. The report asserted
 that the length of sentence correlated directly to the rank and
 position held {(frmdr-intelligence and psychological warfare
 officers were given dspecially severe sentences)-and inversely
 correlated to the bribe paid by the detainee's family. In a
 small move toward leniency, Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon)
 authorities in July announced that reeducation could be
 deferred for those who were pregnant, ill, related to war
 invalids or war dead, or faced with serious family
 difficulties.
 Hanoi media have reported that a small number of the 90,000
 members of the former Republic of Vietnam Government sent to
 reeducation camps in 1975 are still being detained, but would
 be released "if they show real repentance." Accurate figures
 are not available. In private conversations, Vietnamese
 officials have stated that a "few thousand" remain in the
 camps. Over the past 12 years, thousands of prisoners have
 been released. In September the Government announced an
 amnesty involving what Hanoi media said was a "larger number
 than in previous years." The Government reportedly released
 6,685 prisoners and reduced terms of 5,320 others. According
 to a Western press report, those freed included 2,500 from
 reeducation camps. The Vietnamese media reported that the
 Government released 480 who had been officials in the south
 before 1975, including 9 former general officers.
 Forced labor has been used by Vietnamese, and by local
 authorities in Cambodia under Vietnamese control, for projects
 to improve the logistical infrastructure for Vietnamese
 occupation troops. Credible reports indicate that the
 Vietnamese have also used forced Cambodian labor to construct
 militarX.f9 rtifications and defensive barriers along the
 Thai-Caftodian border. A number of government projects in
 Vietnam, such as road building and lumbering, have used forced
 labor provided by reeducation camp prisoners. The adverse
 effects of this labor, exacerbated by poor medical treatment,
 include malnutrition, exhaustion, and sometimes death.
 e. -Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Vietnamese legal system is characterized by arbitrary
 detention, without charge or other form of legal process,
 under the guise of reeducation. The defense counsel is
 supposed to ensure that proper legal procedures are followed,
 in accordance with the defendant's rights under the
 
 
 831
 VIETNAM
 Constitution, and to explain the proceedings to the defendant.
 However, the defense counsel is not an advocate for the
 defendant as in other countries that have both common law and
 civil law systems. In general, the legal system operates as
 an agency for the enforcement of regime directives; it has no
 independence from political intervention. Whether a new penal
 code announced in mid-1985 has engendered any true reform in
 the legal system is not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government operates a nationwide system of population
 surveillance and control through a household registration
 system and party-appointed block wardens who use informants to
 keep track of each person's activities. This system exists in
 both urban and rural areas. It works imperfectly in southern
 Vietnam, however, partly because of a shortage of trusted party
 workers. There have been reports of official and nonofficial
 security wardens conducting searches of homes for draft-age
 males in ordnr to fulfill draft quotas. There continue to be
 reliable reports that Ministry of the Interior officials
 inspect and sometimes confiscate mail and packages sent to
 Vietnam, particularly those sent to politically suspect
 persons or to persons of Chinese origin. Outgoing mail is
 also subject to inspection and censorship.
 The regime has widely publicized its program to relocate its
 people to "New Economic Zones" in virgin or unproductive rural
 areas in order to reduce unemployment in urban centers and
 expand agricultural production. In many cases, the
 resettlement process has involved forms of coercion as local
 officials have striven to meet quotas. The resettlement
 program targeted those whose views and backgrounds were seen
 as politically suspect and who therefore were often unable to
 find employment. Conditions in these zones are reportedly
 extremely poor. Almost no basic services are provided,
 although the Government does pledge to supply housing, tools,
 seeds, and fertilizer. Many resettled persons found it
 impossible to maintain life in these zones and have returned
 to the cities where they are forced to live without the ration
 and neighborhood registration cards essential to procuring
 regular employment, food, and essential services. Recently,
 the Government acknowledged that living and working conditions
 in the zones were not satisfactory. As a result, according to
 a Western press report, Hanoi has modified the program and
 reduced the number slated to be moved in the 1986-1990 5-year
 plan from 3 to 1.5 million. The target for 1987 was 300,000,
 but Vietnamese media reported that as of September only
 250,000 had left the cities for the New Economic Zones.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is severely limited in Vietnam. The
 Ministry of Culture and Information and Communist Party organs
 control all newspapers, books, and other publications, as well
 as all cultural exhibitions. Criticism of the party and the
 Government is allowed only within limits set by the
 authorities. In the period leading up to the December 1986
 Party Congress, the media published a number of critical
 articles, presumably aimed at easing senior leaders out of
 .power. In line with his more open style, the new party
 General Secretary, Nguyen Van Linh, initiated a series of
 
 
 832
 VIETNAM
 articles in May 1987 outlining what needed to be done to put
 the country on the right track. Responding to this more
 critical approach, the media published a number of reports
 revealing corruption and inefficiency. In September, however,
 the authorities warned journalists not to attack shortcomings
 "excessively." In another move towards greater openness, in
 October Nguyen Van Linh urged writers to expose shortcomings
 in the system. He acknowledged that many were loath to do so
 because they feared reprisals, and he promised that a party
 resolution on culture and arts would be forthcoming.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are prohibitions against meeting either publicly or
 privately to criticize or protest government actions or
 policies. Nongovernmental organizations, such as church
 groups, can meet only for approved and narrowly defined
 objectives, such as religious services.
 In lieu of independent labor groups, "unions" have been set up
 under the Vietnam Federation of Trade Unions, which is
 controlled by the Communist Party. Claiming 3 million members,
 the Federation's stated goal is to increase party control and
 economic production, rather than to improve and protect the
 welfare of its members.
 There is no right to bargain collectively or to strike. Mass
 organizations, such as women's federations, have been organized
 in other sectors of the population. They perform the same
 functions of control, propaganda, and-policy dissemination
 within their respective sectors as do the labor organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government tolerates the existence of religious groups and
 allows religious services, but perceives religious groups as
 potential seedbeds of subversion and political opposition. It
 has consistently attempted to divide and control the Catholic,
 Buddhist, Cao Dai, Muslim, and other religious groups, in part
 by establishing government-controlled policymaking bodies such
 as the Catholic Patriotic.Association. In the past the
 Government has attempted to prevent the growth of religious
 groups by blocking publication of religious materials and
 prohibiting the training of new clergy.
 In the last year,.however, the Government has slightly eased
 its policy on-religion even as it has continued to take strong
 measures against religious persons it considers a threat to
 the regime. One indication of the more relaxed stance'was the
 decision to permit two Catholic leaders to attend the Worldwide
 Synod of Bishops in October. The auxiliary Bishop of Hanoi
 told the Synod that the Government had "adopted an attitude of
 detente and openness toward religion." Two large seminaries
 have been opened and have admitted a number, albeit limited,
 of seminarians. New ordinations to the priesthood are
 permitted.". Another source reported that the seminary located
 in Ho Chi Minh City will graduate 20 students in 1993. This
 source added that the Government controls the teachers at the
 seminaries and determines which students will be allowed to
 attend, generally ruling out those with ties to the former
 southern regime. Apparently, the regulation against importing
 or publishing the Bible still stands, but according to one
 report, the authorities permitted printing of the New
 Testament in mid-1987. A Western news agency reported that
 the September amnesty involved 7 Catholic priests and that a
 
 
 833
 VIETNAM
 large number of the approximately 100 military chaplains still
 detained were scheduled to be freed in a subsequent amnesty.
 According to refugees, priests who are released from
 reeducation camps are not permitted to return to their
 pastoral duties.
 Counter to this more relaxed trend, Vietnamese and Western
 media reported the arrest or sentencing of three groups of
 clerics during the year. In July public security forces
 seized priests of the "Congregation of the Holy Redeemer" on
 the grounds that they were plotting counterrevolution. On
 November 4 the Vietnamese News Agency reported that
 81-year-old Tran Dinh, leader of the Congregation, and 23
 others had received sentences ranging from 4 years to life for
 "propaganda against the Socialist system." In August two
 pastors of the Evangelical Church of Vietnam were convicted
 and sentenced to 8 years in prison for antigovernment
 activity. They had been detained since 1983 without trial.
 In addition, government harassment of Catholics has been
 common, particularly in rural areas. Authorities routinely
 disapprove half of the applications of parishioners requesting
 permission to attend services. Required "voluntary" work and
 other activities are scheduled by authorities during times of
 regular church services. In some areas, daily masses must be
 celebrated before 6 a.m. or after 6 p.m. Sermons must be
 cleared or monitored by the local police. The Bishops at the
 October Synod said that the Government limits religious
 activity to 1 or 2 hours on Sundays only and to take place
 only inside of churches. Meetings among members of different
 parishes are prohibited. No church building can be repaired
 without government authorization; a number of churches have
 been allowed to fall into complete disrepair. Catholics are
 required to register with the authorities, while Buddhists are
 not. Catholics are discriminated against in employment and
 education.
 Protestant churches have been similarly restricted. Church
 buildings have been seized by the authorities under various
 pretexts. Churches in the highlands have all been closed, as
 has the sole Protestant College and Theological Seminary.
 There have been continuing reports of harassment of those
 evangelical churches which have been allowed, albeit with
 severe restrictions, to hold services in urban areas. Church
 members may not attend services with other congregations. The
 authorities are said to have forbidden at least one group from
 meeting at all.
 Most of Vietnam's 30,000 Muslims are members of the Cham
 minority, which the regime distrusts. The linkage of Cham,
 Khmer Krom (ethnic Cambodians who live in Vietnam), and
 hilltribe (Montagnard) groups created the only sizable
 resistance movement in Vietnam: the United Liberation Front
 of Oppressed Races (FULRO). In its repression of the Cham,
 the Government has eliminated the position of mufti (religious
 leader) within the Muslim communities, disbanded organized
 Muslim associations, and severed links with overseas Muslims.
 The regime forbids the religious pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca,
 and has not given permission for the Muslim community to
 participate in the Koran reading contest held annually in
 Malaysia. Many Muslim schools have been closed, but most
 mosques remain open. Importation and publication of the Koran
 is forbidden.
 
 
 834
 VIETNAM
 About half of Vietnam's population is Buddhist, the majority
 belonging to the Mahayana sect. Vietnamese authorities have
 tried repeatedly since 1975 to suppress and intimidate the
 Mahayana leadership. Officials have seized temples and
 'transformed them into public buildings. They have arrested
 monks intermittently since 1975. Hundreds of monks remain in
 reeducation camps, while many others are under house arrest.
 The travel of those not detained is severely restricted.
 Government permission is required for monks to travel or stay
 overnight away from their home temples. Some reports allege
 that local authorities seek to control and restrict the
 community of Buddhist monks by forbidding the traditional
 donation of food. The majority of pre-1975 monks in the south
 have been forced to leave the monkhood, and few young men have
 been allowed to join the community. Teaching of monks must
 often be conducted in secret, and most temple schools have
 been closed. Monks of the once politically active An Quang,
 Xa Loi, and Vinh Nghiem temples are kept under close government
 surveillance. The temples are rarely open to visitors.
 The regime's attempts to control and suppress the Buddhists
 became more systematized as a result of a 1981 conference,
 which established the Unified Vietnam Buddhist Church. The
 group's charter states that it is "the only Buddhist
 organization representing Vietnamese Buddhism in all other
 relations in the country and with other countries." Strong
 controls are outlined in the charter: all Buddhist temples
 are placed under the control of local people's revolutionary
 committees; prayer sessions and meditations as well as meetings
 between moniks of different temples are allowed only with the
 permission of the local committees. Reports suggest that the
 new church has no appeal to most Buddhists, who view it simply
 as a creature of the regime.
 Most of the Therevada Buddhists are ethnic Khmer (Khmer Krom).
 Numbering about 800,000, they live in southern and southwestern
 Vietnam and have provided the Vietnamese forces occupying
 Cambodia with interpreters and staff. Nevertheless, the
 Vietnamese distrust the Khmer Krom, partly for historical
 reasons. A number of Therevada leaders have been imprisoned.
 Other religious groups have also been persecuted by the regime.
 The Hoa Hao (an anti-Communist Buddhist armed sect) strongly
 resisted the'Communist takeover of the south in 1975. As a
 result, the Government violently repressed the sect and
 arrested virtually all of its leaders. The regime still
 maintains tight control over Hoa Hao areas. Similarly, the
 regime has arrested many of the leaders of the Cao Dai, a
 uniquely Vietnamese sect that embraces elements of Buddhism
 and Christianity. Refugees have reported police occupation of
 the Cao Dai Holy See in Tay Ninh City. The Vietnamese press
 has claimed that Cao Dai leaders used the Holy See to establish
 an antigovernment subversive organization, for broadcasting
 and printing antigovernment messages, and for storing arms for
 an uprising. Some leaders have been tried and executed for
 these activities, according to the official media. The trial
 of 2 Cao Dai leaders and 31 alleged accomplices was publicized
 in August 1983.
 Adherence to religion is incompatible with membership in the
 Communist Party, which espouses atheism. Party membership is,
 in turn, a major stepping-stone toward political, economic,
 and educational advancement in Vietnam.
 
 
 835
 VIETNAM
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Approval is required for all foreign travel. Permission for
 temporary travel abroad is normally granted only to government
 officials or approved spokesmen for quasi-governmental
 organizations. Identity cards are required for internal
 travel. No one is allowed to change his residence or work
 location without permission from the authorities. Since
 public security cadres frequently check each household's
 occupants against the official family register, unauthorized
 absences or' guests can subject families to punishment.
 Several factors have combined to fuel the exodus of more than
 1 million people since 1975. Among them are severe political
 repression, ethnic and religious persecution, discrimination
 in economic, cultural, and educational opportunities; economic
 hardship; fear of imprisonment or of forced resettlement to
 remote areas; and fear of being conscripted to fight in
 Cambodia.
 In early 1978, the Vietnamese adopted a program to
 "facilitate" the departure of ethnic Chinese and others as
 refugees. The program was administered through special
 offices at the provincial level that.charged large fees for
 exit permits and passage. At its height in early 1979, the
 boat exodus of mostly ethnic Chinese reached over 40,000
 people a month. Those fleeing were exposed to extreme
 hardship at sea, where thousands of lives were lost.
 At the International Conference on Vietnamese Refugees held in
 Geneva in July 1979, Vietnam announced a moratorium on such
 refugee departures. Information from refugees who have left
 Vietnam since then indicates that, in general, the authorities
 are no longer officially assisting such departures, although
 many assist extraofficially for a financial consideration. In
 May 1979, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) reached agreement with Vietnam on the legal departure
 of persons under the Orderly Departure Program (ODP).
 Emigration under this program started slowly, with only some
 13,000 departing Vietnam in the 27 months between July 1979
 and October 1981. Vietnam then expanded the program.
 Cumulative departures to all countries through September 1987
 totaled 132,108. In January 1986, the Vietnamese unilaterally
 halted UNHCR interviews of U.S. ODP candidates, complaining of
 slow processing of persons on Vietnamese lists and the alleged
 creation of a backlog. The Vietnamese also reduced the number
 of departures to other receiving countries. After extended
 negotiations, the Vietnamese allowed renewed interviews of
 U.S. ODP candidates in September 1987.
 Refugees left Vietnam clandestinely during 1987 at a higher
 rate than in 1986. In part this was because a safer route
 opened across Cambodia. The trip involves land and sea travel
 from Ho Chi Minh City to eastern Thailand. Those who flee pay
 facilitators on the average $2,000 to $3,000 per person,
 usually after they reach their destination safely.
 In mid-1987 Vietnam relaxed its restrictions on tourist permits
 for those who had fled the country. Now, only those who
 committed "serious crimes" are not allowed to visit. The need
 to earn foreign exchange helped prompt this policy change.
 
 
 836
 VIETNAM
 Since the occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam, large numbers of
 Vietnamese have settled in Cambodia. Although some of these
 persons are former residents who fled the Khmer Rouge, others
 are first-time settlers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change their Communist-dominated
 system of government. All authority and political power is
 vested in the Vietnamese Communist Party. Political opposition
 to this system is not tolerated. The Political Bureau
 (Politburo) of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Communist
 Party is the supreme decisionmaking body in the nation. The
 Politburo's powerful Secretariat oversees day-to-day
 implementation of directives. The party leadership selects
 candidates for the Central Committee, while periodic national
 party congresses merely ratify the previously selected
 candidates. Each congress is made up of delegates from the
 party apparatus of each province, who are similarly selected
 by those at higher levels.
 Ostensibly the chief legislative body, the National Assembly
 in fact generally approves without dissent the policies set by
 the Politburo. National Assembly elections are held in Vietnam
 in theory every 5 years. However, the elections scheduled for
 1986 were postponed until April 1987. These elections had a
 slightly more democratic flavor than previous ones. In the
 past, the party selected most candidates, but this time
 candidates were nominated in public meetings. However, the
 quasi-governmental mass organization, the Vietnam Fatherland
 Front, vetjed all candidates. Voters had an opportunity to
 criticLze'candidates and had a greater selection than before,
 with B29 competing for 600 seats. Suffrage is effectively
 mandatorl as voting is required in order to have ration cards
 validhted. Voters may only strike out from the single list
 presented to them the'names of candidates for whom they do not
 wish i f vote. In several cases during the most recent
 elections for the National Assembly, however, no candidate
 received sufficient Votes. In those cases it was necessary to
 hold follow-up elections with new candidates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Vietnam reacts strongly to criticism of its human rights
 policies. In March 1986, an official newspaper, Nhan Dan,
 called the State Department's Human Rights Report to the
 Congress "a brazen slander and a manifestation of the hostile
 attitude of the United States toward the Vietnamese people."
 Foreign delegations and journalists who have been allowed to
 visit reeducation camps have been shown only model camps.
 Former prisoners have described extensive preparations to
 beautify camps prior to visits, temporary removal of most
 prisoners during the visit, and careful briefing of the
 remaining prisoners by Communist Party cadre on what to tell
 delegation members. The Government does not permit the
 existence of private human rights groups in Vietnam.
 Vietnam is not a member of any international human rights
 organization, nor is it active in promoting human rights in
 other countries.
 
 
 837
 VIETNAM
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Gradual assimilation and co-option appear to be the
 Government's long-run strategy for most minorities. The
 Government has created special schools in the Hanoi area to
 train minority cadres to be the "eyes and ears" of the party
 among their own people. Highland minorities in central
 Vietnam are subject to repression if suspected of ties with
 resistance groups. Officially programmed resettlement of
 ethnic Vietnamese into the highlands is designed in part to
 increase government control over minority groups once
 dedicated to hunting, gathering, and slash-and-burn
 agriculture. As new inhabitants change ancient land use and
 ownership patterns, the tribes are being forced into settled
 agriculture. Minorities in the south, such as the Chinese,
 Indian, and Khmer, have been encouraged to leave the country.
 Since 1975, according to Vietnamese media, 90,000 former
 officials of the Republic of Vietnam Government have been
 detained in reeducation camps. Once released, these people
 face considerable discrimination. According to refugees, they
 do not regain their citizenship until 1 year after leaving the
 camps, if then. In addition, their children generally are not
 allowed to attend college. The Government has oppressed
 ethnic Chinese by denying them employment and educational
 opportunities. This may change as the Government relies more
 heavily on Chinese entrepreneurs to help implement its
 economic reform program.
 The authorities claim that primary education is universal (97
 percent in 1980), but some children, such as many of the
 Amerasians (the children of Americans who served in Vietnam),
 are not allowed to attend school. Education above the
 elementary level is often restricted to those with approved
 political backgrounds. The party committee in each school
 reportedly has the final determination as to who will graduate.
 Similarly, study abroad is restricted to politically acceptable
 persons. Despite the promises of the Communist Party to
 emancipate women, and the important administrative and
 productive roles of Vietnamese women in the war against the
 United States, women in Vietnam today do not have positions in
 the leadership of the country in proportion to their numbers.
 There are no women in the Vietnamese Politburo and only a
 handful in the 149-member Central Committee.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 No current information is available on minimum age laws,
 occupational safety laws, or other legislation concerning
 condition of labor. Wages and hours of work are regulated by
 the Goverment. Wages for most workers are generally at or
 under basic subsistence levels.
 At least 55,000 Vietnamese workers have worked under contract
 in various occupations in the U.S.S.R. and in Eastern European
 countries. Although their labor appears to be voluntary, a,
 significant portion of their wages is deducted to help pay for
 Vietnam's debt to those countries.
