 CAMEROON
 Although Cameroon implemented democratic reforms in 1992, political power re-
 mained concentrated in the Presidency and in the former single party, the Cam-
 eroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM). In March the Government organized
 Cameroon s first multiparty legislative elections in 25 years. The vote was boycotted
 by several major opposition groups, and some observers charged that the Govern-
 ment resorted to fraud in a few areas of the country. The CPDM won fewer than
 half the seats in the National Assembly, however, and was forced to form a coalition
 with a smaller party to retain a working majority. Opposition presence in the legis-
 lature has not significantly diminished the authority of the President, since the Con-
 stitution imposes few  legislative or judicial checks on executive power. The
 multiparty presidential election in October was marred by widespread fraud and in-
 timidation of voters. Although both the Government and opposition engaged in un-
 fair electoral practices, the Government was responsible for the vast majority of
 these irregularities. According to the Government, President Biya won with almost
 40 percent of the vote and remained in power.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the National Police, the National
 Intelligence Service (CENER), the gendarmerie, the Ministry of Territorial Adminis-
 tration (MINAT), military intelligence (SEMIL), the army, and to a lesser extent,
 the presidential security service. The MINAT is in charge of prisons, and its local-
 levelofficials (prefects) play a key role in ensuring order. The police and the gendar-
 merie have the dominant role in enforcing internal security laws. In 1992 as in pre-
 vious years, security forces committed numerous human rights abuses. dameroon a
 military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and
 Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $148 million. There are
 no indications that efforts will be made to reduce these expenditures in the near
 future.
 Cameroon has a strong, diversified agricultural base and a small but important
 petroleum sector, which produces 60 percent of export earnings. Cameroon's per cap-
 ita gross domestic product (GDP) of about $900 in 1991192 placed it among the
 lower middle-income developing countries. National income has steadily declined
 since 1986, mainly due to the decline in world oil prices. Cameroon's self-sufficiency
 in food production helps mitigate the effects of declining export earnings and its for-
 eign debt burden.
 The unfair presidential elections cast a huge shadow over the political and labor
 reform efforts undertaken in 1992. While not on the same scale as 1991, civil unrest
 continued, and with it a number of abuses committed by security forces in clashes
 with opposition protesters. Following the October vote, there were incidents of
 arson, looting, street protests, and destruction of property in which at least five peo-
 ple died. On October 27, the President declared a state of emergency in Northwest
 province, which had voted overwhelmingly for the opposition. More than 250 per-
 sons, many of them opposition supporters, were detained without charge under the
 state of emergency provisions, which were lifted December 29.
 There also continued to be incidents of politically motivated extrajudicial killing
 by the armed forces, including the summary execution of five persons, beatings, and
 torture. On many occasions, security forces subjected civilians, including political
 and media leaders, to sustained cruel and degrading treatment. In one instance the
 residents of Ndu and Bali in Northwest province suffered beatings, sexual abuse,
 and destruction of property by gendarmes over a period of nearly 1 week. After im-
 provements in press freedom early in the year, censorship tightened in late spring
 and continued through the rest of the year. Other continuing human rights abuses
 included arbitrary arrest and detention, government inaction to redress abuses by
 security forces, and discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--Several incidents of political and
 extrajudicial killing occurred during the year. The most serious involved the sum-
 mary execution of five civilians by soldiers and gendarmes following a violent ethnic
 clash between Kotokos and Choa Arabs in Kousseri, Far North province. According
 to credible eyewitness accounts, a dispute between the groups over voter registra-
 tion erupted in violence on January 29, with some 100 to 150 people killed, mostly
 
 
 poorly armed Kotokos. Soldiers and gendarmes were dispatched to Kousseri to re-
 store order, but their efforts to disarm the combatants prompted renewed fighting
 between the security forces and Choas, with approximately 350 Choas killed. While
 the heavily armed Choas could only be subdued through military intervention, the
 high Choa death toll and few losses among the military (one dead and one wounded)
 point to disproportionate use of force by the soldiers and gendarmes. Moreover, fol-
 lowing the disarmament of the Choas, there were credible reports that members of
 the armed forces led five Choas into the bush where they were summarily executed.
 There was no public inquiry into the incident. Senior military officials maintained
 that internal disciplinary hearings were held in the case but had not concluded as
 of year's end.
 Police intervention between January 24-26 to forestall a demonstration by Mus-
 lims in Yaounde left two police and four protestors dead. According to witnesses' ac-
 counts, police panicked when one officer was speared in the eye during the con-
 frontation and began firing into the crowd. Violence continued over a 2-day period
 with at least 30 seriously wounded in addition to the dead. Police used live ammuni-
 tion and antiriot equipment against the protestors. There was physical evidence
 that some of the wounded demonstrators had been shot in the back.
 Six civilians were killed by gendarmes in Ndu, Northwest province, on June 6.
 According to credible eyewitness accounts, the gendarmes mistook a weekly market
 gathering for a banned opposition rally and fired warning shots to disperse the
 crowd. Townspeople responded by throwing stones at the gendarmes, who then
 opened fire on the crowd. Five Ndu residents were killed by the gunfire, one died
 later in the hospital, and many more were injured. In retaliation, some townspeople
 ransacked the homes of local gendarmes, burnt their belongings, and harassed their
 families. Throughout the week of June 7-12, gendarmes broke into Ndu residents'
 houses, smashing windows and furniture and looting valuables. There were multiple
 reports of rape, sexual abuse, and other violent acts against women, including gun-
 shots to the pelvis. While officials in the security forces maintained that there would
 be a formal inquiry into the Ndu killings, as of year's end, there were no reports
 that those responsible had been brought to justice.
 On July 9, five people were killed near Touboro, in North province, after local citi-
 zens installed a new chief against the wishes of the Lamido of Rey Bouba, a power-
 ful traditional ruler. Members of the Lamido's team of bodyguards intercepted the
 new chief and his entourage outside of Touboro and opened fire, killing two. The
 chiefs supporters fought back, killing three of the Lamido's security guards. Gen-
 darmes were sent to quell the violence. As of year's end, none of those responsible
 had been brought to justice. Government tolerance of the Lamido's private security
 force contributed to the outbreak of violence.
 Following the controversial October 11 presidential election, there were isolated
 disturbances in several provinces in which at least five persons died. On October
 12 and 13 in South province, supporters of the ruling CPDM attacked and looted
 the homes and businesses of Anglophones and members of the Bamileke and
 Bamoun ethnic groups believed to have supported opposition candidates. Security
 forces did not intervene to preserve order, and there were credible reports that some
 soldiers participated in the looting. One looter was killed by an arrow during the
 confrontation, and there were other unconfirmed reports of additional deaths.
 Following announcement of the official election results on October 23, protests
 erupted in the opposition strongholds of Littoral, Northwest, and Southwest prov-
 inces. In Muyaka, Southwest province, an angry mob of opposition supporters
 burned alive subprefect Gideon Ngum . According to credible eyewitness accounts,
 the crowd surrounded Ngum's home after gendarmes accidentally shot a young boy
 while trying to control an unruly opposition demonstration. The mob draged the
 prefect from his house, beat him senseless, and then doused him with gasoline and
 burned him to death.
 In Northwest province, home to the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF)
 leader John Fru Ndi, unknown groups burned or looted some 300 homes. This de-
 struction occurred despite the reinforcement of security forces prior to October 23.
 Government officials maintained that the extra forces were needed to protect public
 buildings and hence could not intervene to protect private property. While some of
 the destruction was politically motivated, other acts were the results of personal
 score settling or pure banditry.
 A prominent CPDM supporter, Tita Fomukong, was burned in his Bamenda home
 after it was surrounded and torched by an angry crowd. While initial reports indi-
 cated that the mob had murdered Fomukong, later accounts-including those of the
 chairman of the presidentially appointed National Commission For Human Rights
 and Freedoms-confirmed that Fomukong had reentered the burning home, perhaps
 
 
 33
 in an attempt to retrieve some valuable or look for a family member, and was
 trapped inside.
 Two persons were killed in Bali, Northwest province, when they attacked a gen-
 darme guardpost in an a pparent attempt to free other persons who had been de-
 tained in connection with looting and arson in the area.
 b. Disappearance.-There were credible but unproven reports of the disappearance
 of four youths after they were allegedly taken into custody by gendarmes following
 a demonstration by the Cameroon Anglophone Movement (CAM) on February 11
 (see Section 2.b.). Witnesses reported seeing gendarmes detain Sule Paul Tataw,
 Kasimo Lemamu Ibrahim Pendap Tataw, and another boy known only as "Che."
 Some human rights monitors reported that gendarme records confirmed that the
 youths had been detained. An investigation by the National Commission for Human
 Rights and Freedoms was inconclusive, and, as of year's end, there had been no fur-
 ther inquiry into the alleed disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Penal Code proscribes torture, renders inadmissible in court evidence
 obtained thereby, and prohibits public servants from using force against any person,
 there were many credible reports of security forces inflicting severe beatings, sys-
 tematic torture, and other inhuman treatment during 1992. These abuses worsened
 in Northwest province following imposition of a 2-month-long state of emergency on
 October 27. At least one person, Ghandi Che Ngwe, reportedly died as a result of
 injuries during torture. Sanctions against those responsible are almost unknown, al-
 though government officials maintain that they face administrative punishments
 which are not made public.
 Investigations are rare because abused persons frequently fear reprisals against
 themselves and their families if they lodge a complaint. Police and gendarmes rou-
 tinely beat detainees to extract confessions and the names and whereabouts of other
 alleged criminals. For example, an article in the September 11 issue of the English
 language government newspaper, the Cameroon Tribune, reported that one detainee
 "under torture at the police post, revealed the names of all members of the gang."
 Security forces also often resort to physical harassment of citizens with whom they
 come in contact.
 The security forces display a pattern of beating detainees on the soles of their feet
 with an iron bar or whipping them with a reinforced rubber tube. On January 3,
 Jean-Michel Nintcheu and Emmanuel Wato were detained and severely beaten by
 gendarmes. The two were members of the banned opposition human rights group
 Cap Liberte. According to credible reports, Nintcheu was unable to walk after his
 release because the soles of his feet had been beaten raw. Although a doctor rec-
 ommended that he be given medical attention, police refused to allow Nintcheu to
 receive hospital treatment. Both detainees were subsequently released without for-
 mal charges being made. Despite denials by the Government, investigations follow-
 ing the mass arrests in the No west province after the election confirmed that
 many persons were beaten at the time of detention.
 There were several incidents of prolonged cruel and degrading treatment of civil-
 ians by security forces, including shaving the heads of opsition members with
 shards of glass. On May 5, ferns e student leader Ange Toam Guiadem was de-
 tained by approximately 12 gendarmes at Yaounde University. They stripped
 Guiadem and marched her across cam pus while punching and kicking her. Other
 students who tried to intervene were beaten off by the gendarmes. Guiadem was
 taken to a garage, where gendarmes continued to beat and taunt her for 2 days.
 During this period, her tormentors shaved her head with shards of broken glass.
 She was subsequently moved to the gendarme detention facility where she was kept
 until her release, without charge, on May 11. While gendarme and university offi-
 cials maintained that an investigation of the incident would be conducted, none had
 occurred by year's end, and none of those responsible had been brought to justice.
 Treatment of prisoners in the penitentiary system is poor, especially outside of
 major urban areas. Prisoners receive inadequate medical attention and food, al-
 though family members often provide supplementary rations. Prisoners are rou-
 tinely chained in their cells. Conditions are worst at Tchollire II prison, where re-
 portedly inadequate food and medical attention caused at least 40 deaths between
 1990 and 1992 among the inmates. Tchollire's isolation makes it diffcult for fami-
 lies to supplement the meager food rations, while even serious diseases, such as tu-
 berculosis and meningitis, go untreated. Mostprisoners were held in severely over-
 crowded and unsanitary conditions, and some detainees faced further beatings while
 in custody, according to the National Commission For Human Rights and Liberties,
 among other observers.
 duArbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary, prolonged detention remained
 a serious problem in 1992. In particular, the intelligence services do not implement
 
 
 34
 fully the Penal Code requirement that detainees be brought before a magistrate for
 investigation of possible offenses and have held detainees incommunicado.
 Under Cameroonian law, a person arrested for a nonpolitical offense may be held
 in custody up to 24 hours befdre being charged. That period may be renewed three
 times. However, the law does not prvide for habeas corpus, and  dicial authorities
 are precluded from acting on a case until the administrative authority who ordered
 the detention turns the case over to the prosecutor. Afer a      has issued
 a warrant to bring the case to trial the detainee may be heldin1petrial detention"
 indefinitelytpending ourt action. Furthermore, a 1990 law permits detention with-
 out charge for renewable periods of 15 days "in order to combat banditry." Persons
 taken into detention are frequently denied access both to legal counsel and family
 members. The law permits release on bail only in the Anglop one provinces, where
 the legal system retains features of British common law. Even there, bail is granted
 infrequently.
 Police and gendarmes sometimes detain opposition activists on political grunds,
 as in the cases of Jean-Michel Nintcheu and Emmanuel Wato in January, and Ange
 Tekam Guiadem in May (see Section l.c.). Those detained on political grounds are
 generally held without charge or charged with a common crime. For example, on
 July 22 armed plainclothes police interrupted a Doula political meeting attended
 by members of the Rally for the Fatherland (RAP) and other small political parties.
 The police arrested about 20 opposition activists, among them Jean-chel Nintheu
 and Emmanuel Wat again.
 Approximately half of the detainees were released after 1week; the remaining
 nine were held until August 6. Police officials claimed that the activists would be
 charged with smuggling arms from Nigeria and plotting to assassinate senior gov-
 ernment leaders. Only Nintcheu, Wato and Martin Tafou finally were charged with
 a crime. A court date was initially scheduled for October but postponed after the
 Paris-based International Federation For Human Rights intervened to urge that the
 accused be given more time to prepare their defense. As of year's end, none had
 been brought to trial.
 Following the October election the Government detained numerous opposition po-
 litical figures, including Victor Hameni Bieleu, campaign chairman of the Union for
 Change, and several prominent legal advisors to the Social Democratic Front (SDF),
 among them retired Supreme Court Justice Nyo Wakai and lawyers Ophelia Sendze
 and Franu Sama. In some cases, including those of Justie Wakai and Mrs.
 Sendze, detainees were beaten while being taken into custody. According to govern-
 ment sources, a total of approximately 250 persons were detained for up to 2
 months unde er se   of emrgency provisions in the Northwest proven e. Other credi-
 ble sources indicated  that some 400-500    persons were detained. Under
 Camerooninn law, persons may be held without c ta during a state of emergency
 for up to 2 months (renewable once), by order of the Minister of Territorial Adminis-
 tration.
 On December 14, 63 of the detainees, including Opheia Sendze, were released
 without charge. On December 23, the igh Court of Mezam  Division ordered the
 release of an additional 176 detainees, either unconditionally or on bail. Hameni
 Bieleu was ordered released unconditionally; Nyo Wakai on bail. On December 26,
 all 176 detainees were instead transferred to to prisons in Yaounde; ther, all were
 released on their own recognizance December 31. The public prosecutor confirmed
 reports that those detainees, if they are brought to trial, will be judged by the State
 Security Court, established in December 1990 to try crimes against the "internal
 and external security of the state."
 In addition to those detained under state of emeren  rovisions, other political
 activists, such as Joseph Tegeh, President of the Douala-based Movement for the
 Renewal of the African People (MORPA), were detained without charge and beaten
 (see also Section 2.a).
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Cameroonian court system is subordinate to
 the Ministry of Justice; it is part of the executive, not a separate or independent
 branch of government. Magistrates in Cameroon are career civil servants respon-
 sible to the Minister of Justice, and thus are subject, particularly in political cases,
 to government direction. Following the October 11 presidential election, for example,
 the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the opposition National Union For Democ-
 racy And Progress (UNDP) party to declare the results invalid due to numerous
 iregularities. The Court ruled against the appeal on technical grounds, noting that
 the NDP had presented photocopies, rather than originals, of alleged fraudulent
 vote tabulations.
 Numerous magistrates have commented that rendering a decision that displeases
 the Government may result in transfer to a less desirable position. However, mag-
 istrates' decisions in nonpolitical cases are usually not subject to government inter-
 
 
 ference. Them have been reported cases of the Government refusing to pay damages
 when a court has found against it. Trials are public. There is no formal public de-
 fender system, but some voluntary organizations and the Bar Association offer pro
 bono legal assistance in some cases.
 Traditional courts continue to play an important role, particularly in rural areas.
 Their authority varies by region and ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters
 of property and domestic disputes and may serve a probate function as well. Most
 traditional courts permit appeal of decisions to traditional authorities of higher
 rank.
 There were no known political prisoners, as distinct from political detainees, in
 Cameroon at the end of 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are violations of
 Cameroonian law, there were numerous reports of police and gendarmes harassing
 citizens and entering homes without warrants. This practice was particularly wide-
 spread in Northwest province, as security forces enterd private 'omes under the
 pretext of enforcing payment of taxes. Sustained periods of harassment of civilians
 and forced ent  into theirhomes occurred in Bali between May 29-31, and in Ndu
 between June 8-12 (see also Section l.a.). In Bali, gendarmes used rubber bullets,
 teargas, and firearms to terrorize twnspeople-including women and the aged-for
 2 days after taxi drivers refused to pay customary bribes.
 In Northwest province during the state of emergency, gendarmes sometimes sur-
 rounded entire neighborhoods, then conducted house-to-house searches without war-
 rants. Property for which the residents lacked receipts was confiscated, and persons
 who could not produce a national identity card were sometimes detained. Two days
 before the state of emergency was declared, a cordon of gendarmes sealed off entry
 to and exit from the Bamenda home of opposition leader John Fru Ndi. An agree-
 ment was subsequently concluded with the security forces to allow food and medical
 supplies to rach the more than 140 family members and supporters who joined Fr
 Ndi on his ompound. The gendarme ordon of the compound was lifted on Decem-
 ber 29.
 There were credible reports that the Government kept some opposition militants
 under surveillance and used informer systems to track the activities of dissidents.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution of 1972 provides for
 freedom of expression and the press, Cameroonian law and practice have long re-
 stricted these freedoms. In late 990, a new law established more liberal regulations
 for beinning publication of newspapers and magazines. That same law, however,
 formally authorized prepublication ensorship an Wgranted the MINAT the authority
 to suspend the right to publish. Public servants face retribution for openly criticizing
 the Government as in the ae of Celestin Mon  mane r of a government-owned
 bank  and part-time journalist, whose May  Jeune Afrique echnomie interview
 prompted an increase in censorship in 1992 (see below). Underpressure, Monga re-
 signed his position at the bank when his supervisor initiated disciplinary proceed-
 ings against him for publishing the article.
 ethe Government publishes two official newspapers--the English and French edi-
 tions of the Cameroon Tribune-and determines the content of all radio and tele-
 vision broadcasts. Moat official journalists are civil servants who may be transferred
 to less desirable positions if they do not practice self-censorship. The government-
 controlled broadcast media, although funded by all taxpayers, provided dispropor-
 tionately high levels of coverage to even minor CPDM functions while giving little
 air time to opposition events.
 Some 40 private newspapers are published, about one-quarter weekly and the oth-
 ers at irregular intervals. Censorship of these newspapers is erratic, with criticism
 of the Government often tolerated. In January the Government lifted a 5-month ban
 on the Doubla weekly Le Messager, and dung the first 3 months of the year the
 private press operated with few restrictions. Beginning in April, however, censor-
 ship was tightened. Editors of the weekl La Galae were tried and fined for pub-
 lishing an article which charged the MoNAT with abuse of government privileges.
 Following publication in May of an interview which implicated the President's fam-
 ily in a banking scandal, the Government banned distribution of the French month-
 ly aJeune Afrique Econmic and seized issues of Cameroonian weeklies La Nouvelle
 Ex      ispsiion and te Messager when they tried to repeat the story.
 From May on, the private press was subject to heavy-handed censorship and har-
 assment of journalists. Throughout the summer and fal, armed police were sta-
 tioned at the Rotoprint Press, where most private weeklies are produced. Police fre-
 quently subjected journalists who wrote stories critical o the Government to lengthy
 
 
 36
 interrogations about their sources of information. Police sometimes roughed up
 newspaper vendors sellin    aers critical of the Government and confiscated the
 publications. In July the MINAT suspended the Douala weekly Galaxie for publish-
 ing a follow-up story on the banking scandal implicating the President's family. In
 early September, the MINAT suspended three Douala weeklies-La Nouvelle Ex-
 pression, Le Messager, and Challenge Hebdo--for allegedl1 failing to deposit the re-
 quired two copies of each issue with the Attorney Generals office. The papers defied
 the MIAT suspension order by ontinuing to publish under different names until
 late November, when the MAT put an end to this practice by issuing definitive
 suspension orders.
 After the October elections, the Government detalned briefly without charge a
 number of media figures, including, in November, Severin Tchounkeu, editor of
 L'Expression who was severely beaten despite being partially crippled by polio. Sev-
 eral of Tchounkeu's colleagues had to go into hiding ater receivig threats to their
 safety. As of the end of the year, no prominent media figures remained in detention.
 There are no legal restrctions on academic freedom, though it is generally be-
 lieved that there are CENER informants at the campus of the University of
 Yaounde. Some university professors believe that their political viewpoints and ac-
 tivism have had a negative impact on professional opportunities and advancement.
 Free political discussion at the University may be dampened by the presence of
 armed members of the security forces, on hand to quell political disturbances (see
 Section 1.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation are provided for in law but restricted in practice. The Penal Code prohibits
 public meetings, demonstrations, or processions without prior government approval.
 The 1990 law on freedom of association provided that Cameroonians may freely
 form associations simyly by notifying the responsible administrative authority ac-
 cording to a set procedure.
 While political parties and civic associations were generally permitted to hold
 public assemblies, the Government at times harassed opposition groups by denying
 them access to meeting facilities or refusing their permits on technicalities. Prior
 to the October 11 presidential election both opposition and ruling party campaign
 rallies were sometimes disrupted by their adversaries. Following the election, all
 public meetings were prohibited in Northwest province under the state of emer-
 gency.
 On February 11, a rally in Bamenda by members of the Cameroon Anglophone
 Movement to commemorate federalism in Cameroon was broken up by security
 forces. The gendarmes claimed that CAM had not obtained the proper permit to
 hold a political rally, but CAM leaders argued that, as members of a civic associa-
 tion rather than a political party, they were not bound by this requirement. More
 than 100 people who attended the rally were detained. There were numerous eye-
 witness accounts of beatings by security forces, along with reports of the disappear-
 ance of four detainees.
 Some 70 political parties operated legally in 1992 along with numerous civic asso-
 ciations. Unlike in 1991, the MINAT did not act to block registration of new groups
 or to ban existing organizations. Associations that had been banned in 1991, how-
 ever, were not rehabilitated. Leaders of some of these banned associations charged
 they had been denied due process by the judiciary, which refused to schedule a court
 date to hear appeals to overturn the banning orders.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution,
 and there is no established state religion. Roughly 25 percent of Cameroonians are
 Muslims, 40 percent are Christians, and the rest follow traditional beliefs. Officials
 of the Government and the CPDM include members of all three groups. There are
 no restrictions on places of worship, the training of clergy religious education, reli-
 gious travel-such as the haij--or participation in charitable activities.
 However, a religious group must be approved and registered with the MINAT in
 order to exist and function legally. Government officials maintain that Jehovah's
 Witnesses, banned from 1970 until 1990, are now free to practice their religion. As
 of year's end, however, the MINAT still had not approved the Witnesses' petition
 for legal status that has been pending since 1990. There were no reports of Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses' being imprisoned as a result of their beliefs in 1992.
 Independent Christian and Muslim publications circulate in Cameroon, and there
 is no evidence that they are more heavily censored than the secular press.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 atriation.-Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by law. Po-
 ce frequently stop travelers to check identification documents, vehicle registrations,
 and tax receipts as a security and immigration control measure. In areas experienc-
 Ing civil unrest, and during the periods immediately preceding the legislative elec-
 
 
 tions and following the presidential election, the checks became pervasive and occa-
 sionally oppressive. Personnel manning these roadblocks frequently solicit bribes to
 speed pass~age. Authorities sometimes employed these roadblocks to limit the activi-
 tesr P~olitalparties. 'InAdaan v epronce prior to thprsidential election,
 thee wre epots ha capain vhices f he ppoitin UDPwere sometimes
 harassed when passing through the check points.  p
 The Government has sometimes used its passport control function against those
 it considers real or potential threats. One former government official, who left office
 after a dispute with the ruling party hierarchy, suffered an unusually long delay
 before being issued a new tourist passport to replace his diplomatic passport.
 Cameroon has long served as a safe haven for displaced persons and refugees
 from the region. At the end of 1992, 1,500 refugees from Chad, Liberia Zaire, and
 Sudan were receiving the assistance of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 in Cameroon. However, estimates of the total number of refugees, mostly spontane-
 ously settled Chadians, range from 8,000 to 50,000. Although Cameroon occasionally
 returns illegal Chadian immigrants, there were no reports of forced repatriation of
 recognized refugees during the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The flawed October 11 presidential election represented a step backwards in Cam-
 eroon's democratization process  which nonetheless made progress from    1990
 through 1992. An international observer group sent by the National Democratic In-
 stitute (NDI) concluded that the overwhelming weight of responsibility for this
 failed process lay with the Government and President Biya. The ruling CPDM and
 five opposition parties contested this first multiparty presidential election in Cam-
 eroon s history. Bia was reelected with about 40 percent of the vote, according to
 official figures. SD candidate John Fnl Ndi received about 38 percent, and UNDP
 candidate Bella Bouba Maigari received 19 percent.
 The vote was man-ed by irregularities during the campaige, on voting day, and
 during the tabulation of results. News coverage of the campagn on thegovernment-
 monopoly television and radio stations was heavily slanted in favor of the CPDM.
 Campaigning was restricted in some ruling party strongholds, such as the Lamidat
 of Hey Boube, which UNDP supportrs were forbidden to eater, and South province,
 where Progressive Movement (MP) candidate Jean-Jacques Ekindi was physicaly
 threatened by an angry mob when he attempted to travel to Ebolowa to deliver a
 campaign speech.
 On polling day, many voters in areas where the opposition was expected to do well
 found that their names had been dropped from electoral registers and that polling
 stations had been moved or renamed. While voting was generally peaceful, there
 were isolated incidents of violence, particularly in Doula and the Southwest prov-
 ince, where opposition supporters attacked the home of ruling party members they
 believed were engaged in fraud. In CPDM strongholds, voting was tightly controlled
 to ensure a high vote total for the President. Pu blic rather th an secret ballot voting
 was used to coerce support for President Biya in many rural areas of his home
 South province. Opposition poll-watchers were not permitted in many polling sta-
 tions in South province and other ruling party strongholds.
 Results of the vote were not announced until 12 days after the election. Although
 this fell within the period established by the electoral code, the delay led to wide-
 spread suspicion that the vote count had been manipulated. Despite many requests
 from oppsition parties and the NDI delegation, the Government did not release the
 results by polling station, which would have allowed opposition parties to check the
 official tally aganst their own parallel vote counts.
 In cntrast to the prresidential election, most observers concluded that, despite
 some irregularities and organizational problems, the outcome of the March 1 legisla-
 tive elections was a fair reflection of the will of those who voted. However, one vio-
 lent incident occurred at Bacikumbat, Northwest province, on election day, when a
 crowd sacked the home of a local traditional ruler believed to be harboring stuffed
 ballot boxes. Fifty-two persons were detained in that incident and, according to cred-
 ible reports, 32 remained in detention atyears end.
 found thefst multiparty legislative elections in more than 25 years, the ruling
 CPDM, which formerly held all 180 Assembly seats, won just 88 seats. It was forced
 to form a coalition with the Movement for the Defense of the Republic (MDR), which
 won 6 seats, to retain a working parliamentaiy majority. Two opposition parties also
 won seats in the Assembly: The UNDP and the Union of Cameroonian Peoples. Sev-
 eral major parties boycotted the election, demanding that the Government first con-
 vene a sovereign national conference and expressing distrust of the Government's
 ability and intent to organize a free and fair election.
 
 
 Cameroon continues to be governed by the President and the CPDM, which came
 to power during a period of single party authoritarian rule. The President and his
 inner circle of advisors, many drawn from his own ethnic group, make all important
 government decisions. While some opposition parties won minority representation in
 e National Assembly during the year, their presence did not significantly dilute
 the authority of the President. The Constitution favors the executive over the legis-
 lature, giving the President the power to dissolve the Assembly and call new elec-
 tions at any time; to return bills for a "second reading," requiring that they be
 passed by a majority of the full Assembly; and to govern by decree when the Assem-
 bly is not in session. With a working parliamentary ma.ority, the ruling party and
 its coalition partner set the legislative agenda, preventing many opposition initia-
 tives from coming to a vote. Moreover, opposition parties in the Assembly lacked the
 staff and expertise to challenge government proposals in technical subjects.
 While underrepresented in senior leadershi positions, a few women do serve in
 prominent positions in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Gov-
 ernment. Two women sit in the 44-me mber Cabinet, and one woman sits on the 14-
 member Supreme Court. Seventeen women were elected to the 180-seat National
 Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Some domestic and international human rights organizations were permitted to
 operate in Cameroon in 1992, but their findings appeared to have little influence
 on the Government. In February the President named members of the National
 Commission for Human Rights and Freedoms, which had been established by decree
 in November 1990. Although the decree called for opposition deputies in the Na-
 tional Assembly to be represented on the Commission, none had been named by
 year's end. The Commission conducted several investigations and prison visits and
 briefed government officials on its findings but issued no public reports during the
 year. The Government did not permit the Commission to make unannounced visits
 to detainees, and the Prime Minister's office was slow to disburse its budget. In one
 instance, gendarmes briefly detained the Commission president and other members
 at gunpoint during their investigation of the June events at Ndu (see Section L.a.).
 During a November mission to South province to investigate postelection violence,
 Commission members were subjected to surveillance by security forces.
 Several nongovernmental civic associations concerned with human rights were ac-
 tive in 1992, among them the National League for Human Rights, the Association
 of Women Against Violence and the Cameroonian Association for the Rights of Chil-
 dren. For the most part, these groups sought primarily to heighten awareness of
 human rights issues rather than investigate specific alleged violations. The groups
 were permitted to operate freely during the year. Human rights groups banned in
 1991 were not rehabilitated.
 In January the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reopened a dele-
 gation office in Yaounde after a 15-year absence. Although the ICRC obtained agree-
 ment in principle to visit security detainees delegates had not yet been allowed ac-
 cess to such prisoners at year's end. The Paris-based International Federation for
 Human Rights (FIDH) visited Cameroon in March and October. The FIDH met free-
 ly with a wide range of government officials, opposition groups, student leaders, and
 journalists during its visits. Amnesty International and the Committee to Protect
 Journalists issued statements on Cameroon based on sources inside the country but
 did not make site visits during the year.
 Breaking the Government's long-standing policy of not responding to the com-
 ments of either domestic or foreign human rights groups, several senior officials
 sought to refute such allegations during 1992. Government spokesman Augustin
 Kontchou, Minister of Territorial Administration Gilbert Andze Tchoungui, and Sec-
 retary of State for Internal Security Jean Fochive all reacted publicly to human
 rirhts-related charges, including Amnesty International's report that more than 70
 prisoners had died at Tchollire H since 1990 (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Preamble to the 1972 Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based
 on sex, enshrines freedom of religion, and mandates that "everyone has equal rights
 and obligations." However, discrimination based on race, language, religion, or social
 status is not explicitly forbidden.
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all Cameroonian citizens
 on a nondiscriminatory basis. President Biya has repeatedly stressed publicly the
 dangers of tribalism, but there remains deep-seated suspicion among more than 200
 ethnic groups, to which government officials are far from immune. Cameroon has
 
 
 39
 two official languages, but the Anglophone minority (20 percent) often charges that
 the Francophone majority does not share real power and that the Government pro-
 vides few economic benefits to English-speaking regions. The Bamileke, the coun-
 trys largest single ethnic group (with at least 20 percent of the population), charge
 that they have been systematically denied political power commensurate with their
 numbers and economic importance. Throughout 1992 opposition newspapers fre-
 quntly attecked the Beti, Prsident Biya's ethnic group, while those close to the
 Gvernment often criticized the Bamileke, Anglophones, and, to a lesser extent,
 northerners. Ethnic violene in far North province between the Kotoko and Choa
 Arab communities resulted in more than 450 deaths in January and 100-150 fatali-
 ties in November. These clashes were fueled by long-standing ethnic rivalries be-
 tween the Choas and Kotokos, which were exacerbated by their support for compet-
 ing political parties in Cameroon's new multiparty environment.
 Women are granted equal rights under the Constitution, and some are active in
 litical parties and civic associations. However, significant cultural pressure is
 nought to bear on women t   ra         int to men. Polygamy is permitted by
 law and tradition, but polyandry is not. The extent to which a woman may inherit
 from her husband is normally governed by traditional law in the absence of a will,
 and customs vary from group to group. In many traditional societies, custom grants
 gre ater authority and benefits to male than to female heirs. In cases of divorce, the
 usband's wishes determine custody of children over the age of 6. A married woman
 may not legally obtain contraceptives without her husband's consent; neither may
 she be sterilized without his authorization. While a man may be convicted of adul-
 tery only if the sexual act takes place in his home, a female may be convicted irre-
 spective of venue.
 Women's rights advocates report that violence against women has surged in re-
 cent years, and that the law does not impose effective penalties against violators.
 Wife beating is not, of itselfn a legal ground for divorce Most women regard having
 been the victim of a sexual assault as so ,profoundly shameful that they cannot
 confront the assailant. Frequently, a victim's family or village impose direct, sum-
 mary punishment upon the suspected perpetrator through means ranging from de-
 structaion of property to lynching. While there are no reliable statistics on violence
 against women, the number of newspaper articles indicate the frequency is high. Fe-
 male genital mutilation (circumcision) is not common in Cameroon but is practiced
 by a limited number of traditional Muslim families.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Rigyh of Association.-In August Cameroon's National Assembly passed a
 new Labor Code, allowing workers to form and join trade unions of their own choos-
 ing. Under the new rules, groups of at least 20 workers may organize a union but
 must then register with the Ministry of Labor. Provisions of the Labor Code do not
 apply to public servants, employees of the penitentiary system, or workers res-on-
 sile for national security. As of the end of December, impementing decrees ha not
 been issued for the new Code, and no new unions had been registered with the Mcin
 istry of Labor. The Federation of National Educators (SYNES) applied in 1991 for
 legal status as a public service association, since government workers are not per-
 mitted to form trade unions. As of year's end, the Ministry of Public Service had
 not accorded legal status to SYNES.
 Prior to 1992 the ruling CPDM party controlled the Organization of Cameroonian
 Workers (OSC), the only labor organization in Cameroon. At its convention in May,
 however, OSTC members announced their intention to operate independently of the
 ruling party, and renamed the organization the Confederation of Cameroonian
 Workers (CSTC). At year's end, it remained unclear to wht extent the CSTC had,
 in fact, severed its ties to the ruling party. While CSTC Secretary General Louis
 Smbes publicly rebuked some members who sought to endorse the CPDM, CSTC
 President Emmanuel Etame-Ndedi continued to serve as an alternate member of
 the CPDMs Central Committee.
 The new Labor Code explicitly recognizes workers' right to strike but only after
 mandatory arbitration. Administrative employees at the agricultural research insti-
 tute engaged in a wildcat strike for several weeks in July and August, demanding
 payment of salary arrears. Employees went back to work after the Government
 made partial payment.
 Although the new Labor Code permits unions to form or join federations or con-
 federations and affiliate with international bodies, the CST C remained in 1992 the
 only labor confederation in Cameroon. The CSTC is a member of the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity and in December was accepted as a member of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The new Labor Code provides
 for collective bargaining between workers and management in local work places, as
 well as between labor federations and business associations in each sector of the
 economy. As of year's end, sectoral collective bargaining negotiations had not been
 undertaken. Prior to passage of the new Code, the Government was involved with
 the CSTC and employers in setting wages through a complicated formula that took
 into account the sector and region of employment and the worker's education level.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employers guilty of such
 discrimination are subject to fines ranging up to $6,000. The Ministry of Labor re-
 ported no complaints of such discrimination in 1992. Seven firms obtained approval
 to operate under Cameroon's industrial free zone regime, and two had begun oper-
 ations by the end of the year. Free zone employers will be exempt from some provi-
 sions of the Labor Code but must respect all internationally recognized worker
 rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the new Labor Code, although it specifically excludes "any work or serv-
 ice extracted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a court of law"
 and "work or service in the general interest forming part of the civic obligation of
 citizens." In its 1992 report, the International Labor Organization's Committee of
 Experts observed that Cameroon continues to allow prison labor to be contracted out
 to private employers and uses communal labor for municipal public works.
 There have been frequent reports that slavery continues to be practiced in some
 traditional Cameroonian ethnic groups, notably the Lamidat of Rey Bouba.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code establishes that
 no child be employed before the age of 14. Ministry of Labor inspectors are respon-
 sible for enforcing the minimum age but lack resources to conduct an effective in-
 spection program. In rural areas many children begin work at an early age on fam-
 ily farms. Some rural youths, especially girls, are ofen employed by relatives as do-
 mestics. Street vendors in the cities are sometimes under 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Under the new Labor Code the Ministry of
 Labor is responsible for setting a single minimum wage applicable nationwide in all
 sectors of the economy. At year's end the minimum wage had not been set. The
 Labor Code establishes a standard workweek of 40 hours in public and private non-
 agricultural frms, and 48 hours in agricultural and related activities. The Code
 makes compulsory at least 24 consecutive hours of weekly rest. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors and occupational health doctors are responsible for monitoring safety and
 health standards but lack the resources for a comprehensive inspection program.
