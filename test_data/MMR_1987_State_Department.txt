 BURMA
 Burma, officially known as the Socialist Republic of the Union
 of Burma, is a society torn between a strong attachment to
 traditional ways and the desire for economic development. For
 25 years the one-party government has stressed adherence to
 the "Burmese Socialist Way," emphasizing self-reliance and
 government control of the economy as a means of building an
 affluent Socialist society.
 After independence from the British in 1948, Burma embarked on
 a path of national development with an essentially democratic
 political system. Factionalism, insurgencies, economic
 problems, and a nationalistic animus against the Chinese and
 Indian minorities, who controlled much of the private sector,
 led to a military coup in 1962, headed by the army commander,
 General Ne Win. The 1974 Constitution established the Burma
 Socialist Program Party (BSPP) as the sole legal political
 party, with the authority to "lead the State." The party is
 the sole channel for political activity in Burma, paralleling
 and dominating government structures. Personnel for
 government and party positions are drawn largely from the
 military, the tool by which Ne Win runs and controls the
 nation. The army enjoys a highly privileged status, getting
 first claim on the economy's scarce resources, and its
 security requirements often impact harshly on Burmese citizens.
 Burma has fought various insurgencies since independence.
 Some of the ethnically based insurgents are fighting for
 autonomy or independence and against what they perceive to be
 domination by ethnic Burmans. Others are no more than
 narcotics syndicates with private armies. The Burma Communist
 Party (BCP), the only insurgency seeking to overthrow the
 Government, also receives most of its revenue from drug
 trafficking. Though the rebels have been on the defensive in
 recent years, the Government uses their continued existence as
 justification to keep the control machinery of a national
 security state firmly in place.
 The attempt to follow "the Burmese Road to Socialism" has
 produced expropriations without compensation, indiscriminate
 seizure of wealth through demonetization, and tight
 restrictions on private economic activity. Most significant
 economic enterprises are government owned, but the private
 sector, largely fed by smuggled goods, has proved to be the
 most viable and resilient sector of the economy. Although
 yearly per capita income is under $180, abundant land and
 natural resources provides adequate food supplies and a higher
 standard of.living than that figure would indicate.
 In the face of Burma's worsening economic situation, the
 Government has begun tempering its doctrinaire socialism with
 pragmatic economic measures, such as accepting foreign grants
 and loans and decontrolling trade in basic crops. These
 limited reforms have not yet shown significant positive
 effect. In September the Government withdrew 80 percent of
 Burma's currency without compensation. Coming shortly after
 Ne Win had raised hopes with a call for reforms, this sudden
 move left many Burmese confused and financially devastated.
 The serious human rights problems which persist in Burma are
 the result of an authoritarian government and ruling party
 which do not guarantee basic rights or the application of an
 impartial rule of law.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Burmese law yrohibits summary executions. Buddhist tenets are
 also a mitigating element. In past military operations against
 insurgents, there have been reports of executions of prisoners
 or killing of supporters, as well as noncombatant deaths,
 although there were no confirmed instances in 1987. Indeed,
 some observers attribute the Burma Army's recent successes
 against-insurgents in part to the Government's emphasis on
 improving relations with indigenous minority groups.
 Reports continue that some insurgent groups summarily execute
 prisoners, opponents, and suspected informers. Insurgent
 groups have sporadically continued to attack civilian targets,
 such as trains, riverboats, and pagodas during festivals;  In
 the wake of the September demonetization, several police
 stations in the Mandalay area were bombed by unknown
 assailants, resulting in a few casualties but no deaths.
 Government efforts to control demonstrations against the
 latest demonetization reportedly resulted in the shooting
 death of one demonstrator and the wounding of several others.
 b.-Disappearance
 There werb-no reports over the past year of people being
 abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention
 by security forces. There is usually no attempt to'conceal
 common criminal or political arrests from family members,
 although details about the charges may not be revealed.
 However, after student riots over the latest demonetization,
 some parents reportedly have been unable to locate their sons,
 and assume that they were arrested.
 There continue to be unconfirmed reports that some insurgent
 groups resort to abduction as a political weapon to coerce
 local inhabitants into cooperation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution provides that punishmeht shall not
 be in violation of human dignity, police and security forces
 at times use psychological coercion and torture during
 investigations in both criminal and political and security
 cases. The Government officially denies that torture or
 inhuman treatment is practiced. Prison conditions are poor,
 due in part to Burma's poverty.
 There were reports recently that one detainee died after
 interrogation in Mandalay for an alleged bomb attack on a
 police station, but the cause may have been due to a
 preexisting health condition. Insurgent groups employ death
 threats, beatings, and other forms of physical and mental
 coercion against opponents or villagers who refuse to
 cooperate. There have been reports that insurgent groups
 tortured captured government soldiers in the course of
 gathering information about Burma Army operations.

 BURMA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 There is no provision in Burmese law for a person in detention
 to seek a judicial determination of the legality of his
 detention. In serious cases involving national security, some
 persons may not be formally charged but held under an
 antisubversion act in indefinite detention without trial. In
 less serious political and security cases, detention under the
 act is nominally limited to 180 days, but this may be extended
 with cabinet approval.
 In common criminal cases, police may detain suspects up to 24
 hours, after which a court order must be sought from competent
 judicial authorities. These renewable court orders authorize
 14-day extensions of the detention until charges are formally
 brought before a court. Detainees are frequently held
 incommunicado during the period of investigation and
 interrogation but normally are allowed visitors thereafter.
 In September some 600 persons, mostly students and some monks,
 were arrested for rioting over demonetization. While most
 were released a few hours later, some are assumed to have been
 detained under the 180-day provision of the antisubversion act
 mentioned above.
 Refugees and other stateless persons are regarded as illegal
 immigrants subject to arrest. If they cannot be repatriated
 after serving sentences for illegal entry, they may be detained
 indefinitely. Reportedly, the Government has several hundred
 illegal immigrants from a number of Asian countries under
 detention and is willing to release them if they are accepted
 for permanent resettlement elsewhere.
 Burma's legal code does not contain any statutory prohibition
 of forced labor. The Burma Army frequently conscripts civilian
 males in the vicinity of military operations (primarily in
 areas populated by ethnic minorities) for porter duty. Some
 of these porters are killed by mines planted by insurgents and
 in military engagements. Insurgent groups also press-gang
 villagers into service as recruits or porters.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A 12-member Council of People's Justices (CPJ) exercises
 national jurisdiction (on an appellate basis only) and
 supervises courts at three lower levels. At the lower levels,
 justice is administered by three-judge panels. These panels
 are elected from a single slate of candidates chosen by the
 BSPP. All judges are BSPP members, and many are active or
 retired military officers. Most are untrained in the law but
 normally advised by professional legal officers.
 The judiciary is not independent of the Government, which can
 influence both verdict and sentence, particularly in political
 and security cases. Influence, payments, and favors are often
 factors in lower court decisions. Tight control through BSPP
 channels and the mandatory use of three-judge panels tend to
 restrain judicial activism. At the same time, lower court
 judges, being more easily swayed by local political and
 financial pressures, are not always accountable to the CPJ.
 The legal code is based upon the British colonial system of
 law, as modified and expanded by the present Constitution and
 other legal measures imposed by the Government. The
 Constitution provides for public trials in most cases, and
 
 
 643
 BURMA;.
 this practice is followed incommon criminal cases. In
 political.qnO security cases,.special judiciary committees may
 be named by the Council of State. The- public normally is not
 allowed to attend such trials.
 The burden of proof is on the prosecution in both common
 crimina and political and security cases. The accused has
 the right to counsel in both typep of cases, and legal counsel
 is provided for.  nd~gent defendants faced with a possible
 sentence of 7.years or more. Normally, defendants can consult
 freely and privately with their -lawyers.- Defendants and their
 lawyers also are made aware of. the charges and evidence and
 are permitted to submit their own evidence. The verdicts of
 civil, security, and military courts may be appealed to the
 next higher court up to jhe Council of State.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Rome, or
 Correspondence
 In political and security cases, security forces are not
 subject to judicial procedures and usually enter homes without
 warrants. In areas-of-insurgency, forced-entry and
 warrantless searches are, carried out by-government security
 forces and rebel groups alike. It is widely believed that
 security personnel selectively monitor private correspondence
 and telephone calls. A well-developed system of neighborhood
 informers reports on dissidents and criticism of the
 Government.
 In common criminal cases, however, police officials are
 required to have a valid search warrant or to be accompanied
 by a member of the local People's Council at the time of
 search. Search warrants are issued by local or state judges'
 committees.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 Burma's governments have been fighting ethnic and Communist
 insurgencies for nearly 40 years, a problem which has
 compounded human rights problems. Lacking adequate resources
 and military equipment, military commanders have been known to
 impress local inhabitants as augmentation forces. Government
 operations can then be conducted with fewer official
 casualties. The limited medical attention available goes
 first to troops and seldom to civilians.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are significant restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press in Burma. The Constitution guarantees freedom of
 speech, expression, and publication but stipulates that the
 exercise of such freedoms should not be "contrary to the
 interest qf the working people and socialism." In practice,
 opposition viewpoints and public criticism of the Government
 bre not tolerated. Party members can express some views about
 economic problems or bureaucratic failures, but outspoken
 members can be disciplined or expelled: Anyone criticizing
 the Government's leadership in public or private is subject to
 arrest. However, in the last year, private criticism has
 become notably more intense and widespread without any signs
 that the security apparatus has reacted.
 
 
 644
 BURMA
 The Government owns and operates the mass media in Burma,
 including television, radio, and the six national newspapers.
 There are some private periodicals. Newspaper editors are
 appointed by the Ministry of Information, and editorials must
 be approved in advance. Journalists are subject to strict
 guidelines as to what can be broadcast or published,
 especially on domestic matters. International news is subject
 to prior review and selection, but reporting, edited from
 foreign wire services, is generally objective and balanced.
 However, stories about Burma or developments elsewhere with
 obvious parallels to Burma's internal politics are not carried
 or are heavily edited. Foreign shortwave radio broadcasts
 such as BBC, Voice of Australia, and VOA are not jammed.
 Criticism of government officials is not permitted in the
 press, although cartoons and editorials will sometimes
 criticize local administration indirectly. All forms of
 communications--domestic and imported books and periodicals,
 stage plays, motion pictures, and musical recordings--are
 subject to government control and censorship. The Government
 monitors academic inquiry in the social sciences. The
 difficulty of obtaining scholarly publications from abroad and
 of communicating with foreign scholars impedes academic
 research, although there have been improvements in recent
 years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for the right of assembly
 and association, it exists only for those organizations
 permitted by law. The Government does not permit private
 associations, except for innocuous social purposes and then
 only on a very limited basis. All organizations must be
 registered formally with the Government and, in effect, are
 subject to government control. The BSPP, in turn, advises the
 Government as to whether a particular organization is to be
 allowed.
 Most legitimate organizations are linked to the BSPP. BSPP
 "mass organizations" for workers, peasants, and youth have
 been established at every administrative level. These
 organizations
 serve primarily as vehicles for communicating national policies
 and implementing government programs. Opposition political
 groups are banned, and their members are subject to arrest.
 Public meetings must be sanctioned by the Government.
 The Government in recent years has promulgated two directives
 that limit Buddhist monks' right to assembly and association.
 Acting through the government-controlled hierarchy of the
 monkhood (Sangha), the State has prohibited monks from
 attending various forms of public entertainment. In part this
 has been done to maintain the moral purity of the Sangha, but
 it is also aimed at curbing the political activities of monks,
 potentially one of the most influential groups in Burmese
 society.
 There is no independent labor movement in Burma. Workers do
 not have the right to organize independently, to bargain
 collectively, or to strike. The labor force is organized into
 BSPP-controlled workers' and peasants' mass organizations.
 Most of the leaders of these organizations are party
 officials, and their national leadership is made up of ranking
 party and government officials. For- example, the workers'
 organization national chairman is also the Minister for Social
 Welfare and Labor, and the peasants' organization chairman is
 
 
 645
 BURMA
 also the Minister for Agriculture and Forests; both are
 membe'rs 'f the BSPP's Central Committee.
 Labor disputes in both the public'and private sectors are
 mediated by arbitration boards composed of worker, management,
 and government representatives. In practice, these committees
 are under the cohtrol of the Workers' Association, and the
 BSPP, Working through the Government, decides disputes. In
 the public sector where workers, management, and government
 representatives are all generally party officials, the process
 has little meaning. Jlowever*, im the private sector this
 process can provide workers with a limited voice.
 Burma is 'a member of the International Labor'Organization
 (ILO). Labor organizations and other professional
 associations Wre not pernitted to maintain independent
 relatfons wiEh'international private bodies.
 c. Freedom of'Religion
 Burma is a secular state dominated by the Burman ethnic
 group. Freedom of religion is provided for in the
 Constitutio and widely observed in practice. The great
 majority of Brmese are Buddhist, although there are sizable
 Christian, Muslim, and animist minorities based principally in
 various minority ethnic groups..
 While minority religious groups are allowed to practice
 freely, security services do monitor the activities of some
 religious communities closely. Some persons of mixed Burman
 and ethnic minority ancestry have been known to convert to
 Buddhism as a way of strengthening their claim to be -
 considered ethnic Burmans- '
 There is considerable social prejudice against Muslims in
 Burma.' Occdsioally this erupts in violence and in one
 instance this year led to government action which infringed on'
 the practice of the Muslim religion. In May, towards the end
 of the Ramacdan fast, Muslim worshipers in Rangoon were
 viciously attacked by machete-wielding persons irate over the
 loud chanting during services. After quelling the disturbance,
 the Government sealed the mosque and refused to allow the
 prayers that end Ramadan.
 Religious groups can and do maintain linis with coreligionists
 in other countries, including the Roman Catholic Church, which
 maintains ties to the Vatican. Religious travel such as the
 hajj is permitted and in some cases subsidized by the
 Government. Foreign religious representatives are usually
 allowed only tourist visas and are not permitted to preach,
 proselytize, or remain to carry out missionary work. So far
 as is known, there are no foreign missionaries in Burma.
 All religious organizations are required to register with the
 Government.* Religious publications are subject to the same
 government control and censorship as other publications. On
 occasion, the Government has used a nationalization law to
 take control of the property of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution assures Burmese citizens the right to live
 anywhere in the country. Except for limitations in areas of
 insurgent activity, Burmese citizens can travel freely within
 
 
 646
 BURMA
 the country but must inform local authorities of their
 temporary place of residence. Noncitizen residents, including
 persons born in Burma who hold foreigners' registration cards,
 must obtain prior permission to travel.
 Legal requirements and bureaucratic procedures cause long
 delays in obtaining passports, and the right to emigrate
 usually is denied, although actual emigration is not blocked.
 Severe limits are placed on what emigrants are allowed to take
 with them. Before traveling abroad, private citizens normally
 must reimburse the Government for their university and
 professional education and pay income tax in advance. Persons
 who retain Burmese citizenship and who left the country legally
 are generally allowed to return to visit relatives. Burma
 does not recognize dual citizenship: acquiring citizenship in
 another country results in the loss of Burmese citizenship.
 Those who take citizenship in another country are banned from
 returning to Burma. Emigrants wishing to return permanently
 are still required to 4eapply for Burmese citizenship.
 Burmese who leave the country illegally cannot legally return.
 Burma does not permit foreign refugees or displaced persons to
 resettle or seek safe haven within Burma. The Government
 treats persons claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants
 and imprisons them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Burma has an authoritarian, one-party system in which leaders
 are drawn for the most part from a small elite within the
 military officer corps. All government institutions and other
 organizations in Burma are subordinate to the guidance of the
 ruling BSPP. The party in turn follows the leadership of
 Chairman U Ne Win, who has personally ruled and guided the
 formulation and execution of national policy for the last 25
 years.
 At the top of the formal government structure is a 29-member
 Council of State whose chairman, U San Yu, is ex-officio
 President of Burma and also Vice Chairman of the BSPP. A
 unicameral People's Assembly is the titular source of
 legitimate power, yet it meets only twice a year for 4-day
 sessions. Its 489 members are chosen for 4-year terms and, in
 parliamentary style, include government ministers.
 Ethnic Burmans dominate the political system, although the
 party seeks to expand participation by Burmese ethnic
 minorities. Women are underrepresented both in the Government
 and in the party relative to their percentage of the general
 population. Under the Constitution, Burmese citizens do not
 enjoy the right to change the party in power.
 Political opposition is not tolerated, and opposition
 political parties are illegal. The BSPP is used to mobilize
 popular support behind decisions of the leadership rather than
 as a vehicle to express the individual or group opinions of
 the members.
 Elections are held at various levels once every 4 years,
 except when byelections are required to fill vacated seats.
 Suffrage rights extend to all persons over 18 years of age who
 meet strict citizenship requirements. The party chooses a
 single slate of candidates for government offices. Although
 party nominees run unopposed, they must receive 50 percent of
 
 
 647
 BURMA
 the vote to be elected. In party and governmental
 decisiofrmakin9 assemblies, votes'are almost always unanimous.
 Party cahaiddte  gbnern1ly win electibns at state and division
 levels. In the last country-wide election, held'in 1985,
 several thousand party candidates at the township levels and
 below were not elected, and many who were elected barely met
 the 50 percent voterequirement. If the electorate refuses

 Section:4'Gbverhmhtal Attitudd Regarding Int~rnational'and
 Nongove~hmenil Investigation of'Alleged Viola tiofis
 6'o.Human Rights-"'
 No known internal Burmise'organization, governmental or
 private, monitors the human rights situation in Burma, nor
 does Burma actively participate in international or regional
 human rights bodies. The Burmese Government does not permit
 investigations of its human rights practices, nor is it
 willing to discuss human rights problems with outside
 governmental or nongovernmental organizations. However, the
 Government has permitted visits by U.N. organizations such as
 the ILO and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
 fok Refugees (UNHCR) to discuss a few specific issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities have their own distinct
 cultures and languages. Economic development among minorities
 has lagged, and many still live at the subsistence level.
 This is due in part to geographic factors which impede
 economic development in rugged, isolated, ethnic minority-
 populated border areas. Burma's chronic insurgencies, many of
 which are based on ethnic minority groups' perceptions of
 Burman dominance of the country at the expense of the
 minorities, also play a large role in lagging economic
 development. Minorities are underrepresented in the BSPP and
 the Government, are largely excluded from the military
 leadership, and sometimes suffer other forms of discrimination.
 Persons of nonethnic Burmese ancestry, primarily Indians and
 Chinese, while denied full citizenship status and excluded
 from party or government positions, continue to play an
 important role in the economy, a factor resented by the
 majority population.
 Women in Burma have historically played an active role in
 society, but this varies with cultural traditions and ethnic
 backgrounds. In general, Burmese women enjoy most of the same
 legal rights as men. They keep their own names after marriage,
 are active in trade, and often control family finances. There
 are no women in the senior ranks of government service above
 the rank of director general. Since the 1985 elections and
 
 
 648
 BURMA
 party congress, however, a few more women are members of the
 BSPP Central Committee and the People's Assembly. Lately,
 younger women have been entering universities and the civil
 service in increasing numbers.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Burma continues to revise and update its labor laws. At
 present the minimum age for workers is 15. There is a 5-day,
 35-hour workweek for employees in the public sector and a
 6-day, 44-hour workweek for private and parastatal sector
 employees, with overtime paid for additional work. However,
 public sector employees seldom actually work more than 6 1/2
 hours a day. Workers have 21 paid holidays a year, and there
 are numerous legal provisions to protect workers' health and
 safety, but these are not strictly enforced. The minimum
 legal wage is about $1.00 per day at current official exchange
 rates. In the private sector the minimum wage law applies
 only to cheroot-rolling plants and rice mills.
 The gap between legal provisions and actual conditions can
 vary widely, with government entities and government corporate
 enterprises coming closest to the legal standards. The law
 commission of the National Assembly reportedly still has under
 consideration legislation concerning ILO Conventions 17
 (workers' compensation) and 52 (hours of work).
