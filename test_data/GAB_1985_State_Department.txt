 GABON
 Gabon has a single-party political system in which effective
 political power is concentrated in the Presidency. That office
 has been held since 1967 by President Omar Bongo, who is also
 head of the party. A March 1983 amendment to the party
 constitution restricts candidacy in future presidential
 elections to the "Secretary General-Founder of the Democratic
 Party of Gabon," thus reserving presidential candidacy for
 President Bongo. In practice, presidential power is limited by
 the complexity of government and the diffusion of power through
 60 cabinet-level officials led by a Prime Minister. A
 120-member National Assembly is elected from slates chosen by
 the single party and meets regularly, but it has little real
 power.
 Although still a developing country, Gabon has the highest per
 capita income ($4,000) in Sub-Saharan Africa due to its
 significant petroleum and mineral resources and its small
 population. Economic performance has also benefited from
 long-standing government policies supporting private enterprise
 and encouraging foreign investment. While income distribution
 is skewed in favor of the modern urban sector as opposed to the
 traditional, agricultural sector, most Gabonese have benefited
 in some measure from the country's strong economy.
 The country's 1961 Constitution guarantees protection of the
 individual and respect for the integrity of the person, and,
 with isolated exceptions, these rights are generally respected
 in practice. Political rights, however, are not guaranteed
 under the Constitution, and active political opposition to the
 sole legal party is not permitted. Public criticism of
 particular government actions and policies is allowed and
 occurs with some regularity within the context of the single
 party, although direct attacks on the President are
 prohibited. There is no evidence of systematic police or other
 repression of the population. Gabon released the last of its
 political prisoners in 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings or summary executions.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of abductions or hostage-taking by
 government or any other groups. The authorities are sometimes
 slow to advise the families of accused criminals or detainees
 who are arrested, but there has been no evidence of attempts to
 suppress news of an arrest.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The political opposition group, the Movement for National
 Recovery (MORENA), based in Paris, has alleged that several
 people detained in the Libreville prison on political charges
 have been mistreated or kept in degrading conditions. Amnesty
 International's 1985 report mentioned allegations that some
 prisoners, both criminal and political, had been ill-treated.
 There were other reports, however, that virtually all prisoners
 
 
 115
 GABON
 had been allowed family visits. Family members reported no
 serious mistreatment. Police are believed to be rough but not
 brutal in their treatment of suspected criminals. Prison
 conditions are harsh.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In Gabon, "acts against the security of the state" and "actions
 against the Chief of State," which can include advocating a
 multiparty system, are punishable crimes. Alleged members of
 the MORENA opposition group were detained for several months
 before being brought to trial and sentenced in 1982 and 1983.
 All MORENA prisoners have now been released. There have been
 no reports of detention without trial of persons accused of
 violations of criminal law. Gabonese law, amended in September
 1983 and ratified by the National Assembly early in 1984,
 provides guarantees against arbitrary detention according to
 clearly articulated judicial procedure which is observed in
 practice. Previously, there were no legal protections against
 arbitrary detention.
 Forced labor is not used as a means of political coercion or
 racial or social discrimination. Some prison sentences for
 serious crimes include hard labor as part of the sentence
 during incarceration.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A legal system based upon French law, customary law, and the
 1961 Constitution, which gives the President a powerful role,
 functions fairly effectively. The right to a fair public trial
 is guaranteed by the Gabonese Constitution and has generally
 been respected in practice in criminal cases. In
 security/political cases, however, there have been more
 controversy and inconsistency. The 1982 trial of the 29
 alleged members of MORENA took place in public with
 representatives of the international press and Amnesty
 International present, while the 1983 trial of 4 political
 dissidents took place in camera. The charges leveled against
 the accused were basically the same in both cases, namely,
 printing and distributing antigovernment tracts and encouraging
 the Government of France to use its influence in Gabon to bring
 about a multiparty political system. In 1985, a military
 officer was tried publicly and convicted by a special military
 tribunal for plotting to overthrow the Government. He was
 executed after the Gabonese Supreme Court and the President
 declined his appeal. By the end of 1985, all known political
 prisoners had been released, and no others are known to be held.
 The Gabonese court system is modeled on the French judicial
 system. Trial courts hear questions of fact and law in civil,
 commercial, social, criminal and administrative cases. A
 second level of appeals courts is divided into two general
 appellate courts, with a separate appeals court for criminal
 cases. Gabon's highest judicial body, the supreme court, is
 divided into four chambers. There are also three exceptional
 courts: a military tribunal which handles all military
 offenses, a state security court, and a special criminal court
 which deals with fraud and embezzlement of public funds by
 officials.
 The judiciary is implicitly susceptible to executive influence,
 since Gabon's Constitution gives the President the authority to
 appoint, transfer, and dismiss judicial officials.

 GABON
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The various police and security units monitor dissident
 political activity, including dissident telephone
 conversations, but interference in the daily life of the
 populace is relatively rare.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are certain limits on these rights in Gabon. No direct
 public criticism of President Bongo is permitted, and no
 advocacy of a multiparty political system by the media or
 individuals is tolerated. The country's single daily
 newspaper, which is government-owned, regularly prints columns
 attacking alleged inefficiency or corruption in various
 government offices. Foreign magazines and newspapers, notably
 French publications and magazines printed elsewhere in Africa,
 which sometimes criticize the President and the one-party
 system, generally circulate freely in Gabon, although
 occasionally particular issues of publications are seized by
 the police and a few publications are banned. Journalists are
 considered to be state employees and are expected to expound on
 themes as directed by the Government. The policies of the
 Government are sometimes debated in public forums. The
 President sometimes holds press conferences and his ministers
 have submitted to lively direct questioning on television on a
 broad range of domestic policy issues such as education, public
 housing, and transportation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political activity outside the Democratic Party of Gabon is
 illegal. The Government does not interfere in the affairs of
 nonpolitical organizations. In some sectors, for example,
 sports clubs and social service organizations have been
 formed. Many are national programs under government auspices,
 but diverse private groups and events sponsored by private
 companies also exist.
 Labor unions may organize but are legally required to be
 affiliated to the government-sponsored Gabonese Labor
 Confederation, which is closely tied to the governing political
 structure and is the sole legal labor federation. The Labor
 Code (1978) and the General Convention of Labor (1982) govern
 general working conditions and benefits for all sectors.
 Unions in each sector negotiate with management over specific
 pay scales, working conditions, and benefits applicable to
 their industry. Each year, representatives of labor,
 management, and government meet to agree on the minimum wage,
 which is determined within guidelines provided by the
 Government. Under Gabonese law, all strikes are illegal which
 occur before remedies prescribed under the Gabonese Labor Code
 have been exhausted. Nevertheless, petroleum and
 transportation workers have successfully organized strikes and
 job actions in 1985 and in previous years over wages and
 working conditions. The Gabonese Labor Confederation is a
 member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 It is estimated that over half of Gabon's 80,000 salaried
 private sector workers are unionized. Government employees are
 not permitted to belong to unions. Agreements reached between
 
 
 117
 GABON
 labor and management in each sector also apply to nonunion and
 expatriate labor. According to the 1978 labor code, workers
 may individually or collectively take complaints of code
 violations to arbitration and may appeal to labor and national
 courts. These provisions are observed in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Gabonese Constitution guarantees religious freedom and
 tolerance. Proselytizing has sometimes been discouraged, and
 in 1985 four small syncretistic sects were banned because of
 alleged tolerance of antigovernment activities. Nonetheless,
 Christian, Muslim, and animist religions all flourish in Gabon,
 and public worship is unrestricted. A number of different
 religious groups operate schools. There is no political or
 economic discrimination because of religious preference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country, foreign travel, and return to
 Gabon are normally not restricted by the Government.
 Government employees, however, must obtain permission to travel
 abroad, and private citizens must obtain exit permits. Since
 mid-1983, the Government has slightly tightened restrictions on
 the entry and resettlement of displaced persons, but many
 individuals who have a "well-founded fear of persecution" in
 their country of origin have been given permission to stay in
 Gabon; they come from a variety of countries, including those
 with which Gabon has friendly bilateral relations. There have
 been no reported cases of involuntary repatriation, and those
 refugees who wish to repatriate voluntarily are allowed to do
 so.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Gabon is governed by a centralized, single-party regime in
 which President Omar Bongo exercises most political power.
 Major political and economic decisions are made by the
 President, usually in consultation with cabinet-level
 officials. This group of 60 includes representatives of all
 the country's major ethnic, geographic, and political groups.
 Gabon's varied interest groups are thus given access to
 political patronage. The Fang, an ethnic group comprising
 about 35 percent of the population, feel themselves to be
 underrepresented. Fear of Fang dominance by the remaining 65
 percent has contributed to the President's political control.
 The need to maintain the balance of interests represents,
 therefore, the major check on presidential power. The very
 size and complexity of the government structure is another
 significant factor. Opposition political parties are not
 permitted. Membership in the single political party is open to
 all Gabonese but is not required. Elections below the
 presidential level are sometimes contested, but all candidates
 must be approved by the Democratic Party of Gabon.
 Although no women are found among the top 40 full government
 ministers, 4 women occupy cabinet level positions as
 secretaries of state, and 9 others occupy junior minister
 positions. Women are particularly active in the judiciary and
 occupy 13 seats in the National Assembly.

 GABON
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 President Bongo has invited representatives of Amnesty
 International and other human rights organizations to visit
 Gabon. An Amnesty International representative from Senegal
 was present in 1982 for the major human rights-related event in
 recent years, the public trial of the MORENA dissidents. In
 1985, informal contacts were undertaken with several
 international human rights organizations for frank discussion
 on the human rights situation in Gabon. The United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees functions in Gabon under the
 aegis of the United Nations Development Program. Some of
 Amnesty International's current concerns are noted in Sections
 1c and le above. Freedom House rated Gabon "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Gabon is a developing country, although its petroleum and
 mineral resources and small population of only one million
 enable it to have one of the highest per capita incomes in
 Africa--about $4,000 in 1983. The population growth rate is
 2.8 percent per annum. Gabon has enjoyed substantial economic
 growth over the past 10 years, helped in part by the
 Government's policy of supporting private enterprise and
 encouraging foreign investment. However, economic growth has
 stagnated over the last 4 years due to the depressed state of
 world markets for Gabon's principal exports.
 In spite of its good economic record, Gabon faces the problem-
 of trying to integrate the modern sector of the economy with
 the traditional sector based on semisubsistence agriculture.
 Income distribution is skewed in favor of the roughly 50
 percent of the population who live in the modern urban sector.
 The Government is attempting to ensure further economic growth
 and a more equitable distribution of national income through a
 program of investment in education, social services,
 infrastructure, and agriculture. Access to the Government's
 social programs is open to all Gabonese citizens on a
 nondiscriminatory basis. The right of both men and women to
 hold private property is spelled out in the Constitution and is
 fully protected in practice.
 According to the World Bank, life expectancy at birth rose from
 40 years in 1970 to 51 years in 1985. Estimates of infant
 mortality have varied widely. The World Bank statistics for
 1985 of 159 deaths per 1,000 live births indicates a slight
 decrease during the past several years. The majority of the
 population has access to maternity clinics and basic health
 facilities. A World Bank estimate of the ratio of available
 caloric supply to nutritional requirements was 115 percent in
 1977. There has been no evidence of significant malnutrition
 due to inadequate food supplies, but lack of knowledge of good
 nutritional and health care practices for children in the
 traditional sector remains a problem. It is estimated that
 about 75 percent of the urban population has access to safe
 drinking water. The World Bank in 1981 gave the primary school
 enrollment ratio as 106 percent (109 for males and 103 for
 females). The Government has made school attendance compulsory
 and nearly all primary school-age children are believed to be
 attending school.
 Labor legislation provides broad protection to workers. The
 minimum wage for unskilled labor since April, 1985'is about
 
 
 119
 GABON
 $162 per month for Gabonese and $125 per month for foreigners,
 the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of South
 Africa. Due to labor shortages, most salaries are much
 higher. There is little unemployment among Gabonese wishing to
 enter the wage economy, although some unemployment exists among
 recent baccalaureate and university graduates.
 No one below the age of 16 may work without the authorization
 of the Ministries of Labor, Public Health, and Education. This
 permission is rarely granted. Any work in excess of 40 hours
 per week must be compensated with overtime pay, and the work
 week must include a minimum rest of 48 consecutive hours.
 Pregnant women have the right to 14 weeks of leave during
 pregnancy, including 6 immediately before delivery. The labor
 code describes enforcement of occupational health and safety
 standards, which are established by decree of the Minister of
 Health.
 Women enjoy full legal rights in Gabon, although their
 influence and overall participation in government is limited by
 cultural factors. The Gabonese legal system contains many
 statutes providing specific rights and protection to women, but
 many are undoubtedly unaware of these provisions. In recent
 years, women have begun to play an increasing role in the
 economic, political, and cultural life of the country,
 particularly in the urban areas. The Government and party have
 become more sensitized to women's issues, and government and
 party institutions are actively promoting women's rights. The
 Ministry of Women's Affairs 1984 budget shows an increase of
 about 600 percent since 1983. Under the Ministry's auspices, a
 National Commission for the Promotion of Women was created in
 1984 and has recently completed a study on the needs of.Gabon's
 women. It acknowledged that the rural sector lags behind the
 urban in the promotion and protection of women's rights and
 encouraged efforts underway to help rural women organize
 agricultural cooperatives and government programs in basic
 heal-th care, nutrition, and adult literacy. These programs are
 largely directed at women. A new journal published by the
 Ministry of Women's Affairs gives extensive coverage to women
 in the military and the professions. The party's women's union
 is active in organizing women's cultural presentations
 throughout the country.
