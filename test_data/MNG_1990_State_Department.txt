 MONGOLIA
 In 1990 Mongolia, long a highly centralized Communist state,
 installed its first freely elected government as part of a
 transition toward multiparty democracy. Responding to demands
 of a growing opposition movement, the Mongolian People's
 Revolutionary Party (MPRP--the Communist Party) amended the
 Constitution to delete its leading role and created a
 presidential system and an additional, more representative
 legislative house. Political parties were legalized and an
 electoral law was passed, leading to general elections in July.
 As a result of these political reforms, Mongolia now has a
 president, a vice president, a prime minister, and two
 legislative houses known as the Great People's Hural (GPH) and
 the new Baga (small) Hural. The Vice President also serves as
 president of the smaller, more influential legislative house.
 Although the President serves as Chief of State with broad
 emergency and veto powers, the actual division of
 responsibilities between the President and Prime Minister is
 not yet clear.   The GPH, which elects the President, is the
 major legislative body, but the Baga Hural becomes the highest
 organ of state power between infrequent GPH sessions.
 The new Government is led by President Ochirbat and Prime
 Minister Byambasuren of the MPRP but it includes a Vice
 President, Deputy Prime Ministers, and cabinet members from
 opposition parties. It has pledged to involve all parties in
 reforming Mongolia's economic, political and judicial
 structures. The political influence of the Soviet Union in
 Mongolia has greatly diminished as the Government turns toward
 the non-Socialist world for political and economic relations.
 The once central role of the security apparatus has also
 diminished. State security is no longer a cabinet ministry,
 but a department responsible to the Couicil of Ministers
 rather than to the MPRP. The number of security officials has
 been drastically reduced. Military forces are also being
 reduced, and all Soviet troops--the bulk of which had already
 left Mongolia--are to be withdrawn by 1992. Security forces
 played virtually no role in the 199G revolution.
 Despite increasing industrialization and urbanization, a
 majority of the population is engaged in agriculture, with an
 emphasis on livestock raising and associated light industry.
 After decades of near total dependency on the Soviet Union,
 Mongolia has expressed interest in increasing its foreign
 trade with non-Socialist countries and begun an overhaul of
 the economy with the goal of achieving a full market economy
 within 3 years. The GPH passed an investment law designed to
 attract foreign investment, and the Baga Hural is expected to
 pass a law allowing private ownership of property.
 Democratic reforms undertaken in 1990 resulted in major
 improvement in most human rights categories. Progress was
 most dramatic in freedom of speech and press, freedom of
 assembly, freedom of religion, and the right of citizens to
 change their government. The elections were generally judged
 by observers to be free and open. However, a short campaign
 period and MPRP institutional advantages raised concerns over
 ability of the opposition to contest the election on an equal
 basis. Concerns also persist about judicial independence and
 arbitrary interference with privacy, although the Government
 has singled out these areas for additional reforms.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial killing
 There -has been no evidence of such killings in recent years.
 The Government is iyvestigating allegations of past instances
 of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of unresolved abductions or
 disappearances in recent years.
 c. Torture-,and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have-been no reports that torture or other cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment has been
 practiced in the recent past.
 .d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no confirmed reports of arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile in the past few years. The Government is
 investigating cases of such occurrences in the past and has
 rehabilitated many victims. Internal exile was used as a
 political punishment in the past; many former victims have
 been rehabilitated. One of the two candidates for president
 in September had been rehabilitated earlier in the year.
 Police may arrest those in the act of committing a crime and
 * hold them for up to 72 hours without a warrant. For .
 incarcerations of longer duration, or when the actual crime
 was not witnessed, awarrant must be issued by a prosecutor
 who is appointed by the State Prosecutor for a 5 -year term and
 ,who functions as part of the Ministry of Justice-. The State
 Prosecutor is appointed by the GPH for a 5-year term.
 Warrants must also be issued by a prosecutor before persons or
 premises may be searched. There is no statutory right for an
 accused to see an attorney, and defense attorneys are
 routinely denied access to their clients. The Government does
 not pay for legal representation on behalf of those who cannot
 afford it.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three levels of courts in Mongolia. The People's
 Courts handle most'routine criminal and civil cases such as
 assault, petty larceny, traffic accidents, and liability
 disputes. Provincial Courts hear serious cases such- as
 murder, rape, grand larceny, official corruption, and security
 cases. The:High Court serves as an appeals court for the
 People!s .and Provincial Courts. To date the High Court has
 rarely overturned verdicts of the Lower Courts. High Court
 judges are appointed by the GPH for a 4-year term. Lower
 Court judges are appointed by provincial Hurals, also for
 4-year terms. Current civil and criminal codes stipulate the
 right of the accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and
 public trial "except as stipulated by law." Closed
 proceedings are.permitted in the cases of.crimes against the
 State, rape cases involving minors, and particularly brutal
 murders. Witnesses are usually required to appear at trials,
 
 
 976
 MONGOLIA
 but written testimony is sometimes accepted instead. The
 accused must answer all questions put to him by the
 prosecutor. The courts have nominally been independent, but
 in reality have been closely controlled by MPRP. A
 comprehensive review of the legal code is currently underway,
 with the goal of establishing a legal system conforming to
 international standards. Aside from a few prisoners convicted
 of passing confidential material to foreigners, whose exact
 status is not clear, there are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is
 provided for in the Constitution. Despite political reforms
 and cutbacks in the apparatus of government, the Government
 still retains the authority to exercise control over
 individual activity. The State still has the power to approve
 job and residence changes. The Department of State Security
 (DSS), despite internal reforms, still reserves the right to
 use special surveillance measures (e.g., wiretaps) "when
 necessary." No information is available on the extent of
 these practices, and the capabilities of the DSS seem
 significantly below what they were a year ago. Membership in
 political parties seems to be voluntary and free from
 government coercion.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for in the
 Constitution and is now widely respected in practice, although
 limits remain. Since the start of 1990, Mongolia has
 experienced a lively debate covering a broad range of
 political issues. Many newspapers freely publish and
 circulate in Mongolia, although the Government controls the
 allocation of newsprint. The only television station is
 government owned. There were credible reports that opposition
 parties were denied equal access to the media during the
 election campaign. For example, several opposition parties
 claimed that the MPRP-owned newspaper, which enjoys the widest
 circulation, refused to accept advertisements for opposition
 candidates. Opposition parties also alleged that limitations
 on the quantities of newsprint provided to opposition
 newspapers effectively prevented them from publishing as
 frequently as the MPRP newspaper.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of demonstration and
 assembly. Mass demonstrations played a key role in the 1990
 revolution. Permits are technically required for mass
 gatherings, but this requirement is rarely enforced. In
 separate incidents in April, unarmed troops were sent to the
 site of one demonstration and nine demonstrators were briefly
 detained at another for lack of the required permit. The
 troops did not interfere with the demonstration, and the
 detainees were released without penalty.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mongolian law provides for freedom of religion; there is no
 state religion. Since the 1990 revolution, freedom of
 religion has been respected in practice. There has been a
 
 
 977
 MONGOLIA
 rapid growth in the number of monasteries, and a Buddhist
 clergy-train-ng school opened in Ulaanbaatar, the capital,
 without goveriment interference. Members of the Buddhist
 pï¿½ergy elected a new leader in -1990. He replaced a man who
 had been appointed by the previous government. The Government
 has given permission for a mosque to be built in the western
 Kazakh province of Bayan Ulghi (the first since 1937) and for
 an.Islamic center to be established in Ulaanbaatar. The
 importation of Korans,.was allowed to begin in 1990, and one
 Mongolian was allowed to visit Mecca to make the hajj. The
 Government said.that beginning in 1991 all Moslems may make
 the hajj. An association of Mongolian religious people formed
 in 1990 and has functioned freely. A group of foreign Baha'is
 made a series of presentations at the state theater in
 mid-1990. Christian missionaries began to appear in late
 1990, an. 4the Government did not interfere in their
 activities. The Government has stated that proselytizing
 would b& permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Mongolians pay travel freely inside the.country. While travel
 and job xesillnce changes arestill nominally decided by the.
 .State, in thq wake of the liberalizations of recent years many
 people are freely takings-and leaving jobs. A 1989 census
 revealed that approximately 10 percent of the residents of
 Ulaanbaatar had no residence permits. Mongolia liberalized.,
 emigration.regulations in 1989, and 13,000 Mongolians traveled
 abroad that year. Under current policy, all Mongolians-may.
 leave the country and return to- it. Over 6,000 had traveled
 abroad in the first 8 months of 1990. The Government passed a
 ne.wemigration law, codifying these-rights in October.
 .MongQIiA does not receive many refugees, but the few who have
 come from China's Province of Inner.Mongolia have.been
 accepted for resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political-Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As a result of the.reforms engendered by the 1990 revolution,
 Mongolians have been promised the right to change their
 govenment through periodic, free elections with universal
 suffrage. The Constitution was amhended in March to abolish
 the leading role of the MPRP,-and. create a presidential system
 and the more representative Baga Hural Political parties
 were formally legalized and. an electoral law passed. The GPH
 is directly elected in single member-districts; the Baga Rural
 is selected on the basis of party preference lists.
 Dissatisfaction with elements of the electoral law, perceived
 MPRPmanipulation of the electoral process, and the short
 campaign, period led some opposition parties to threaten
 election boycotts on several occasions. However, in early
 July the MPRP made concessions assuring the participation of
 all,-five registered opposition.parties. On July 29 Mongolian
 citizens participated in the first multiparty elections for
 the GPH and local offices and expressed their party
 preferences in voting for the Baga Hural. The elections were
 generally judged by observers to be free and open. Multiple
 candidates were narrowed to the two top contenders for each
 post in an open primary held July 22.
 Although MPRP candidates captured over 80'percent of the 430
 GPH seats, only 13 percent of GPH deputies were reelected,
 
 
 978
 MONGOLIA
 bringing about wholesale changes within the MPRP. The
 Mongolian Democratic Party, the Progressive National Party,
 the Social Democratic Party, and some 39 independents won the
 remaining GPH seats. Eighteen seats were determined in runoff
 elections. The MPRP won 62 percent of the votes for the Baga
 Hural, giving it 31 of 50 seats. The same three opposition
 parties won the remaining seats. Two opposition parties
 polled less than the 2-percent threshhold required for a seat
 in the Baga Hural. The GPH will meet four times over the next
 5 years while the Baga Hural will meet twice yearly for 75-day
 periods and will act as the standing legislature.
 The GPH met for the first time since the elections on
 September 3 and elected P. Ochirbat of the MPRP and R.
 Gonchigdorg of the Social Democratic Party as President and
 Vice President, respectively. Prime Minister Byambasuren
 (MPRP) and two opposition Deputy Prime Ministers were also
 elected. The rest of the Council of Ministers is composed of
 MPRP members, but Byambasuren has pledged to include all
 parties and ideologies in a collaborative effort to reform
 Mongolia's political, economic, and legal systems.
 While they acknowledged that the election was an important
 step toward establishing democracy in Mongolia, opposition
 leaders noted after the election-that GPH districts of unequal
 size gave unfair advantage to the MPRP, and that inexperience
 and time constraints prevented them from contesting every
 race. In order to give Mongolians a genuine opportunity to
 change their government, they demanded, and the Government
 agreed to consider, holding the next general election in 2
 years rather than in 5.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 -A local human rights group, the Mongolian Human Rights
 Committee, was formed in 1990. While 'it was too early to draw
 conclusions as to its effectiveness, there were at year's end
 no known impediments to its ability to monitor and report on
 human rights developments. At the invitation of the
 Government, the U.S.-based International Human Rights Law
 Group sent an observer team to monitor the July elections.'
 The Government published the texts of international human
 rights agreements in local newspapers.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There appears to be little discrimination in education on the
 basis of race, sex, or religion.
 Universal franchise and equal rights for women are official
 policy. According to government statistics, the percentage of
 women in the work force rose from 30 to 48.5 percent between
 1960 and 1984. Women constitute about 30 percent of the MPRP
 membership and 49.8 percent of trade union membership. Women
 also hold high'professional positions in institutions such as
 schools, research centers, and hospitals. Nine women were
 elected to the Great People's Hural in July. Harassment of
 women does not appear to be practiced, although little
 information about it is available' Little is known about the
 extent to which violence against women, including domestic
 violence, occurs. It has not been discussed as a matter of
 public policy or in the media.
 
 
 MONGOLIA
 Section 6 Worker -Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to organize professional associations and trade
 unions is provided'foi in the Constitution. The charter of
 the Federation of Mongolian TradeUnions(FMTU) also provides
 for the unionization of police and military personnel, but it
 is unclear whpther there are any such unions. Approximately
 75 percent of the total Mongolian work force, including
 agricultural-as.well as industrial workers, is unionized.
 Union officials-are elected by. secret ballot. There are no
 restrictions-on who can be a union official, except that those
 judged mentally incompetent cannot hold union office.
 All unions in Mongolia are cuurently affiliated with the FMTU,
 which formerly was a part of the MPRP. The FMTU separated
 from the party during the 1990 revolution and its charter now
 states that all unions have the right to leave it should they
 so desire. The FMTU also maintains there is no requirement
 for new unions to register with it or with any government
 body. Although ito4sdifficult to make any conclusive
 -assessment of this new policy, it is clear the FMTU is no
 longer an instrument of government control.
 The Constitution places no restrictions on-the political
 activity of unions or union officials. Twenty members of the
 national legislature (Great People's Hural) are labor union
 officials, three of whom are members of the Central Council of-
 the FMTU. During the 1990 elections, unions openly supported
 .candidates from the ruling MPRP and from opposition parties.
 Except in certain key industries, such as transportation,
 communications, and power generation, Mongolians have the
 right to strike.. In key industries workers can also strike,
 -but not all workers may leave their jobs; there must always
 remain enough workers to- maintain minimal services. According
 to the labor law, the Government bears special responsibility
 for seeing that the demands of these workers are met. During
 1990 there- were several strikes lasting from a few hours to a
 few days in the'taxi and the construction industries and-in
 the milk product enterprise. Bus drivers also carried out a
 strike which was only partial, as some workers had to stay at
 work because they are considered.part.of the key
 transportation industry.
 There is no statutory prohibition against unions forming
 federations or. joining international bodies. The FMTU is
 affiliated with the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions and has represented Mongolian workers at the
 International Labor Organization (ILO). The Mongolian
 Transportation Workers Union is affiliated with the
 -Communist-run Trade Union International.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Labor Lai prohibits antiunion discrimination. According
 to the law, any time an employer wishes to fire a worker who
 is a union official, the employer must show work-related cause
 and must obtain the union's approval. Should the union not
 approve, the worker may judicially appeal any firing. The
 courts have the right to order reinstatement. The FMTU says
 there were a few such cases this year, most of which resulted
 in the workers regaining their jobs.
 
 
 980
 MONGOLIA
 The right to bargain collectively is protected in the
 Constitution. The Government sets the minimum wage in most
 industries. The upper boundary of wages is then decided by
 collective bargaining. During 1990 collective bargaining
 agreements were reached with the coal mining, power generation,
 and transportation industries, among others. No export
 processing zones exist in Mongolia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is specifically prohibited by law.
 The Constitution also guarantees the right of workers to be
 compensated for all work they perform. In practice, there is
 no forced labor in Mongolia.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits children from working under the age of 16,
 although those aged 14 may work if allowed to by the local
 trade union committee and given permission by their parents.
 Those under 18 are statutorily prohibited from working at
 night, from doing arduous work, or from working in dangerous
 areas such as mining or construction. The workday is
 prescribed as 8 hours for adults, 7 hours for those aged 16 to
 18, and 6 hours for those aged 14 and 15. These laws are
 strictly enforced by civil authorities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Law sets 46 hours as the standard workweek. For
 those under 18 the standard workweek is 36 hours. The minimum
 wage is $41 per month at the official exchange rate ($8 to $10
 at the black market rate). This minimum wage applies to all
 workers, even to those under 18 who work only 36 hours per
 week. While it is difficult to determine what portion of the
 work force is paid at the minimum wage, this wage, together
 with subsidies provided workers, appears to provide an
 adequate standard of living. The average monthly income in
 Mongolia is $84.32 per month. Overtime is forbidden by law
 except in case of national emergency or natural disaster such
 as an earthquake or floods, and then only with the concurrence
 of the local labor union.
 The Labor Law, the Cooperatives Law, and the Enterprise Law
 provide for occupational safety and health standards. These
 standards are enforced by the Government and trade unions.
 Violators can be fined and imprisoned. There were
 approximately 2,000 industrial accidents in 1990. According
 to the FMTU, every fourth day a Mongolian worker dies from an
 industrial accident.
