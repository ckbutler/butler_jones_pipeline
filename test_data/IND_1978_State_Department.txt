 INDIA
 India has a vigorous democratic political system, an
 independent judiciary and a flourishing free press.
 Fundamental human rights are guaranteed in the Consti-
 tution, and discrimination on the grounds of religion,
 race, caste, sex or place of birth is prohibited.
 India's Constitution mandates the promotion of the edu-
 cation and economic interests of the disadvantaged
 sections of society. These aims are reflected in economic
 policies which give priority to the development of India's
 rural areas and to increasing employment opportunities.
 One of the aims of government since independence has
 been to promote harmony among and the advancement of
 India's diverse peoples and castes. Through legislation
 and government programs the negative effects of the
 traditional social and economic systems have been reduced.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Indian Penal Code. There
 have been few reports of major violations of these pro-
 visions. In two reported cases of deaths which followed
 police interrogations this past year in the states of
 Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, the state governments
 responded by instituting judicial or magisterial
 commissions of inquiry. In the Tamil Nadu case, three
 police officials were found guilty of the wrongful
 confinement and torture of the deceased and were sen-
 tenced to one year's imprisonment. In the Andhra Pradesh
 case, the commission recommended that police officers
 be tried for causing the death of the detainee and the
 rape of his wife. The state government accepted the
 commission's findings to institute criminal proceedings
 and said it would take administrative action against
 other officials involved.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment or punishment is proscribed by law. In
 addition to the two reported deaths following police
 interrogations, there have been occasional press reports
 of harsh police treatment toward those involved in or
 detained following demonstrations and civil disturbances.
 Judicial inquiries have been instituted in at least ten
 cases. In addition, the Government has appointed a blue
 ribbon commission to look into police administration.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Constitution provides that a person detained in
 custody must be informed of the grounds for arrest as
 soon as possible, and shall have the right to be repre-
 sented by counsel. Such persons must be brought before
 a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest and not be detained
 further without the magistrate's authority. The Department
 of State has no information that these provisions have
 been violated in practice.
 However, the Constitution also permits preventive
 detention laws to "prevent threats to the public welfare
 and safeguard national security." It requires that
 these laws provide for certain limits on the length of
 detention and for review of such detention. One pre-
 ventive detention law, the Maintenance of Internal
 Security Act, was repealed in July 1978; the 86 persons
 being held under its authority at that time were released.
 A move in the Indian Parliament in 1978 by human rights
 activists to repeal the constitutional authorization for
 preventive detention laws failed, however, and one such
 law remains on the books--the Conservation of Foreign
 Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act.
 The number of persons being held without trial under this
 law as of June 30, 1978 was 168. In addition, five
 states have preventive detention laws. The number being
 held by these states is not known by the Department of
 State.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no constitutional guarantee of public trial.
 The Criminal Procedure Code provides for open trial but
 
 
 545
 also permits the judiciary to close the proceedings in
 part or in whole. The Official Secrets Act also
 permits proceedings to be closed on the plea that publi-
 cation of any evidence or statements would be preju-
 dicial to the safety of the state. The Act requires,
 however, that the passing of sentence take place in
 public. In India, there are effective legal procedures
 to assure fair trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Criminal Procedure Code requires warrants for
 searches and seizures, but it also permits the police
 in the course of a criminal investigation to institute
 searches without warrant if otherwise there would be
 undue delay. In such a case, the officer must state
 in writing the grounds for making the search without a
 warrant and specify the object of the search. There is
 no indication that this provision has been abused in
 practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 About 46 percent of India's population, or 290 million
 people, live below the Government's official poverty line.
 The ruling Janata Party in 1977 promulgated an economic
 policy statement which places highest priority on develop-
 ing India's rural areas, where eighty percent of the
 population live. In its most recent budget, announced
 in February 1978, the Janata Government gave concrete
 expression to its intention to shift more government
 resources into agriculture and rural development, small-
 scale industry, employment creation and the meeting of
 basic human needs. The Government's outlays for the
 agricultural and allied sectors in 1978-79 were to increase
 by 27 percent. For health and welfare, the increase was
 to be 39 percent. The Reserve Bank of India has issued
 instructions requiring commercial banks to increase their
 loans to the rural sector. A minimum of one-third of
 all commercial bank lending now must be made to priority
 sectors, particularly agriculture.

 Among the goals of the Government's five year (1978-83)
 development plan are: a 35 percent increase in irri-
 gated areas; higher yields per acre and a doubling of
 the agricultural growth rate; the creation of 49 million
 new jobs; increased school attendance, from 69 percent
 to ninety percent of all children six to fourteen years;
 an extension of rural health workers, health center,
 drinking water facilities, roads and electrification;
 and making 66 million more persons literate.
 Government programs to provide special assistance to the
 economically-disadvantaged classes continue. These include
 such affirmative actions as the reservation of a percentage
 of educational admissions and public sector jobs, as
 well as land redistribution, for scheduled castes and
 tribes.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and As~embly
 The Constitution of India guarantees freedom of thought,
 speech and, by extension, press, religion and assembly,
 and these guarantees are honored in practice. There are
 no restrictions on the activities of trade unions, which
 trace their roots to Gandhi and the beginning of the
 Indian independence movement. Trade unions continue to
 be an important, positive force for the good of the
 urban industrial worker.
 The Constitution of India prohibits discrimination by
 the state against any citizen on the grounds of religion,
 race, caste, sex or place of birth. No citizen can be
 subject on such grounds to any disability or restriction
 with regard to public shops and accommodations, public
 wells and water places, or public employment. The
 Constitution also abolishes "untouchability" and forbids
 its practice in any form. Implementing legislation was
 enacted in 1966. It was further amended and strengthened
 in 1976 and renamed the Protection of Civil Rights Act.
 Enforcement of the law is the responsibility of the state
 governments. The record of redress of grievances varies
 from state to state and often reflects the social atti-
 tudes of local officials.
 
 
 547
 Since independence, there has been progress in the
 economic sphere in ameliorating the effects of the
 discrimination inherent in the caste system. Caste-
 based social customs in the cities also have broken down
 to some extent, primarily because the urban environment
 is not a favorable climate for the maintenance of
 traditional caste customs. De facto discrimination
 continues to exist through the soc-iety, however, in jobs,
 education, public accommodations, housing and personal
 relations. The constitutionally-mandated Commissioner
 for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in his last
 annual report noted that such discrimination is deeply
 rooted in the fabric of Indian society, is wide-spread
 in rural India where most of the population resides, and
 continues despite legal provisions and state efforts to
 the contrary. The Commissioner further noted that the
 need to enact more stringent civil rights laws after
 thirty years of independence bears "ample testimony
 of the fact that we continue with our sin of denying
 basic human rights to quite a sizeable section of our
 people."
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration o
 There is full freedom of movement within India for all
 citizens, except for a long-standing requirement of
 permits to enter sensitive tribal border areas. Foreign
 travel and emigration are free, provided regulatory
 requirements are met. These regulations are aimed
 primarily at conserving foreign exchange, restricting
 Indian nationals to $500 in foreign exchange conversion
 privileges every two years. In the past year, the Govern-
 ment of India has simplified the passport application
 process and has established more regional passport
 offices to facilitate issuance.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens of India--regardless of religion, race,
 caste, sex, or place of birth--are free to participate
 in the political process on an equal basis. Women serve
 in the legislatures and cabinets at both the national
 and state level.

 4. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding International
 and Non-.governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International sent a mission to India from
 December 31, 1977 to January 18, 1978 "to obtain a first-
 hand account of the many and serious human rights viola-
 tions during the Emergency period" (June 1975 - March
 1977) and "to acquaint itself with the measures announced
 by the new Government for the restoration of the rule
 of law." In their report of January 10, 1979, the
 mission delegates indicated that they "received full
 cooperation from officials throughout their stay."
