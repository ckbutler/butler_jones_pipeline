 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic and parliamentary
 democracy. Executive power is vested in a president who
 appoints as prime minister the leader of the party which gains
 a plurality of seats in the quinquennial elections for the
 unicameral legislature. The two major political parties
 reflect widely divergent political views. After 16 years of
 Labor Party rule, the election in 1987 brought the Nationalist
 Party to power with a one-seat majority in Parliament.
 Law enforcement and internal security are the responsibility
 of the Malta police under the command of a civilian
 commissioner. The Deputy Prime Minister, who is also Minister
 of Justice, has jurisdiction over the police. A specially
 trained riot police, the Special Assignments Group (SAG),
 forms part of the regular police force. Human rights, a
 subject included in the curriculum of the police academy, are
 generally respected by the police force.
 The Maltese econofny is a mix of state-controlled and private
 firms. Malta is heavily dependent on its ability to export
 and on tourism. Foreign private investment in export-
 oriented, light manufacturing industries is being actively
 promoted, and the Government is also developing Malta as a
 center for offshore business activities.
 Constitutional protection for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual is upheld by an independent
 judiciary. The current Maltese Government is strongly
 committed to human rights. Women encounter a degree of
 culturally based inequality. In 1989 the National Council of
 Women complained publicly about discrimination against women
 in the newly enacted dual citizenship law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No known incidents of political killing occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance are known to have occurred.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were accUsations by the opposition party against the
 police for using excessive force in controlling unruly crowds
 on two separate occasions during the year. Measures for
 prison reform taken in 1989 included training wardens and
 providing higher wages and better working conditions for
 prison guavds. The Government announced its intention to
 bring the penitentiary system "up to European standards."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and is generally respected in practice.
 Police officers above the rank of inspector may issue arrest
 warrants without court order. The police may, on the basis of
 reasonable suspicion, arrest a person for questioning. Within

 MALTA
 48 hours, persons so arrested must be brought before the court
 and charged or released. There is no right to legal counsel
 during this 48-hour period. Persons incarcerated pending trial
 have access to counsel, and periodic hearings are mandatory.
 Provision for bail exists. While previously the granting of
 bail to defendants accused of murder and crimes against the
 security of the State was prohibited by law, the Constitutional
 Court in April, acting on an appeal filed by three persons
 charged with attempted murder, ruled that the criminal code was
 in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. The
 court decreed that judges may now exercise their discretion on
 whether to grant bail or not, and remanded the cases to the
 lower courts. The Constitutional Court in another case
 ordered two police officers to pay a citizen compensation for
 an illegal arrest and detention which occurred in 1983.
 There are no known cases of incommunicado detention or
 political exile. With regard to forced or compulsory labor,
 see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires a fair public trial before an
 impartial court. Recommendations to reform the Constitution
 and to strengthen both the independence and peer review of the
 judiciary are under review by political parties and the public.
 Defendants have the right to counsel of their choice, at public
 expense if necessary. They enjoy a presumption of innocence,
 may confront witnesses and present evidence, and have the right
 of appeal. The courts' jurisdiction is limited in certain
 areas. Lay tribunals (e.g., the Industrial Tribunal, the
 Commissioners for Justice, and the Inheritance Partition
 Tribunal) have exclusive authority over certain judicial
 functions, although their independence is not legally
 guaranteed. Defendants in cases before the Industrial Tribunal
 or the Public Service Commission may not be represented by
 lawyers.
 Maltese criminal law has on several occasions in the past year
 been challenged in the Constitutional Court for not conforming
 to certain provisions of the European Convention on Human
 Rights. In every instance the court has ruled in favor of the
 appellants. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of the home is ensured in the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. Search
 warrants may be issued, on reasonable suspicion of crime, by
 public officers above the rank of inspector, without a court
 order. In a 1989 decision in a case against a former
 parliamentary Secretary for Housing dating back to 1974, the
 Constitutional Court ruled that the requisition order and
 eviction of the complainant from his home had violated his
 constitutional rights. The court ordered payment of
 compensation.
 Political party membership and participation is voluntary.
 However, there is strong societal (family, employment)
 pressure for affiliation with particular parties.
 Electronic surveillance is prohibited by law. However,
 prompted by the opposition's charges that wiretaps were being
 
 
 1193
 MALTA
 unlawfully used against it, the Minister of Justice said he
 would introduce legislation permitting the Government to use
 wiretaps in exceptional circumstances when state security was
 threatened.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression (speech and press) is protected by the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. The only
 exception is the 1987 constitutional amendment which bans
 foreign participation in local politics (e.g., guest foreign
 speakers sponsored by a political party) during the period
 prior to an election.
 The broadcast media (television and radio) are state owned.
 During 1989 opposition viewpoints received prominent,
 frequently extensive, coverage on a par with coverage provided
 to the Government, irrespective of news value, although both
 majority and opposition political parties complained of bias
 in news coverage. A constitutionally mandated Broadcasting
 Authority exists to ensure impartiality in broadcasting, and a
 parliamentary select committee has reported on ways to
 strengthen the broadcasting authority.
 Ten privately owned daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers
 freely express partisan views. Several newspapers are
 associated with political parties. .Academic freedom generally
 is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of peaceful assembly is ensured in the
 Constitution. In 1989 police permits were routinely issued
 for political meetings and other public activities of
 political parties or groups of citizens. On two occasions
 during the-year, violence erupted, prompted by longstanding
 animosityahd polarization between the two leading political
 parties. The first incident occurred during a wedding in an
 opposition patty stronghold attended by prominent government
 officials, where opposition party adherents proceeded to
 attack the wedding party. The second instance was in
 connection with ceremonies and festivities on March 31, the
 day which the opposition party claims as Malta's independence
 day. On both occasions, the Special'Assignments Group (SAG)
 was called in to control the crowd and particular individuals,
 violent behavior. Some people were affected by the tear gas
 and injured by police batons. The opposition party later
 accused the SAG of police brutality and of using excessive
 force.
 For a discussion of freedom of. association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice is
 protected constitutionally and is respected. The
 overwhelmingly dominant religion is Roman Catholicism; small
 numbers of people practice other religions. State subsidies
 are granted only to Catholic schools. In the state schools,
 students have the option at some stage to opt for religious
 instruction in the Catholic faith.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel, or emigration. In July a law was enacted
 enabling returning Maltese emigrants, who have acquired the
 citizenship of another country and resided abroad for a
 minimum of 6 years, to hold dual citizenship. The law does
 not apply to children of emigrants nor to women who left Malta
 to marry a foreigner and obtained the citizenship of their
 husbands.
 Foreign nationals claiming refugee status while visiting Malta
 generally are not permitted to remain in Malta but are allowed
 to stay until settled in a third country. The Emigrants'
 Commission, established in 1987 as the local representative of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has
 worked well in providing assistance and counseling for
 refugees until they are accepted by the UNHCR.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malta is a parliamentary democracy in which the incumbent
 Nationalist Party and the opposition Malta Labor Party
 dominate public life. Political activity is often intense,
 and partisan feelings can be very pronounced, heated, and
 polarized. Elections with universal suffrage, in which all
 parties participate freely, are held every 5 years. During
 the 1987 election, 96.11 percent of those registered actually
 voted.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government places no restrictions on investigations by
 international human rights groups. It is strongly committed
 to human rights and is active in international human rights
 forums. Several local human rights groups and persons
 interested in promoting and protecting human rights operate
 freely.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Maltese citizens have a legal right to housing, employment,
 and education on a nondiscriminatory basis. In practice,
 however, there is discrimination in employment, the provision
 of public services, and the granting of import licenses based
 upon political party affiliation and extended family ties. In
 conformance with its election campaign pledge to obtain
 redress for individual injustices incurred under the previous
 government, the present Government set up a commission shortly
 after its election in 1987 to probe alleged injustices brought
 to its attention. Because of its heavy workload, another two
 commissions were added in 1989 to investigate injustices with
 respect to appointments of public officers, granting of
 licenses permits and government contracts, and provision of
 public services.
 For reasons derived from tradition and culture, Maltese society
 has only recently begun to associate women's rights with human
 rights. There are laws on equal opportunity and equal pay for
 equal work, but discrimination occurs. Job advertisements may
 
 
 1195
 specify whether the positions are for men or women. The low
 rate of participation of women in the work force can be partly
 attributed to a tax structure which discourages married women
 from working. As of January 1990, however, a new tax law will
 eliminate the tax disincentive for married women.
 Married women lose entitlements and seniority personally
 acquired (retirement, health benefits, social security) upon
 marriage. Legally, the husband is head of the family unit
 with dominant responsibility for economic and financial
 questions, as well as all major decisions concerning children.
 Married women can own businesses and hold checking accounts
 only with the consent of their husbands. They must be
 represented by their husbands in business or financial
 litigation. This inequity has been challenged by women's
 organizations, among others the Commission for the Advancement
 of Women, which was formed in collaboration with the Government
 in March. The Commission has drafted a new family law aimed.
 at eliminating the inferior status and discriminatory treatment
 of women, which it hopes the Government will act upon. The
 Government has responded by setting up a Secretariat for the
 Equality of Women within the Ministry of Social Policy, which
 will monitor legislation relating to women and draw up
 initiatives leading to the equality of women. Married women
 are also discriminated against in the recently enacted dual
 citizenship law (see Section 2.d.). The National Council of
 Women has complained to the Government and threatened to take
 its case to the European Commission of Human Rights.
 There are no laws specifically prohibiting abuse of women. A
 church refuge for battered women exists and is partially
 supported by the Government. In 1989 the Government increased
 its contribution to the refuge. A privately organized
 association of battered women also exists.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right, respected in practice, to associate
 freely and to strike. The only groups restrained from
 striking are the uniformed personnel of the armed forces and
 the police. In -1989 there were 23 trade unions registered in
 Malta representing over 51 percent of the work force. The
 General Workers Union (GWU) and the Union Haddiema Maghqudin
 are the two largest unions. The GWU has been institutionally
 tied to the Malta Labor Party since .1978, and it has
 participated in the Labor Party Government. The other labor
 unions are independent of political parties, and the current
 Government encourages the development of free trade unions
 without party affiliation. Maltese unions belong to a variety
 of international trade union groupings.
 There were occasional sporadic strikes of short duration
 during 1989, most of them politically motivated. Under the
 Industrial Relations Act of 1976, the responsible minister may
 refer disputes to the Industrial Tribunal for binding
 settlement, in effect limiting the right to strike. In 1989
 the Committee of Experts of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) asked the Government to take the necessary
 measures to bring this legislation into conformity with ILO
 principles. It also noted with satisfaction the efforts made
 by the Government to refund the salaries of worker-students
 involved in a teachers' strike in 1984.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free, in law and in practice, to organize and
 bargain collectively. Voluntary worker-employer negotiations
 and collective bargaining are encouraged by the current
 Government. The 1976 Act provided for the creation of a joint
 negotiating council for the public sector, but this has not
 yet been formed.
 According to the Industrial Relations Act, an employer may not
 take action against any employee because he or she belongs to
 a trade union. Complaints may be addressed through a court of
 law or an industrial tribunal composed of one member each
 named by the employer, union, and the Government. Complaints
 of discrimination may also be lodged with the Commission
 against Injustices which was set up in 1987.
 There are no export processing zones in Malta.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is constitutionally prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children younger than 16 years may not legally be employed.
 This injunction is generally respected and enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage in Malta in 1989 was $86.65 per week.
 The minimum wage is generally enforced. Given government
 subsidies in housing, health care, and free education, the
 minimum wage provides a basic standard of living.
 Maximum hours of work are regulated by wage council orders for
 various trades. For most sectors, the maximum is 40 hours per
 week, but in some trades the maximum allowable is 43 or 45
 hours per week. Government labor regulations prescribe daily
 rest periods of 1 hour. Annual paid vacation according to law
 is currently 22 working days.
 Occupational safety standards and health regulations,
 especially in the dockyards and construction sectors, are
 being reviewed and updated. The Government is in the process
 of organizing the recently established authority for workers'
 health, safety, and welfare, which will be responsible for
 educating workers and enforcing occupational safety standards;
 enforcement heretofore has been lax. Following two serious
 occupational accidents, one of which resulted in death, the
 Department of Labor took legal action against the employers.
