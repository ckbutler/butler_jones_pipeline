 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal structure and an inde-
 pendent judiciary. The bicameral Parliament elects the seven members of the Fed-
 eral Council, the highest executive body, whose presidency rotates annually. Be-
 cause of the nation's linguistic and religious diversity, the Swiss political system em-
 phasizes local and national political consensus and grants considerable autonomy to
 individual cantons.
 The Swiss armed forces are a civilian-controlled militia based on universal mili-
 tary service for able-bodied males. There is virtually no standing army apart from
 training cadres and a few essential headquarters staff functions. Police duties are
 primarily a responsibility of the individual cantons, which have their own distinct
 police forces kept under effective control. The National Police Authority has a co-
 ordination role and relies on the cantons for actual law enforcement.
 Switzerland has a highly developed free enterprise industrial and service economy
 strongly dependent on international trade. The standard of living is very high.
 The Government fully respects human rights, and there were no major human
 rights problems. However, there continue to be instances of violence against foreign-
 ers and lingering concerns over minor violence against foreigners in police custody.
 In 1994 an independent government inquiry cleared police of similar allegations.
 The implementation of a new law against asylum seekers who are suspected of com-
 mitting a crime has led to charges of unjustified detention or incarceration. How-
 ever, the federal court has overturned police and lower court actions deemed in vio-
 lation of the new law. Some laws still tend to discriminate against women. However,
 amendments to the law on gender equality were to have come into force in January
 1996. The Government is taking serious steps to address violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KMling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 On November 13, Egyptian diplomat Ahmed Alaa Nazmi was shot and killed in
 Geneva. No suspects have been identified; a group calling itself the International
 Justice Group claimed credit for the killing, in "retribution for anti-Islamic actions.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution proscribes such practices, and there were no reports of violations.
 In response to claims of minor violence in 1994 against persons in cantonal police
 custody, the Federal Government conducted an inquiry and exonerated the cantonal
 police forces.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The legal prohibitions on arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile are fully respected at all levels of government. A suspect
 may not be held longer than 24 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by the
 investigative magistrate. A suspect has the right to choose and contact an attorney
 as soon as the warrant is issued; the State provides free counsel for indigents. In-
 vestigations are generally prompt even if in some cases investigative detention may
 exceed the length of sentence. Release on personal recognizance or bail is granted
 unless the magistrate believes the person is dangerous or will not appear for trial.
 Any lengthy detention is subject to review by higher judicial authorities.
 There is no summary exile, nor is exile used as a mean of political control. Non-
 Swiss convicted of crimes may receive sentences which include denial of reentry for
 a specific period following completion of a prison sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 
 
 1047
 The Constitution provides for public trials in which the defendant's rights are
 fully respected, including the right to challenge and to present witnesses or evi-
 dence. All courts of first instance are local or cantonal courts. Minor cases are tried
 by a single judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder (or other serious
 cases) by a public jury. Trials are usually held expeditiously. Citizens have the right
 to appeal to a higher instance court, ultimately to the Federal Court.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 Most csntons since 1991 have suspended the incarceration of conscientious objec-
 tors and have replaced it with public service work. This change of policy took place
 in expectation of a new law instituting a civilian service alternative for conscien-
 tious objectors, even though'the law then in effect provided for no exemption. Par-
 liament passed the new law and it is to come into force in January 1996. The new
 law essentially dcriminalizes refusal to serve in the military if such refusal is moti-
 vatd by reasons of conscientious objection.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Can-
 tonal laws regulate police entry into private premises. These regulations differ wide-
 ly from canton to canton, but all prohibit such practices without a warrant. All gov-
 ernment authorities respect these provisions, and violations are subject to effective
 legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 The authorities may legally restrict these freedoms for groups deemed to be a threat
 to the State, but no groups were restricted during the year. In addition, an article
 of the Penal Code criminalizes racist or anti-Semitic expression, whether in public
 speech or in printed material.
 Most broadcast media are government-funded but possess editorial autonomy, and
 foreign broadcast media are freely available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete freedom of reli-
 gion, and the Government respects this right in practice. There is no single state
 church, but most cantons support one or several churches out of public funds. A tax-
 payer may opt out of contributing to church funding in all cantons, but in 19 can-
 tons private companies may not.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the Constitution and the law, citizens are free to travel in or
 outside the country, to emigrate, and to repatriate.
 Switzerland has traditionally been a haven for refugees, but public concern over
 the high number of asylum seekers generated pressure on the Government to tight.
 en its policy.
 The prominent role played by some asylum seekers in narcotics trafficking led to
 passage of a new law in February. The new legislation introduced tougher measures
 aimed at refugees suspected of committing crimes or illegally avoiding repatriation.
 The law contains the following key elements which apply only to those suspected
 or convicted of a felony: preliminary incarceration of an asylum seeker waiting for
 a decision concerning his asylum request; detention prior to repatriation to avoid es-
 cape; and restrictions on freedom of movement to inhibit access to the local narcotics
 market. In all of these measures, the new law obliges the police to inform a judge
 of their action. At that point, the judge can overturn the police action. If the judge
 approves incsrceration, the detained asylum seeker's right of appeal is mre cir-
 cumscribed than that of citizens or foreigners with legal status. Nevertheless, the
 Federal Court has overturned decisions by judges who were deemed to have imple-
 mented the new law improperly, without sufficient regard for the rights of asylum
 seekers.
 The new law does not apply to noncriminal asylum seekers whose asylum applica-
 tions continue to recive orderly consideration. The Government cooperates with the
 UN. High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees.
 Refugees whose applications are rejected are allowed to stay temporarily if their
 home country experiences war or insurrection.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully (at all local, cantonal, and federal levels), and citizens exercise this right
 in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal
 suffrage. In addition, initiative and referendum procedures provide unusually in-
 tense popular involvement in the legislative process.
 Participation  by  women in   politics continues to  expand. Women     were
 disenfranchised until 1971 at the federal level, but since then their participation in
 politics has expanded unabatedly. Women occupy 41 of the 248 seats in the Par-
 liament, 1 of 7 seats in the Federal Council (cabinet), and a record 16 in the can-
 tonal government executive bodies. The Federal Office for Equality Between the
 Genders released a brochure intended to encourage and facilitate women's participa-
 tion in the country's political life. In addition, petitioners succeeded in collecting
 enough signatures to force a vote on mandated equal gender representation in all
 federal institutions. A referendum on this issue will not take place for several years,
 given the legal process the proposal must follow. In September voters rejected a
 local initiative to require a fixed percentage of elective seats for women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International And Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 All major international human rights groups are active and operate without gov-
 ernment restriction.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, reli-
 gin language, or social status, and the Government effectively enforces these pro-
 hibitions. To ensure that the disabled are in no way discriminated against or dis-
 advantaged, a member of Parliament proposed in October a formal amendment to
 the Constitution for this purpose.
 Women.-While there are no data about violence against women, indications are
 that a problem exists and that many cases go unreported. The Federation of Wom-
 en's Organizations and other groups have heightened public awareness on the prob-
 lem of violence against women. The law prohibits wife beating and similar offenses,
 and spousal rape is expliitly considered a crime in the Penal Code. The Penal Code
 also criminalizes sexual exploitation and trafficking in women. The authorities effec-
 tively enforce these laws. Victims of violence can obtain help, counseling, and legal
 assistance from specialized offices sponsored by local and cantonal authorities.
 Although the Constitution prohibits all kinds of discrimination, some laws still
 tend to discriminate against women. However, the Government is taking effective
 action against this, and Parliament has recently passed significant legislation im-
 proving the treatment of women. Amendments to the law on gender equality were
 approved by the two houses of Parliament and were to have come into force in Janu-
 ary 1996. Their goal is to facilitate lawsuits by individual women (or organizations
 representing them), to reduce the burden of proof on female plaintiffs in discrimina-
 tion cases (or even reverse it in some instances), and to strengthen the authority
 of the Federal Office for Equality. In August the Government transmitted to Par-
 liament for ratification the 1987 U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
 of Discrimination Against Women.
 Significant disparities still exist between the wages received by men and women.
 Despit    e statutory requirement of equal pay for equivalent work, some studies
 (whose veracity cannot be confirmed) suggest that women's wages lag on average
 15 percent behind those of men.
 Children .-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through a well-funded public education system and medical care.
 The federal and cantonal governments, as well as organizations defending children's
 rights, in recent years have devoted considerable attention to possible abuses
 against children, especially sexual abuse. For convicted perpetrators of the latter,
 the law mandates imprisonment for up to 15 years. In June 1994, the Government
 approved the 1989 UY.. Convention on Children Rights and tramitted the drat
 bill to Parliament for ratification, albeit with some reservations. In addition, it de-
 cided in July to intensify its actions against child abuse. The Government plans to
 subsidize a prevention and information campaign and the activities of groups de-
 fending chidren's  hts.
 People With Disiities.-qThere is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the prcvision of other state services. The Government
 has not mandated that buildings or transportation facilities be made accessible. An
 
 
 1049
 umbrella organization representing most associations defending the rights of dis-
 abled persons participates actively in the political scene. This organization is par-
 ticulary active on issues concerning transport and mobility of the disabled, and
 their professional integration. Disabled men will no longer be required to pay the
 tax on men who have not accomplished their military duty.
 NationallIRaciallEthni Minorities.-Reported attacks against foreigners (includ-
 ing abusive language) were less fequent in the first half of the year than during
 the same period of previous years. Between January and June, 22 alleged racist at-
 tacks were reported compared to more than 90 for all of 1994. Investigations of
 these attacks are conducted effectively and lead in most cases to the arrest of the
 responsible persons. Persons convicted of racist crimes are commonly sentenced to
 at least I year's imprisonment.
 In accordance with the country's first antiracism law which was approved in Sep-
 tember 1994 (and which criminalizes racist and anti-Semitic actions or public
 speech), the Government appointed in August a new commission against racism.
 This group of experts will focus on preventive measures and will serve as a mediator
 for conflicts between individuals.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, including foreigners, have the freedom
 to associate freely, to join unions of their choice, and to select their own representa-
 tives. The Government does not hamper the exercise of these rights. About one-third
 of the work force is unionized.
 The right to strike is legally recognized and freely exercised, but a unique labor
 peace under an informal agreement between unions and employers--in existence
 since the 1930's-has meant fewer than 10 strikes per year since 1975. There were
 no sinificant strikes in 1995.
 Umons are independent of government and political parties, and laws prohibit ret-
 ribution against strikers or their leaders. Unions can associate freely with inter-
 national organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-By law, workers have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively, and the law protects them from acts of
 antiunion discrimination. The Government fully respects these provisions. Periodic
 negotiations between employer and worker orgamzations determine wages and
 other labor matters at the national and local levels. Nonunion firms generally adopt
 the terms and conditions fixed in the unions' collective bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there is no specific con-
 stitutional or statutory ban on forced or compulsory labor, it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Childien.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 15 years, and children are in school up to this age. Children over 13
 years may be employed in light duties for not more than 9 hours a week during
 the school year and 15 hours otherwise. Employment of youths between ags 15 and
 20 is strictly regulated; they cannot work at night on Sundays, or under hazardous
 or dangerous conditions. The Federal Office for Industry, Trade, and Labor effec-
 tively enforces the law on working conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The low-
 est wages flxed in collective bargaining are always adequate to provide a decent
 standard of living for workers and their families.
 The Labor Act established a maximum 45-hour workweek for blue- and white-col-
 lar workers in industry, services, and retail trades, and a 50-hour workweek for all
 other workers. The law prescribes a rest period during the workweek. Overtime is
 limited by law to 120 hours annually.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain extensive regulations
 to protect worker health and safety. There have been no reports of lapses in the en-
 forcement of these regulations, but the degree to which enforcement is effective is
 unclear. The Government is currently overhauling the 1948 Labor Act, in part to
 strengthen provisions for workers' health and safety. A worker may opt out of a dan-
 gerous assignment without penalty.
