 ANGOLA*
 The People's Republic of Angola, the regime established in
 Luanda upon the withdrawal of the Portuguese in 1975, is ruled
 by the only legal political party, the Marxist-Leninist
 Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).
 President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is both Head of State and
 chief of the MPLA. -His rule was reconfirmed by the MPLA's
 Second Party Congress in December 1985. All major policy
 decisions are made by a small elite in the MPLA, which also
 controls all means of mass communication. Open political
 dissension is not tolerated.
 Now in its 13th year, the regional conflict involving Angola,
 Namibia, South Africa, and the internal conflict between the
 Government and the main opposition force, the National Union
 for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), again dominated
 events in 1988. On December 22, 1988, however, the parties to
 the international conflict--Cuba, Angola, and South Africa--
 signed a series of agreements under U.S. mediation that will
 lead to independence for Namibia in the context of total Cuban
 troop withdrawal from Angola. This should significantly
 reduce regional tensions in the coming year. There were also
 signs that elements within the Government were reconsidering
 their opposition to opening a dialog with UNITA to end the
 civil war. UNITA has repeatedly stated that it favors a
 government of national unity and does not seek to establish an
 alternate government.
 The Angolan armed forces (FAPLA) total approximately 100,000.
 TAPLA is backed by a lightly armed Peoples' Militia, which is
 used for counterinsurgency and defensive duties within their
 localities. UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, is estimated to have
 a regular force of about 30,000, as well as a comparable
 number of irregular troops. It has the allegiance of a
 substantial portion of the population, especially among
 Angola's largest ethnic group, the Ovimbundu. UNITA controls
 the southeastern quarter of Angola's territory. The Angolan
 Government receives extensive military assistance from the
 Soviet Union, and an estimated 50,000 Cuban military personnel
 are stationed in the country. The United States supports
 UNITA in the Angolan conflict and has provided its forces with
 assistance.
 The fighting, combined with misguided economic policies, has
 devastated the country's infrastructure, forced a return to
 barter in some areas, and has led the Government to divert
 much of its revenues to the military, including payments to
 the Soviet bloc for military equipment and Cuban combat
 troops. Although foreign exchange earnings from Angola's oil
 exports increased in 1988 (to over $2 billion), the
 expenditure of hard currency for weapons and the impact of war
 on the productivity and distribution networks of Angolan
 agriculture appear to have created a chronic food shortage in
 both the cities and the countryside. The threat of famine,
 reportedly evident at the end of 1987, appears to have faded
 in the face of actions taken by the international donor
 community and the Government itself. The Government, in
 *The United States does not maintain diplomatic relations with
 the People's Republic of Angola and thus has no diplomatic
 personnel there able to monitor human rights conditions or
 evaluate allegations of abuses.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 response to the generally critical situation, announced on
 August 17, 1987, its intention to institute economic reforms,
 but it had not taken any significant steps by the end of
 1988. The Government also has applied for admission to the
 International Monetary Fund.
 In 1988 human rights abuses continued as the fighting showed
 no signs of abating. The prosecution of the war resulted in
 numerous allegations that government, UNITA, Cuban, and South
 African forces killed civilians and that the MPLA and UNITA
 executed political prisoners. There are no reliable casualty
 figures, but the international press focused on the large
 number of civilian casualties due to the extensive use of
 landmines. Upwards of 20,000 persons may have lost limbs as a
 result of the widespread use of landmines. Some recent
 estimates indicate that about 700,000 of the 8 to 9 million
 population have been displaced internally, in addition to some
 400,000 refugees resident in neighboring countries.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reports of political killings on the part of the Government
 and UNITA, both within the combat areas and in the form of
 summary executions of prisoners, persisted in 1988. It is
 difficult to evaluate the various claims and counterclaims.
 The fighting also resulted in many civilian-deaths. While
 some of these deaths were inadvertently caused by military
 operations, others may have been deliberately perpetrated by
 opposing forces to intimidate civilian populations. The MPLA
 and UNITA publicly and repeatedly accused each other of
 practicing terrorism against their respective opponents,
 including killing or maiming civilians. UNITA additionally
 charged that Cuban forces have been involved in attacks on
 civilians. Civilians also have.died as a result of UNITA
 actions, such as attacks on ground transportation and other
 economic targets.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information to confirm that secret arrests or
 clandestine detentions are practiced by government security
 agencies or by UNITA, although each side has accused the other
 of such practices.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Allegations of torture and mistreatment made by both sides
 appear to have some basis in fact, but torture of opponents
 does not appear to be a generalised systematic practice of
 either the Government or UNITA.
 Angolan prison conditions are poor, with substandard diet and
 sanitation. There are some unconfirmed reports that
 foreigners are not well treated, but Americans who have been
 imprisoned in Angola appear to have been treated adequately
 and to have had access to medical care.
 Prison authorities reportedly have wide latitude in the
 treatment of prisoners. Treatment of political prisoners in
 
 
 8
 ANGOLA
 the prisons controlled by the Ministry of State Security
 appears to be harsher than treatment in the regular prisons.
 There are reports of mistreatment including beatings, threats,
 and prolonged interrogation with the use of force. Family
 visits appear to be arbitrarily restricted in many instances.
 Foreign advisers, including Cuban and East Germans, are
 assisting Angolan state security services and may help in
 operating state security prisons. The Government continues to
 put captured UNITA supporters on public display.
 Very limited information is available on the administrative
 structure and practices within UNITA-held areas. There have
 been reports that UNITA mistreats some prisoners, but,
 generally, these could neither be confirmed nor disproved. In
 1988, however, two Cuban military prisoners freed by UNITA
 indicated that they had been well treated while in captivity.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile,
 Under Angolan law, persons suspected of committing serious
 acts against the security of the State may be held by the
 Ministry of State Security without charge for an initial
 period of 3 months, renewable for a further period of 3
 months. Such detainees need not be presented to a judge
 within 48 hours of their arrest, as stipulated in the Code of
 Criminal Procedure for persons suspected of other kinds of
 crime, and apparently have no right to challenge the grounds
 of their detention. After 6 months in detention without
 charge, the detainee must be informed of the accusations, with
 the State Security Service either informing the public
 prosecutor of the charges or releasing the suspect. Once the
 case is presented to the public prosecutor, there does not
 appear to be a specific time limit within which a suspect must
 be brought to trial.
 The deterioration of the security situation has exacerbated
 the general decline in judicial safeguards and due process.
 The Government has established regional military councils
 throughout much of Angola. They are responsible directly to
 President Dos Santos and have broad authority to restrict the
 movement of people and goods, to requisition people and goods
 without compensation, and to try crimes against the security
 of the State. The Government has also created "People's
 Vigilance Brigades" for urban areas, whose powers are not
 clear but include general administration and "protecting the
 people and ensuring public order and stability."
 Amnesty International's (AI) 1988 report (covering 1987)
 stressed that arbitrary arrests by the Government are
 continuing. A large number of persons have been detained by
 the Government on suspicion of ties with UNITA, and in some
 cases held for years without being charged or brought to
 trial. AI's report mentions the case of Claudio Pereira
 Songamaso, director of legal affairs of the Angolan Red Cross
 Society. He was held incommunicado for several months on
 suspicion of assisting UNITA. Outside Luanda and the main
 cities, detainees are often held in special detention camps.
 In some cases, detainees haave been sent to "reeducation
 centers" for political indoctrination.
 The precise number of political detainees and prisoners is not
 known but may have been several hundred at the end of 1988.
 Most were held on suspicion of aiding or sympathizing with
 UNITA. It is not clear how many captured UNITA military
 
 
 9
 ANGOLA
 personnel were being held, as distinguished from civilian
 political detainees.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although the Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary, in practice the judiciary follows party guidelines.
 The Constitution also states that no citizen shall be arrested
 and brought to trial except under the terms of the law, which
 includes a public trial and the right of the accused to legal
 counsel. There is, however, insufficient evidence to determine
 to what extent these rights are observed in practice in regular
 criminal and civil cases.
 In the past, AI has expressed concern that trials of government
 opponents, notably in military tribunals, do not conform to
 internationally recognized standards. In particular,
 defendants reportedly were not given adequate opportunity to
 present their defense or appeal their cases. AI's 1988 report
 indicated that 29 defendants had been tried in January 1987 by
 the People's Revolutionary Tribunal on charges of treason,
 conspiracy, rebellion, and economic sabotage. AI also noted
 that detailed information was not available on the trial other
 than that 14 persons had been convicted and that some of the
 defendants reportedly had been accused of links with UNITA.
 Judicial lines of authority are unclear, especially since the
 regional military councils have been given responsibility for
 the trial of offenses against the security of the State,
 including "economic crimes." It is not known which trials are
 open to the public and under what rules of procedure the
 various military and civilian courts operate. The Constitution
 also provides for a People's Supreme Court, but its
 jurisdiction is not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of
 the home and privacy of correspondence, the Government conducts
 arbitrary searches of homes, censors private correspondence,
 and monitors private communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression "in the
 context of the achievement of the basic objectives of the
 People's Republic of Angola." In fact, the Angolan people
 live under censorship, intimidation, and Government control of
 the media. Opposition views are not tolerated, and critics
 such as Bartolomeu Dias Fernandes, who was accused of
 "insulting the Head of State," have been sentenced to long
 prison terms.
 The Government is especially sensitive to criticism in the
 foreign press. But in 1986 the Government began to allow the
 travel of foreign correspondents to Angola in a controlled
 flow, a practice that was continued in 1987 and 1988. Angola
 subscribes to the "Front Line" states' ban on visits by South
 Africa-based news correspondents. The circulation of Western
 journals and periodicals in Angola is tightly restricted.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is denied to any political group or
 movement other than the MPLA. All other political movements
 have been banned. There are numerous unconfirmed reports of
 arrests of people who voice support of opposition movements or
 alternative political systems. The People's Vigilance
 Brigades, which have some law enforcement authority in urban
 areas, and the martial law climate throughout the country tend
 further to restrict freedom of assembly and association.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of
 freedom of conscience and belief and for separation of church
 and state, the Government publicly emphasizes the importance
 of propagating atheism and has been critical of religious
 activities. The overwhelming majority of the Angolan
 population is Christian, however, and the Government has not
 moved to close down officially recognized churches. Church
 services are held regularly, and there is widespread
 attendance. Foreign and Angolan missionaries are allowed to
 carry out their normal activities. Reportedly, UNITA respects
 freedom of religion in the areas it controls. In the past,
 UNITA several times captured foreign missionaries, releasing
 them unharmed after publicly warning them of the dangers of
 being caught in the combat zone.
 The Government refuses to recognize smaller religious sects
 that it deems subversive. The most recent known case of
 repression concerns the Tocoist Church, founded in Africa in
 1949, which has a syncretic blend of Christian beliefs and
 indigenous religious practices. The Government banned the
 Church in 1977, and in 1987 it apparently tried and executed a
 number of church members.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a result of the increased fighting, the Government is
 acutely sensitive about security and has tightly restricted
 travel. Travel by road in most areas of Angola is dangerous.
 The Government has instituted a pass system within Angola, and
 foreigners are generally prohibited from traveling outside the
 principal cities. UNITA has publicly warned that it considers
 all of Angola to be a war zone and that it cannot guarantee
 the safety of persons traveling there.
 Angolan citizens are allowed to travel abroad, but this travel
 is carefully controlled by restrictions on issuance of
 passports and exit visas and by currency restrictions.
 Emigration is restricted. The Government limits travel to
 Angola through a selective and stringent visa policy.
 Angola is a party to the U.N. Protocol Relating to the Status
 of Refugees. There are currently approximately 70,000
 Namibian, 13,000 Zairian, and 10,000 South African refugees or
 displaced persons in Angola. As of December 1988, about 1,000
 Angolan and 1,000 Zairean refugees had registered with the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to request repatriation to
 their respective homeland.
 
 
 11
 ANGOLA
 Approximately 300,000 Angolans are still refugees in Zaire,
 and an estimated 94,000 are in Zambia. The Government claims
 that 180,000 exiles have returned to Angola over the years,
 but this claim cannot be verified.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government.
 Angola is ruled by a small group of officials within the party
 apparatus of the ruling MPLA. The Constitution provides for
 popular participation in the political process, but political
 activity is limited to participation in the MPLA or in one of
 its controlled and sanctioned organizations such as its youth
 wing, the Angolan Women's Organization, or the trade union
 movement. Political power is centered in the elite membership
 of the Politburo and the somewhat larger Central Committee.
 Party membership is very restricted, with fewer than 30,000
 members out of a population of 8 to 9 million, according to
 the official media.
 The Constitution provides for a popularly elected National
 People's Assembly, established in 1981, and people's
 assemblies at the provincial and local level. However,
 despite recent suggestions from President Dos Santos that the
 powers and membership of the National People's Assembly be
 broadened, as of the end of 1988 only candidates chosen and
 endorsed by the party have been elected. Key members of the
 party also hold leadership positions in the other people's
 assemblies.
 Both the MPLA and UNITA have primarily ethnic bases of
 support--the MPLA among Kimbundu speakers, and UNITA among the
 Ovimbundu, Ganguela, and Lunda-Chokwe. The National Front for
 the Liberation of Angola (FLNA) has its base among the
 Bakongo, but the FLNA is no longer a major force in Angolan
 politics and has in part been integrated into the MPLA.
 Members of all of Angola's ethnic groups and religions, as
 well as women, participate in both organizations, some at high
 levels of the party. However, non-Kimbundu groups are greatly
 underrepresented in the small group within the ruling MPLA
 Central Committee and Politburo. Mesticos (Angolans of mixed
 racial background numbering only about 1 percent of the
 population) remain the most highly skilled and educated group
 in Angola and are influential--politically, culturally, and
 economically--beyond their numbers.
 Women and blacks were given more positions in the top
 leadership by the 1985 Second Party Congress.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government did not respond to AI's 1987 appeal for
 information concerning numerous political detainees. The
 Government has been more forthcoming with international
 assistance groups. It allowed the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) and United Nations International
 Children's Emergency Fund to provide food and medical
 assistance in areas it controls. UNITA allows the ICRC to
 conduct similar operations in areas it controls. The
 Government has not responded to ICRC requests for access to
 all persons arrested in connection with internal events and
 the military situation in the country.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Because of the disturbed situation prevailing in most of
 Angola, there is little information available on the existence
 or extent of discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Angolan workers do not have the right to form independent
 trade unions. The sole legally recognized trade union
 organization in Angola is the National Union of Angolan
 Workers (UNTA), which was formed in the late 1950's as an
 appendage of the MPLA and became the ruling party's official
 labor wing after Angolan independence in 1975. The pre-
 independence Portuguese-run labor centers of rival liberation
 organizations ceased to exist soon after the MPLA took control
 of the country.
 The monopoly situation of the UNTA is ensured by the statutory
 basis of the single-union structure. Still, the activities of
 the labor central and its affiliates are tightly controlled by
 the Government and the party. The UNTA participates in
 meetings of the International Labor Organization (ILO), to
 which Angola belongs, and is affiliated to the continent-wide
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and the Communist-
 controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Strikes are illegal and considered to be a crime against the
 security of the State.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to bargain collectively. The
 Government through the Minister of Labor and Social Security
 controls the process of setting wages and benefits, but it
 coordinates with UNTA and employers. As far as is known,
 labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 During 1988 both sides accused each other of relying on forced
 conscription of young males for recruitment into the military
 forces. In 1984 the Angolan Government was cited by the ILO
 for being in violation of ILO Convention 105, which prohibits
 forced labor. The basis of this citation is Angolan
 legislation providing for compulsory labor for breaches of
 labor discipline and participation in strikes. The Government
 has yet to supply the ILO with a full report on the matter.
 The 1988 report of the ILO Committee of Experts indicated that
 the cited legislation remained in force and had not been
 brought into conformity with ILO Convention 105, which Angola
 ratified in 1976.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no information available on this subject.
 e   Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no information available on this subject.
