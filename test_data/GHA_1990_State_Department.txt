 GHANA
 Ghana is governed by the Provisional National Defense Council
 (PNDC) under the chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant Jerry John
 Rawlings who seized power from an elected government on
 December 31, 1981, and suspended the constitution. Under the
 Establishment Proclamation of January 11, 1982, the PNDC
 exercises "all powers of government." In addition to Chairman
 Rawlings, the PNDC consists of eight members, of whom two are
 serving military officers and six are civilians. The
 executive consists of ministries headed by secretaries, who
 together constitute a committee of secretaries, chaired by a
 PNDC member, that drafts laws for referral to the PNDC for
 final consideration and approval. There is no national
 legislative body, but in 1989 elections were held for nonparty
 district assemblies, the country's only forum for popular
 involvement in decisionmaking. These assemblies are tasked
 with defining and carrying out local development projects.
 The district assemblies notwithstanding, all senior national,
 regional, and district officials are appointed by the PNDC.
 The several security organizations report to various
 departments, but all come under the control of the PNDC. Most
 security cases of a political nature are handled by the Bureau
 of National Investigation (BNI). All security agencies report
 to the PNDC member for Foreign Affairs and National Security.
 Although Ghana is attempting to rebuild its industrial base
 after years of economic mismanagement, more than 60 percent of
 the population is still involved in agriculture. Cocoa and
 cocoa products provide about two-thirds of export revenues.
 Minerals, principally gold, diamonds, manganese ore, and
 bauxite, are also produced and exported. Economic growth has
 averaged 5 percent annually since the inception of the
 Economic Recovery Program in 1983. In recent months, the
 inflation rate has accelerated again and was about 37 percent
 in 1990.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in Ghana during 1990.
 There continued to be significant restrictions on such basic
 rights as freedom of speech, press, assembly, and religion;
 the right of citizens to change their government; and legal
 due process. Major Protestant churches and the Roman Catholic
 Church have refused to register with the Government as
 required under PNDC law 221 of June 1989. After being
 "frozen" for 18 months, the Mormons are again allowed to
 worship publicly. The Jehovah's Witnesses remained "frozen"
 and cannot worship publicly; the Government indicated it was
 willing to review the case. Summary arrest and detention were
 continuing problems with instances of incarceration without
 formal charges. The Government sponsored a series of public
 meetings in 1990 for the populace to discuss and propose ideas
 for changing the current system for one providing greater
 participation, but by year's end no specific proposals had
 emerged.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 
 
 143
 GHANA
 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have been occasional credible reports of torture and
 beatings in recent years, although there were none in 1990.
 Amnesty International (AI) appealed in 1989 to the Government
 to investigate instances of reported mistreatment of political
 prisoners.
 Prisons in Ghana are antiquated and seriously overcrowded;
 conditions are harsh, and there have been a number of deaths.
 Within the past few years two American citizens with medical
 problems died in Ghanaian prisons. The Government established
 a commission in 1989 to look into prison. reform, but atyear's
 end the commission had issued no public report, and the-
 Government had announced no-significant ameliorative steps-
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The criminal code provides minimal legal protections against
 arbitrary arrest and detention. Although accused persons have-
 the right to be charged formally within 48 hours of detention,
 the court can set excessive bail or refuse to release persons
 on bail and instead remand them without charge for an
 indefinite period, subject to weekly review. The only-crimes
 for which, by statute, there is no bail are murder and
 subversion. PNDC law 4 (Preventive Custody Law of 19821
 provides for indefinite detention without trial if the- PNDC
 determines it is in the-interest of national security. A 1984
 law prevents any judicial inquiry into the grounds for-
 detention under PNDC law 4. Ghanaian security forces
 occasionally take persons into custody, with or without
 warrants, and hold them incommunicado for extended periods of
 time, with no legal recourse available to the detainee. The
 threat of such treatment serves as a deterrent to political or
 other opposition activities which the PNDC wishes to
 discourage.
 In past years, and in 1990, businessmen suspected of illegal
 activities, especially in the timber industry, wete often
 arrested and incarcerated while the Government undertook
 investigations. Lebanese and other resident foreign
 businessmen have been jailed and held for extended periods
 without formal charges and without benefit of formal trial.
 In some cases, the incarcerated businessmen have been released
 without any trial after paying a sum, informally deemed .to be
 a suitable reparation, to the national investigation committee.
 In recent years, American citizens have been arrested and held
 without charge for lengthy periods without the U.S. Embassy
 being notified or provided access as stipulated in
 international and bilateral conventions. On two occasions in
 1990, naturalized American citizens of Ghanaian origin were
 held without charge for extended periods of time. One was
 eventually released without being charged. The other was
 still in detention at the end of the year.
 The number of political detainees/prisoners at the end of 1990
 was unknown but is estimated at around 200. The Government
 claims the actual number is smaller. The total number of
 persons detained during the year for short periods of a-few
 
 
 144
 GHANA
 days to a few weeks is unknown but is certainly much higher
 than 200. Among those now under detention are Major Courage
 Quashigah and five other suspected coup plotters arrested in
 October 1989. Occasional and unverifiable reports suggest
 they are not being mistreated, but the Government gives no
 indication that it is prepared to charge them or bring them to
 trial. In June the PNDC released 10 persons who had been
 detained for alleged involvement in "subversive activities
 against the State."  Although little information was
 available, at least one person had been imprisoned since 1983
 and another since 1985.
 In August the Chairman and other officials of the Movement for
 Freedom and Justice (MFJ), which advocates greater respect for
 human rights and democratization, were charged with conspiracy
 and publication of false statements stemming from an MFJ press
 statement charging that the BNI had detained them. The MFJ
 chairman later retracted MFJ's charge, publicly apologized to
 the BNI director, and announced that the MFJ leadership had
 simply been "invited to a discussion" at the BNI. This
 discussion coincided with the public release of MFJ's
 statement of political principles (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government does not practice forced exile. In recent
 years, it has quietly encouraged Ghanaians with valuable
 skills--including dissidents--who are living abroad to return
 home; in some case, the Government has offered amnesty. Some
 officials of former governments have returned and resumed
 careers outside politics, apparently without difficulties.
 Others have remained abroad, particularly in the United
 Kingdom and other parts of Western Europe, in order to conduct
 active opposition to the PNDC, out of fear of political
 persecution, or because they have established a more secure
 livelihood.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Three court systems exist in Ghana. In the "prerevolutionary"
 court system, traditional legal safeguards are based on
 British legal practices. Trials are public, and defendants
 have a right to be present, to be represented by an attorney,
 and to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. This
 system includes high courts, appeals courts, and the Supreme
 Court headed by a chief justice. There are limitations,
 however, to the independence of these courts, and in the past
 the PNDC summarily dismissed judges, thereby warning judges
 that they serve at the PNDC's sufferance.
 In 1989 the Government- reconstituted the Judicial Council but
 confined it to an advisory role for judicial appointments and
 disciplinary matters. The judiciary is still not independent.
 A separate public tribunal system at the national and regional
 levels was set up by the PNDC in 1982 to bypass the regular
 court system and speed up the judicial process by restricting
 procedural rights of defendants. The public tribunals depend
 largely on judges with little or no legal experience, and they
 shortcut legal safeguards and due process to provide "rough
 and ready" decisions, particularly in criminal cases. This
 system includes the Office of Revenue Commissioners, the
 National Investigations Committee (which, established by PNDC
 Law 2, has the power to investigate virtually any allegation
 referred to it by the PNDC), the Special Military Tribunal,
 and the Public Tribunals Board. Most sensitive political
 cases and those involving security issues and capital
 
 
 GHANA
 punishment are heard by public tribunals. PNDC Law 24
 empowers public tribunals to impose the death penalty for any
 crime specified a capital offense by the PNDC or if the
 tribunal determines that it is merited in a particular case,
 even if the crime is not punishable by the death penalty under
 regulir statutes. No appeals were permitted until 1985, when
 the National Appeals Tribunal was created. The Ghana Bar
 Association has elected not to practice before the public
 tribunals and currently has a court case pending-which hinges
 on its opposition to the tribunals.
 In October the greater Accra Bar Association called upon
 members to uphold the rule of law and help protect human
 rights. It called on the Government to allow criticism and
 dissent and requested repeal of the Habeas Corpus Act, the
 Preventive Custody Law, and the laws which require
 registration of newspapers and religious organizations.
 The Chieftancy Act of 1971 gives the village chiefs powers in
 local matters, including authority to enforce customary tribal
 laws, e.g.. dealing with divorce, child custody matters, and
 property disputes-.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Citizens engaged in activity deemed objectionable by the
 Government (which sometimes includes the peaceful expressioi
 of dissent) are subject to interference with regard to private
 conduct, including monitoring of telephones and mail. There
 is no recourse if a government agency is wiretapping or
 interfering with private correspondence. In past'years,
 forced entry into homes has been reported in connection with
 security investigations.
 In 1990 the PNDC began redefining the role of the local
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, which previously
 functioned as neighborhood watch committees and reported'
 individual political behavior to the Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are restricted. Chairman
 Rawlings frequently laments the "culture of silence" and urges
 people to speak out on local community concerns. However, few
 Ghanaians have openly criticized the PNDC or challenged its
 authority. Following the first public forum on "Ghana's
 Political Future" in July, two organizations--the Kwame
 Nkrumah Revolutionary Guards (which espouses the politics of
 Nkrumah's Convention Peoples' Party) and the Movement for
 Freedom and Justice--publicly criticized the PNDC's
 authoritarian rule and called for removal of the ban on
 political parties, release of all political prisoners, and
 convocation of a constituent assembly. In the course of the
 seminars, other organizations such as the Ghana Bar -
 Association, the Trade Union Congress, and the National Union
 of Ghanaian Students expressed similar criticisms.
 In July Chairman Rawlings spoke at the first of a series of
 public meetings to be held in each of Ghana's administrative
 regions on the "evolving democratic process" toward "a new
 constitutional order" in Ghana. The meetings focused on two
 issues: improvement of the current district assembly system
 
 
 146
 GHANA
 and the next steps for increasing public participation in the
 political process. Critics charged that the PNDC carefully
 controlled the meetings and that participants were reluctant
 to speak freely. After some initial hesitation, participants
 did in fact express their views. However, the PNDC continues
 to control the pace of political reform and has not revealed a
 timetable or specific goals for liberalizing the political
 system.
 The PNDC ban on political parties remains in effect. The
 newly created MFJ was denied a police permit for a public
 meeting in Kumasi, and its members have encountered some
 official harassment. Members of some organizations, including
 the MFJ, were not permitted to speak at the public meetings
 discussed above as representatives of their organizations.
 They were permitted to speak as individuals, representing only
 themselves.
 The Government owns the radio and television stations and the
 two principal daily newspapers. Reporting in government-owned
 media accentuates positive aspects of government policies but
 also covers selected instances of corruption and mismanagement
 in government'agencies and state-owned enterprises. In
 general, media criticism of government policies or of Chairman
 Rawlings and PNDC members, as well as of foreign and domestic
 policies, is not tolerated. Journalists are occasionally
 subject to discipline or dismissal by the Government for
 writing articles deemed unacceptable.
 The Government does not censor the press--official or
 private--on a daily basis, but makes clear the boundaries of
 acceptable commentary, and editors and writers engage in
 self-censorship. On occasion, the few remaining privately
 owned newspapers have published editorials and articles
 criticizing Ghana's foreign policy and the Economic Recovery
 Program (ERP). In February the Ghanian Times, a
 government-owned daily, reported that the Secretary of
 Information had instructed the paper to discontinue a series
 of articles on harassment of Chairman Rawlings and other PNDC
 officials by the previous government.
 A few foreign periodicals such as West Africa, Time, and
 Newsweek are sold freely in Accra and other major cities, and
 even issues containing articles critical of Ghana's Government
 are allowed to circulate. Most Western journalists are now
 routinely accorded visas and press credentials as opposed to
 the practices of a few years ago.
 Academic freedom is subject to many of the same prohibitions
 on political expression as the society in general, although
 the National Union of Ghanaian Students (NUGS), one of the
 more vocal critics of the PNDC, is tolerated and allowed to
 organize and hold meetings. In September NUGS publicly
 criticized the PNDC's public meetings on Ghana's political
 future. It called for a referendum at the conclusion of the
 national debate and for the establishment of multiethnic
 political parties and of an independent commission to
 guarantee freedom of the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is restricted. Persons
 generally are free to join together formally or informally to
 promote benevolent or nonpolitical causes, but permits are
 required for public meetings or demonstrations, and these are
 
 
 GHANA
 seldom granted for political purposes, particularly if the
 applicant's views are at odds with those of the Government.
 The MFJ, created in July, called on the Government to allow
 greater participation in the national debate. In August the
 MFJ issued a statement of principles which defended the
 concept of multiparty democracy and called for the
 establishment of a democratic government which respects basic
 human rights. The leadership of the MFJ was "invited" to the
 BNI on the day this statement was released (see Section l.d.).
 That same month, the MFJ was not permitted to hold a public
 outdoor rally in Kumasi. The MFJ had previously held an
 indoor rally, attended by about 600 people in Accra. At that
 meeting, the MFJ chairman emphasized that the MFJ did not wish
 to confront the PNDC. Political parties and political
 meetings are prohibited. The Government barred personswith
 close ties to the- old parties from running as candidates for
 election to the district assemblies in 1988-89.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although there is no state-favored religion, the PNDP- requires
 all religious organizations to register with the Government
 and has prohibited-public worship by the Jehovah Witnesses.
 Ghanaians are predominantly Christian, and Christians of all
 sects as well as Muslims are well represented at all levels of
 government. There are no apparent advantages or disadvantages
 attached to membership in any particular sect or religion.
 PNDC efforts to urge the major religious communities to
 support its economic and social pelicies- have created
 tensions. Chairman Rawlings publicly criticized the Roman
 Catholic Church for prohibiting its priests from participating
 in the district assemblies. The PNDC has also been sensitive
 to criticism of Ghanw's human rights record by leaders of
 various denominations. PNDC law 221 of June 1989 requires all
 religious organizations to register with the National
 Commission on Culture. The Commission is granted authority to
 deny registration and the right to worship publicly to any
 religious group whose actions, it concludes, would lead to
 social disruption or offend the morals of the people. The
 Government requires full information about the property and
 financial assets of the churches and makes the boards of
 governors personally lipble for contraventions.
 The Government states that it received some 11,000
 applications from various churches wishing to register.
 However, the Roman Catholic Church and the 14 mainline
 Protestant churches which belong to the Christian Council have
 refused to register on grounds that PNDC law 221 infringes on
 freedom of religion. By the end of 1990, the Government had
 made no effort to enforce PNDC law 221, and those religious
 bodies that refused to register continued to worship freely.
 Also in June 1989, the Government "froze" the assets of four
 churches, two indigenous Christian churches, plus the
 Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of
 Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) and expelled their foreign
 personnel. The indigenous churches had often been accused of
 promoting practices offensive to the general community; the
 Jehovah's Witness community have been accused of not showing
 proper respect for the symbols of Ghana's Government; and the
 Mormons were accused of practicing racism. On November 30,
 the Government rescinded the prohibition on the Mormons and
 announced that it is willing to review the Jehovah's Witness
 case. The two indigenous churches remain "frozen."
 
 
 GHANA
 Other foreign missionary groups have generally operated
 throughout the country with a minimum of formal restrictions,
 but in recent years some foreign missionaries have said that
 obtaining visas and residence permits is becoming more
 difficult.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Ghanaians and foreigners are free to move throughout Ghana
 without special permission. Police checkpoints exist
 countrywide for the prevention of smuggling. Roadblocks and
 car searches are a normal part of nighttime travel in Accra.
 The Government frequently impedes departure from the country
 for its perceived opponents.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States
 (ECOWAS), Ghanaians may travel without visas for up to 90 days
 in member states. Ghanaians are generally free to exercise
 this right, and nationals of other member states are free to
 travel to Ghana. Ghanaians are also free to emigrate or to be
 repatriated from other countries. If a person is considered a
 security threat, special permission to travel outside Ghana
 must be obtained.
 Ghanaian authorities denied the U.S. Embassy access to a
 detained naturalized American citizen in 1990 on the grounds
 that he had entered Ghana on a Ghanaian passport rather than
 on an U.S. passport. The authorities claimed that he had thus
 asserted his Ghanaian citizenship and could be treated as a
 Ghanaian and not as an American. Ghanaian law does not
 recognize dual citizenship.
 Since the last half of 1990, Ghana has been faced with a
 growing refugee population. Liberians fleeing civil war began
 to arrive in August; by November, Ghana was hosting some 8,000
 Liberian refugees. Most of the new refugee population, as
 well as many transiting third-country nationals who also fled
 Liberia, were housed in a camp set up by the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Government 20
 kilometers outside Accra. In addition, over 15,000 Ghanaians
 have returned to their home villages, often imposing great
 hardship on government social services.
 Prior to the influx of Liberians, Ghana was hosting
 approximately 150 refugees registered with the UNHCR.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is no procedure by which citizens can freely and
 peacefully change their laws, officials, or form of
 government. Chairman Rawlings and the PNDC exercise total
 executive, legislative, and administrative power. The PNDC
 controls the National Commission for Democracy (NCD)
 established in 1984 to design and propose "democratic"
 institutions for Ghana.
 In December 1988, and in January and February 1989, the PNDC
 held elections for the newly created district assemblies. The
 assemblies have limited authority, primarily directed toward
 local development activities.
 
 
 149
 GHANA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known locally organized human rights groups
 currently dealing with human rights matters. Several
 organizations--most notably the Ghana Bar Association--have
 attempted to address human rights issues from time to time.
 The Government's reactions to these efforts have ranged from
 indifference to active discouragement.
 The Government is sensitive to charges of abuse of human
 rights and stoutly defends its practices, although it takes
 few constructive actions in response to criticism. The PNDC
 is particularly critical of charges from human rights groups
 that it lacks a democratic structure.
 The Ghanaian Government permits prison visits by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion-
 Language, or Social Status
 Although ethnic differences are intentionally downplayed by
 the Government, charges are occasionally aired that the PNDC
 and the political leadership are dominated by the Ewe ethnic
 group from eastern Ghana. Chairman Rawlings and a number of
 his close advisers-are Ewe, but many PNDC secretaries are from
 other ethnic groups.
 The Government has made concerted- effort to raise the status
 of women, but Ghanaian women remain subject to some forms of
 societal discrimination. In 1985 the PNDC promulgated four
 laws which overturned many of the customary, traditional, and
 colonial laws which discriminated against women. These
 concerned family accountability, intestate succession,
 customary divorce registrations, and the administration of
 estates. Women in urban centeis and those who have entered-
 the modern sector encounter little overt bias, but resistance
 to women in nontraditional roles persists. Women in the rural
 agricultural sector remain subject to traditional male
 dominance.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but,
 as there are no statistics or studies available, the extent of
 the problem is unknown. Police do not normally intervene in
 domestic disputes, and such cases seldom come before the
 courts. The Government has not addressed the issue of
 violence against women, but it discourages the practice of
 female circumcision, although it has not made it illegal.
 Female mutilation (e.g., clitoridectomy) is practiced in the
 far northeast and northwest parts of the country.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 While the Trade Unions' Ordinance confers broad powers on the
 Government to refuse to register a trade union, the PNDC has
 not interfered with the right of workers to associate in labor
 unions. Civil servants, however, are prohibited by law from
 joining or organizing a trade union. Trade unions in Ghana
 and their activities are still governed by the Industrial
 Relations Act (IRA). The independent Trades Union Congress
 (TUC), established in 1958, represents organized labor in
 
 
 150
 GHANA
 Ghana. It has been the sole central organization Since its
 creation before Ghanaian independence when it became closely
 linked to Nkrumah's Convention People's Party, but it has been
 reorganized on a number of occasions including by a radical
 pro-Rawlings faction following the military coup of 1981. In
 1984, the leftist, progovernment slate was defeated in a free
 election by experienced union leaders who, aided by a revised
 union constitution and bylaws, have sought to define an
 autonomous role for the TUC within the PNDC regime.
 The right to strike is recognized in law, although the
 Government has on occasion taken strong action to end strikes,
 especially those which threaten interests it perceives as
 vital. Under the IRA, the Government has established a system
 under which it seeks first to conciliate, then arbitrate,
 disputes. Again in 1990 there was no known progress in
 implementing the Government's declared intention to replace
 this system with labor tribunals to arbitrate industrial
 disputes certified as deadlocked.
 For several years the Committee Of Experts (COE) of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) has criticized various
 aspects of Ghanaian legislation pertaining to freedom of
 association which make the right of workers to form unions of
 their own choosing and to seek recognition as bargaining
 agents subject to government-formulated criteria. The COE,
 again in 1989, expressed the hope that measures would be taken
 to bring Ghana's laws into conformity with ILO Convention 87
 which Ghana ratified in 1967.
 The TUC is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity (OATUU). Consistent with OATUU guidelines, the
 TUC maintains no other international affiliations, although it
 has friendly relations with other international labor
 organizations, including the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions and the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions.,
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The IRA provides a framework for collective bargaining and
 some protections against antiunion discrimination as well.
 Ghana's trade unions engage in collective bargaining for wages
 and benefits with both private and state-owned enterprises,
 though in the latter category the threat of detention (a
 common practice in the early 1980's) hangs over union leaders
 to force agreement on issues. No union leaders were detained
 during 1990 for union, or other, activities. There are no
 functioning export processing zones in Ghana, and labor
 legislation appears uniformly applied throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Ghanaian law prohibits forced labor, and it is not known to be
 practiced. For a number of years, however, and again in 1990,
 the COE has urged the Government to revise various legal
 provisions which permit imprisonment with an obligation to
 perform labor for offenses which are not countenanced under
 ILO Convention 105, ratified by Ghana in 1958.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor legislation in Ghana sets a minimum employment age of 15
 and prohibits night work and certain types of hazardous labor
 for those under 18. In practice, child labor is prevalent,
 
 
 151
 GHANA
 and young children of school age can often be found during the
 day performing menial tasks in the market or collecting fares
 on local buses. Observance of minimum age. laws is eroded by
 local custom and economic circumstances which encourage
 children to work to help their families. Violators of
 regulations prohibiting heavy labor and night work for
 children are occasionally punished. In two or three instances
 in 1990, the Government arrested and prosecuted persons on
 charges of transporting underage youths from one part of the
 country to another as laborers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum standards for wages and working conditions are
 established through a tripartite committee composed of
 representatives of government, labor, and employees. It
 establishes- a minimum wage rate, and other salaries- are
 adjusted accordingly. Effective January 199a, the national
 minimum wage was increased 28 percent to $0.70 pen working day
 at current exchange rates. The current "living
 wage"--consisting of the national minimum wage and customary
 benefits such as transportation and food allowance--is about
 $1.00 per working day, the TUC estimates the daily living
 costs of a family of four at $5.00. Thus the existing
 minimum wage is insufficient for a single wage earner to
 support a family. In most cases households are supported by
 multiple wage earners, some family farming, and other family
 based commercial activities.
 The basic workweek in Ghana is 40 hours. Occupational safety
 and health regulations are in-effect, and- sanctions are
 occasionally applied through the Labor Department of the
 Ministry of Social Welfare. However, Ministry officials are
 few in number and poorly trained. They will take action if
 matters are called to their attention, but lack the resources
 to seek out violations.
