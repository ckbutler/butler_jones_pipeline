 DOMINICAN REPUbLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional oemocracy
 with an elected Presiaent, an electea bicameral
 iegisiature ana a 3uaicial branch led by a Supreme
 Court appointed by the Senate. The current President
 is Antonio Guzman Fernandez, inaugurated August 16, 1978,
 atter winning the May 16 election on the ticket of the
 Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD). He defeated
 the canaidate of the Retormista Party (PR), then
 President Joaquin balaguer, who had unsuccessfully
 sought a fourth tour-year term of office.
 bince uinning its independence from Haiti in 1844
 the Dominican Republic has had a history marked
 by trequent civil strife and violence, including
 civil war and foreign interventions. Thus the
 1578 peacetul transter of power was a ma3or landmark
 in the uevelopment of aemocratic traaitions. The new
 Aaministration has made a strong commitment to progress
 in human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Incluoing
 Freeoom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not officially conaoned nor has it been
 systematically employed against prisoners in the recent
 past. There have been no reports of torture since
 the Guzman Government took office.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or begraoing Treatment or
 Punishment
 Conaitions in the country's prisons are poor, ana some
 mistreatment of prisoners has occurred. Access by prisoners
 ano their families to a tree press has served, to a
 large uegree, as a check against cruel, inhuman or
 (234)

 oegrading treatment. The new Government's expressed
 interest in prison reform and the release of "political
 prisoners  has given heavy publicity to credible allegations
 ot abuse. The Government has announced a program to reform
 the nation's prisons. The Government has placed a high
 priority on improving prison conditions, especially at the
 Victoria Penitentiary, and treatment of prisoners has
 improved.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Although reduced from the scale of the late 1960s and
 early 1970s, isolated instances of arbitrary arrest
 occuried in the last months of the previous Government.
 bsually these cases involved the aetention of individuals
 suspected of crimes or 'subversive activities" against the
 security of the state. Frequently the period of detention
 was snort; but often no charges were filed.
 The Guzman Administration has publicly assigned a high
 priority to improving Dominican justice and increasing
 protection of human rights. Amnesty legislation was
 quickly passed in August 1978. This legislation,
 although approvea unanimously by both houses of Congress,
 was criticisea by some Dominicans as too broad because
 it providea for the release of practically any criminal
 claiming to have acted with political motivation. President
 Guzman proposed to amend the law to provide for a commission
 that would screen candidates for release in order to
 insure the common criminals claiming to be :'prisoners of
 conscience" would not be freed. Congress rejected the
 amendment, however, and to date the law has resulted
 in the release of over two hundred prisoners, including
 apparently all political prisoners, and the return of
 over one hundred political exiles.
 The amnesty legislation concurrently annulled the 1963
 iaws against "Cormunist'" and "subversive' activity.
 Thus arbitrary arrests are now likely to decline
 
 
 236
 substantially. One of the themes most heavily stressed
 in the Guzinan Aoministration's efforts to professionalize
 ana institutionalize the armea forces is the need to
 exercise restraint in the treatment of civilians.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Laws calling for fair public trials continue to be
 respected. There were some exceptions under the
 previous regime in cases of persons suspected of
 or chargea with politically-motivated crimes.
 In such instances cases dragged on for years. In
 Noveiuber Presioent Guzman signed legislation passed
 oy the Congress to strengthen the right of habeas
 corpus ana lacilitate recourse to more rapid 3ustice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Legal safeguaras against invasion of the home continue
 to be generally observea, but there are occasional
 violations, usually when individuals are believed
 to be armed or oangerous.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 or Such Vital Neeas as Food, Shelter, health Care
 and aucation
 Economic and social development programs designed to
 assist the urban and rural poor are well established.
 However, for several months prior to the May elections,
 the former Government's attention to aevelopment
 programs aropped off noticeably. The diversion of
 resouices cannot be accurately quantified but was
 substantial. The new Aaministration has yet
 to Gevelop an operational aefinition of the poor. The
 lack of Limely ano sufficiently aetailed income data,
 currently being assemblea, undoubtedly will make this
 etort aitticult.
 
 
 237
 However, even the sparse data now on hand suggest
 that the extraorainarily rapid growth of the economy
 between 1968 ana 1974 aia not ameliorate a badly
 skewed aistribution of income. There was a slight upward
 trena between 1973 and 1976 in government expenaitures
 for agriculture, health, education and public housing--
 areas where the impact upon the poor is likely to be
 relatively high. Nonetheless, the balaguer Government.'s
 commitment to the improvement of basic human needs had
 been somewhat equivocal.
 President Guzman has promised to end the highly
 centralized system of public administration he inherited
 ana to aevise means of aistributing the national income more
 equitably. As a check on corruption, traditional in high
 government and military ranks, all senior officials
 are required to aeclare their net worth as a condition
 lor taking office. The country has minimum wage standards,
 though they are low. The new Administration's comprehensive
 economic program has not yet been announced, but
 is expected to shift resources from urban construction
 to rural aevelopment, and to emphasize low income housing.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 All these liberties are in large measure respected,
 as was evident during the recent political campaign.
 Dominican newspapers engage heavily in political
 comitentary, and are rated by the Inter-American
 Press Association as among the freest in the Hemisphere.
 Vjhile outdoor public meetings require official Government
 permits, inaoor gatherings of political parties, labor
 unions and other associations are unrestricted. Trade
 union organizing activity and freedom to operate,
 traoitionally inhibited by a labor code dating from
 
 
 238
 the Gays of the Tru3illo dictatorship, have gradually
 expandea in recent years. Labor unions are allowed
 to organize and bargain for employees, but the outdated
 labor code has generally favored management. The new
 Government has proved to be more even handed in labor-
 managemftent relations and has promised to update the
 laoor code.
 Although traaitonally they have not shared equal social
 ano economic status, women hold positions up to the sub-
 cabinet level in the present Administration and are found
 throughout the Government. Several were elected to Con-
 gress in 1978, including two to the Senate.
 Discrimination is not officially authorized or condoned.
 There are no restrictions on religious practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is no restriction on freedom to travel within the
 country. Except for a requirement for prior approval to
 travel to Communist countries, foreign travel is also
 freely permittea. A substantial number of political exiles
 who were deported by the former Government have returned
 to the country ana other exiles will benefit under the new
 ainesty law. Legislation to lift the restrictions to
 travel to Communist countries has been approved by the
 Senate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Legal procedures governed national elections in 1965,
 197U, 1974, ama 1978. The governing party was challenged
 by a significant opposition in the 1966 election, which was
 won by President balaguer, and in the 1978 election. In
 the campaigns of 1970 and 1974 the then main opposi-
 tion party, the PRD, charged intervention and harassment
 by the military in favor of the reelection of Balaguer
 ana witharew from the contests prior to election day.
 
 
 In 1978, the political campaign preceding the election
 proceeded freely and openly. Early on May 17, when
 it became clear that the incumbent PR was losing
 on the national level, the vote-counting was interrupted
 by elements of the Dominican armed forces. Tnere
 ensued several days of political uncertainty and
 tension throughout the country, as national opinion
 formed and domestic and international pressures
 were brought to bear. In various localities electoral
 officials were detained briefly and dozens of members
 and supporters of the PRD were arrested or otherwise
 harassea by security authorities. Several governments,
 including the United States Government, stressed
 to President Balaguer the importance of the integrity
 of the electoral process. President Balaguer announced
 he would abide by the final decision of the Central
 Electoral Board, which certifies election results.
 The Board declared Guzman the winner on July 7.
 At the same time the Board, without reference to
 the electoral law, awarded four seats to Mr. Balaguer's
 PR, thus giving the latter control of the Dominican
 Senate and distorting what was otherwise considered
 on balance a fair election outcome.
 In all a dozen parties, including the small Communist
 Party, participated in the 1978 election, as did
 several "single-issue' political movements. Despite
 the legalization of the Communist Party in 1977,
 the old sanctions against "subversive" and "Communist"
 activities remained. Those proscriptions are now
 annulled.
 The new Government is also taking steps to remove the
 military from politics and to institutionalize and
 professionalize the arled forces and police which his-
 torically have played a decisive role in the political
 
 
 system oi the country. Inefficiency, inequity and
 rampant corruption in Government were central campaign
 issues which helped hr. Guzman to win the Presidency.
 4. Government Attituoe and Record Regarding Inter-
 national ano Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The 1977 Amnesty International Report, critical of
 human rights practices in the Dominican Republic,
 promptea an exchange of correspondence with then
 representatives of Amnesty International in the
 Dominican Republic. After agreeing in April 1977
 to a visit by Amnesty International, President
 balaguer then suggested that the visit be conducted
 by a third-party observer. No visit took place.
 Although apparently all political prisoners have
 been released, Amnesty concern over conditions in
 the riation's penitentiaries continues.
 The Dominican Republic has generally supported
 human rights initiatives in international fora.
 The Government cosponsored the resolution on
 human rights at the June, 1977 General Assembly
 of the Organization of American States and has
 ratified the American Convention on Human Rights.
