 BELIZE
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy organized under a
 Constitution enacted in 1981 upon independence from the United
 Kingdom. It is governed by a Prime Minister, a Cabinet of
 Ministers, and a Legislative Assembly. A Governor General
 represents Queen Elizabeth II in the largely ceremonial role of
 Head of State. Both local and national elections are scheduled
 on a regular, constitutionally prescribed basis, and the two
 national political parties-the People's United Party (PUP) and
 the United Democratic Party (UDP)-field competing slates of
 candidates. The Government changed hands, for the second time
 since independence, when the PUP won a majority of
 parliamentary seats on September 4, 1989.
 The 750-member Belize National Police (BNP) is responsible for
 law enforcement and maintenance of order. It is responsible to
 and controlled by civilian authorities.
 Belize is a developing nation with an economy dependent
 primarily on agriculture. The Government favors free
 enterprise and actively encourages increased investment, both
 foreign and domestic. In 1990 the gross domestic product grew
 by 9 percent, and the per capita gross domestic product was
 $1,637.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual, including women and all ethnic
 groups, are upheld by the judiciary. An active press
 buttresses the people's civil and political rights. However,
 during the year there continued to be credible reports of
 mistreatment of workers by employers, especially in cases
 involving undocumented aliens in agricultural areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are expressly forbidden by the Constitution, and
 this prohibition is generally respected in practice.
 In December 1990 the Government announced the formation of a
 Commission of Inquiry to investigate charges that the police
 had tortured a Guatemalan, Luis Arevalo, before deporting him
 in late October. The Commission concluded public and private
 hearings on the case in May 1991. By year's end, the
 Commission's findings had not yet been submitted to the Prime
 Minister.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention, and
 these provisions are respected in practice. A detainee must be
 informed of the cause of detention within 48 hours of arrest
 and must be brought before a Court within 72 hours. In
 practice, detainees are normally informed immediately of the
 charges against them. Bail is granted in all but the most
 serious cases. However, many detainees cannot make bail, and
 backlogs in the judicial system often result in considerable
 delays and postponements of hearings, resulting in overcrowded
 prisons and prolonged incarceration without trial. Exile is
 forbidden by the Constitution and does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of civil or criminal offenses have.
 constitutional rights to presumption of innocence, protection
 against self-incrimination, defense by counsel, public trial,
 and appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory-in criminal cases.
 Those convicted by either a-magistrate's court.or the Supreme
 Court of Belize may appeal to the Court of Appeal In some
 cases, including those resulting in a capital sentence, the
 convicted party may make a final appeal to the Queen's Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom.
 These constitutional guarantees are respected in practice,
 although the judiciary's independence from the executive branch
 has been questioned by observers who note that judges must
 negotiate their contracts with the Government.. The Supreme
 Court and magistrate courts suffer backlogs aggravated by the
 inability to maintain a full complement of judges.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional provisions for the protection of personal
 property, privacy of home and person, and recognition of human
 dignity are generally- h6nored by the Government..
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are protected under the
 Constitution and by local custom. In practice, all viewpoints
 are publicly presented without government interference. Five
 privately owned weekly newspapers, two of them fiercely-
 partisan, engage in lively debate of the issues. The
 opposition press is a frequent critic of government officials
 and poli6ies. All newspapers are subject to the constraints of
 libel laws.
 With the introduction in 1990 of Radio KREM, Belize's first
 privately owned commercial radio station, the government
 monopoly of radio ended. The Belize Broadcasting Network was
 removed from direct government control, restructured as an
 autonomous corporation, and renamed the Broadcasting
 Corporation of Belize (BCB) in September 1990. According to
 informed observers, indirect government influence over the BCB
 continues, however, and sometimes affects editorial decisions
 regarding news and feature reporting.
 
 
 502
 BELIZE
 Fourteen privately owned television broadcasting stations,
 including several cable networks, operate throughout Belize
 under the authority and regulation of the Belize Broadcasting
 Authority (BBA). The BBA asserts its right to authorize
 certain broadcasts, such as those with political content, and
 to edit any defamatory or personally libelous material from the
 political broadcasts of both parties before these are aired.
 As far as is known, the BBA did not exercise this authority
 during 1991.
 Academic freedom is provided for by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is constitutionally assured and honored in
 practice. Political parties and other groups with political
 objectives freely hold rallies and mass meetings. The
 organizers of public meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in
 advance of the meetings; such permits are not denied for
 political reasons. Under the Constitution Belizeans are free
 to form and join associations of their choice, both political
 and nonpolitical.
 a. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Belize. All groups may worship
 as they choose, and all groups and churches may establish
 places of worship, train clergy, and maintain contact with
 coreligionists abroad. There is an active missionary
 presence. In church publications and from the pulpit, church
 leaders comment on government and political policies as these
 affect the social welfare of the country. A broad-based
 partnership of the Government and several different churches
 active in education successfully operates and administers most
 of Belize's primary and secondary schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country. Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are
 unrestricted.
 As many as 40,000 Central Americans from neighboring countries
 have taken up residence in Belize since 1980, many of them
 entering illegally and living in Belize without documentation.
 The Government of Belize has been generous in conferring
 refugee status on many of the new arrivals and providing them
 with assistance. However, the sheer number of refugees and
 other immigrants has strained government social services, while
 the highly visible presence of recent immigrants in the labor
 force and the marketplace has provoked widespread resentment
 among native-born Belizeans.
 The Government is taking steps to address these problems.
 Working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), Belize has undertaken a variety of projects aimed at
 defusing resentment of the refugees. In 1991 the Government
 enacted legislation implementing the provisions of the United
 Nations Convention on Refugees, which Belize ratified in 1990.
 The new refugee law clarifies the distinction between refugees
 and illegal immigrants and establishes an Office on Refugee
 Affairs within the Foreign Ministry.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Belize is a functioning democracy governed by a Legislative
 Assembly, with executive direction coming from a Cabinet of
 Ministers headed by Prime Minister George Price. By
 constitutional mandate, the Governor General instructs the
 leader of the majority party of the Legislative Assembly to
 form a Government following national elections, which must be
 held at least once every 5 years. Municipal and town board
 officials are elected in local contests at 3-year intervals.
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal
 for Belizean citizens 18 years and older. The UDP and PUP
 dominate Belizean political life, and each party's membership
 includes all segments of Belize's diverse. e thnic groupings.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights-groups operate freely, and
 the Government cooperates with independent investigations of
 human rights conditions in Belize.
 The Human Rights Commission of Belize (HRCB), a nongovernmental
 organization that opened offices in late 1987, cooperates with
 Amnesty International and is affiliated with regional human
 rights organizations. The HRCB was active in 1991 on a range
 of issues, Ancluding refugee and agricultural workers' rights.
 cases of alleged police abuse and cases of alleged illegal
 deportations of Central American nationals.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Belize is a multiracial, multiethnic country, and the
 Government actively promotes tolerance and cross-cultural
 understanding. Discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds
 is illegal and is not common, although ethnic tension,
 particularly resentment of Central American immigrants, is
 increasingly apparent.
 Despite constitutional provisions of equality, Belizean women
 face some social and economic prejudices. For example, women
 can find it more difficult than men to obtain business and
 agricultural financing and other resources. Most employed
 women are concentrated in female-dominated occupations with
 traditionally low status and wages. The Government worked to
 ameliorate this problem by funding a Women's Bureau, charged
 with developing programs to improve the status of women in
 Belize. Founded in 1981, the Women's Bureau was upgraded in
 1986 to a department within the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Services. A number of officially registered women's groups
 work closely with various government ministries in promoting
 social awareness programs. Women have access to education and
 are active in all spheres of national life. Both the Governor
 General and the President of the Senate are women, and women
 hold other important positions in both the public and private
 sectors. Women generally receive the same wage as men for
 similar work and are not impeded from owning or managing land
 or other real property.
 Domestic violence against women is a chronic problem. In 1985
 a group of Belize City residents began the Belize Women Against
 
 
 504
 BELIZE
 Violence Movement (WAY) which now has branches elsewhere in the
 country. The group runs a shelter for battered wives and a
 hotline for rape victims and has obtained cooperation from the
 Ministries of Home Affairs and Education. The Government's
 commitment to increasing the safety of women is affirmed in its
 Policy Statement on Women, the effective policy guidance for
 the work of the Women's Bureau.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By statute and in practice Belizean workers are free to
 establish and join labor organizations. Thirteen independent
 unions, with an estimated 10.3 percent of the labor force,
 represent a cross-section of white-collar, blue-collar, and
 professional workers, including most civil service employees.
 The unions are recognized by the Ministry of Labor after they
 file with the Office of Registry. Members are empowered to
 draft the bylaws and constitutions of their unions, and they
 are free to elect officers from among the membership at large.
 Unions which choose not to hold elections can act as
 representatives for their membership, but only unions which
 hold free and annual elections of officers are permitted to
 join the National Trade Union Congress of Belize (NTUC). By
 both law and precedent, unions are effectively protected
 against dissolution or suspension by administrative authority.
 Although no unions are officially affiliated with political
 parties, several are clearly allied with one or the other of
 the two main parties. Unions freely exercise the right to form
 federations and confederations and affiliate with international
 organizations. Unions are legally permitted to strike, but
 unions representing essential services may strike only after
 giving 21 days' notice to the Ministry concerned. Workers at
 the Civic Textile plant in Belmopan struck in April to protest
 the company's dismissal of 16 coworkers, including 6 members of
 the newly formed Women Worker's Union (WWU). A board of
 inquiry commissioned by the Labor Minister found that the
 workers' rights had been violated and ordered the dismissed
 workers reinstated. The Government subsequently revoked Civic
 Textile's development concession (which had exempted the
 company from paying normal import duties). Shortly thereafter
 -the company closed down, and all its employees lost their
 jobs. The board of inquiry further criticized the Labor
 Ministry for failing to enforce labor laws and regulations and
 for failing to advise employers about fair labor practices.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is protected in law and freely practiced
 throughout the country. Wages are set in free negotiations
 between employers and unions or, more commonly, simply offered
 by employers. In practice, the Labor Commissioner acts as a
 conciliator in deadlocked collective bargaining negotiations
 between labor and management, offering nonbinding counsel to
 both sides. Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been
 voluntarily accepted. However, should either union or
 management choose not to accept the conciliator's decision,
 both are entitled to a legal hearing of the case, provided that
 it is linked to some valid provision of civil or criminal law.
 The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination both before
 and after the union is registered. Theoretically, unions may
 freely organize. In practice, however, employers are not
 legally required to recognize a union as a bargaining agent,
 
 
 505
 BELIZE
 and some employers have been known to block union organization
 by terminating the employment of key union sympathizers,
 usually on grounds purportedly unrelated to union activities.
 Effective redress is extremely difficult in such situations.
 Technically, a worker may file a complaint with the Labor
 Department, but it has been virtually impossible to prove that
 a termination was due to union activity.
 Belize's sole export processing zone is not exempt from the
 Labor Code. However, there are no unions in the export
 processing zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is forbidden by the Constitution and does not
 occur.
 d. Minimum.Age for Employment of. Children_
 The minimum age of employment in Belize is 14 years, or 17
 years for employment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors of
 the Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation,
 although in recent years school truancy officers, who have
 historically borne the brunt of the enforcement burden, have
 been less active.
 .e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No single minimum wage covers all workers, but some categories
 of service employment, such as retail, restaurant, domestic,
 and health care jobs, do have legal minimum-hourly wage
 standards. However, current legal minimum wage rates are
 outdated, and real wages generally exceed the statutory rates.
 Real wage rates provide a relatively decent standard of living
 for a worker and his family. A minimum wage.council appointed
 in May by the Minister of Labor proposed an increase in the
 minimum wage for all manual workers. By year's end, the-
 proposal had not yet been approved.
 No worker is obliged to work more than-6- days or 45 hours per
 week. Payment of overtime work is obligatory, as is an annual
 paid vacation of 2 weeks. A patchwork of health and safety
 regulations covers numerous industries, and these are enforced
 to varying degrees by the Ministries of Labor and Public
 Health. Enforcement is not universal countrywide, and in 1991
 the limited inspection and investigative resources were
 committed principally to urban and more accessible rural areas
 where labor, health, and safety complaints had been registered.
 There continued to be reports of employers who routinely fail
 to pay workers. Undocumented foreign workers-; especially in
 the banana industry, are particularly vulnerable to this
 practice. The working conditions of undocumented Central
 American banana workers in Stann Creek District are a cause of
 major concern to labor and human rights officials. Workers
 have complained to the Human Rights Commission of Belize about
 impure drinking water, lack of electricity, inadequate
 schooling, and poor medical care, in addition to nonpayment of
 wages.
