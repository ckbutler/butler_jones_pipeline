 GRENADA
 The island state of Grenada won its independence from
 Great Britain in 1974 and its government took the form
 of a parliamentary system based on the British model.
 The first Prime Minister, Eric Gairy, was a former labor
 leader who was accused by his opponents of personal cor-
 ruption, rigging the 1976 elections, and physically in-
 timidating the political opposition through the use of
 violence by a force of police "auxiliaries" personally
 loyal to him.
 In March 1979 the leaders of a former opposition party,
 the New Jewel Movement (NJM), staged a nearly bloodless
 coup d'etat. The new Government was greeted with wide-
 spread acceptance despite criticism of the extra consti-
 tutional nature of the coup itself.
 In its first several months the new People's Revolutionary
 Government (PRG) suspended the 1974 Constitution and
 detained a number of former government officials, police-
 men, opposition political leaders and private citizens.
 The Government also formed a People's Revolutionary Army
 and closed the sole privately-owned newspaper.
 The Government has promised elections, but has not set
 a date. The Government has declared that a new Constitu-
 tion is now in preparation, and will be placed before
 the voters for approval by a national referendum. Mean-
 while, Government policy seeks to involve people directly
 in local decisions by facilitating the formation of village-
 level committees devoted to such tasks as public works.
 The level of official corruption appears to have been
 sharply reduced, and the Government has taken steps to
 meet basic human needs within the parameters of a poor
 economy. The Government has, for example, reduced fees
 for secondary schools and instituted a school milk program.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The 1974 Constitution which guaranteed protection from
 inhuman treatment expressly prohibited torture. While
 there were credible reports of incidents of torture under
 the former government, there has been no evidence that
 the current government either condones or employs torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 
 
 323
 A Royal Commission of Inquiry set up in 1973 to examine
 the "breakdown of law and order and police brutality
 in Grenada" produced findings critical of Gairy, then
 Premier and later Prime Minister.
 The prison system in Grenada provides adequate health,
 dietary, and sanitary conditions. Visits by family members
 are usually allowed. However, visits by family members
 with political detainees were generally not allowed during
 1979. Members of the press and a committee of the Carib-
 bean Conference of Churches visited the prison once shortly
 after the March revolution to observe conditions.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Incidents of arbitrary arrest are believed to have occurred
 under the former government. The periods of arrest were
 brief and the aim was probably political harassment;
 legal remedies were available through appeal to an indepen-
 dent judiciary. At present, the constitution is suspended
 and the new People's Law provides for a preventive deten-
 tion tribunal; detention without trial has thus become
 institutionalized. The People's Law provides that persons
 whose actions are likely to endanger "public safety or
 public order or to subvert or otherwise sabotage the
 People's Revolutionary Government" are subject to detention
 without formal charge. The present government has conducted
 roundups of persons suspected of counter-revolutionary
 activity. Very few of those persons detained under the
 People's Law dealing with National Security have had
 charges brought against them. Between March and December,
 1979 there was an average of about seventy persons being
 held under the preventive detention tribunal system.
 (Grenada's population is about 100,000.) Most of those
 detained were members of or associated with the former
 government. The present government justifies the detention
 of most persons confined under the new law by claiming
 that they are potential allies of the former Prime Minister,
 whom they believe capable of organizing and executing
 a counter coup. Critics of the PRG allege that government
 claims of a counter coup are designed to justify arrests
 of opposition political leaders.
 The law allows for review of the detainee's case by a
 three-member tribunal at two-month intervals. The trib-
 unal's recommendations are secret and submitted only
 to the Minister of National Security (at present the
 Prime Minister) for final review.
 Detainees are not allowed legal counsel during proceedings
 before the tribunal, and hearings may be conducted in
 the detainee's absence. Detention is legally defined
 as "legal custody" and no detention under the People's
 Law may be called into question in any court, effectively
 denying the right of habeas corpus.
 
 
 324
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The newly-established preventive detention tribunal to
 deal with national security offenses has the effect of
 delaying indefinitely a citizen's access to fair public
 trial. The traditional legal system, based on British
 common law, continues to operate for non-security related
 offenses. Normal legal remedies are available in such
 cases, and the judiciary is fair and independent. A
 Grenadian Supreme Court was created to replace the West
 Indies Associated States Court of Appeals as Grenada's
 highest court of appeal.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The 1974 Constitution prohibited arbitrary search. There
 were, nevertheless, alleged incidents of search without
 warrant under the former government. The present govern-
 ment gives powers of arrest and search to members of
 its newly established People's Revolutionary Army, as
 well as to the regular police. Searches done under the
 umbrella of "National Security" require no warrant and
 have probably been used to harass and stifle political
 opposition. Warrantless searches are usually conducted
 in conjunction with arrests of presumed political opponents
 of the Government.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The economy of Grenada has traditionally been sustained
 by agriculture. Cacao, bananas, and nutmeg are the main
 cash crops. The present government has designed its
 economic strategy around the development of agro-indus-
 tries, a fisheries industry, and tourism. While control
 over certain imported commodities has increased, the
 private industrial, commercial and banking sectors have
 been left mostly undisturbed. The single significant
 exception is the recent takeover by the Government of
 a bottling plant after a management-worker dispute lasting
 nearly 40 days. It is estimated that 32-40 percent of
 the labor force of 35,000 are without jobs.
 The housing situation in Grenada appears to have deterio-
 rated steadily during the 1970's. The new government
 has given priority to the construction of new low-cost
 housing and has sought the assistance of both traditional
 and non-traditional donors.
 The general educational level is high. The literacy
 rate is over 85%, which is the percentage of the population
 completing three or more years of schooling. Elementary
 
 
 325
 education is free. Secondary education is subsidized
 by the Government, but is not completely free. Classroom
 space appears adequate and the Government has included
 the improvement of existing educational facilities among
 its priorities.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 These freedoms were guaranteed in the 1974 Constitution.
 while religious freedom has been well respected in prac-
 tice, there had been violations of the others from time
 to time under the former government; in recent months
 there have been indications that freedom of speech, press,
 and assembly are threatened. The privately owned newspaper
 Torchlight was closed by government decree, after a series
 of government attacks describing it as a "vehicle of
 destabilization" and a threat to national security.
 The Deputy Prime Minister said the newspaper will be
 reopened under a new form of management structure after
 having been "democratized." The remaining news media
 in Grenada have traditionally been under government owner-
 ship.
 Prominent opposition political leaders have not been
 allowed freedom to criticize the Government publicly
 or to rally public support. One leader twice attempted
 to hold political rallies; hecklers disrupted both meet-
 ings. The Deputy Prime Minister expressed the opinion
 that as long as no violence is used, people have a "demo-
 cratic right" to make it clear they do not want to listen.
 With a single minor exception, there have been no anti-
 government demonstrations in the seven months since the
 revolution.
 Another prominent opposition politician was detained
 by the People's Revolutionary Army shortly after his
 return to Grenada. The Government has said he will be
 charged with conspiracy to overthrow the Government and
 to assassinate the regime's leadership. The Government
 discourages public or private criticism on the grounds
 it is "counter-revolutionary".
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is no restriction on freedom to travel within the
 country, except for entry to zones restricted on national
 security grounds. Apart from the long-standing requirement
 to give evidence that national taxes are paid before
 departing the country, foreign travel and emigration
 are also freely permitted.
 
 
 326
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The 1974 Constitution has been suspended. The Government
 has pledged a return to constitutional rule at an early
 opportunity and has indicated that a new constitution
 will be produced only after the people have been consulted,
 probably through a referendum rather than a constituent
 assembly. An enumeration of voters, promised within
 a few weeks of the coup, still has not begun. Men and
 women 18 and over have the right to vote. While acknow-
 ledging that the revolutionary government is "committed
 to elections," the Prime Minister has said that "elections
 are not the key question" and has not set a date for
 them.
 Men and women have equal legal and political rights.
 In practice women hold a number of positions at high
 government levels, although they remain underrepresented
 in both the public and private sectors. There is no
 racial discrimination. The labor movement in Grenada
 has been an active factor in the political scene since
 former Prime Minister Gairy used it as his political
 base. Unions were in the forefront of the opposition
 to Gairy before his downfall. However, some unions now
 appear to be facing pressures from the People's Revolu-
 tionary Government. There are reports that in November
 1979, PRG officials attempted to stop a meeting of a
 democratic trade union organization, and made several
 public statements condemning certain labor officials
 for "destabilization". Despite these pressures, unions
 still have certain legal protections under the new govern-
 ment and are still able to organize.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights:
 Soon after the March, 1979 revolution, a delegation from
 the Caribbean Conference of Churches visited the main
 prison in Grenada at the Government's invitation. There
 was no report by the group of any human rights abuses.
 There have been no subsequent visits by similar groups,
 although a press report has suggested the Caribbean Human
 Rights Committee may ask to examine the continued deten-
 tion, without charge or trial, of persons in Grenada.
 Grenada ratified the American Convention on Human Rights
 under the previous government.
 
 
 327
 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala's history has been plagued by political violence,
 and during 1979 a high incidence of political and personal
 violence continued to seriously affect the exercise of
 many liberties.
 Kidnappings and assassinations by both the extreme right
 and left continued at about the same level as during 1978.
 Victims included government personnel, pro-government and
 opposition politicians, students, labor leaders and business-
 men. There was an apparent increase in the number of murders
 of suspected criminals by "death squads" during the first
 nine months of the year, but this seemed to have dropped
 off significantly toward the end of the year. Two major
 left-of-center political leaders and the Army Chief of
 Staff were among the political murder victims. The Vice
 Foreign Minister and a number of political activists were
 kidnapped. It is often impossible to differentiate politi-
 cally-inspired from privately-inspired violence. The Govern-
 ment has taken few steps to halt abuses or to undertake
 serious public investigations.
 Charges of human rights violations such as degrading treat-
 ment and arbitrary arrest continued to appear, particularly
 in those rural areas where self-proclaimed Marxist guerrillas
 operate. Nevertheless, the overall level dTf both political
 violence and human rights violations remained lower than
 during the decade prior to 1976. Events in Nicaragua and
 El Salvador and growing international criticism of the
 Government's human rights record have prompted efforts
 by concerned and influential elements of Guatemalan society
 to seek reforms. There appears to be a growing awareness
 within the country that the status quo must give way to
 political and economic reform.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture of prisoners has been commonly reported throughout
 Guatemalan history, despite the constitutional prohibition
 against physical abuse of the person. There are reports
 alleging that security forces personnel have engaged in
 torture or other arbitrary and unjust treatment, and some
 of the allegations seem to have basis in fact. The Govern-
 ment claims it neither authorizes nor condones torture.
 There is no indication that persons allegedly involved
 in torture have been disciplined.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment and punishment are legally prohibited.
 Abuses nevertheless occur. There have been a number of
 unexplained deaths of criminal repeaters, which tends to
 confirm reports of a "death squad," although the Government
 denies police involvement in such activities. In rural
 areas, there are frequent accusations of political and
 personal violence committed by private parties, the local
 
 
 328
 military and civil authorities, and by Marxist and militant
 rightist terrorists. There were few prosecutions by the
 Government as a result of such charges. Of those allegedly
 implicated, only a few were known to have been disciplined
 by the atthorities.  Deaths which appeared to have political
 overtone. averaged about twenty each month; some of these
 were alltgedly caused by members of the security forces
 acting either officially or unofficially. Others were
 allegedly caused by armed elements of both the extreme
 right and the extreme left. Anti-criminal "death squad"
 killings, as reported by the press, averaged about forty
 per month, a marked increase over the previous period;
 since September, however, there appears to have been a
 significant decrease in this activity. There is insufficient
 information to determine accurately who is directly responsible
 for most of the violence. However, a 1979 International
 Commission of Jurists' report on Guatemala is critical
 of the Government of Guatemala's failure to investigate
 violence and the activities of the "death squad." There
 were no major outbreaks of violence in 1979 comparable
 to the 1978 Panzos tragedy or bus fare riots. A potential
 major confrontation between the Government and striking
 secondary students was resolved peacefully.
 There are hospitals or clinics at all prisons. Diet is
 customary Guatemalan fare. Prisoners have ready access
 to other food to supplemnt their diet. Prisoners have
 considerable freedom of movement within the jails. There
 are liberal visiting hours for families and clean rooms
 are available for conjugal visits. Access to prisoners
 by the International Red Cross has not been an issue.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Article 46 of the Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest.
 During the past year, some persons suspected of subversive
 activities and a number of criminal repeaters were arrested
 and detained for several days, in at least some cases without
 due process. Accurate estimates of the number of such
 cases are not available. Most of those accused of subversion
 were detained and interrogated for short periods. No cases
 of lengthy detention without indictment or trial were reported
 in 1979. There are no political prisoners. Habeas corpus
 exists and is honored in practice.- However, there are
 occasional reports, some credible, of disappearances.
 Some of these reports refer to individuals who were allegedly
 suspected of guerrilla activity by Government authorities
 or by extremists acting independently of the Government,
 and who were not brought before the judicial system.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Article 53 of the Constitution provides for due process
 for accused persons before the courts. Those persons ac-
 tually so 3rocessed continued generally to receive fair
 public trials. Courts are independent of executive or mi-
 litary con:rol. Under Guatemalan law, attorneys have access
 to clients after formal charges are made at a preliminary
 hearing which must take place within 48 hours of apprehension.
 Article 259 of the Constitution provides that military
 courts have jurisdiction over civilians if the latter act
 as chiefs or leaders of armed action against the public
 
 
 329
 powers. The organization, composition and function of
 these courts are governed by military laws supplemented
 by ordinary legislation.
 The Government and others have expressed frustration that
 intimidation of judges, including threats of violence by
 terrorist groups of the right or left, results in fewer
 convictions than might otherwise be the case. The Inter-
 national Commission of Jurists' 1979 report finds that
 the operations of para-military forces in suppressing dissent
 also has had the effect of breaking down respect for judicial
 institutions and the rule of law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Article 51 of the Constitution protects the sanctity of
 the home. Nevertheless, there are credible charges that
 homes have been invaded illegally, for example, in police
 searches for the kidnapped Vice Foreign Minister. Rural
 homes, in particular, are the subject of searches without
 judicial warrants in the course of anti-terrorist sweeps
 by security forces.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Guatemala's economy is one of laissez faire capitalism.
 The Government supports the powerful and dynamic industrial
 and export-oriented agriculture sectors by providing favor-
 able policies and necessary infrastructure. Property is
 privately owned. This right traditionally is protected.
 The public sector, in terms of personnel, expenditures
 and services, is small. Its principal source of funding
 is indirect taxes, principally on agricultural exports
 and luxury goods.
 The economy is healthy in macro-economic terms with per
 capita income estimated at $910 in 1978. The distribution
 of income is, however, highly skewed. Large sectors of
 the population, including the Indians who constitute over
 40 percent of the population, are poor and have little
 access to health and education services. Mortality and
 morbidity rates are high, and the adult illiteracy rate
 currently stands at 64 percent. In the area of health,
 a high rate of maternal mortality has been associated with
 pregnancy and child bearing. Effective methods of family
 planning are not widespread. Abortion, although forbidden
 under the penal code, is common. Half of maternal deaths
 are the result of septic abortions. However, the Government,
 in response to pressure groups, including well-organized
 women's organizations, has recently made important concessions
 on the issues of family planning and contraceptive distribution.
 There are significant elements within Guatemalan society
 and the Government who propose an expanded role for govern-
 ment in promoting equitable economic and social development.
 The 1979-1983 National Development Plan is based on the
 transformation of the rural economy with emphasis on produc-
 tive infrastructure, the extension of free health and educa-
 tion services through the ninth grade, and industrial decent-
 ralization into rural areas. Many new programs were initiated
 with international financial support in agriculture, primary
 
 
 330
 and secondary education and rural health. While adequate
 shelter for the poor continues to be a major problem, ambitious
 programs in low-cost housing were initiated with the support
 of A.I.D. and other international donors. Some 27,000
 families are expected to benefit over the next few years
 from these programs.
 Large tracts of government lands also are being opened
 up for colonization by the landless poor. The Guatemalan
 military provides substantial logistical and material support
 to this program. Last year, more than 10,000 titles were
 issued. The Lucas Government has continued its predecessor's
 encouragement of an important rural cooperative movement,
 and recently established a cooperative development institute
 for promotion, training and technical assistance. The
 central budget, in general, and public investment in particu-
 lar, are growing rapidly; 78 percent of the Agriculture
 Ministry'" expenditures was earmarked for the rural poor
 in 1978 compared with 30 percent in 1974. Such corruption
 as exists does not appear to have diverted significant
 resources from ongoing development programs.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Officially, there is freedom of speech, press and worship,
 although fear of retaliation including violence sometimes
 inhibits freedom of expression. Church-related groups
 and the Government clash occasionally when foreign missionaries
 are accused of meddling in domestic politics, or of becoming
 active in organizing or counseling peasant groups in ways
 the Government believes challenge its authority. Newspapers
 and the broadcasting media frequently criticize government
 officials and policies without censorship or retaliation.
 The murder in November of a news reporter by unknown assailants
 elicited a strong condemnation by the Guatemalan Government
 and Congress. The Government announced that it would initiate
 an exhaustive investigation. The status of this investigation
 had not been made public by the end of the year. In the
 academic community some students and professors have complained
 of the intolerance by Marxist elements, particularly at
 the National University, who interfere with the academic
 freedom of others. Political protest demonstrations and
 parades are regulated by the Ministry of Interior, which
 generally issues permits when legal criteria are met.
 The Government has enforced the permit policy rigorously,
 dispersing demonstrations which lack prior authorization.
 Principal protest demonstrations authorized in 1979 were
 the University student parody parade and the May 1 Labor
 Day parade. In November the democratic left opposition
 party (FUR) requested and received permission for a demonstration
 which transpired without incident.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are generally no restrictions on foreign or domestic
 travel or on emigration by Guatemalans. However, travel
 to and from some guerrilla areas and access to Guatemala
 
 
 331
 City from the countryside at times are controlled (for
 example, on Labor Day).
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 For the past two decades, Guatemalan politics have been
 dominated by the military within a constitutional framework
 providing for regular elections and civilian control below
 the top level. Opposition parties contest elections, hold
 rallies, have access to the media and hold seats in the
 national and municipal assemblies. Open and hard-fought
 elections in 1978 transferred power to a new administration,
 though the military retained its traditional primacy.
 Nominated by civilian political parties, two of the three
 candidates were military officers and the third was a retired
 officer. The new Government has authorized four additional
 parties, the first ones since 1968. This action was marred
 by the assassinations of two major opposition political
 leaders, one from an authorized party ang the other from
 a party still awaiting legal inscription.�/Groups awaiting
 certification, in accordance with constitutional provisions
 pertaining to political parties (Chapter 5 of the Constitu-
 tion), are permitted to function as parties in most respects
 other than formally presenting candidates in national elec-
 tions. The Constitution bans the Communist Party.
 The 1978 Presidential elections were marred by fraud charges
 on all sides, but apparently to a significantly lesser
 degree than in 1974. Since no candidate received the neces-
 sary majority, the Congress selected the President as the
 Constitution provides. After certifying its tally, the
 Congress chose the candidate (General Lucas) with the highest
 recorded popular vote (42 percent). Votes recorded for
 the three candidates amounted to about 35 percent of the
 registered electorate. Eight political parties intend
 to contest the 1980 municipal elections. Several of these
 parties have expressed concern over past election fraud
 and are seeking assurances that the municipal elections
 will be conducted fairly.
 Guatemalan women are less discriminated against by legal
 or institutional restrictions than by historical, cultural
 and social biases which have relegated them to an inferior
 status. Women are becoming increasingly active in the
 labor force; in rural areas they play a key economic role
 in the marketing of small farmer produce and in the handi-
 craft industry, and as economic pressures create a greater
 need for supplemental family income, more middle-class
 women are joining the labor force. However, managerial
 and political positions are still dominated by men. Illite-
 racy rates are higher among women, but a growing number
 of women are taking advantage of higher education opportunities.
 Labor unions legally are free to organize and to bargain
 collectively and strikes are permitted in the private sector,
 but not in the public sector. However, there are few strong,
 independent unions. Part of the reason is the excess supply
 of unskilled labor and ineffective union leadership. Another
 important cause is that threats and beatings by right wing
 terrorists, allegedly linked to management, and the assassination
 of trade union figures by unidentified parties have created
 a climate adverse to the growth of a free and vigorous
 labor movement.
 I/ Manuel Colom Argueta, former mayor of Guatemala City, and
 leader of the FUR party when assassinated 3/22/79.
 2/ Alberto Fuentes Mohr, former Foreign Minister, and leader
 of Social Democratic Party when assassinated 1/25/79.
 
 
 332
 The Government in some cases has overreacted to illegal
 acts by unions. When public sector employee associations
 participated in illegal strikes, the Government cancelled
 their legal status. Furthermore, the system of labor justice
 is viewed by unions as favoring business and is the source
 of much labir discontent. The Government has proposed
 a new labor code which is being considered by the Congress.
 Some of its provisions could strengthen trade unions.
 About 2.5 million Indians of Guatemala's total population
 of 6.5 million speak a language other than Spanish as their
 mother tongue. The great majority of these people are
 illiterate They are largely isolated from much of national
 life. The Indians are often the objects of discrimination
 and exploita;:ion, and must contend with many social, economic
 and political disadvantages.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Unofficial observers from the United States and Europe
 visited Guatemala for the 1978 national elections. Represen-
 tatives of the International Commission of Jurists and
 Amnesty International visited Guatemala in 1979 and published
 reports critical of the Guatemalan Government's human rights
 record. In its report, the International Commission of
 Jurists stated that "since its accession to power in 1978
 the current government has embarked on a systematic campaign
 to suppress dissent which has, in fact, generated a wide-
 spread climate of fear, demoralization, and the growth
 of clandestine opposition." Amnesty International attributed
 responsibility for a "wave of violence" ... "to government,
 military and security forces and to semi-clandestine 'death
 squads,' some of which operate with apparent government
 complicity." Government spokesmen and some private entities
 consider the charges exaggerated or unfounded and have
 challenged these organizations to substantiate them.
 Guatemala has ratified the American Convention on Human
 Rights. Guatemala abstained on permitting Amnesty Interna-
 tional to attend the 1978 General Assembly of the Organiza-
 tion of American States as a "special invitee," but at
 the United Nations it supported creation of the office
 of a High Commissioner for Human Rights.
