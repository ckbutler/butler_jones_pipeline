 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy. The President exercises exec-
 utive authority; Sir Ketumile Masire, was reelected for a third 5-year term in Octo-
 ber. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) continued to dominate the Na-
 tional Assembly, holding 31 of 44 seats. The opposition Botswana National Front
 (BNF) has the remaining 13 seats.
 The civilian Government exercises effective control over the security forces. The
 military, the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), and the Botswana National Police
 (BNP) are responsible for external and internal security.
 The economy is market oriented with strong encouragement for private enter-
 prise. Steady diamond revenues and efficient economic and fiscal policies resulted
 in steady growth, although the rate slowed somewhat compared to the previous
 year. Per capita gross domestic product was approximately $3,100 in 1994. Over 50
 percent of the population is employed in the informal sector, largely subsistence
 farming and animal husban. Rural poverty remains a serious problem.
 Respect for citizens' human rights is enshrined in the Constitution, and the Gov-
 ernment has widely observed these rights. Despite a number of problem areas, Bot-
 swana's overall human rights record has  en consistently positive since independ-
 ence in 1966. However, there were credible reports that police sometimes mistreated
 suspects, especially during interrogation. The continued arbitrary detention of sus-
 pected economic migrants alongside convicted felons remained a serious problem in
 1994. Women continue to face significant legal and societal discrimination, and vio-
 lence against women is a growing problem. Groups not numbered among the eight
 "principal tribes" identified  the Constitution still d not enjoy full access to social
 services and are marginalized in the political process. In many instances the judicial
 
 
 system did not provide timely fair trials due to a serious backlog of cases. Trade
 unions continued to face some legal restrictions, and the Government did not always
 ensure that labor laws were observed in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution explicitly forbids torture, inhuman, and degrading treatment or
 punishment. The authorities generally respect this prohibition in practice, and in
 some cases have taken disciplinary or judicial action against persons responsible for
 abuses. However, instances of abuse do occur. While coerced confessions are inad-
 missible in court, evidence gathered through coercion or abuse may be used in pros-
 ecution. There were credible reports that police sometimes used intimidation tech-
 niques in order to obtain evidence. In the past, police sometimes suffocated criminal
 suspects with a plastic bag, but police beatings and other forms of extreme physical
 abuse are rare. A victim of police brutality filed and won a civil suit against the
 BNP in 1994; criminal charges are still pending.
 The Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) has law enforcement au-
 thority within the confines of the 40 percent of the country that is devoted to con-
 servation. There were credible but unconfirmed reports that DWNP wardens some-
 times tortured suspected poachers in remote areas. There was insufficient evidence
 for the DWNP or the courts to assemble cases against the alleged perpetrators. The
 DWNP and the rest of the Government condemn such practices, but the allegations
 continued in 1994.
 Prison conditions are generally acceptable, although overcrowding has increased
 in the last decade. The Government makes efforts to protect women in custody from
 rape and other abuse. Police placed arrested women in the charge of female officers
 to reduce the potential for mistreatment, and they keep female suspects and con-
 victed felons in separate facilities from men. Sexual assault against women is not
 a problem in the prison system.
 The Government does not forcibly repatriate or deport failed asylum seekers, but
 does not always permit them to remain free. In the absence of a dedicated facility
 for failed asylum seekers, the authorities have resorted in some instances to incar-
 cerating them alongside convicted felons. While recognizing this as a problem, the
 Government is reluctant to build a separate facility both for budgetary reasons and
 out of concern that such a facility would attract asylum seekers.
 The Government permits independent monitoring of its prisons, including by
 church, nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), and international groups.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Constitution, 'very person in
 Botswana" enjoys freedom from arbitrary arrest as well as due process and the pre-
 sumption of innocence. However, the Government has not extended those rights to
 those who enter the country illegally. Upon arrest, a suspect must be informed of
 his or her legal rights, including the right to remain silent, to be allowed to contact
 a person of choice, and generally to be charged before a magistrate within 48 hours.
 A magistrate may detain a suspect for 14 days through a writ of detention, which
 may be renewed every 14 days. Most citizens charged with noncapital offenses are
 released on their own recognizance; some are released with minimal bail. Detention
 without bail is highly unusual, except in murder cases, where it is mandated. De-
 tainees have the right to hire attorneys of their choice.
 Poor police training and poor communications in rural villages, however, make it
 difficult for many detainees to obtain legal assistance, and authorities do not always
 strictly follow procedures. The Government does not provide counsel for the indi-
 gent, and there is no public defender service. Two NGO's--the University of Bot-
 swana Legal Assistance Center and the Botswana Center for Human Rights-pro-
 vide pro bono legal services, but their capacity is limited. Constitutional protections
 do not appy to illegal immigrants, although the constitutionality of denying due
 proess to iAegal immigrants has not been tested in court.
 While the Government does not use exile for political purposes, it has expelled for-
 eigners on political grounds, declaring foreigners who criticize government policy
 prohibited immigrants--a ruling from the oice of the President for which there is
 no appeal process.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Botswana has two court systems, the civil courts
 and the customary (traditional) courts. While the Constitution provides for dueproc-
 ess, the civil courts, which include magistrates' courts and the Court of Appeal, are
 
 
 not able to provide for timely fair trial in many cases. In 1994 these courts contin-
 ued to face acute resource shortages and a lack of trained personnel, leading to
 enormous backlogs, over a year in many capital cases and longer in lesser offenses.
 Most trials in the regular courts are public, although trials under the National
 Security Act (NSA) may be held in secret. As a rule, the courts appoint public de-
 fenders only for those persons charged with capital crimes (murder and treason);
 those charged with noncapital crimes are often tried without legal representation
 if they cannot afford an attorney. As a result, many defendants are not informed
 of their rights in pretrial or trial proceedings.
 Botswana's civil courts operate with a high degree of independence. They are
 largely unhampered by corruption and rarely susceptible to political influence. How-
 ever, judicial authority has been undermined by the Government's continued reluc-
 tance to abide by a 1992 decision of the High Court that the Citizenship Act is un-
 constitutional because it discriminates against women. International human rights
 monitors criticized the Government for its failure to revise the law and respect the
 Court's ruling (see Sections 2.d. and 5). The Government has yet to declare publicly
 how it will implement the High Court's decision. President Masire has made a com-
 mitment to address the issue in 1995.
 During the debate preceding adoption of the 1994 Anticorruption Bill, some
 human rights organizations expressed concern that, in the case of those accused of
 misuse of government resources, the bill would weaken the constitutional provision
 providing for the defendants' presumption of innocence.
 Most citizens encounter the legal system through the customary courts under the
 nominal authority of a traditional leader. These courts handle minor offenses involv-
 ing land, marita, and property disputes. In these courts, the defendant does not
 have legal counsel  and there are no precise rules of evidence. Tribal judges, ap-
 pointedby the traditional leader or elected by the community, determine sentences,
 which may be appealed through the civil court system. The quality of decisions
 rached in the traditional courts varies considerably. In communities where chiefs
 are respcted, their decisions are respected; in communities where the chiefs are not
 respected, people seek justice from the civil courts.
 The Govenent held no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the protection of privacy and the security of the person,
 and the Government respects these rights. While judicial search warrants are nor-
 meally required, police officers above the rank of sergeant may enter, search, and
 seize property if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that evidence might be
 destroyed or that a crime is in progress. Evidence gathered without a search war-
 rant is admissible in court, but judges may and do disqualify such evidence if it can
 be shown that the police had time to obtain a warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, both individual and corporate, but also permits restrictions on these freedoms
 "reasonably required in the interests of defense, public safety, public order, public
 morality, or public health." Botswana has a long tradition of vigorous and candid
 public discourse, and the Government has not used this constitutional provision to
 place unreasonable restrictions on speech or press.
 However, the broadcast media remain a government monopoly, with radio the
 most important medium of information in this highly dispersed society. Radio Bot-
 swana follows government policies and draws most of its stories from the official
 Botswana Press Agency (BOPA). Opposition leaders have access to the radio, but
 they complain-with some justification-that their broadcast time is severely lim-
 . The Government also subsidizes a free daily newspaper which depends heavily
 on BOPA for its material.
 The independent press is small but lively and frequently critical of the Govern-
 ment and the President. It reports without fear of closure, censorship, or intimida-
 tion. There are no privately owned radio or television stations, But there is a
 semilegal television station broadcasting mostly pirated programs to viewers in the
 capital city. Independent radio and television from neighboring South Africa are
 easily received.
 On occasion the Government has taken steps, under loosely defined provisions of
 the NSA, to limit publication of national security information. The Attorney General
 did not take any action during 1994 in the case involving two journalists accused
 of violating the NSA in 1993, in part because one of the reporters was abroad on
 a scholarship.
 The Government also has leverage over the independent press through advertis-
 ing placed by state-owned enterprises. Within the Government, there has been some
 
 
 15
 discussion of withdrawing such advertising from the independent media, but no
 such action had been taken by year's end.
 There are no limits placed on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peacefid Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of association, and the Government respects this right in practice. Police
 authorization is needed to hold public demonstrations, but the authorities withhold
 permission only in limited cases and then exclusively for the sake of public safety.
 Although associations must officially register, the Government has not used the reg-
 istration process to delay, harass, or otherwise impede group formation. There are
 a multiplicity of political parties, labor unions, and civic associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for this freedom, and people
 worship freely in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no barriers to domestic and international travel or migration.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons, although once voluntarily relin-
 quished, it can only be regained through naturalization.
 Citizenship provisions of the Nationality Law discriminate against women and
 have been severely criticized by human rights groups, as well as being the object
 of legal action (see Section 5).
 The Government does not repatriate refugees against their will, nor will it forcibly
 expel those who have applied for, but failed to gain refugee status. Those granted
 refugee or asylum status are treated well, but some failed asylum seekers have been
 detained without charge for up to 2 years in the same facilities and cells as con-
 victed felons. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other international refugee organizations, but'it
 generally applies stricter criteria to asylum seekers than does the UNHCR.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. In practice, one party-the
 BDP-has dominated the lower chamber of Parliament, the National Assembly,
 since independence, although its representation in the Assembly was reduced in the
 October 15 multiparty general elections, in which it won 27 of the 40 elected seats.
 While eight parties contested the election, only the BNF, with 13 seats, joined the
 BDP in Parliament. There are also four appointed seats. The BNF's recent perform-
 ance at the polls (increasing its parliamentary presence from 3 to 13 seats) reflected
 a strong following in urban areas. Parliament elects the President. Citizens 21 years
 of age and older may vote, using a secret ballot.
 The House of Chiefs, a ceremonial upper chamber of Parliament with limited ad-
 visory powers, is constitutionally restricted to the eight "principal tribes" of the
 Tswana nation. Conseuently, other groups of Botswana citizens, e.g., the Basarwa
 (widely known as "bushmen ), Herero, Kalanga, Humbukush, Baloi or Lozi are not
 represented in the House of Chiefs. Given the limited authority of the Hlouse of
 Chiefs, the impact of this discrimination is largely symbolic, but it is viewed as im-
 portant in principle by a number of non-Batswana.
 Members of the National Assembly are required to be able to speak English, and
 one prospective candidate for a seat representing a Basarwa constituency was not
 nominated by his party for this reason. This restriction has never been challenged
 in court.
 Women are also underrepresented in the political process. Although women con-
 stitute just over 50 percent of the population, only 3 of 44 National Assembly seats
 are occupied by women, and only 2 women are in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not prevent local and international organizations from in-
 vestigating human rights abuses in Botswana, nor does it make any attempt to sup-
 press any critical publications. Local human rights groups operate openly and inde-
 pendently. They freely use the independent media to publicize their findings, which
 are often critical of the Government. Organizations such as Human Rights Watch/
 Africa and Amnesty International have criticized certain practices in Botswana. The
 Government often disputes the conclusions of NGO's but does not attempt to pre-
 vent them from being debated. Officers from international human rights groups
 enter and depart Botswana freely.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and Penal Code forbid discrimination on the basis of ethnicity,
 nationality, or creed but do not address discrimination based on sex.

 Women--Women in Botswana do not have the same civil rights as men. A promi-
 nent illustration of this is the highly publicized Unity Dow lawsuit challenging Bot-
 swana's citizenship laws. Attorney Unity Dow, a female citizen of Botswana married
 to an expatriate, filed a successful suit challenging the constitutionality of Bot-
 swana's Nationality Law. Under that Law, a Motswana woman married to a non-
 Motswana could not transmit Botswana citizenship to her child whereas a
 Motswana man in the same situation could do so. Although the High Court declared
 the law unconstitutional, the Government has since failed to take action to pass a
 new law which would treat male and female citizen parents equally with respect
 to transmission of citizenship to their children. In an effort to force government ac-
 tion, Unity Dow has since applied for a passport for her child, but the authorities
 had declined to act on that application by yeaes end.
 A number of other laws, many of which are attributed to traditional practices, re-
 strict civil and economic opportunities for women. Women married in 'common pro&-
 erty" are held to be legal minors, requiring their husbands' consent to buy or sel
 property, apply for credit, and enter into legally binding contracts. Women have,
 and are increasingly exercising, the right to marriage "out of common property," in
 which case they retain their full legal rights as adults. Polygny is stilllegal under
 traditional law and with the consent of the first wife, but it is rarely practiced.
 Well-trained urban women enjoy growing entry-level access to the white-collar iob
 market, but the number of opportunities decreases sharply as they rise in seniority.
 Discrimination against women is most acute in rural areas where women work pri-
 marily in subsistence agriculture.
 Violence against women, primarily beatings, remains a serious problem in Bot-
 swana. Under customary law and in common rural practice, men have the right to
 "chastise" their wives. Statistics are believed to underreport the true level of abuse
 against women. Police are rarely called to intervene in cases of domestic violence,
 and there were no cases in which a wife filed criminal charges against an abusive
 husband in 1994. Spouse abuse does not receive widespread media attention.
 A number of women's organizations have emerged to promote the status of
 women. The groups vary considerably in their membership, philosophy, and tactics.
 The Government has been slow to respond concretely to issues raised by these
 groups.
 Children.-The rights of children are addressed in the Constitution and the 1981
 Children's Act. Under the Act, Botswana has a court system and social service appa-
 ratus designed solely for juveniles. There is no pattern of societal abuse against chil-
 dren.
 National/Racial[Ethnic Minorities.-The Tswana majority, of which the Constitu-
 tion recognizes eight "principal tribes," has a tradition of peacefully coexisting with
 "minor" tribes, chief among which are the Kalanga who represent some 25 percent
 of the population. Each of the eight principal tribes is represented in the advisory
 -louse of Chiefs, while other groups are permitted only a subchief, who is not a
 member of the House. Other than the lack of schooling in their own language and
 representation  in the House of Chiefs, Botswana's Bantu       minorities and
 nonindigenous minorities, such as the white and Asian communities, are not subject
 to discrimination. However, the nomadic Basarwa remain marginalized and have
 lost access to their traditional land. The Basarwa ae vulnerable to exploitation, and
 their isolation, ignorance of civil rights, and lack of representation in local or na-
 tional government have stymied their progress.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not require accessibility to public
 buildings and conveyances for people with disabilities, and the NGO community has
 only recently begun to press for more government attention to the needs of the dis-
 abled. The Government does not discriminate on the basis of physical or mental
 handicap, although employment bpportunities for the disabled remain limited.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion, and in practice all workers, with the exception of government employees, are
 free to join or organize unions of their own choosing. Government workers may form
 associations that function as quasi-unions but without the right to negotiate wages.
 The industrial or wage economy is small, and unions are concentratedlargely in the
 mineral, and to a lesser extent, in the railway and banking sectors. There is only
 one major confederation, the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU), but
 unions are free to form other confederations.
 Unions are independent of the Government and are not closely allied with any
 political party or movement. Unions may employ administrative staff, but the law
 requires elected union officials to work full time in the industry the union rep-
 resents. This severely limits union leaders' professionalism and effectiveness and
 
 
 17
 has been criticized by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU).
 In addition, the law severely restricts the right to strike. Legal strikes are theo-
 retically possible after an exhaustive arbitration process, but in practice none of the
 country's strikes to date has been legal. Employees of two banks, one private and
 one state owned, staged strikes in December. At year's end, both actions were unre-
 solved.
 Unions may join international organizations, and the BFTU is affiliated with the
 ICFTU. The Minister of Labor must approve any affiliation with an outside labor
 movement, but unions may appeal to the courts if an application for affiliation is
 refused.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 collective bargaining for unions that have enrolled 25 percent of a labor force. In
 reality, only the mineworker unions have the organizational strength to engage in
 collective bargaining, and collective bargaining is virtually nonexistent in most other
 sectors.
 Workers may not be fired for union-related activities, and dismissed workers may
 appeal to labor officers or civil courts. However, labor officers rarely do more than
 order 2 months' severance pay.
 Botswana has only one export processing zone-in the town of Selebi-Phikwe-
 which is subject to the same labor laws as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Although education is not compul-
 sory, the Government provides 7 years of free education to every child, and most
 children in Botswana take advantage of this opportunity. Only an immediate family
 member may employ a child 13 years old or younger, and no juvenile under 15 may
 be employed in any industry. Only persons over 16 may be hired to perform night
 work, and no person under 16 is allowed to assume hazardous labor, including in
 mining. District and municipal councils have child welfare divisions that are respon-
 sible for enforcing child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum monthly wage for full-time labor
 is $100 (270 Pula), which is just under 50 percent of what the Government cal-
 culates is necessary to meet the basic needs of a family of five. The Ministry of
 Labor is nominally responsible for enforcing the minimum wage, but there were no
 known cases in which the Ministry took actions against an employer paying less in
 1994.
 Formal sector jobs almost always pay well above minimum wage levels. Informal
 sector employment, particularly in the agricultural and domestic service sectors,
 where housing and food are included, frequently pay below the minimum wage. ille-
 gal immigrants, primarily Zimbabweans and Zambians, are easily exploited as they
 would be subject to arbitrary and immediate deportation if they filed grievances
 against employers.
 Botswana law permits a maximum 48-hour workweek, exclusive of overtime
 which is payable at time and a half for each additional hour. Most modern private
 and public sector jobs are on the 40-hour workweek.
 Workers who complain about hazardous conditions cannot be fired. The Govern-
 ment's institutional ability to enforce its workplace safety legislation remains lim-
 ited, however, by inadequate staffing and unclear jurisdictions between different
 ministries. Nevertheless, worker safety is generally provided for by employers, with
 the occasionally notable exception of the construction industry.
