 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is governed by President Robert Mugabe and his
 Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) which
 has dominated the legislative and executive branches of
 government since independence in 1980. Although the
 Constitution allows for multiple parties, and several small
 parties exist, in 1991 they were weak, poorly financed, and
 faced periodic intimidation by goveLnment security forces. As
 a result, they posed little serious challenge to the control of
 the government by ZANU-PF.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) is responsible for
 maintaining law and order. The Central IntelIigence
 Organization (CIO) and the Police Internal Security and
 Intelligence (PISI) units are attached to the President's
 office. In 1991 the President relieved the CIO and PISI of
 their powers to arrest, detain, and interrogate suspects in
 internal security cases. In some instances, particularly in
 the cases of suspected South African spies and the Mozambican
 National Resistance (RENAMO) rebels, the CIO and PISI have
 violated the new restrictions on their powers. The CIO has
 been accused of human rights abuses, including the use of
 torture.
 Zimbabwe's economy has strong agricultural and mining sectors
 and a diversified industrial base. Economic growth has
 generally matched the rate of population growth, but new
 investment has been inadequate to generate jobs for the large
 number of secondary school graduates. Unemployment is over 30
 percent. In February the Government embarked on a
 comprehensive Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP).
 which projects a transition to a largely market-oriented
 economy within 5 years.
 The year 1991 witnessed the appointment of independent judges
 to the High Court, the appearance of several independent
 periodicals, the founding of a new political party, and more
 movement toward free collective bargaining. However, a number
 of human rights violations continued, notably deaths in police
 custody, the mistreatment of detainees, forced repatriation of
 some refugees, and irregularities in the national city council
 election campaign. On occasion the Government acted to
 restrict freedom of assembly and association, and traditional,
 often illegal, discrimination against women continued. The
 controversial l1th amendment to Zimbabwe's Constitution, which
 entrenches hanging and whipping in the Constitution and opens
 the way for the acquisition of land for resettlement, took
 effect in April.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a..Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.
 There were no confirmed political killings or summary
 executions by government security forces in 1991. However, one
 ZANU-PF politician died under circumstances which suggested it
 might have been politically motivated.
 Also, two opposition politicians died in mysterious accidents.
 In March Amos Dlamini and Kenneth Ncube, two officials of the
 Bulawayo-based Open Forum, a political discussion organization,
 were killed after allegedly being struck by a car while walking
 
 
 461
 ZIMBABWE
 at the side of the Bulawayo-Harare highway. Dlamini was a
 veteran member of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU),
 and before the accident he told a reporter that he was wanted
 for questioning by security officers regarding the activities
 of the Open Forum, which had become popular among intellectuals
 disillusioned with ZAPU's merger with ZANU.
 In 1991 five people died in police custody under questionable,
 circumstances. The family of Edmore Muroyiwa, who diedin
 police custody at Harare police station in August, has sued the
 police. The ZRP claimed that Muroyiwa hanged himself with a
 rope made from strips of a blanket, following his detention on
 suspicion of car theft. An independent newspaper account cast
 considerable doubt on the police version of the incident,
 noting that Muroyiwa was the owner of the car he was accused of
 having stolen and had no prior arrest record.
 The September issue of Horizon Magazine, an independent
 monthly, claimed that two ZANU-Ndonga (ar opposition party)
 officials, Albert Mtewa and Elisha Machisa, died in a Chipinge
 prison in late 1990 as a result of Cï¿½O-administered beatings.
 The death'certificates state that the men died of natural
 causes, and there is no proof to the contrary. It is not
 disputed that CIO arrested the men and illegally held them
 without charge on suspicion of aiding RENAMO forces.
 RENAMO forces operating across the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border
 continued to commit atrocities in Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
 There were no reports of killings of -innocent civilians in
 1991- in contrast to the last 3 years when RENAMO- cadres
 reportedly killed more than 300 Zimbabweans.
 b. Disappearance
 No new cases of disappearance- attributable to the Government
 were known to have occurred. The Government has not made a
 serious effort to account for the persons, estimated- from at
 least 80 to 400, who disappeared in 1982-1985, almost all of.
 whom were from Ndebele ethnic regions.
 There were no new abductions by-RENAMO forces reported in-
 1991. Reportedly-54 Zimbabweans were abducted by RENAMO in
 1990.
 e. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture has long been a problem in Zimbabwe. Under the -State
 of Emergency (SOE>, detainees in security cases were often held
 'incommunicado and tortured by CIO offieials.
 While the SOE was lifted in 1990, firsthand reports in 1991
 indicated that torture continued to be-employed in some
 security cases, especial-ly cases involving suspected South.
 African and RENAMO agents. Senior government officials
 strongly deny that torture is condoned but admit that isolated,
 unauthorized instances have occurred. No CIO officials were
 prosecuted for such abuses in 1990 or 1991. Credible reports,
 indicate that security officers on a routine basis physically
 abused displaced Mozambicans suspected of being RENAMO
 supporters.
 Police brutality in political and ordinary criminal cases is
 also a problem. Student demonstrators protesting legislation
 which they believe curtails academic freedom leaped from
 
 
 462
 ZIMBABWE
 third-story windows to flee club-wielding police in October.
 In an effort to instill discipline in the police force, the ZRP
 hierarchy has decided to deduct all damages for illegal arrests
 and physical abuse-from the salaries of the offending officers.
 Zimbabwean prisons are overcrowded, and the treatment of
 prisoners is dehumanizing. Due to prison procedures and the
 physical structure of the prisons, even minimal respect for
 individual privacy is often lacking.
 In 1991 the Legal Resources Foundation (LRF) conducted seminars
 for police officers that were intended to help the ZRP learn to
 act within the framework of the law; it was seeking approval
 from-the Government to provide similar training for the CIO.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The police must by law inform an arrested person of the charges
 against him before he is taken into custody. Also, a person
 arrested on a criminal charge must have a preliminary hearing
 before a magistrate within 48 hours, but the law is often
 disregarded if a person is not legally represented. At the
 hearing the magistrate decides whether the arrested person
 should be released on bail or held in custody until trial.
 Pretrial rights are generally respected, but occasionally
 magistrates and police officers do not inform defendants of
 their rights.
 Playwright Denford Magora had his passport seized in November
 and was arrested and held for 48 hours in December by the PISI
 unit. Magora's detention followed the staging of a
 controversial play about the Government.
 It is still possible for the Government to apply a wide range
 of legal powers under the Official Secrets Act or the Law and
 Order (Maintenance) Act (LOMA). Originally promulgated 30
 years ago and widely used to prosecute political opponents, the
 LOMA has extremely wide and vague sections on political and
 security crimes and gives extensive powers to the police and to
 the Minister of Home Affairs and the chief executive. However,
 the Government has been loath to invoke the LOMA since July
 1990, fearing that its oppressive provisions might be declared
 unconstitutional. People may only be detained under the
 Official Secrets Act if they aresuspected of spying or of
 passing classified material or information about military
 matters to those without a bona fide need to know.
 There were no known political detainees being held at year's
 end. No information is available on the number of persons
 being detained by military forces due to the conflict with
 RENAMO.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e." Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Zimbabwe's legal system is based on a mixture of Roman-Dutch
 law, English common law, and customary law. Every defendant
 has the right to select a lawyer of his or her choosing. In
 civil cases an indigent may apply to have the Government supply
 an attorney, while in capital cases the Government will provide
 an attorney for all defendants unable to afford one. In
 practice, however, approximately 90 percent of defendants are
 not represented by counsel. The right to appeal exists in all
 cases and is automatic in cases where the death penalty is
 
 
 463
 ZIMBABWE
 imposed. Trials are open to the public except in certain
 security cases, e.g., those involving alleged South African
 agents.
 The Customary Law and Local Courts Act of 1990 created a
 unitarycourt system, consisting of headmen's courts, chiefs'
 courts, magisterial courts, the High Court, and the Supreme
 Court. With the restructuring'of the courts, customary law
 cases can be heard at all levels of the judiciary, including
 the Supreme Court. The village and community courts were
 replaced by assistant magistrates' courts, chiefs' courts, and
 headmen's courts. Headmen and chiefs can hear limited
 categories of customary law cases in disputes not exceeding
 $100 and $200, respectively-
 The judiciary is generally independent. In January Chief
 Justice Anthony Gubbay attacked constitutional amendment 11,
 which was passed in December 1990, criticizing inter alia the
 reintroduction of hanging and whipping as punishment for
 juvenile offenders, and the compulsory acquisition of property
 by the State. He said the amendment's language will remove the
 powers of the judiciary to intervene in the event of unfair
 compensation forcommercial farm land compulsorily purchased by
 the Government for resettlement. In response, President Mugabe
 said judges should not interfere with Parliament's political
 decisions, and those judges unhappy with- laws passed should
 quit. The Attorney General castigated the Chief Justice for
 commenting on a case before it came before the court. However,
 judges are not fired or transferred for political reasons.  The
 Government generally abides by court decisions even, when-it. iS:
 strongly opposed to the rulings.
 'AIthough there are at present 500 lawyers in Zimbabwe, there is
 a severe shortage of experienced magistrates. Zimbabwe's
 judicial system is hard pressed to cope with ordinary criminal
 cases. The 3-year lag in case and law reporting #ended in 1990
 as the Legal Resources Foundation received a government
 contract, and brought the cases up to date. However, the
 production of records for. review and appeal remains a problem.
 Following President Mugabe's July1990 amnesty for 1,400
 prisoners, local human rights organizations agreed with Home
 Affairs Minister Mahachi's assertion that no political
 prisoners remain in Zimbabwe., However, in 199r the Catholic
 Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) expressed concern about
 the continued detention of 36 former dissidents.  Most of them
 are former guerrillas from the ZYPRA (Zimbabwe People's-
 Revol-utionary ArmyY Qf current Vice President Joshua Nkomo.
 Another is the former chauffeur 'for Rev. Ndabaning Sithole,
 the self-exiled leader'of the ZANU-Ndonga party. Some, but not
 all, were legally convicted of crimes, including robbery and
 murder. The CCJP has argued that the dissidents should have
 been released under the amnesty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution formally protects citizens from arbitrary
 search or entry, and after the lifting of the SOE these
 protections are generally respected. It is widely believed,
 however, that the Government monitors private correspondence
 and telephones, particularly international communications.
 The GOZ relocated over 3,000 squatiers in 1991. In July police
 raided a squatter settlement near the Mozambican border and
 
 
 464
 ZIMBABWE
 razed at least 72 dwellings. In September armed police burned
 the homes and property of some 300 squatter families in
 Masvingo province after the families had been served with
 eviction orders. A source close to the squatters said the
 burning of the homes appeared to be in response to a letter
 sent by the squatters' lawyers appealing against eviction
 orders. The families (who are Zimbabwean citizens) are now
 living in the open. That same month, almost 2,000 Harare
 squatters were temporarily moved 40 kilometers from the capital
 to camps with inadequate sanitation and services; public access
 to these camps was denied. The Government began to build
 permanent housing for the majority of these squatters in
 November.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression but allows
 for legislation to limit this freedom in the "interest of
 defense, public safety, public order, state economic interests,
 public morality, and public health." In practice, the
 Government interprets broadly its power to discourage free
 speech. At public events it is generally assumed that speakers
 are under surveillance and may be subject to follow-up
 questioning by the CIO if their remarks are judged too
 controversial. The LOMA provides for the prosecution of
 persons who make racially inflammatory remarks.
 Zimbabwe's major print media (five English-language newspapers
 and one vernacular broadsheet) belong to the Mass Media Trust,
 a holding company heavily influenced by the Government and
 ruling party. There is no opposition press per se, but a small
 independent press, consisting of an economic weekly, a
 political weekly, a Sunday tabloid, and three monthly
 magazines, carefully monitors government policies and opens its
 pages to opposition critics. Despite its displeasure with
 these publications, the Government has taken no punitive
 measures against them. However, all are plagued by chronic
 financial woes and the shortage of government-controlled
 newsprint.
 Two new independent publications in 1991 challenged the
 Government's hold on the media.. Former Parade Magazine editor
 Andrew Moyse, who first captured the public's attention in 1988
 with detailed exposes of scandals and corruption in senior
 government circles, launched Horizon Magazine in September.
 Former journalist Herbert Munangatire and a small group of
 leading businesspersons and retired politicians began
 publication of the Sunday Times to rival the
 government-controlled Sunday Mail.
 The Government controls mainstream media through indirect
 ownership, editorial appointments, directives to editors, and
 removal' of wayward editors. Progovernment media officials
 generally hew to the government and party line. The
 government-influenced press in 1991 carried more critical
 articles and editorials than in previous years. The most
 influential of the media in reaching the public, radio and
 televison, are entirely government owned. Government
 domination of the mass media restricts the free flow of
 information and impedes the emergence of an informed public.
 Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa said there is a tendency to
 use the Official Secrets Act to cover the blunders and corrupt
 
 
 465
 ZIMBABWE
 practices of government officials. Mnangagwa also pointed to
 several other pieces of legislation, including the Censorship
 and Entertainment Act, the Printed Publications Act, and the
 Postal Telecommunications Act, all of which can restrict a free
 press.
 Academic freedom suffered a setback i4 1990-1991. The
 University of Zimbabwe Amendment Act, passed by Parliament in
 November 1990 after a hurried debate, greatly restricts the
 independence of the University from government influence and
 extends the disciplinary powers of the university authorities
 against staff and students. During his July commencement
 address, University Vice Chancellor Walter Kamba announced his
 resignation, citing interference from politicians as the reason
 for his resignation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and*Association
 The Constitution formally provides for the right of assembly
 and association for political and nonpolitical organizations,
 including a broad spectrum of economic, social, professional,
 and recreational activities. In law and in practice, however,
 there are serious obstacles to the full exercise of this right,
 particularly in the case of political associations. The
 broadest authority for restricting these-freedoms is contained
 in the LOMA. Since the lifting of the SOE, the Government has
 relied on the LOMA to limit freedom of association or assembly.
 The SOE's expiration means that organizations including
 political parties are no longer required to request police
 approval to hold political meetings or stage,rallies. The -
 police need only be given 7 days' notice of public meetings;
 private meetings do not require notification. In 1991,
 however, police officers acted as if permission was required,
 effectively canceling at least six meetings, including a
 meeting of the Kwekwe-based Southern-African Human- Rights
 Foundation and a Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUK) meeting in
 Bulawayo. Other ZUM conclaves were disrupted by the police on
 -the grounds that they were illegal, including a Gweru meeting
 in May which resulted in party members being detained for 48
 hours. On August l the High Court ruled that ZUM did not*
 require police permission to hold political meetings. However,
 some police officers ignored the landmark High Court ruling
 when they barred a Democratic Party meeting in Kezi,
 Matabeleland South.
 Organizations are generally free of governmental interference
 as -long as their activities are viewed as nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom Qf Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Zimbabwe. There is no
 state religion. Denominations are permitted to worship openly,
 pursue social and charitable activities, and maintain ties with
 affiliates and coreligionists abroad. Religious belief is
 neither a handicap nor an advantage in terms of professional or
 political advancement.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel at home and abroad is not-generally subject to official
 restrictions, although restrictions have been occasionally
 'applied to prevent anticipated government criticism before
 foreign audiences. This practice does not appear to be
 widespread.
 
 
 466
 ZIMBABWE
 Immigration is not restricted, although persons who have left
 the country are not guaranteed the right to return if they were
 not born in Zimbabwe. Applicants must be able to demonstrate
 proof of livelihood. Some repatriates from South Africa are
 suspected by the Government of being in the employment of The
 South African intelligence services.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), at the end of 1991 the registered refugee population
 was estimated at 100,000; 97,000 were Mozambicans located in
 five rural camps along the eastern border. The remainder,
 mainly South Africans, were located in Harare and Bulawayo. In
 a change from past practices, the Government has permitted
 UNHCR officials unrestricted access to Mozambican refugee
 camps. Another 100,000 Mozambicans, many of them migrant
 farmers, are self-settled in rural areas in the east. In 1991
 some Mozambican males of military age were reportedly turned
 over to the Government of Mozambique, which pressed them into
 compulsory military service. Men in this age group are now
 being relocated into the official camps.
 Senior government officials have said publicly that RENAMO
 guerrillas infiltrate Zimbabwe in the guise of these Mozambican
 refugees and have declared their intention to repatriate most
 of them. In 1991 Zimbabwe sought to keep sections of its
 border closed to new refugees, thus seriously constricting the
 right of asylum. Firm figures are not available, but in 1991
 an estimated 2,000 refugees were forcibly-repatriated to
 Mozambique. Mozambicans intercepted at the border are first
 interviewed by security forces to identify RENAMO sympathizers;
 neither the Zimbabwe Refugee Committee officials nor the UNHCR
 participates in the initial screening process.
 In 1991 Zimbabwe refused to grant refugee status to several
 former African National Congress and Pan-Africanist Congress
 members because they were suspected of being South African
 agents, forcing them to seek refuge in other countries. The
 Government also refused to grant refugee status to a member of
 the Swazi-based People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO),
 who had publicly criticized the Swazi monarchy.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Citizens have the legal right to change their government
 through democratic means, but the March 1990 elections called
 into question their ability to exercise that right. In those
 elections, 274 candidates from 5 parties and 11 independent
 candidates were duly nominated for the 120 contestable seats.
 As a consequence of the ZANU-ZAPU unity agreement and the
 ruling party's capture of 117 of these seats, there is no
 effective parliamentary opposition. However, 1991 saw
 increasingly frequent challenges to the Government by ZANU-PF
 backbenchers, creation of a new opposition party, and more
 critical media coverage of public issues and government
 leadership.
 President Mugabe and his Cabinet are the preeminent political
 figures, and the ruling party--ZANU-PF--is the dominant
 political organization in the country. Following the amendment
 of the Constitution in 1987 to create a strong executive
 presidency, Robert Mugabe, who previously served as Prime
 Minister,- became in 1988 both the Head of State and the Head of
 Government. Elected in 1987 by an electoral college made up of
 the two houses of Parliament, the executive president was
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 selected by popular election in 1990 to a term of 6 years. The
 President appoints both Vice Presidents and the rest of the
 Cabinet, who serve at his pleasure.
 Under an earlier constitutional amendment (number 9) the
 bicameral Parliament, which included a House of Assembly and a
 Senate, was changed in 1990 to a unicameral body, the
 Parliament of Zimbabwe. The small but vigorous group of
 backbenchers in the Parliament has confronted the Government on
 a number of issues, in particular the 1990 debate on a
 one-party state, manipulation of the media, the reintroduction
 of school fees, investment, resettlement, and unemployment.
 Their comments have received extensive coverage in both the
 government-influenced and the independent press.
 The net result of several constitutional amendments has been
 the concentration of power in the executive branch of
 government, The ability of Members of Parliament (M.P.) to
 debate freely and openly is also affected by the amendments.
 If a Member of Parliament "crosses the floor," e-g., changes
 his party allegiance, or is declared by his party to have
 ceased to represent its interests in Parliament by being
 critical of its policies, or is expelled 'from that party,
 perhaps for activities totally unrelated to performance as a
 parliamentarian, such an M.P. immediately loses his seat and a
 by-election has to be held. This provision makes M.P.'s more
 submissive to the party line and tends to reduce Parliament to
 a mere rubber stamp of party policies.
 Although the polling itself appeared free and fair, there were
 serious irregularities in the 1991 election campaign for the
 national city council, which affected the.outcome. Harare Town
 Clerk Edward Kanengoni was at the center of the controversy
 surrounding nomination procedures and the voting roll. Both
 ZUM and independent candidates accused Kanengoni of denying
 them free access to nomination forms, of intimidating persons
 who nominated opposition candidates, and of general
 administrative malfeasance. Nevertheless, independent and ZUM
 candidates won 6 of the 25 contested seats in the Harare city
 council elections.
 In rural areas, only homeowners may vote in council elections.
 Farmworkers, who predominate in the areas, do not have the
 right to vote in these local elections, ensuring that
 commercial farmers, overwhelmingly white, are elected to
 represent them in rural councils. In metropolitan-areas, save
 Bulawayo, a similar situation exists. In the wealthy suburbs,
 only homeowners may vote, but in the high density areas renters
 are accorded the right to vote in city council elections.
 Wealthy areas aie accorded one council representative per 3,000
 voters, while high density districts have one council person
 per 8,000 voters. The Minister of Local Government has the
 right to change the regulations concerning voting rights in
 council elections but has not chosen to exercise his power, and
 the opposition parties have not challenged these voting
 regulations in the courts, although the Zimbabwean Constitution
 provides for one person, one vote.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude RegardinT International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permits private local human rights groups to
 operate in Zimbabwe. However, it monitors their activities, in
 particular those of the CCJP which investigates complaints from
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 private persons about human rights abuses in Zimbabwe and
 conveys its findings to the Government. Other groups which
 promote human rights include the Central and Southern African
 Legal Assistance Foundation (CASALAF), the Southern African
 Human Rights Foundation (SAHRF), and the Harare-based Legal
 Resources Foundation which oversees the operation of the
 Bulavdyo, Gweru, and Masvingo Legal Projects Centers with their
 libraries and information centers, legal aid clinics, and
 paralegal programs.
 The Government has been critical of nongovernmental
 organizations, e.g., Amnesty International is still not
 permitted to operate in Zimbabwe, although Africa Watch's
 executive director was permitted to visit Zimbabwe in October.
 In January the police attempted to prevent SAHRF from holding
 its inaugural conference. The police banned the conference,
 seized the passports of SAHRF members, and pressured St.
 Edward's Catholic Church into withdrawing permission to use its
 ball as the site of the conference. SAHRF sought an injunction
 and was permitted to hold a conference in February.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRCI operates a
 regional office in Harare and cooperates with the^UNHCR to
 assist Mozambican, South African, and other refugees.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government services in Zimbabwe are provided on a
 nondiscriminatory basis, and the Government has been able to
 work-with the previously "whites only" infrastructure in urban
 areasto provide health and social services to all citizens.
 In many rural areas, however, the neglect of the
 preindependence period still leaves the Government struggling
 to provide minimal care. Blacks on most commercial farms are
 still mainly dependent on white farmers to meet basic health
 care and educati6nal needs.
 In social terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified country
 despite legal prohibitions against official discrimination.
 While schools, churches, and clubs are all integrated, there is
 limited but increasing social interaction among racial groups.
 The colored (mixed race) community has complained of
 discrimination in the allocation of civil service jobs and in
 the purchase of government-controlled housing, which are
 exclusively reserved for blacks by the Harare City Council.
 There are, however, two colored (mixed race) ministerial-level
 appointees.
 The actual status of women in Zimbabwe contrasts with their
 legal status. Since independence the Government has enacted
 major laws aimed at.enhancing women's rights-and countering
 certain traditional practices, some of which are based on the
 view of women as~dependents or minors. For example, the Legal
 Age ofUMhjority Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act recognize
 the capacity of women to act independently of their husbands or
 fathers to own property. Judges on the high courts have
 adjudicated cases upholding women's rights, including the right
 of women to inherit property. In 1991 the Women in Law and
 Development Africa-Zimbabwe office mounted a national campaign
 to gain inheritance rights for women.
 Nevertheless, many women remain disadvantaged in Zimbabwean
 society. Ignorance of reforms, illiteracy, economic
 dependency, and prevailing social norms prevent rural women in
 
 
 469
 ZIMBABWE
 particular from benefiting equally from these changes. Despite
 legal prohibitions, women are still vulnerable to entrenched
 customary practices that operate against their personal rights.
 Among these persistent practices are "kuzvarira," the practice
 of pledging a young woman to marriage with a partner not of her
 choosing; "lobola," the customary obligation of a groom to pay
 a bride price to the parents of a would-be wife; and "ngozi,"
 the customary practice of offering a young girl as compensatory
 payment in interfamily disputes.
 The Zimbabwean Marriage Guidance Society has described lobo-la
 as the biggest obstacle to the establishment of equality
 between men and women as the practice implies, "I paid for you,
 so we cannot be equal." Lobola has become a commercial venture
 as many parents, mostly fathers, charge huge sums of money for
 their daughters. In July the Child Protection Society issued a
 report which stated that the prevalence of ngozi beliefs among
 Zimbabweans remains high and that women are deliberately
 exploited and regarded as units, not only of production and
 reproduction but also as currency that can be a medium as
 circumstances demand.
 A considerable expansion of the nation's education system has
 resulted in an increase in the absolute number of girls being
 educated but has not altered the pattern of.male domination of
 the higher levels of education. Though legislation prohibits
 discrimination in employment on the basis of gender, women are
 concentrated in the lower echelons of the work force and in
 urban areas.face harassment in the workplace. Fear of losing
 employment'prevents women from reporting sexual harassment at
 work. Nongovernmental organizations have spoken out against
 the public harassment of women, especially the police "cleanup",
 campaigns aimed'at stopping prostitution but which target
 innocent women as well-
 Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is
 common and crosses all racial and economic lines in Zimbabwe.
 Consequently, several social welfare organizations, including
 the Harare-based Musasa Project, have organized counseling and
 research programs aimed at stemming violence against women.
 Women's rights activists have noted that every police station
 in Zimbabwe has handled at least one case of a woman killed by
 her husband, and one rural police station reported 76 deaths of
 women killed.by husbands in the past a years. Minister of
 Community and Cooperative Affairs Mujuru said, "I have yet to
 come across anyone who does not know of a relative, friend, or
 neighbor who has been battered."
 The number of reported rape cases has increased substantially.
 The most recent police figures show that, during 1990, 2,643
 reports of rape were made to the police countrywide, with the
 majority involving girls under 14. According to a newspaper
 editorial, the actual figure is 20 times greater than the
 officially recorded statistics. A Bulawayo magistrate
 disclosed he was dealing with an average of five rape cases per
 week involving subteenage girls, and the Government is
 considering increasing the power of magistrates to sentence
 rapists to more than the current maximum of 7 years. The
 Women's Action Group has urged police to improve their services
 by giving women a full explanation of court procedures and
 possible defense attorney tactics before they appear in court.
 The Government has assigned community relations liaison
 officers to police precincts to counsel victims of sexual
 assault.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Labor Relations Act states that workers shall have freedom
 of association, the right to elect their own representatives,
 publish.newsletters, and set programs and policies which
 reflect the political and economic interests of labor. Workers
 are free to form or join unions without prior authorization,
 but the Government may refuse to register them. The Act
 permits only one union per industry (although the Government
 registered a second railway union in 1991) and specifies that
 workers may establish workers' committees, which exist side by.
 side with unions, in each plant. The Act specifies further
 that workers' committees and trade unions must be registered
 with the Ministry of Labor, but it also seeks to protect
 workers' organizations from arbitrary government interference.
 The-Zimbabwe High Court ruled in 1991 that the Act does not
 give the Labor Minister the power to suspend or deregister the
 national labor center, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
 (ZCTU). In practice, the Government does not try to inhibit
 the unions' freedom to organize or to elect officers, nor has
 any union been threatened with deregistration as a disciplinary
 measure.
 About 17 percent of the salaried work force is organized in 22
 trade unions which are members of the ZCTU, the umbrella
 confederation of the trade union movement. ZCTU officers are
 elected bythe delegates of affiliated trade unions at biennial
 conventions, most recently in September 1990. While the ZCTU
 was created by the Government shortly after independence to
 unite the fragmented unions that previously existed, neither
 the Government nor any political party has a preponderant
 influence in the trade union movement today. The ZCTU and the
 Government frequently clash on economic and political issues.
 The ZCTU is the only legal trade union central. Others are
 prohibited in practice. However, employee associations, such
 as the public service association, are not affiliated with the
 ZCTU.. Most trade unions suffer from-meager budgets which
 prevent them from conducting a greater range of organizing and-
 educational activities.
 Workers have the right to strike provided the union advises the
 Government 2 weeks in advance of its intention to do so. Until
 the lifting of the state of emergency in 1990, the right to
 strike was further limited by the right of the Government to
 declare a specific industry to be essential and therefore not
 subject to strike action. In practice, the Government employed
 a broad interpretation of what constitutes essential industries.
 In July air traffic controllers staged a 5-day work stoppage,
 demanding higher pay and better working cbnditions. The action
 was a follow-up to a similar strike in 1990 when the Government
 promised various allowances which were never received. The
 Government promised to award these allowances by September 1991
 but had not done so by year's end. Posts and
 Telecommunications employees engaged in a 1-day strike in
 November. Disputes over wages and conditions of service
 resulted in slowdowns in various industries in January,
 September, October, and November.
 The ZCTU and its officials are free to associate with
 international labor organizations and do so actively. The most
 notable example during the year was the ZCTU's affiliation to
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Labor Relations Act provides workers with the right to
 organize but is silent on the right to bargain collectively.
 Workers' committees are empowered to negotiate with the
 management of a particular plant the conditions of labor in the
 workplace. Wage negotiations take place on an industrywide
 basis. In the case of a union-organized industry, the
 employers' association meets directly with a particular trade
 union. In certain cases when there is no trade union
 representing a specific industry, representatives of the
 organized workers, i.e., the professional associations, meet
 with the employers' association under the mediation of labor
 officers from the Ministry of Labor.
 As part of its economic recovery program, the Government
 announced in 1990 the commencement of free collective
 bargaining between workers and employers. It pledged to
 withdraw from the practice of using Ministry of Labor-appointed
 employment boards to recommend conditions of service and wage
 structures. Starting in 1990, boards were chosen by the
 employers and the unions to negotiate for wages and salary
 increments. The Government announced that in the future the
 Ministry's role in collective bargaining is only to monitor,
 vet, and register agreements. Registration can include
 rejection of agreements of which the Government does not
 approve. In 1991 the Government rejected agreements with the
 Municipal Workers and the Posts and Telecommunications Workers,
 all of whom are government employees. In 1991, for the first
 time, the Government did not set a minimum across-the-board
 wage increase for all workers, and wage agreements were reached
 in employment councils and boards without any parameters set by
 the Government, other than the statutory minimum rates which
 were well below the prevailing rates.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited-by law and regulation.
 In fact, the Government believes it is responsible for
 assisting workers with legislation and intervention with
 employers. The Labor Relations Act provides considerable job
 security for workers. For example, under the Act, a worker may
 not be fired without the- Labor Ministry's concurrence. Labor
 relations officers are authorized to handle worker grievances
 within the plant. Their decision may be appealed to the
 regional hearing officer of the Ministry of Labor, and finally
 to a special labor relations tribunal over which a judge from
 the Supreme Court or High Court presides.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is prohibited by law and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor regulations stipulate the minimum age for employment
 in the formal sector at 18 years, but it is possible to begin
 an apprenticeship at age 16. In this sector, minimum age
 regulations are generally enforced by the Ministry of Labor.
 However, the Government does not attempt to enforce these
 regulations for children employed in household enterprises,
 such as family farms. In 1991 there were credible newspaper
 reports that preadolescent children were being employed in
 increasing numbers as domestics ard were being paid a monthly
 average wage of half the minimum wage for adult domestics.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Conditions of labor are regulated by the Government according
 to industry. The Government publishes labor regulations for
 each of the 22 industrial sectors. These regulations specify
 minimum wages, hours, holidays, and required safety measures.
 In 1991 the Government specified minimum wage increases only
 for domestics and gardeners, but due to an ineffective
 monitoring system many such workers are remunerated below'the
 minimum wage. The maximum legal workweek is 54 hours, and the
 law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest period per week.
 The employer also dsually provides housing, food, and medical
 care tQ workers, On commercial farms, the employer may provide
 schoqling for the workers' children. The minimum wage is not
 generally sufficient to sustain a decent standard of living.
 In many instances, workers must rely on second jobs, extended
 family help,. or some subsistence farming to meet a minimum
 standard of living.
 iLibor relations officers from the Ministry of Labor are
 assigned to monitor developments in each plant to ensure that
 government minimum wage policy and occupational health and
 safety regulations are observed. Safety in the workplace is a
 majoroproblem, hQwever, due primarily to the fact that there
 are too few inspectors and that many of the basic legal
 protections do not apply to the vast majority pf the farm,
 mine, and~domestia workers.
