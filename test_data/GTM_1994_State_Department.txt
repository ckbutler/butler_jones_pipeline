 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala's 1985 Constitution calls for election by universal suffrage of a one-
 term President and a unicameral Congress. It also mandates an independent judici-
 ary and a Human Rights Ombudsman, who is elected by and reports to the Con-
 gress. On June 5, 1993, Congress elected then Human Rights Ombudsman Ramiro
 DeLeon Carpio to finish the presidential term of Jorge Serrano, who had been con-
 stitutionally deposed from office following his attempt to seize full power. President
 De Leon launched an anticorruption campaign that led to a political confrontation
 with the legislature and Supreme Court, both widely seen as corrupt. This con-
 frontation was finally resolved with a January 30 referendum on constitutional
 changes, which led to new congressional elections in August and the October re-
 placement of the Supreme Court.
 The armed forces operate with considerable institutional and legal autonomy, par-
 ticularly in security and military matters. With the entry into force of the new
 Criminal Procedures Code, military personnel accused of committing common crimes
 are subject to trial in civilian courts. The 43,000-man army, which has responsibility
 for national security, has fought a leftist insurgency for more than three decades.
 The Minister of Government oversees the National Police and the Treasury Police,
 which share responsibility for internal security with the army. In March President
 De Leon appointed the then head of army intelligence as Vice Minister of Govern-
 ment, reversing a trend he began upon taking office of removing military personnel
 from civilian law enforcement positions, but he removed him at the end of the year.
 The Government announced the establishment of a civilian intelligence service, in-
 tended to diminish presidential reliance on military intelligence.
 An estimated 430,000 men serve in civil self-defense committees called Civil De-
 fense Patrols (PAC's), some of which conduct counterinsurgency patrols in rural
 areas. Although these are ostensibly voluntary, the Human Rights Ombudsman and
 the Catholic Archbishop's human rights office reported that in some regions PAC
 members were compelled to join the patrols, in violation of the Constitution. Secu-
 rity forces and especially PAC's and civilian military commissioners--who are the
 intermediaries between the PAC's and the armed forces--committed numerous seri-
 ous human rights violations.
 The Government and the leftist Guatemala National Revolutionary Unity (URNG)
 insurgents resumed peace talks in January and reached a human rights accord in
 March. Many human rights monitors criticized the Government for being lax in ful-
 filling its commitments under the March accord. The agreement, which took force
 immediately, led to the November introduction of a U.N. human rights verification
 mission into Guatemala. At year's end, peace negotiations were continuing.
 The agriculture-based, private sector-oriented economy was projected to grow by
 approximately 4 percent in real terms in 1994, which would produce an increase in
 9 r capita income of about 1 percent. Inflation was expected to exceed 10 percent.
 ere is a marked disparity in income distribution, and poverty is pervasive, par-
 ticularly in the large indigenous community.
 Both government authorities and guerrilla groups committed serious human
 rights abuses during the year. While human rights activists now have greater free-
 dom to report, comment, and denounce abuses, statistics prepared by the Arch-
 bishop's human rights office, utilizing media reports and interviews with victims,
 show a substantial increase in human rights violations, especially extrajudicial
 killings. The Ombudsman's office, which compiles data based on personal interviews
 with victims and their families, noted that reports of human rights complaints in-
 creased from 1993. PAC's, military commissioners, members of the army, police, and
 guerrillas, as well as leftwing and rightwing extremist groups, all committed major
 violations, including extrajudicial killings, political kidnapings, death threats, and
 forced recruitment. Political killings, for example, continued at an alarming rate,
 and the Government failed to investigate them adequately or to bring perpetrators
 to justice. Government forces and unknown perpetrators increased attacks on labor
 union leaders and members, involving killings, death threats, physical abuse, and
 other forms of mistreatment and harassment. Guerrilla abuses included kidnapings,
 the widespread use of mines and explosives in civilian areas, forced recruitment of
 children, and reprisal attacks against persons who refused to pay extortion. Both
 legal and societal discrimination against women continued, as did societal abuse of
 children and discrimination against indigenous peoples.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Politically motivated killings contin-
 ued and, due to the lack of political will and law enforcement resources, with few
 exceptions the Government failed to investigate them fully or to detain or prosecute
 the perpetrators. Individual members of the security forces (military, PAC's, mili-
 tary commissioners, and the police), leftist 8uerrilla and righ~twing extremist groups
 were responsible for political and extrajudicial killings. The Human Rights Ombuds-
 man's office listed 287 cases of possible extrajudicial killings. The Archbishop's
 human rights office reported 355 extrajudicial killings in 1994, compared with 248
 in 1993 and 204 in 1992. The Church office labeled 42 of the extrajudicial killings
 as definitely political and 237 as presumed political. Neither human rights office
 broke down the figures according to the organization believed to be responsible, but
 beth gvernent security forces and leftist guerrilla forces committed such offenses.
 PAC leaders and military commissioners are feared in many rural communities.
 They enjoy army backing and, often, de facto immunity from prosecution. The Arch-
 bishop's human rights office reported that the executive branch failed to carry out
 arrest warrants against 24 military commissioners and PAC members for their in-
 volvement in human rights crimes. With the exception of the arrest of a few PAC
 members accused of involvement in the 1993 Jorge Carpio murder, the authorities
 rarely held PAC members accountable for their crimes.
 Despite being aware of the locations of various PAC members wanted for involve-
 ment in the 1993 Colotenan~o killing of Juan Chonay Pablo and the 1993 Quiche
 killing of Tomas Lares Cipriano, the Government failed to carry out the majority
 of the arrest warrants. In the Juan Chonay Pablo killing, which occurred during an
 anti-PAC demonstration, the authorities issued 15 arrest warrants for PAC mem-
 bers but arrested only 2 persons. They released one for insufficient evidence linking
 him to the crime; the Public Ministry requested the release of the other under per-
 sonal bond. Three more persons turned themselves in, but the authorities released
 two of them for lack of evidence. At the end of the year, no one was in jail awaiting
 trial. In March the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) re-
 quested that the Government take precautionary measures to protect witnesses and
 victims' family members. In July based on new evidence of continuing harassment
 of these individuals, the IACHR requested the Inter-American Court of Human
 Rights to order the Government to take additional precautionary measures and to
 dissolve the local PAC. The Court accepted the request in November and ordered
 the Government to take these additional measures, which the Government agreed
 to do. However, the Court did net agree to order the Government to dissolve the
 PAC's.
 In the Lares Cipriano killing, the authorities charged six PAC members with mur-
 dering him after he resigned from their patrol. The authorities arrested two persons,
 later released under personal bonds, dismissed all charges against another person
 who turned himself in, and did not carry out arrest warrants against the remaining
 three persons.
 On May 31, a joint military-police operation arrested four San Pedro Jocopilas
 PAC members and military commissioners wanted for alleged involvement in the
 July 1993 murder of newspaper publisher and former presidential candidate Jorge
 Carpio. However, judicial authorities later released all four, citing insufficient evi-
 dence tying them to the crime. The Carpio family appealed the release and criticized
 the Government for failure to carry out the arrest warrants for six other PAC mem-
 bers wanted in this case. On June 26, unknown perpetrators killed a PAC member
 accused of having participated in this matter. On September 7, three other PAC
 members and    nitary commissioners wanted by the authorities turned themselves
 in. On October 12, the Quiche Department Police Chief, who had ordered the cap-
 ture of four PAC members, was murdered.
 On December 5, attorneys presented their closing arguments in the Jorge Carpio
 murder trial. Only one jailed defendant and two other defendants currently on bend
 were present for the hearing. Both sides will have an opportunity to present new
 evidence prior to the trial court's decision. Members of Carpio's family have been
 threatened since his death. On June 25, unknown armed persons rammed Karen
 Fischer de Carpio's car, when they determined she was not in the car, they left
 death threats against Fischer with her driver. Fischer subsequently left Guatemala
 with her children for the United States where she remained for several weeks. Arer
 returning to Guatemala, Fischer met with the then Vice Minister of Government,
 a military officer and formerly the director of military intelligence, whom she later
 claimed had threatened her if her family did not desist from assertions that senior
 military officers were behind the Carp o murder.
 
 
 The Archbishop's human rights office reported that army personnel or former PAC
 members killed retired army officer Lieutenant Diaz on June 20. The killers, who
 apparently had participated with Diaz in the 1981-82 Rabinal massacres, allegedly
 rmurdered Diaz to prevent him from publicly commenting or testifying on the mas-
 sacres. The Church office asserted that the deaths of two other Rabinal residents,
 a military commissioner and the son of the landowner where exhumations were tak-
 ing place, were orchestrated to send a message to the Rabinal community to remain
 silent. There are credible reports by the media and the Archbishop's human right's
 office that in July the army conducted house-to-house inspections and interrogations
 in the community and told male residents in a community meeting not to partici-
 pate in the exhumations. While not admitting these events took place, the authori-
 ties transferred the senior officer who allegedly called the meeting.
 On April 1, Constitutional Court president Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon was
 killed while returning from Holy Week religious processions; the motive behind the
 crime remains undetermined. Initially, many believed that the murder was an in-
 timidation attempt by those wishing to destabilize the De Leon administration or
 a reprisal directed at the judge for his anti-Serrano role in May 1993. On April 26,
 the Government announced the arrest of 12 persons, members of an alleged car
 theft ring, 4 of whom were said to have participated in the shooting. Only two re-
 main in jail awaiting trial; the authorities released the others due to insufficient
 evidence.
 On November 11, during a University of San Carlos student demonstration
 against an increase in national bus fares, student activist Mario Sanchez Lopez was
 killed after police pursued demonstrators onto the barricaded university grounds in
 response to student-made Molotov cocktails and shots fired from the interior of the
 university. According to the government autopsy, Lopez died of gunshot wounds
 from unknown assailants. However, credible eyewitnesses' reports and photographs
 also detail the police beating Lopez. These eyewitnesses also reported that
 nonstudents had provoked the confrontation with the police. Soon afterward, the
 Prosecutor Goneral called for the courts to carry out arrest warrants for the police
 officers who participated in the disturbance. However, the trial judge sent the case
 back to the prosecutor's office requesting more information.
 Unknown persons have also targeted journalists for killing and acts of violence
 (see Section 2.a.).
 On August 24, police killed 2 persons and wounded 11 when they used excessive
 force to dislodge striking workers from a ranch known as "La Exacta" in
 Coatepeque. A third person allegedly disappeared; his body was found some distance
 from the ranch the following day. The woikers had taken over the ranch in an at-
 tempt to pressure their supervisors to comply with a labor court order that the em-
 ployers obey labor laws, pay workers the minimum wage and overtime, as well as
 grant vacation, sick leave, and other mandatory bonuses. Rather than comply, the
 owners reportedly fired approximately 79 employees. After initially saying the police
 had acted in accordance with the law, President De Leon later expressed his regret
 for the tragedy, saying he had misspoken earlier based on preliminary police reports
 and that a full investigation would be made. On September 15, residents found the
 body of another peasant who had participated in the strike. The Archbishop's
 human rights office reported that this person was kidnaped and then killed in re-
 prisal for his participation in the strike. Initially, 23 police officers were brought be-
 fore the court but were later released pending investigation. To prevent possible re-
 taliation against the workers, the judge also ordered that the police stay away from
 the ranch.
 The Archbishop's human rights office said the URNG's "united front" was respon-
 sible for the early September murder of army reserve junior officer Amarildo Sanan
 Hernandez in Cbimaltenango. Guerrillas stopped Sanan, who was dressed in civil-
 ian clothes, at a roadblock, where he drew a revolver to defend himself. A guerrilla
 shot Sanan in the leg, he then attempted to crawl away, but the guerrillas fired at
 him again, immobilizing him. As Sanan lay unable to move, the guerrillas searched
 him and discovered a military leave document, whereupon they struck him with
 fatal machete blows across the face and neck.
 There was some progress in certain past high-profile cases. On February 8, the
 Supreme Court confirmed the 25-year sentence given to former government security
 agent Noel De Jesus Beteta for the 1990 killing of Myrna Mack.-The Court left legal
 proceedings open against the alleged intellectual authors of the crime, former senior
 military officers who appealed the decision to the Constitutional Court. In December
 the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of Helen Mack, Myrna's sister, that the case
 against the intellectual authors may proceed. However, it failed to overrule a Su-
 preme Court decision denying her request that it order the release of executive
 
 
 405
 branch documents concerning her sister's murder. The executive branch maintained
 it did not have any files not already in the hands of the court.
 On May 18, the court of appeals confirmed the 2-year suspended sentence and $40
 fine against the corporal whose absence from post facilitated the May 1993 escape
 of Captain Hugo Contreras, who had just been convicted and sentenced to 20 years
 in prison for killing US. citizen Michael Devine in 1990. Captain Contreras remains
 a fugitive. On September 6, the Supreme Court confirmed the 30-year sentence
 given the five enlisted men convicted in the Devine murder. However, the Govern-
 ment never brought to trial the senior officers believed to be involved in coveri
 up the crime. Two relatives of witnesses who testified at the Devine trial (one civil-
 ian and one soldier) were killed- another (a soldier) was shot in the leg under sus-
 picious circumstances. The dead soldier was found with his tongue cut out, hands
 mutilated, and a bullet wound in his skull Additionally, two other relatives have
 been targets of intimidation.
 The Brake family, who in 1993 fied a petition with the IACHR accusing the Gov-
 ernment of institutional responsibility for and coverup of the 1985 abduction and
 murder of U.S. citizens Nicholas Blake and Griffith Davis by PAC members, contin-
 ued to pursue their case. In December 1993, a Blake relative met with President
 De Leon and sought unsuccessfully a settlement in lieu of petitioning the IACHR.
 On March 18 and August 22, the Constitutional Court dismissed appeals fied by
 21 former "Hunapu" anticrime task force police officers over their lengthy (more
 than 20 years) prison sentences, which had been previously confirmed by the Su-
 reme Court. The officers had been found guilty in the 1992 death of university stu-
 dent Julio Rigoberto Cu Quir and injury to six other students. The case remains
 under Supreme Court review.
 The IACHR reported that, on September 11, a leading witness and survivor of the
 1988 "white van7 case, Oscar Vasquez, was killed along with his son. In this case,
 which remains before the Commission, Treasury Police personnel are accused of
 having kidnaped, tortured, and assassinated civilians in 1988. During a subsequent
 investigation, a judge involved in the case was abducted and his assistant killed.
 There was no progress in resolving numerous other outstanding extrajudicial
 killings, including the 1989 disappearances and murders of university students, the
 1990 Hector Oqueli Colindres and Gilda Flores killings, the 1990 disappearance of
 Maria Tiu Tojin and her daughter, the 1991 murder of police detective Jose Luis
 Merida Escobar, the 1991 disappearance of Diego Domingo Martin, the 1992 kidnap-
 ing, torture, and murder of H ehen         easant Lcas Perez Tadeo, the 1993
 shooting of street children Henry Yubani  varez and Francisco Tziac, the 1993
 shooting of student jrotester Abner Abdiel Hernandez Orellan  or past kidnapings
 and murders of varous members of the Runujel Junam Council of Ethnic Commu-
 nities (CERJ), a rural-based human rights organization. The Government's frequent
 inability to deter, prosecute, or punish those responsible for such offenses is a major
 impediment to human rights progress.
 b. Disappearance.-The Archbi hop's human rights office reported 41 forced dis-
 appearances, as compared with 45 in 1993. It labeled 1 disappearance definitely po-
 litical and classified 32 as presumed political. Victims included a human rights ac-
 tivist, union employees, private sector employees, entrepreneurs, farmers, a soldier
 a policeman, and others. The Ombudsman's office received 60 complaints of forced
 disappearance. The Government did not identify' or prosecute the perpetrators of
 any af these disappearances.
 Sister Dianna Ortiz returned to Guatemala in January and again in November
 to press authorities to take action on her 1989 kidnaping and torture case. In Janu-
 ary she accompanied Guatemalan officials on judicia inspections of the Guardia De
 Honor barracks and the old military academy. Ortiz identified the latter as the
 place where she was sexually abused and tortured. Shortly after entering the facil-
 ity, Ortiz was overcome by emotion and unable to identf  the specific site of the
 violations, which she says occurred in the basement of the facility. However, the in-
 spection team failed to discover any subterranean levels. The army maintains none
 ever existed. A previously filed petition on this case remained pending before the
 IACHR at year's end.
 On January 12, Lorenzo Quiej Pu, a member of CONDEG, an organization dedi-
 cated to helping Guatemalans who have been internally displaced due to the armed
 conflict, disappeared after leaving his home. Members of CONDEG and Quiej family
 members reported that prior to the disappearance, they had received threats stem-
 ming from the organization's occupation of privately owned land. The authorities
 charged no one with this disappearance.
 The whereabouts remain unknown of San Marcos PAC members Margarito Lopez
 and Obdulio Zapeta, army enlisted man Diego Chel Matom, and farmers Ramona
 Munoz and Maritza Gil who were allegedly kidnaped in 1993 by guerrillas. Reliable
 
 
 406
 reports link the guerrillas to various kidnaping for profit, including that of wealthy
 industrialist Fraterno Vila.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Derading' Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the inte grity an security of the person. However, as
 in past years, many bodies were found throughout the country-bearing signs of se-
 vere disi rement or post mortem mutilation. The Human Rights Ombudsman's of-
 fice listed 18 potential cases of torture in 1994. The Archbishop's human rights of.
 fice listed 17 cases of torture, compared with 18 cases in 1993. In a typical case,
 unknown armed men kidnaped a law student in January after he left work, then
 beat him, burned him with cigarettes, and left him unconscious.
 There were credible reports of mistreatment by security forces, including sexual
 abuse of minors and adults, and use of excessive force by police at the time of arrest.
 Additional Arerts indicated that, especially in rural areas, the URNG guerrillas
 the army, c     defese patrols, military commissioners and the police at times usea
 excessive force against the civilian population. CER reported that Juan Osorio
 Vasquez filed a legal complaint alleging that on July 21, PAC members had accused
 him of being a guerrilla, kidnaped him, tied a rope to his neck, hung him from a
 beam, and left him for dead. Family members later arrived and rescued Osorio.
 Some peasants in areas of conflict around Huehuetenang have alleged to the
 army that members of "Comite De Unidad Campesino," a farm workers organiza-
 tion composed of indigenous people, have threatened them with death due to their
 allegiance to the army.
 Casa Alianza, an organization dedicated to assisting street children, reported five
 instances in which National Police abused street children between January and late
 December. On March 3, Casa Alianza filed charges against four police officers ac-
 cused of inducing street children to steal for them. The police never formally
 charged the accused and instead transferred them to another part of Guatemala
 City. On July 14, the National Police referred a case of police abuse against a minor
 to the courts after concluding that five policemen had abused their authority in the
 March 4 beating of Luis Antonio Roldan Izeppi. Casa Alianza also filed charges
 against the National Police for an August 15 incident in which three policemen
 sprayed pait thinner at the face of sleeping street child Luis Alfredo Bonilla
 Juarez. On December 11, three National Police officers chased six street children,
 who were attempting to steal another street child's shoes, to Casa Alianza offices.
 The police caught up with four children at the door step, beat them, and arrested
 one child. There were numerous other reports of policemen illegally detaining street
 children; the authorities rarely took action in any of these incidents.
 Casa Alianza also reported that private security guards routinely abuse street
 children and that this abuse has led to the death of seven children. While a number
 of cases of national and private police abuse remain pending, there have been no
 successful convictions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal safeguards, there were fre-
 quent credible reports of arbitrary arrest by the security forces, incommunicado de-
 tention, and failure to adhere to the prescribed time limits for legal procedures. The
 law requires a court-issued arrest warrant unless a person is caught in the act of
 committing a crime. Police ma not detain a suspect or over 6 hours without bring-
 ing the case before a judge. The law provides for bail and access to lawyers. The
 authorities arrested 17,823 persons in 1994; of those, 3,872 persons remain in jail
 awaiting trial, which represented 71 percent of the total prison population.
 The security forces routinely ignore writs of habeas corpus in cases of illegal de-
 tention. There are no reliable data on the number of arbitrary detentions. The Arch-
 bishop's human rights office charged that prisoners are sometimes not released in
 a timely fashion after completing their sentences due to the failure of judges to issue
 the necessary court order.
 The Constitution prohibits exile and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is ineffective and often unable
 to ensure a fair trial. However, defendants have the right to be present at trials
 and to legal representation. An appeals court automatically reviews convictions. The
 Constitution provides for an independent judiciary composed of a Constitutional
 Court, a Supreme Court, appeals courts, and several courts of special jurisdiction,
 such as labor courts. The Supreme Court appoints judges; the Congress appoints
 magistrates, or appellate court judges, from a list prepared by a selection committee
 composed of udges, lawyers, and university deans.
 The new Cri  al Procedures Code, which took effect on July 1, effects significant
 changes in the way criminal trials are conducted. These include new provisions for
 a public defender to provide legal counsel to the accused, especially important in the
 new oral trial setting. The new Code also modified the Military Code of Justice to
 extend jurisdiction by civilian courts over military personnel for offenses 'not essen-
 
 
 407
 tially military in nature. These reforms will be phased in once the Government
 drafts specific implementing rules or regulations. Prior to the Code's enactment,
 military courts retained jurisdiction over military personnel, including military com-
 missioners who commit crimes while on official business, thus limiting the ability
 of civil courts to prosecute persons under military control in human rights abuse
 cases. PAC members are civilians and are not under military jurisdiction.
 The following factors hampered the Code's implementation: A lack of funding for
 education, political differences between the executive and judicial branches, intran-
 sigence by many members of the criminal bar, constitutional challenges, and inad-
 equate preparation by law enforcement agencies. As of early December, only three
 oral trials had been conducted, as required under the new procedures. Meanwhile,
 the backlog of criminal cases continued to mount.
 Most human rights violations are not investigated; security force personnel are re-
 luctant to investigate cases potentially involving colleagues. Police are very poorly
 paid, relatively few in number, and lack adequate resources and training. Judges
 are susceptible to intimidation and corruption and suffer from low pay bad workin
 conditions, and low morale. Officials from the Archbishop's human rights office and
 the Human Rights Ombudsman's offices, including the Ombudsman himself, have
 received threats.
 There were public accusations that the Supreme Court pressures lower court
 judges to decide cases in line with its wishes. In 1993 the Constitutional Court ruled
 that the Supreme Court practice of arbitrarily transferring justices was unconstitu-
 tional, thereby limiting one means of Supreme Court interference in lower court
 cases.
 Members of the judiciary also continued to receive threats in an attempt to influ-
 ence decisions or as reprisals for past decisions. In February Judge Yolanda Perez
 received death threats after she appeared at a local army base with the local auxil-
 iary ombudsman for human rights requesting to see a serviceman reported to be
 missing. Cotzumalguapa justice of the peace Carlos Humberto Dardon Reyes re-
 ported receiving death threats after he sent U.S. citizen Melissa Larson to the
 Escuintla department court house for her protection in March, after a mob wrongly
 accused her of transporting baby organs in her backpack. In July third district ap-
 pellate court judge and judicial reform activist Maria Eugenia Villasenor reported
 she and other appellate magistrates had been harassed in attempts to influence de-
 cisions in high profile cases. (The third district court had issued rulings in a variety
 of cases involving the security forces.) On August 29, a policeman assigned to pro-
 tect Villasenor was kidnaped, interrogated, and assaulted. Following this incident,
 Villasenor left the country for a number of weeks.
 On January 19, unknown persons purposely set fire to the judicial records build-
 ing in Santa Cruz De Quiche, which held numerous files regarding PAC abuses.
 Quiche Judge Francisco Perez stated that just before the fire he received threats
 from Joyabaj PAC members attempting to persuade him to release two of its mem-
 bers charged with committing multiple crimes, including the deaths of numerous
 persons.
 Corruption continues to plague the proper functioning of the police force. On June
 25, a live grenade was tossed at the residence of anticorruption transit police chief
 Ernesto Ruiz Saenz De Tejada. Ruiz was not injured in this attack, but he resigned
 from the police force shortly afterward.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and private doc-
 uments, but the authorities do not always respect these provisions. Elements of the
 security forces continue to monitor private communications. Many human rights
 monitors reported receiving threats in the form of surveillance, telephone calls, and
 anonymous letters.
 On March 11, a year after an arrest warrant had been issued, Juan Jose Garcia
 Orellana a postal control officer charged with operating a mail espionage ring in
 the post office for the presidential security staff under the Serrano administraton,
 turned himself in to judicial authorities. The authorities are still gathering evidence
 in this case.
 Through July, officials enforcing the military draft continued to stop vehicles and
 enter homes and places of business without legally required court orders. Prior to
 August, under recruitment practices adopted in some departments, potential draft-
 ees receive three induction notices, after which they are arrested if they do not re-
 port for enlistment. Under the law, such arrests must be effected pursuant to a
 court order.
 On June 14, Amilcar Mendez, the founder of CERJ, filed a lawsuit against De-
 fense Minister Enriquez charging that the armed forces' forced recruitment practices
 
 
 408
 violated constitutional provisions regarding obligatory military service. However, a
 court ruled the * diial branch did not have jurisdiction over this matter because
 the Minister of Defense had immunity from prosecution, which only Congress could
 remove. It referred the immunity question to the Congress, which ruled that the
 case lacked legal merit, thus effectively dismissing the entire lawsuit.
 Through July 30, the Archbishop's human rights office handled 89 individual
 cases of forced recruitment. In the same period, the Human Rights Ombudsman's
 office reported receiving 663 complaints of forced recruitment. The office obtained
 the release of 268 persons from military service, of whom 79 were minors. On June
 29, Defense Minister General Enriquez announced a 6-nmnth moratorium on forced
 recruitment, which was confirmed by President De Leon during the June 30 Army
 Day celebrations. However, the Ombudsman reported three separate instances of
 forced conscription in July. On August 28, the Defense Ministry once again ordered
 a suspension of forced recruitment; since then, there were no further reports of
 forced recruitment. The army has continued the practice of setting up draft boards
 consisting of the zone military commander, the local representative of the Human
 Rights Ombudsman's office, and other civilian leaders.
 The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary. However, army officers,
 military commissioners, and PAC leaders often pressure men in areas of conflict to
 become members. Nevertheless, PAC's do appear to enjoy some popular support; a
 majority of respondents in a recent academic survey conducted for the Human
 Rights Ombudsman in seven departments claimed to be pleased with the PAC mem-
 bership and with the PAC presence in their communities. However, some human
 rights monitors have charged that PAC members may have felt intimidated by fel-
 low PAC members and did not give completely candid answers.
 In June and July, CERJ filed a legal complaint on behalf of former PAC member
 Juan Antonio Chumel with local judicial authorities and the IACHR stating that
 since 1988, when Chumel left the PAC's, PAC members threatened and intimidated
 Chumel to the extent that he was forced to leave his community for fear of his life.
 There are other credible reports that others who refused to serve in the PAC's suf-
 fered threats and other abuses.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Guatemala's armed internal conflict entered its 34th year and continued to
 be a major cause of human rights violations by both government and guerrilla
 forces.
 Communities of People in Resistance (CPR), groups of displaced persons who have
 lived in remote areas to avoid army control since the 1980 a, claimed army harass-
 ment throughout the year, including late evening helicopter overflights and restric-
 tion of commerce. Reflecting increased security in the valleys, in February, a num-
 ber of CPR's came down from the mountains and established permanent villages.
 According to statistics reported by the Archbishop's human rights office, repeated
 URNG attacks against civilian infrastructure targets damaged electrical and com-
 munication facilities and petroleum storage areas. The Church office reported two
 persons injured by exploding mines planted by guerrillas. On Aust 22, guerrillas
 fired indiscriminately at a civilian bus injuring 11 persons and klling 1 during an
 attack against army units in Chupol, Chichicastenango. On various occasions guer-
 rillas have also burned farms and destroyed property of farm owners who refused
 to pay extortion.
 Terrorist bombings conducted by unknown perpetrators continued throughout the
 year. Before the January 30 national referendum, 25 explosive devices detonated or
 were deactivated in Guatemala City alone. Several of these devices were accom-
 panied by URNG leaflets. Other bomb attacks were believed to be orchestrated by
 free-lancing rightist groups opposed to the referendum. On March 6 and 7 bombs
 exploded at two key bridges leading from the capital. The army and the UlNG ac-
 cused each other of planting the bombs. On September 1, two more pamphlet bombs
 exploded in the capital, releasing URNG literature. The home of a businessman and
 partial owner of the newsweekfy Cronica was bombed in June. (He is the brother
 of former peace talks conciliator and current president of the Civil Sedety Assembly,
 Bishop Rodolfo Quezada.) On September 22, three bombs went off in residential
 zones, killing one child who was watching cars in exchange for tips. On several occa-
 sions death threat lists, including the names of human rights and labor leaders and
 newspaper journalists, circulated, but no one listed was injured or killed.
 On August 12, a lower court judge dismissed the amnesty granted four recently
 captured URNG guerrillas. However, these guerrillas were freed under a Penal
 Code provision, a move considered legally controversial. It had been common govern-
 ment practice to excuse post-1988 crimes committed by guerrillas even though the
 Amnesty Law only applies to political and related crimes committed before 1988.
 
 
 409
 The Government appealed this decision and is considering new amnesty legislation
 to cover crimes committed after 1988. The URNG claims it holds no prisoners.
 The army continued to deny it has ever held guerrilla leader Efrain "Everardo
 Bamaca or 35 other URNG prisoners of war as claimed by the American citizen wife
 of Bamaca. According to army spokespersons, Bamaca was killed in battle. The Gov-
 ernment denies holding prisoners clandestinely. The Government also denies reports
 the U.S. Government received that the army took Efrain Bamaca captive in March
 1992. Those reports indicated he had been wounded but that his injuries were not
 life-threatening. The reports included no information to indicate that he was alive
 much beyond the first few weeks after his capture. The Guatemalan Government
 filed a writ of habeas corpus on Bamaca's behalf, and the Supreme Court assigned
 the Human Rights Ombudsman to conduct a special 30-day investigation into the
 disappearance.The Ombudsman developed no new leads and turned responsibility
 for the investigation back to the Attorney General. The United Nations Verification
 Mission, MINUGUA, is assisting in the investigation.
 In January the URNG and the Government resumed peace talks with the United
 Nations serving as moderator. In late March, the Government and the guerrillas
 signed a human rights accord that called for the immediate establishment of a U.N.
 human rights verification mission. Although the start-up of this international mis-
 sion was delayed until September, the accord was a major step forward. As part of
 its mandate, the U.N. team will seek to strengthen local institutions dealing with
 human rights. In November and December, MINUGUA accompanied Human Rights
 Ombudsman officials inspecting army bases, witnessing the turning in of rifles by
 PAC members and other-human rights-related activity. Also in March, the Govern-
 ment and the URNG agreed upon a calendar to address the major outstanding nego-
 tiating issues. In June the two sides signed accords on "uprooted" peoples and tie
 establishment of a Historical Clarification Commission to catalog and analyze
 human rights abuses related to the guerrilla war. However, the Commission will not
 name past violators, and its findings will not have judicial force. Following signing
 of this accord, talks fell into a temporary hiatus. They resumed in late October to
 discuss indigenous rights. No agreement was reached on this issue by the end of
 the yea
 th  UUA    reported that, on December 20, men identified by local residents as
 military commissioners and their assistants threatened MINUGUA officers and
 human rights activists during a meeting in Tecpan, Chimaltenango. During the
 meeting, one of the armed men grabbed activist Eliseo Calel and beat him. Calel
 had been pressing authorities to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the
 August 1 death of Chimaltenango activist Pascual Serech and the August 20 murder
 of the judge handling the case, Elias Ogaldez. Ogaldez had ordered the arrest of a
 military commissioner alleged to have been involved in Serechs death.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion. There was no evidence of harassment from senior government officials, but
 both major press associations denounced incidents restricting freedom of the press.
 The media reported sensitive issues such as corruption, as well as major human
 rights stories. They also publicized communiques from the URNG, leftist groups,
 and others opposed to the Government or its policies. Journalists admit, however,
 that pressure and fears of reprisal result in self-censorship and limits on investiga-
 tive reporting. For example, there is no open criticism of the military nor is there
 open discussion of important issues such as land use, land ownership, or similar
 topics that would affect the interests of powerful eonomic grups and individuals.
 Reports on human rights and narcotic trafficking are carefully written and sourced
 so that neither journalists nor their institutions are put at risk. Radio and television
 station owners observe that licensing procedures potentially give the government
 powerful leverage over their editorial policies, but they have not cited any instances
 in which the De Leon Government attempted to abuse this power.
 Continuing acts of political violence directed against journalists give credence to
 their complaints of pressure and coercion at the working level. Through November
 the Archbishop's human rights office recorded 25 separate political acts against the
 media: 2 extrajudicial killings, 5 assaults, and 18 intimidating acts. On March 26,
 unknown men fired shots at newspaper reporter Marco Tuo De la Roca, killing him
 and injuring his companion. Unknown perpetrators targeted journalist Hector
 Adolfo Baera Ortiz, first by a bomb explosion outside his home and later by a kid-
 naping attempt while at work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly and association. Peaceful demonstrations were com-
 mon and demonstrators sometimes occupied government institutions, including the
 
 
 410
 presidential palace government ministries, and the Supreme Court building. In all
 these cases, the police acted with restraint, and the authorities negotiated a peace-
 ful departure of demonstrators. The Government did not interfere with political as-
 sociations, although the law nominally requires organizations to obtain legal status,
 a cumbersome and expensive procedure.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 authorities respect it in practice. Religious personnel are sometimes threatened on
 political grounds for their human rights, indigenous rights, and land reform activi-
 ties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict foreign travel, nor does it revoke citi-
 zenship for political reasons. The authorities did not restrict movement inside the
 country except where the army and PAC's limited travel in some areas of conflict.
 Guerrillas continued to establish roadblocks to rob private citizens, extort protection
 payments from businessmen, attack and drain petroleum trucks, and limit travel in
 certain rural areas.
 Voluntary repatriation of refugees from Mexico continued. According to the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 6,011 refugees were repatriated
 to Guatemala in 1994. Since the initiation of the program, over 18,000 persons have
 returned, despite the lack of suitable land which can support the returning popu-
 lation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government by peaceful and democratic
 means, through secret ballot and universal suffrage for those 18 years of age and
 older. Members of the armed forces and police may not vote. Since the return to
 democracy and civilian rule in 1985, there have been seven free elections. Inter-
 national observers concluded that both the January 30 national referendum and the
 August 14 congressional elections were free and fair.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in politics, but women
 are underrepresented in the political arena. However, women do hold prominent po-
 litical positions, including three cabinet posts. The first President of the newly elect-
 ed Congress was a woman, and 5 other women'hold seats in the 80-member body.
 There are also two female Supreme Court justices and one female Constitutional
 Court justice.
 Indigenous people enjoy equal rights under the Constitution, and some have at-
 tained positions as army officers (including one general), judges, and government of-
 ficials, including a Cabinet member and five members of the newly elected Con-
 gress. Nevertheless, limited educational opportunity and pervasive discrimination
 (see Section 5) lead to their underrepresentation in politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits local human rights groups to operate freely, but the se-
 curity forces, PAC's, and extremist groups continued to threaten and use violence
 against their members. For example, on January 24 human rights monitor Amilcar
 Mendez reported that a masked motorcyclist tried to run over his 16-year-old
 daughter, Miriam Rocia Mendez, who was en route to the University of San Carlos.
 The daughter was uninjured. Five months later on June 29, the Mendez family re-
 ported there were armed men outside his home. However, when the police were dis-
 patched to the scene, the armed men had left. In Augs an unknown person called
 a Mendez relative in Guatemala City stating that Mendez should not return to his
 home in Quiche because he would be killed.
 Rosalina Tuyuc, director of CONAVIGUA, the National Council of Guatemalan
 Widows, reported that during June and July armed soldiers repeatedly were sta-
 tioned outside her parents' home in Chimaltenang. Throughout the year, the army
 has accused Tuyuc and CONAVIGUA of being allied with the guerrilGas.The army
 also charged that one of Tuyuc's brothers is a guerrilla commander who engiee
 recent guerrilla attacks. On June 22, unknown men attacked, stabbed, an robbed
 Sara Porej Vasquez, an officer of the human rights organization lAM, "Grupo De
 Apoyo Mutuo, outside her home. No one was apprehended for this attack.
 Disturbed by political activities of some foreign visitors, immigration authorities
 in late November began limiting U.S, Canadian, and Spanish visitors to 15-day
 stays (as opposed to 90 days previously). When embassies and individuals protested,
 the Government decided to issue all foreign visitors 30-day stays.
 Relations between the executive branch and the Human Rights Ombudsman, who
 is congressionally appointed, remain tense. The Ombudsman repeatedly accused
 
 
 President De Leon, the previous human rights ombudsman, of not taking action on
 the numerous resolutions his office has issued concerning human rights. However,
 the current Ombudsman has significantly reduced his investigative staff, thus limit-
 ing his capacity to verify comp aints. On September 7, the Ombudsman called for
 the resignation of the National Police director because of allegations of police abuse
 in the La Exacta incident (see Section L.a.).
 High-ranking government officials working in the fields of human rights and ju-
 risprudence complained publicly and privately of receiving threats stemming from
 their interest in resolving cases related to human rights violations, official corrup-
 tion, and drug trafficking.
 Both the Ombudsmans office and the Archbishop's human rights office continued
 to enjoy widespread public su pport and respect. Senior government officials met nu-
 merous foreign officials and human rights monitors. International human rights
 monitors travel throughout the country but on occasion advise local military au-
 thorities of their presence to ensure their safety, particularly in rural areas. Despite
 a persistent, 13-year effort, Peace Brigades International, an international human
 rights organization which accompanies persons whose lives may be in danger for
 their political beliefs or activities, has been unable to obtain government recognition.
 The absence of legal status did not, however, prevent Peace Brigades or other
 human rights organizations from operating openly.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all human beings are free and equal in dignity and
 rights and that the State must protect the life, liberty, justice, security, peace, and
 development of all Guatemalans.
 Women.-The Constitution asserts the principle of equality between the sexes.
 Nonetheless, women face job discrimination and on average receive significantly
 lower pay than men. They are primarily employed in low-wage jobs in the textile
 industry, agriculture, retail business, and the public sector. More working women
 than men are employed in the informal sector of the economy, where pay and bene-
 fits are generallylower. A 1989 survey reported that in Guatemala City women are
 underrepresented in high-income categories and overrepresented among poorly paid
 workers.
 In some cases, domestic laws remain discriminatory against women, such as the
 Penal Code's provisions on adultery. Only women may be charged with adultery,
 while men fall under a different statute which is more limited, makes it more dif-
 ficult to prove, and carries a lesser penalty.
 CONAVIGUA reported that violence against women, including domestic violence,
 remains common but receives little attention. There is no specific law against do-
 mestic violence, although it is considered to fall under other statutes. Criminal sex-
 ual violence often goes unreported by victims, and relatively few rape cases come
 to court. The human rights Ombudsman's office reported receiving 30 complaints
 per month of spousal abuse committed by the male spouse.
 Children.-The Constitution charges the Government with protecting the physical
 health and mental and moral well-being of minors. However, the abuse of street
 children (see Section 1.c.) is a serious problem in major cities. Estimated numbers
 of street children range between 1,500 and 5,000, with the majority of these youths
 concentrated in Guatemala City. These children are often recruited into thievery or
 prostitution rings. The Government and a number of nongovernmental organiza-
 tions operate youth centers, but the funds devoted to them are inadequate for the
 problem. An accord between Casa Alianza and the Attorney General's office was not
 renewed because the De Leon administration believes that the treatment of street
 children is adequately addressed in existing laws.
 COPREDEH, the Presidential Human Rights Commission, has formed a special
 commission called the Permanent Commission for Children, composed of Casa
 Alianza and representatives from the judicial and executive branches, which met
 through October to address the problems of street children. Relations between Casa
 Alianza and the National Police have fluctuated and only improved due to the re-
 peated personal intervention of the police department's inspector general and the in-
 terest of the department's minors division, office of professional responsibility, and
 human rights office. However, the police department's office of criminal investiga-
 tions has been reluctant to release information on past alleged human rights abuses
 committed by police officers.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution states that Guatemala is composed of di-
 verse ethnic groups and calls on the Government to recognize, respect, and promote
 lifestyles, customs, traditions, social organization, and the manner of dress of indige-
 nous people. Indigenous people comprise about one-half the population but remain
 
 
 largely outside the country's political, economic, social, and cultural mainstream. In-
 digenous people suffered most of the serious human rights abuses described
 throughout this report. Rural indigenous men were more likely than urban dwellers
 to be drafted by the army or forcibly recruited by either the army or guerrilla
 groups. Although the Constitution accords indigenous people equal rights, in prac-
 tice they have only minimal participation in decisions affecting their lands, culture,
 traditions, and allocation of natural resources.
 Rural indigenous people have limited educational opportunities and thus have
 limited employment opportunities. Many indigenous people are illiterate and do not
 speak Spanish. Linguistic barriers hinder interaction with the Government and
 limit access to public services, including the judiciary, because few officials speak
 any of the 21 indigenous languages. Indigenous persons arrested for crimes are
 often at a disadvantage due to their lack of Spanish. The public defender's office
 is charged with providing judicial translating services but is not sufficiently staffed
 to cope with the problem. Under the new Criminal Procedures Code, the Govern-
 ment is required to provide translating services to all who need it in criminal pro-
 ceedings.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that the State should protect
 disabled persons. Nonetheless, physically disabled persons are discriminated against
 in employment practices, and few resources are devoted to combat this problem or
 otherwise to assist people with disabilities. There is no legislation mandating provi-
 sion of accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide work-
 ers complete freedom of association and the right to form and join trade unions.
 Major reforms to the Labor Code in 1992 mandated concrete steps to improve work-
 er rights by facilitating freedom of association, strengthening the rights of working
 women, increasing penalties for violations of labor laws, and enhancing the role of
 the Labor Ministry and labor courts in enforcing them. All workers have the right
 to form or join unions, including public sector employees, with the exception of mem-
 bers of security forces. National Police officers have unsuccessfully attempted to
 form a trade union or association. Between 5 and 8 percent of the work force is or-
 ganized. The 993 registered unions in the country are independent of government
 and political party domination.
 The Labor Code amendments simplified the process for unions to obtain legal sta-
 tus. This was further revised when the Minister of Labor made administrative
 changes to reduce the number of steps needed within the Ministry for consideration
 of union applications, establishing strict timetables and warning officials that non-
 compliance with the timetable could lead to dismissal of those responsible for the
 delay.
 These new regulations accelerated the approval procedure, and the backlog of
 union applications was basically eliminated by midyear. The Labor Ministry has
 granted legal status to 63 unions since late 1993, and only 13 applications are still
 pending. Of the registered unions, 834 are in the private sector and 159 are in the
 public sector. The Labor Ministry initiated a program to assist unions with their ap-
 plications, to avoid some of the pitfalls still inherent in the Labor Code.
 Workers have the right to strike, but Labor Code procedures make legal strikes
 cumbersome. Labor organizers criticize the requirement that two-thirds of the work-
 ers must approve a vote to strike, the prohibition of strikes by agricultural workers
 at harvest time, and the right of the Government to prohibit strikes which it deems
 as seriously affecting the national economy. Those strikes that do occur, frequently
 in the public sector, are generally called without legal authorization, and in practice
 the Government makes no effort to intervene on the basis of illegality. Nonetheless,
 the lack of legal approval for a strike can be used as a threat against strikers. Pub-
 lic sector workers held a series of work stoppages in early 1994 and suffered no
 sanctions for their action. Indeed, the Government negotiated and reached a peace-
 ful accommodation with the public labor force.
 The law protects workers from retribution for forming and participating in trade
 union activities, but enforcement of these provisions varies. While an increasing
 number of employers accept unionization, many routinely seek to circumvent Labor
 Code provisions in order to resist union activities which many view as historically
 confrontational and disruptive. An ineffective legal system and the inadequate level
 of penalties for violations has hindered enforcement of the right to form and partici-
 gate in trade union activities. While penalties were increased in the 1992 Labor
 Code reform, the previous Supreme Court (replaced in October 1994) delayed full
 implementation of the reforms.
 
 
 413
 Trade union leaders and members were victims of a marked increase in violence
 and abuse, such as threats, assassination attempts, kidnapings and physical harm.
 In one incident, police killed and wounded several personsa l e attempting to ar-
 rest workers who were illegally occupying a ranch (see Section La.). The Arch-
 bishop's human rights office reported  a unkown assailants killed 5 unionists, in-
 4ured 2, and threatened 36, although it is not always clear whether such violence
 is union-related. Public sector union leaders, as well as unionists in the high-profile
 in-bond export sector, reported receiving threats against themselves and their fami-
 lies. Such anonymous thr eats increase-markedly early in the year when one of the
 federations of government employees held a prolonged series of work stoppages for
 improved wages and government compliance with previously negotiated agreements.
 This dispute was peacefully settled through negotiations with various union rep-
 resentatives.
 On September 30 President De Leon Carpio eliminated--allegedly without follow-
 ing legally required procedures--the moribund Committee of National Reconstruc-
 tion (CNR), a government entity established to manage recovery from the 1976
 earthquake. Many of the 600 workers who lost their jobs occupied the Committee's
 headquarters in an attempt to force the Government to negotiate severance pay or
 fmd them alternative employment. Agustin Monzon, a member of the CNR union,
 was allegedly kidnaped on November 7 and released only after the occupiers agreed
 to leave the site peacefully on November 18.
 Unions may and do form federations and confederations and join international or-
 ganizations.
 An active "solidarity" movement claims approximately 100,000 members in over
 395 companies. Unions may legally continue to operate in workplaces which have
 solidarity associations, and workers have the right to choose between the two or be-
 long to both. The Government views these associations as civic organizations which
 need not interfere with the functioning of trade unions. The amended Labor Code
 stipulates very clearly that trade unions have the exclusive right to bargain collec-
 tively over work conditions on behalf of workers. Unionists charge, however, that
 solidarity associations are promoted by management to avoid the formation of trade
 unions or to rival existing labor unions. There are credible reports that some of
 these associations did not always adhere to democratic principles in their formation
 and management and that workers are unable to participate fully and freely in deci-
 sion making. Similar credible charges are made against some trade union organiza-
 tions.
 At the rest of trade union leaders, the independent Human Rights Ombuds-
 man, t;ru his Office for Economic and Social Issues, receives complaints related
 to trade umon activities. Union leaders and workers filed a number of complaints
 with the Ombudsman during the year, and the Ombudsman has spoken out in pub-
 lic statements about labor conditions in varying sectors of the economy. The Om-
 budsman can investigate their complaints and issue a statement. He has no enforce-
 ment powers but can attempt to ameliorate the situation through publicity and
 moral suasion.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain CoUectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 .anize and baain collectively. However, the practice of collective bargaining is lim-
 ited by the weak structure of the union movement, the lack of experience with this
 practice, and the preference of management in many cases to avoid formal ties with
 trade unions. While both management and the unions honored some well-written
 collective contracts, in other instances, both parties openly ignored and violated con-
 tracts. Most workers, even those organized by trade unions, do not have collective
 contracts to cover their wages and working conditions, but do have individual con-
 tracts as required by law. Most workers receive the minimum wages established by
 bipartite commissions, which operate under the guidance of the Ministry of Labor.
 Employers cannot dismiss workers for participating in the formation of a trade
 union; workers file complaints in this regard with the labor inspectors for resolution.
 The Labor Code provides for the right of employers to fire union workers for cause,
 permits workers to appeal their dismissal to the labor courts, and requires the rein-
 statement of any union worker fired without cause. The revised Code prohibits em-
 ployers from firing workers for union organizing and protects them for 60 days fol-
 lowing the official publication of approval of the union. It also prohibits employers
 from Iring any member of the executive committee of a union and protects them
 for an additional 12 months after they are no longer on the executive committee.
 An employer may fire a member of the union's executive committee for cause only
 after a trial and issuance of a court resolution.
 Labor courts responsible for enforcing labor laws continued to be generally ineffec-
 tive. Although two new labor courts began to function, efforts to restructure and
 modernize the labor court system made little headway, in part because of tensions
 
 
 414
 between the executive and judicial branches stemming from President De Leon's re-
 form efforts. A heavy backlog of labor cases continues to clog the courts due to cor-
 ruption indolence, and lack of resources. There is only spotty enforcement of the
 Labor Code, due to the scarcity of labor inspectors, corruption, the lack of adequate
 training and resources, and structural weaknesses (or the lack of political will) in
 the labor court system Nonetheless, enforcement is improving as new labor inspec-
 tors complete training and be in work outside the capital allowing the Ministry of
 Labor to increase significantly its rate of inspections. The Ministry has also in-
 creased the number of court cases filed for failure to comply with the Labor Code
 and has begun an educational campaign on worker rights, including providing some
 documents in indigenous languages.
 Labor laws and regulations apply throughout the country, including in the few ex-
 port processing zones (EPZ's). The laws governing EPZ's are not discriminatory on
 the subect of organizing trade unions or collective bargaining. While union leaders
 often blame employer pressures and unofficially restricted access to the EPZ's for
 their virtual inability to organize workers in these zones, labor conditions in the
 EPZ's are no different from those found outside the zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bars forced or
 compulsory labor, and the practice does not exist. However, human rights and indig-
 enous groups continue to charge that there is coerced participation in the PAC s
 that violates prohibitions against forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children.-Although the Constitution
 bars employment of minors under the age of 14, children below this age are regu-
 larly employed. Laws governing the employment of minors are not effectively en-
 forced, due to the shortage of qualified labor inspectors and structural weaknesses
 in the labor court system. Only 5,000 minors have permission from the Labor Min-
 istry to work legally. Thousands working without legal permission are open to ex-
 ploitation, generally receiving no social benefits, no social insurance, no vacations,
 and no severance pay, and are paid below the minimum wage level. The Labor Min-
 istry has a program to educate minors, their parents, and employers on the rights
 of minors in the labor market. Economic necessity, however, forces most families to
 have their children seek some type of employment to supplement the family income.
 There are no export industries in which gild labor is a significant factor.
 The Constitution provides for compulsory education for all children up to the age
 of 12 or to the sixth grade. However, less than half the population actually receives
 a primary education. Child labor is largely confined to small or family enterprises,
 to agricultural work, and to the informal sectors of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although the law sets minimum wages, the le-
 gally mandated minimum wage for most unskilled and semiskilled workers is rarely
 paidto rural and urban workers. A bilateral committee representing labor and man-
 agement in specific economic sectors is named each year to make recommendations
 for increases in the minimum wage. In the event that agreement is not possible,
 the Government may decree such increases. In June the National Association of Cof-
 fee Growers (ANACAFE) reached an agreement with one trade union group rep-
 resenting coffee farm workers which increased the minimum wage for coffee farm
 workers by approximately 30 percent to $2.55 (14.50 quetzals) a day. The accord
 also provides for both productivity training and bonus payments and foresees talks
 on modernization of the critical coffee sector.
 Following the ANACAFE accord, the Government substantially increased the min-
 imum wage in the main sectors of the economy in October. The minimum wage for
 commercial and industrial workers is $2.80 (16 quetzals) for an 8-hour workday, in-
 cluding a required hourly bonus. The minimum wage for farm workers is $2.55
 (14.50 quetzals) per day, plus mandatory and productivity bonuses. It has been esti-
 mated that an urban family of four needs at least $8.50 (48 quetzales) per day to
 live, thus the minimum wage does not provide a decent standard of living. An esti-
 mated 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, including approxi-
 mately 60 percent of those employed.
 The legal workday is 8 hours and the workweek is 44 hours, but a tradition of
 much longer hours remains in place due to economic conditions. The amended Labor
 Code requires a weekly paid rest period of at least 24 hours. Trade union leaders
 and human rights groups charge that workers are sometimes forced to work over-
 time, often without premium pay, or given drugs to help them work longer in order
 to meet work requirements. Labor inspectors report that numerous instances were
 uncovered of such abuses, but corruption and inefficiencies in the labor court system
 inhibit adequate enforcement of the law.
 Occupational health and safety standards are inadequate. As with other aspects
 of the labor law, enforcement of standards that do exist is also inadequate. Workers
 have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations, and
 
 
 415
 the law provides them with protection for their continued employment. However,
 few workers are willing to jeopardize their jobs by complaining about unsafe work-
 ing conditions. When serious or fatal industrial accidents do occur, the authorities
 generally take no legal steps against those responsible. The Labor Ministry provides
 training courses for labor inspectrs in health and safety standards but does not ac-
 cord them a high priority due to scarce resources. The Government does not effec-
 tively enforce egsation requiring companies with more than 60 employees to pro-
 vide on-site medical facilities for their workers, although many large employers do
 provide such facilities.
