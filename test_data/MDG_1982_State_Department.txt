 MADAGASCAR
 The elements of the Malagasy Government include a president and
 national assembly lower house, a prime minister and cabinet
 chosen by the president, and an upper house whose members are
 selected by the president with some input from the lower house.
 The president is the dominant figure, both constitutionally and
 in fact, and virtually all major decisions on Government policies
 and actions are ultimately made by him. Although the system
 functions democratically in a number of respects, the president's
 legal powers, his personal domination of the other organs of
 Government, and the absence of a unified or effective opposition
 result in the centering of a great deal of authority in his
 person. The commitment to socialism has led to nationalization
 of well over half of the modern, cash economy, though the pri-
 vate sector remains important. The economic situation is very
 serious, with significant early improvement hard to predict.
 Disruptive policy choices, poor performance by public sector
 economic elements, and alleged corruption have all played a part
 in the decline of the economy. The economic situation has re-
 sulted in considerable popular disillusionment with the Government
 and socialism.
 The Malagasy Constitution and laws guarantee most of the basic
 civil and political rights and those affecting the integrity of
 the person. The Constitution provides, however, that anyone
 guilty of such generalized offenses as combating the revolution,
 opposing the creation of the socialist state, or endangering
 national unity risks the loss of rights and liberties. In
 practice the Malagasy citizen enjoys a fair degree of civil and
 political liberty. Legal political activity is limited to the
 seven parties of the ruling National Front, but these parties
 represent a fairly broad range of the political spectrum. Such
 rights as freedom of speech, press, and assembly are restricted
 but not eliminated. Although abuses of the integrity of the
 person do occur, they appear to be exceptional rather than
 the norm.
 The human rights situation in Madagascar has not changed sub-
 stantially in the past year. Economic factors were probably
 largely responsible for outbreaks of rioting and disorder in
 certain areas in early 1982 and for a growing crime problem, but
 these have not led to any major suppression by the Government of
 civil and political liberties.
 The human rights situation appears unlikely to change signifi-
 cantly over the near term. Prospects for longer term change are
 uncertain. The president has on occasion indicated that he might
 ultimately entertain the idea of a one-party state with a presi-
 dent for life. A move in this direction would, however, be
 widely unpopular, and it is questionable whether the president
 would risk alienating a major segment of public opinion in this
 way.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Killing
 Killing for political reasons by. governmental or other elements
 is not characteristic of Madagascar. In the period since inde-
 pendence, only one major political or Government figure has been
 assassinated, and the alleged existence of a few other assassi-
 
 
 180
 nation plots remains unproven. Government security elements
 have typically exercised restraint in the use of extremely
 violent or lethal force. Mass riots in several northern cities
 over a period of weeks in early 1982 were put down with total
 loss of life estimated at between 8 and 15, with several of the
 deaths suffered by the security forces. The forces of order do
 not appear to have used lethal force until they themselves were
 violently attacked. In May 1982, however, police fired upon a
 group of citizens engaged in pursuit of livestock thieves and
 killed at least 60 persons. These killings may have resulted
 from confusion of the citizens with the thieves possibly, or from
 local police collusion with the thieves.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of abduction, clandestine detention,
 or disappearances in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Torture is forbidden by law. Isolated allegations of torture in
 the course of interrogations have been made by former prisoners,
 but these have been unsupported by physical or other evidence.
 A credible allegation of occasional use of torture in prisons has
 been made by church sources with access to prisons, but it is not
 clear whether these instances were officially sanctioned. If
 ,torture does occur, it would appear to be unusual and without
 higher official sanction. The Government has never admitted
 that torture may have been used in any case, and its efforts to
 investigate occasional allegations are unknown.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prisons are crowded, and conditions of sanitation, diet, and
 health care within them are reportedly primitive. This appears to
 result from the general level of development and economic con-
 straints, rather than any deliberately punitive purpose. Though
 differential treatment is not officially accorded on the basis of
 class, type of offense, or for other reasons, those with resources
 or influence are typically able to obtain better penal conditions.
 Mistreatment of prisoners is forbidden by regulations and does not
 appear to be widespread. Brutal treatment appears to be the
 exception rather than the norm.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Three military officers arrested for alleged coup plotting in 1977
 are still being held without trial, as are three other persons
 arrested on similar grounds in January 1982. The Government's
 position is that investigation is still continuing and that these
 persons will eventually be charged and tried according to law or
 released. This explanation appears unsatisfactory, particularly
 in the case of the officers who have been held for five years. A
 small number of foreigners, including at least two South Africans,
 are currently in detention for alleged subversive activities.
 Grounds for imprisonment in such cases often appear doubtful.
 The concept of habeas corpus does not exist as such in the French-
 derived Malagasy legal system. Preventive detention is applied in
 some of the cases cited above. In ordinary criminal cases a
 suspect may be held for no more than three days without being
 charged. Persons suspected of activity against the state may be
 legally detained, incommunicado, for fifteen days, subject
 to indefinite extension if the Government deems it necessary.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 
 181
 The relationship between the defendant and the court follows the
 French model and does not include the specific initial presumption
 of innocence and certain other safeguards characteristic of the
 Anglo-American judicial system. Defendants are usually charged
 formally and clearly within the prescribed time periods. Upon
 being informed of the charges against them, they have the right to
 the assistance of counsel. The local Iegal community is not large,
 but it includes a number of competent attorneys who have demon-
 strated readiness to undertake controversial cases, including those
 which could bring them into conflict with Government interests.
 The courts are declared by the Constitution to be completely
 independent, except for being subject to the Constitution itself
 and the law. While this rule generally prevails, in practice there
 are exceptions. Observed departures from impartiality have in-
 cluded light sentences, or escape from prosecution, for Government
 officials and other well-connected persons, and occasional lengthy
 detention of persons before trial, usually in cases where Govern-
 ment interests are involved. The Constitution provides for open
 trials except for cases involving national defense/security
 matters, and minors. There are also military courts and special
 courts for economic crimes. Civilians can be tried before mili-
 tary courts for crimes affecting the security of the state.
 Military courts may be more sensitive to security threats than
 civil ones, but are in other respects probably no more or less
 subject to Government pressure than civil counterparts. There is
 a Court of Appeals for normal civil cases. Ultimate appeal can be
 made to the Supreme Court to challenge the verdict of any lower
 court, including a military one.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the private home.
 Under the law, process servers may enter a private dwelling to
 perform their functions only in daylight hours. The police may
 enter at any time if in possession of a written order from the
 police chief or a competent magistrate. Violations of the home
 such as demolition are unknown in Madagascar. There have been no
 reports of forced entry or technical surveillance, though whether
 the latter may occasionally be employed is unknown. Surveillance
 of the residences of persons in detention or of those who have
 been released pending possible charges is practiced in certain
 cases.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government exercises effective control over media content
 through Government ownership of radio and television and Ministry
 of Interior prior censorship of all print media (including those
 published by the Ministry of Information). Guidelines on pro-
 hibited topics are somewhat vague, but seem principally designed
 to prevent criticism of the president and senior officials, and
 discussion in the media of any alleged wrongdoing on their part.
 In practice, there is frequent criticism (much of it outspoken) in
 the independent press of a variety of Government failings in the
 areas of economic management, transportation, security and edu-
 cational policy, and criticism of censorship itself. In addition,
 the independent press in the past year has begun to publish arti-
 cles implicitly critical of the Soviet Union and its satellites.
 Private interests control about 80 to 90 percent of publications.
 Apparently the Government has never forced an independent news-
 paper to close, and there are no known instances of harassment or
 imprisonment of independent journalists. During the recent presi-
 dential campaign and afterward, the opposition candidate, Monja
 
 
 182
 Jaona, sharply attacked the Ratsiraka Government's economic pol-
 icies, charging it as well with incompetence and corruption. Much
 of this criticism was made in the press and was aired on radio and
 television.
 There are no impediments to private expression of dissatisfaction
 with Government policies and officials by Malagasy citizens. The
 Malagasy do not hesitate to discuss Government shortcomings. Al-
 though the distribution of uncensored tracts is illegal, Govern-
 ment efforts to halt such distribution and punish those respons-
 ible have not been noticeably vigorous.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is limited. Organized political activity,
 including public political gatherings, is restricted to the
 seven parties of the ruling political front. Permits needed to
 hold meetings can be denied under the Constitution, which provides
 for the suspension of rights of persons or groups combating the
 revolution, opposing the creation of the socialist state, or
 endangering national unity. These categories are so broad as to
 permit the prohibition of virtually any activity which the Govern-
 ment considers unfriendly. Unauthorized demonstrations in several
 northern cities in early 1982, arising out of the alleged partici-
 pation of officials in black marketeering, as well as other
 complaints, were forcibly suppressed. As these demonstrations
 quickly became violent, the extent to which the Government might
 have tolerated more peaceful expression is not known.
 The right to organize labor unions is recognized, but unions are
 not a major force in the society. Only about five percent of the
 total labor force, composed mostly of farmers and estimated at
 four million, has union connections. Union officials are elected
 by workers. The more important unions, however, are offshoots of
 political parties, so party leaders probably exert influence on the
 choice of union officials. Unions conduct substantive negotiations
 with employers and strikes do occur, but the Government has given
 indications that it will move against labor activity which threat-
 ens the functioning of important economic sectors of the Govern-
 ment. One independent union attempted to organize a civil service
 slowdown and walkout in 1979. The Government ended this through
 the detention of some union leaders, harassment of unauthorized
 gatherings, and the firing or threatened firing of some workers
 unless all returned to work.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nearly half of the population is Christian, with the remainder
 following either traditional Malagasy religious beliefs or none at
 all. The Government is secular. There are no restrictions on
 religious practices, and no group is favored over others or dis-
 criminated against on religious grounds. The Christian churches
 have traditionally eschewed involvement in politics,.but over the
 past year have become more outspoken on economic issues and on the
 government's control of information and emphasis on secular educa-
 tion. While this has been criticized by some political parties,
 the Government has not tried to restrain the churches, as this
 would risk significant loss of popular support.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within the country is unrestricted. There are no official
 limitations on travel abroad, but authorization must be obtained
 for each journey outside the country. This seems in practice to
 
 
 183
 be granted rather freely. A practical restriction on foreign
 travel is the shortage of foreign exchange. There are no official
 impediments to emigration, but the number of emigrants is small
 owing to the influence of tradition and financial constraints.
 Repatriation is also unrestricted. The Government has not taken a
 position on refugee matters as there is no refugee population.
 Geographical isolation and current economic problems would dis-
 courage refugees from seeking to relocate in Madagascar.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political power is concentrated in the presidency which dominates
 the political scene. Other organs of Government typically acquiesce
 in presidential decisions. Political activity is limited to the
 seven parties of the ruling political front acting within the
 framework of the front. No other parties may operate. Presi-
 dent Ratsiraka went unchallenged in the 1975 presidential election,
 and the front presented a single list of candidates for the
 national assembly elections in 1977. In a nationwide election on
 November 7, President Ratairaka was reelectea for a seven-year
 term. He was backed by five of seven parties of the national
 front, and his opponent, Monja Jaona, by the other two. Ratsiraka
 gained about 80 percent of the vote nationwide, with wide margins
 in the rural areas and narrow margins in Madagascar's major cities.
 Balloting in the cities was generally considered to have been
 conducted fairly; some irregularities probably occurred in the less
 well observed rural countryside balloting. There is some de facto
 opposition to the Government and its policies within the parties
 represented in the national front; overt opposition groups and
 activites are not tolerated, however. National front parties offer
 a moderate range of choice of ideological persuasions and policies;
 parties which explicitly oppose socialism are illegal. Although
 the Government exhorts the citizenry to be politically conscious,
 and claims a high level of political participation, the typical
 Malagasy does not appear to see himself as having the possibility
 for an effective role in the political process. Women play a
 fairly active part in public life, and the Government strives to
 achieve ethnic balance, a political imperative in Madagascar.
 There are no problems associated with nationality, citizenship, or
 statelessness.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There are no resident official representatives of human rights
 groups in Madagascar, nor have such groups been allowed to visit.
 Madagascar does participate, albeit passively, in UN human rights
 deliberations and apparently intends to become a signatory of the
 Organization of African Unity's Human Rights Charter. Amnesty
 International's 1982 Annual Report dealt briefly with Madagascar,
 with attention focused on the cases of the three military officers
 imprisoned without trial since 1977 for alleged coup plotting
 and allegations of torture of prisoners by security police.
 The Organization of African Unity earlier investigated a 1976
 massacre of ethnic Comorans in the region of Majunga. Investiga-
 tors were apparently allowed free access and produced a report
 critical of the performance of the Malagasy security forces, but
 the repott has not been released. The Government has not re-
 sponded officially to questions concerning possible violations of
 human rights.
 The Government is not known to encourage dialogue with external
 human rights groups. President Ratsiraka recently rejected a
 call by his opponent in the presidential campaign for supervision
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 13
 
 
 184
 of the elections by Amnesty International or another international
 body, saying that this would be in derogation of national sover-
 eignty.
 There are no private human rights organizations in the country,
 though the Christian churches have several times in the past year
 issued declarations calling for respect of various human rights
 and implicitly criticizing the Government in this area. Given the
 moral influence of the churches in Madagascar, the Government
 takes cognizance of any criticism emanating from this quarter.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 With a population of around nine million people and per capita GNP
 of about $300, Madagascar ranks among the poorest countries in
 the world. According to the World Bank, half the population sub-
 sists below the absolute poverty level. More than 75 percent of
 the modern, cash economy is controlled by the Government following
 a wave of nationalizations in the latter 1970s. But despite the
 priority it has given economic growth, overall productivity is on
 the decline, while the population continues to grow at a rate of
 2.6 percent annually.
 Madagascar's low population density, vast expanse of arable land,
 and variable climate offer tremendous potential for developing an
 agricultural surplus. The country, however, is becoming increas-
 ingly dependent on imports of basic commodities such as rice and
 vegetable oil. It is expected in 1982 to double the previous
 year's imports of 200,000 tons of rice, its basic dietary staple.
 This, combined with diminishing exports and growing external debt
 service payments, has produced a critical shortage of foreign
 exchange essential for agricultural investment and spare parts.
 In attempting to deal with these problems, the Government appears
 now to be taking a more pragmatic approach than in the past.
 Through reduced consumer subsidies and higher producer prices, it
 hopes to stimulate productivity in sectors such as rice production
 and to rationalize the operations of state marketing and distri-
 bution companies.
 Except for areas deemed to be of fundamental importance to nation-
 al security or economic well-being, private property rights are
 recognized and respected. Approximately 70 percent of the culti-
 vated agricultural area consists of small, family-owned holdings.
 While many of the country's small businesses and shops are still in
 the hands of the French, Chinese, and Indians, the number has
 dropped substantially as a result of policies favoring Malagasy
 nationals. A latent resentment is still harbored toward these
 commercially more successful groups. Though resentment is some-
 times manifest at the level of local government and institu-
 tions, actions against these communities are not condoned by
 central Government authorities.
 There is no discrimination against religious groups or against
 women. Women enjoy a highly visible and influential position in
 Malagasy society. They occupy many important posts in business
 and Government, a phenomenon with deep historical and sociological
 roots. Equality of opportunity is far less a problem than limited
 opportunity resulting from Madagascar's serious economic diffi-
 culties.
 Only about a quarter of the population is estimated to have access
 to safe drinking water. Although declining agricultural output
 and deteriorating infrastructure have not yet led to widespread
 malnutrition, food shortages are sporadic, and the quality of
 
 
 185
 nutrition varies greatly. The ratio of calorie supply available
 for consumption relative to nutritional requirements was recorded
 at 115 percent in 1977, but both the quantity and quality of food
 have diminished since then. Rice is the most popular dish through-
 out the country, but erratic supplies are causing increasing num-
 berq of people, especially in the arid south, to return to manioc
 as a basic staple. Fresh fruits and vegetables are plentiful in
 certain parts of the country-and scarce in others.
 The quality of health care in Madagascar has also suffered from
 many of the problems plaguing the economy at large. The lack
 of foreign exchange has resulted in a growing dependence on inter-
 national donations of basic medical supplies. Serious flooding
 such as that which occurred early in 1982 leaves the population
 particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. Malaria, espe-
 cially in the coastal regions, is a continuing problem. The
 resources for dealing with emergencies are limited, as are anti-
 biotics and other routinely used medicines. The present system
 of health care relies largely on Government subsidy, with little
 allowance for improved care for those who can afford it. There
 is approximately one hospital bed for every 617 people and one
 physician for every 11,500. Life expectancy at birth was 47.1
 years in 1980. The infant mortality rate in that year was 71.3
 per thousand live births.
 Private and parochial schools still play an important role in
 Malagasy education. At the primary school level, some 13 percent
 of the student population was enrolled in non-public schools
 in 1978. The figure jumps to about 33 percent in the case of
 secondary schools. The percentage of private school enrollment
 generally declined throughout the 1970s, however, and there is
 evidence that this decline has continued. The most plausible
 reason for increases in public school enrollment is the cost of
 private education and an overall increase in the primary and
 secondary school enrollment. The latest available figures indi-
 cate some 83 percent of those eligible for primary school were
 enrolled in 1979, an increase of over 20 percent from earlier in
 the decade. The adult literacy rate for that year was listed at
 53 percent.
