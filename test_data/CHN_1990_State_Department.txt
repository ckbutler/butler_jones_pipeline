 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China is ruled by an.authoritarian
 government in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), backed
 by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), retains dominant
 decisionmaking authority. A closed inner circle of a few
 senior leaders exercises ultimate power. Some of these party
 elders hold positions within the Politburo, the Central
 Military Commission,, and other organs. Others hold no formal
 positions of authority, but still wield decisive influence by
 virtue of their seniority in the Communist movement.
 The Government seeks to maintain control through a nationwide
 security network--which includes the Ministry of State
 Security; the Ministry of Public Security; the People's Armed
 Police; the People's Liberation Army; and state judicial,
 procuratorial, and penal systems--and through the ubiquitous
 party apparatus and traditional societal pressure. In 1990
 security forces were responsible for human rights abuses,
 including torture and arbitrary arrests, as part of a
 heightened emphasis on the role of security forces in
 maintaining political control and social order.
 A decade of economic reforms initiated in 1978 greatly
 expanded the role of market forces, encouraged the growth of a
 significant nonstate (including private) economic sector, and
 contributed to greater prosperity for the ordinary citizen.
 However, China still maintains extensive government controls
 over economic activity which limit labor mobility, restrict
 enterprise discretion over prices and wages, and ration
 certain key commodities in short supply. In the wake of
 economic retrenchment imposed since late 1988, and the
 political crackdown since June 1989, the Government has
 reiterated its commitment to economic reform, combining market
 forces with central planning. But in seeking economic
 stability it has reemphasized the primacy of the state sector
 and the need for administrative control through state planning
 agencies. Progress on some labor reforms has been suspended,
 leaders of nascent independent unions remain imprisoned, and
 the CCP has reasserted complete control over trade unions.
 China's human rights climate in 1990 remained repressive, if
 less overtly so than in 1989. Observance of human rights fell
 far short of internationally recognized norms, although some
 overt aspects of repression eased. The Government announced
 the release of nearly 900 persons detained in 1989 during the
 democracy movement (a figure that cannot be independently
 confirmed) and lifted martial law in Beijing and Lhasa. It
 also apparently ended investigations of most participants in
 the protests, and allowed Fang Lizhi, the dissident physicist
 who sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy after being branded a
 criminal during the June 4 crackdown, to leave the country.
 However, serious human rights abuses continued. At least
 several hundred persons remained detained without formal
 charge since the 1989 crackdown on political dissent. The
 suppression of Catholic and Protestant churches that refused
 to affiliate with government-sponsored religious organizations
 continued. Security forces broke up several proindependence
 demonstrations in Tibet. Credible reports, from sources
 including official media, persisted of torture and
 mistreatment of those accused of crimes. Progress toward most
 political and legal reforms offering protection for individual
 rights were halted and even reversed, although a law enabling
 citizens to sue government officials who abuse their authority
 
 
 846
 CHINA
 took effect in October. The lifting of martial law was
 accompanied by new laws codifying restrictions on assembly,
 expression, and the press; these and other freedoms remained
 tightly restricted.
 Two conflicting developments emerged at year's end.
 Authorities brought formal charges against a number of
 democracy activists--most already detained for over 18
 months--for "counterrevolutionary" offenses that could result
 in lengthy prison terms. At the same time, the Government has
 been significantly more willing than previously to discuss
 human rights issues. Its unprecedented invitation to the U.S.
 Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian
 Affairs in December inaugurated a substantive dialog on human
 rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were few instances of extrajudicial killings in 1990 and
 none to compare with the large scale of those in Beijing and
 Tibet in 1989. In November, officials stated that to date
 there had been 30 deaths from torture reported in 1990,
 compared with a reported 41 in all of 1989. They insisted
 that officials responsible for torture were prosecuted to the
 fullest extent of the law, but they provided only 2 examples
 of such punishment in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were few reported cases of disappearance in 1990. With
 tight political controls reinforced in the wake of the June
 1989 crackdown, it is likely that few persons dared to speak
 out publicly in opposition to'the regime. Disposition of the
 cases of several persons detained by police for political
 activities marking the anniversary of the Beijing massacre has
 not been revealed.
 There has not yet been an overall public accounting by the
 Government of the fate of those detained during and after the
 suppression of the 1989 demonstrations. In the Department of
 State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1989,
 the number of people originally detained was estimated to be
 in the thousands; that rough order of magnitude still seems to
 be correct. Most apparently were released after varying
 periods of detention and interrogation, but exact figures are
 unknown. Among those whose fate is unclear is the young man
 who was filmed stopping a column of tanks on June 4, 1989.
 The Government has stated that he was never arrested; a Hong
 Kong press report claimed he had been executed. Neither
 account can be confirmed. Chinese authorities have
 consistently turned aside requests by the U.S. Government and
 by international human rights monitoring groups for
 information on the identity or status of most of these
 persons. The Government announced the release of 881
 detainees in the first half of 1990, and said in June that 355
 remained in pretrial detention in Beijing.  The actual number
 is probably somewhat higher. At least a thousand more have
 already been sentenced to prison, labor reform, or labor
 reeducation
 
 
 847
 CHINA
 The status of many persons detained in the 1989-1990
 suppression of unofficial religious activities remains
 unknown. The same is true of many Tibetans who are presumed
 detained for demonstrations in Tibet in 1990, as well as in
 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Despite legal safeguards, the use of torture and degrading
 treatment of persons detained and imprisoned persisted.
 According to an April report by the Supreme People's
 Procuratorate, the Government investigated nearly 500 cases of
 the extraction of confessions by torture and other serious
 abuses of police authority for the first quarter of 1990, a
 59.6 percent increase over the same period in 1989. In
 November officials said they had confirmed 300 cases of
 torture so far in 1990. Government statistics may represent
 only a fraction of the total number of abuses, and punishment
 of abusers is rarely reported (though, as previously noted,
 severe punishments have been imposed in at least a few cases).
 Conditions in Chinese prisons and detention centers vary
 widely. Most of the democracy movement detainees released in
 1990 who reported generally good treatment during detention
 were students and intellectuals. The prominent journalist Dai
 Qing, for example, was held in a special police guest house.
 According to a variety of sources, including some released
 detainees, workers and unemployed youths were treated far
 worse, with more frequent instances of torture and degrading
 treatment. Workers were also more likely to be sentenced to
 prison, reeducation through labor, or execution than were
 students and intellectuals.
 Conditions in all types of Chinese penal institutions are
 generally harsh and frequently degrading. The emphasis on
 obtaining confessions as a basis for convictions leads to
 widespread abuses, particularly in detention centers. Former
 detainees have reported the use of cattle prods, electrodes,
 prolonged periods of solitary confinement, and incommunicado
 detention, beatings, shackles, and other forms of abuse. Both
 before and after trial, prisoners are subject to severe
 pressure to confess their "errors." According to judicial
 officials, confessions are an insufficient basis :or
 conviction without corroborating evidence. However, official
 media and other reports indicate that coerced confessions have
 led to erroneous convictions. There have been frequent
 credible reports from Tibetan refugees of torture and
 mistreatment in penal institutions in Tibet, although reports
 of abuses at Lhasa Prison (also known as Drapchi) have
 declined. In October authorities in Tibet began allowing
 foreign officials to visit this prison and have indicated a
 willingness to discuss individual cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile
 China's Criminal Procedure Law proscribes arbitrary arrest or
 detention and limits the amount of time a person can be held
 in custody without being charged. According to the law,
 interrogation should take place within 24 hours of detention,
 and the detainee's family and work unit should be informed of
 the circumstances of the detention within 48 hours. Articles
 43-52 of the Criminal Procedure Law, however, permit the
 police to delay notifying the family and work unit 'in
 circumstances where notification would hinder the
 
 
 848
 CHINA
 investigation." The detention of a person by the Public
 Security Bureau must be approved by the Procuratorate within
 18 days of detention. According to Chinese officials, this
 period can be longer when the detainee does not cooperate in
 the investigation. In some politically sensitive cases,
 however, detainees have been held for many months without
 charge, and family members have not been informed of the
 detention.
 Several hundred persons detained for activities related to the
 1989 demonstrations were held throughout 1990 in "detention
 during investigation" or "administrative detention" status.
 These persons were not formally "arrested" or charged with any
 crime, though at year's end authorities began to press charges
 against at least some detainees. Similarly, many members of
 unofficial Catholic and Protestant churches have been detained
 for months before being charged or released, according to
 credible reports.
 "Crimes of counterrevolution" are dealt with under articles
 90-104 of the Criminal Law. Some of these offenses--which
 range from treason and espionage to "spreading counter-
 revolutionary propaganda"--are defined in such broad terms
 that they are subject to arbitrary interpretation by the
 State. These articles apparently have been used to charge
 persons guilty of nothing more than open expression of their
 views, despite constitutional guarantees of this freedom.
 They have also been used to punish persons who organized
 demonstrations, disrupted traffic, disclosed official
 information to foreigners, or formed associations outside
 state control. Those detained for committing "crimes of
 counterrevolution" are in theory treated the same as those
 detained for other crimes, and their cases are supposed to be
 handled in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law, though
 in practice the law's provisions limiting length of detention
 and requiring family notification are sometimes ignored.
 Sentences imposed by criminal-courts may be served in prisons
 or in reform through labor camps. Ministry of Justice
 officials say there are no practical differences between the
 two institutions. Many labor reform camps reportedly are in
 remote areas such as Xinjiang or Qinghai. Some former inmates
 reportedly have been denied permission to return to their
 homes in what amounts to a form of internal exile. In recent
 years, "Ministry of Justice officials insist, most prisoners
 have been allowed to serve their sentences in the areas in
 which they live.
 The number of 1989 democracy movement participants still under
 detention is difficult to estimate. The Government has not
 disclosed the total number originally detained, sentenced to
 prison terms, administratively assigned to reeducation through
 labor camps, executed, or released. Many of those detained in
 1989 were either sentenced or released during the ensuing
 year. The Government announced the release of 881 detainees
 in three groups in January, May, and June. The authorities
 publicized a few prominent names but did not provide complete
 lists of those released. Independent verification of the
 numbers has not been possible. At least some of those
 released were subject to restrictions on movement and
 employment and were required to report periodically to
 police. In June Chinese officials reported that 355 persons
 picked up after the 1989 demonstrations remained in pretrial
 detention in Beijing. Shanghai authorities acknowledged that
 two persons from that city remained in detention in December.
 
 
 849
 CHINA
 In September a credible unofficial source placed the number of
 remaining detainees in Beijing at nearly 400.
 Hundreds if not thousands of participants in the 1989
 demonstrations have been assigned without trial to reeducation
 through labor camps. In two reeducation through labor camps
 near Beijing, for example, over 800 of the inmates consisted
 of youths detained for activities during the demonstrations.
 They were charged with "hooliganism" and destruction of
 property and were not included by Chinese authorities in any
 accounting of detentions in connection with the demonstrations.
 Among the prominent political detainees not formally arrested
 or charged by year's end were Bao Tong, Gao Shan, Li Mingqi,
 Liu Gang, Peng Rong, Wang Zhixin, Xiong Yan, Yang Wei, Zhai
 Weimin and Zhang Weiguo. The status of the case against labor
 activist Han Dongfang, who according to some reports was
 charged early in the year, remains unclear.
 A number of people reportedly were detained for acts of
 dissent during 1990, several linked to anniversaries of the
 1989 demonstrations. Among these, according to reliable
 reports, were persons who laid wreaths on Tiananmen Square and
 students who put up antigovernment posters at Beijing
 University.
 Dozens of persons involved in small demonstrations throughout
 the year against Chinese rule in Tibet were detained, as were
 an undetermined number of persons involved in riots and
 demonstrations in Xinjiang. A reliable estimate of the total
 number of arbitrary arrests and detentions in 1990 is not
 possible.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Officials insist that China's judiciary is independent, but
 official statements also acknowledge that it is subject to the
 policy guidance of the CCP. In addition, there are reports
 that Party and government leaders predetermine verdicts and
 sentences in some sensitive cases. According to the
 Constitution, the court system is equal in authority to the
 State Council and the Central Military Commission, the two
 most important government institutions. All three organs are
 under the supervision of the National People's Congress. The
 Supreme People's Court stands at the apex of the court system,
 followed in descending order by the Higher People's Court
 (province), the Intermediate People's Court (prefecture), and
 the Basic People's Court (county). Separate and special
 military, maritime, and railway courts function directly under
 the Supreme People's Court.
 During the 1980's, the Government moved gradually toward the
 establishment of a more autonomous and less arbitrary legal
 system. There were efforts to define broad, general laws more
 precisely, including the legal provisions for 'crimes of
 counterrevolution," in order to clarify what are criminally
 indictable offenses. Programs were set up to provide
 professional training for judges through overseas training
 courses to acquaint them with foreign legal procedures. After
 the 1989 crackdown, however, the tightening of political and
 ideological controls seriously undermined these reforms,
 closed off debate on the relative merits of "rule by man" and
 "rule by law," and set back China's efforts to build a modern
 and more autonomous judicial system. Official directives to
 the courts to produce quick judgments during the 1990
 
 
 850
 CHINA
 anticrime campaign further undermined the integrity of the
 court system.
 Due process rights are stipulated under the Constitution but
 often ignored in practice. The Criminal Procedure Law
 requires that all trials be held "in public," except those
 involving state secrets, juveniles, and "personal secrets."
 Details of cases involving "counterrevolutionary" charges have
 frequently been kept secret, even from relatives of the
 defendants, under this provision. Even when trials are
 nominally open, in many cases the only "public" allowed to
 attend apparently are officially selected "representatives" of
 the people and immediate relatives of the accused. The law
 also states that a defendant may be held in custody for a
 maximum of 2 months during investigation prior to trial,
 although a 1-month extension may be requested from the next
 higher procuratorate. The procuratorate then has up to 1 1/2
 months to decide whether or not to prosecute the case. An
 additional month is permitted if "supplementary investigation"
 is needed. Any delay beyond 5 1/2 months theoretically
 requires approval of the Standing Committee of the NPC. In
 practice, however, the period of pretrial detention is
 occasionally much longer than legally permitted, particularly
 in politically sensitive cases.
 The procuratorate sends to trial only those persons it
 determines are guilty on the basis of the police
 investigation, supplemented if necessary by its own
 inquiries. Persons appearing before the court are not
 presumed innocent; trials are generally, in effect, sentencing
 hearings. Conviction rates average over 99 percent according
 to recent statistics. Defense lawyers may be retained
 privately, but most are appointed by the court. They
 virtually never contest their clients' guilt; rather their
 function is generally confined to requesting clemency. There
 is an appeal process, but initial decisions are rarely
 overturned. Defendants are expected to "show the right
 attitude" by confessing their crimes, and those who fail to
 confess are sentenced more harshly.
 There were several cases in 1990 of people who were tried and
 convicted for clearly political offenses, often related to the
 1989 demonstrations. Among these'was a student sentenced to 3
 years' imprisonment for instigating a sit-in at the Hangzhou
 railway station, and another sentenced to 1 year for.
 denouncing CCP leaders at a rally. Chen Zhixiang, a teacher
 in Guangzhou, received 10 years for displaying an
 antigovernment poster; and Li Haitao, a university professor
 in Wuhan, was sentenced to 4 years for "counterrevolutionary
 agitation" and "disrupting transportation." Li had given
 speeches and held a memorial service in June 1989 for the
 victims of the crackdown and organized a sit-in on a bridge.
 In November and December, the families of a number of
 prominent detainees were notified of their formal arrest.
 Among these reportedly were Bao Zunxin, Chen Xiaoping, Chen
 Ziming, Liu Suli, Liu Xiaobo, Lu Jiaming, Pang Zhihong, Ren
 Wanding, Wang Dan, Wang Juntao, Wang Peigong, Zhang King and
 Zheng Xuguang. In addition, a number of political prisoners
 jailed in previous cycles of repression, notably 1979
 "democracy wall" dissident Wei Jingsheng, remain in prison.
 Western press reports have claimed that Wei's health has
 deteriorated during prolonged solitary confinement, but in
 December authorities asserted Wei was in good health and
 receives family visits.
 
 
 851
 CHINA
 In Tibet, authorities continued to impose harsh sentences for
 proindependence activities. Ngawang Chamtsul, a monk at the
 Potala Palace, reportedly was convicted December 5 of "passing
 information to the enemy" and "spreading counterrevolutionary
 propaganda" (charges that often derive from expressing
 resentment of Chinese rule to tourists) and sentenced to 15
 years' imprisonment. Six high school students detained in
 late 1989 were sentenced to varying terms for forming a
 "counterrevolutionary organization." At least two of the
 boys, including 14-year-old Lhakpa Tesring, are serving their
 sentences at Lhasa's main adult prison.
 In May China launched one of its occasional crackdowns on
 crime. The CCP leadership ordered public security,
 procuratorate, and court officials to speed the process of
 investigation, trial, and sentencing, raising serious concerns
 about lack of due process. In at least several hundred
 instances, death sentences were imposed. All death sentences
 are reviewed by a higher court, but such reviews are generally
 very rapid (often completed within a few days after initial
 sentencing) and seldom result in reversal or reduction of
 sentences.
 Under article 19 of "the Regulations of the PRC on
 Administrative Penalties for Public Security," government
 authorities can assign persons accused of minor public order
 offenses (e.g., disturbing the peace, fabricating rumors,
 hindering government officials from performing their official
 duties) to reeducation through labor camps without judicial
 review. In March Chinese officials stated that 869,934
 Chinese citizens had been assigned to these camps since 1980,
 with about 80,000 assigned each year and 160,00a undergoing
 reeducation through labor at that time. It has not been
 possible to verify the official figures; other estimates of
 the number of inmates are considerably higher. The term of
 assignment runs from a normal minimum oL 1 year to a maximum
 of 3, though the labor reeducation committee may subsequently
 extend an inmate's sentence for a maximum of I year if his
 "reform attitude" is not good.
 The number of persons in Chinese penal institutions who would
 be considered political prisoners by international standards
 is impossible to estimate accurately. While government
 officials deny that the PRC has any "political" prisoners,
 they have stated that there are just over 1.1 million inmates
 in Chinese prisons and reform camps, and that 0.5 percent of
 these were convicted of "counterrevolutionary crimes," for a
 total of roughly 5,500 "counterrevolutionary" convicts. This
 figure includes a substantial number convicted of crimes such
 as espionage that are internationally recognized criminal
 offenses. On the other hand, it excludes the several hundred
 remaining 1989 detainees, at least 1,000 in labor reeducation
 camps, and an undetermined number sentenced for criminal
 offenses in connection with religious activities (such as
 receiving funds from abroad without authorization or changing
 such funds on the black market). Estimates of the number of
 political prisoners by some foreign researchers are much
 higher but cannot be confirmed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Personal and family life in China are extensively monitored
 and regulated by the authorities. Most persons depend on
 their work unit for employment, housing, ration coupons,
 
 
 852
 CHINA
 permission to marry or have a child, and other aspects of
 ordinary life. The work unit, along with the neighborhood
 watch committee, monitors activities and attitudes. Since the
 1989 demonstrations, Chinese authorities have strengthened the
 surveillance functions of neighborhood watch committees,
 requiring them to work more closely with the police. Search
 warrants are required by law before security forces can search
 premises, but this provision is often ignored. Daily life is
 monitored in a variety of ways. Some telephone conversations
 are recorded, and mail is frequently opened and censored, in
 spite of the provision in the 1982 Constitution that "freedom
 and privacy of correspondence of citizens . . . are protected
 by law." Interference is not always limited to surveillance.
 Complaints by Chinese students overseas that they and their
 families in China were harassed by PRC officials because of
 their democracy activities continued through early 1990 but
 virtually ended by mid-year.
 One purpose of this government surveillance is to regulate and
 limit contact between PRC citizens and foreigners. Most
 Chinese visiting foreign residences must enter segregated and
 closely monitored foreign residential compounds, where most
 foreigners are required to live. Foreign residences are under
 physical surveillance and presumed to be electronically
 monitored. Under the crackdown, the Government has
 intensified traditional efforts to restrict contact between
 Chinese citizens and foreigners.
 China's population has roughly doubled in the past 40 years,
 seriously complicating the country's ability to feed its
 people and develop its economy. In the early 1980's, the
 Government set a goal of limiting the population to 1.2
 billion by the year 2000. To meet this target, it adopted a
 comprehensive--and highly intrusive--family planning program
 aimed at achieving a-one-child-per-family policy for Han
 Chinese in urban areas (numerous exceptions are allowed for
 Han in rural areas). Ethnic minorities are either exempted or
 subject to less stringent population controls.
 Individual and family decisions about bearing children are
 regulated by the State, with rewards for those who cooperate
 with, and severe sanctions against those who deviate from,
 official guidelines. The central Government sets an annual
 nationwide goal for the number of authorized births,
 apportioned down to the local level and, ultimately, to each
 work unit. In urban areas, couples are encouraged to delay
 marriage until well after the legal minimum age of 22 for men
 and 20 for women, and to defer childbirth until at least their
 mid-20's. For urban couples, obtaining permission to have a
 second child is very difficult.
 China's population control policy relies on education,
 propaganda, and economic incentives, as well as more coercive
 measures, including psychological pressure and severe economic
 penalties. Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy
 include monthly stipends and preferential medical, food, and
 educational benefits. Disciplinary measures against those who
 violate the policy often include stiff fines, withholding of
 social services, demotion, and other administrative
 punishments. In at least a few cases, people have been fired
 from their jobs (a very serious penalty in China, affecting
 housing, pension, and other social benefits) for refusing to
 terminate unauthorized pregnancies.
 
 
 853
 CHINA
 Physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization is
 not authorized, but continues to occur as officials strive to
 meet population targets. Reports of forced abortions and
 sterilizations continue, though well below the levels of the
 early 1980's. While recognizing that abuses occur, officials
 maintain that China does not condone forced abortion or
 sterilization, and that abuses by local officials are
 punished. They admit, however, that punishment is rare and
 have yet to provide documentation of any punishments.
 Enforcement of the family planning policy has been
 inconsistent and varies widely from place to place and from
 year to year. The 1990 census data indicate that the average
 number of children per family (2.3) and the population growth
 rate (1.5 percent) remain significantly higher than would be
 produced by successful enforcement of official policy. In
 many areas, couples apparently are able to have several
 children without incurring any penalty, while in other areas
 enforcement has been more stringent. Local officials have
 great discretion in how, and how strictly, the policy is
 implemented. Because penalties for excess births can be
 levied against local officials and the women's work units,
 many individuals are personally affected, providing an
 additional potential source of pressure.
 Female infanticide persists in some impoverished rural areas.
 Insistence that local units meet population goals has
 contributed to the persistence of this traditional practice,
 generally by parents who hope to have more sons without
 incurring official punishment. The Government strongly
 opposes infanticide and has prosecuted offenders, but has been
 unable to eradicate the practice.
 In recent years, new regulations with eugenics provisions have
 been implemented in at least five provinces, beginning with
 Gansu. These regulations prohibit people with severe mental
 handicaps from having children. Should any person with a low
 intelligence quotient--the Gansu cut-off is 49--decide to
 marry, one spouse must undergo sterilization. For those
 already married, one partner must be sterilized and any
 pregnancies compulsorily aborted. Provincial officials claim
 that permission for any operation requires the consent of a
 mentally competent relative, but they admit that heavy
 psychological pressure may be employed to obtain consent.
 National family planning officials reportedly have discouraged
 the enactment and enforcement of such eugenics laws.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The use of excessive force declined sharply in 1990, as
 reinforcement of systems of social control deterred open
 dissent. The Government places a high premium on stability
 and has demonstrated that it will do whatever is necessary to
 maintain it. Government security units suppressed several
 small proindependence demonstrations in Tibet, detaining
 dozens of persons. Armed security forces quelled a violent
 uprising among Muslims in southwest Xinjiang in April, when
 rioters protesting official restrictions on religious
 observance and advocating independence reportedly killed six
 policemen. The subsequent suppression of the uprising left 22
 dead by official count; unofficial estimates range
 significantly higher. The use of overwhelming force
 underscores China's policy of moving forcefully against ethnic
 unrest, especially that involving violence.
 
 
 854
 CHINA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and self-expression are severely
 restricted. Limited tolerance of some criticism of government
 policies and officials had generally increased through the
 1980's, but after June 1989 this trend was abruptly reversed.
 The Party has reasserted complete control over the press; the
 media's traditional role of transmitting the views of the
 people to the leadership has been limited and carefully
 regulated. Citizens are not permitted to criticize senior
 leaders or to express opinions contrary to the "four cardinal
 principles," which provide for a Socialist state under the
 Communist Party's exclusive control. Persons who violate
 these guidelines are punished. Several persons were detained
 for acts of dissent coinciding with the first anniversary of
 the Beijing massacre, such as wearing a white armband or
 laying a wreath on Tiananmen Square. Beijing University
 students Peng Rong and Li Mingqi were detained in May and June
 respectively after making speeches on campus. Both were
 charged with "counterrevolutionary" conspiracy, and remained
 in detention at year's end.
 Television and radio broadcasting remained under strict party
 and government control and were used to propagate an orthodox
 ideological line. Programming was heavily laced with party
 propaganda.
 As part of its control of citizens' access to information, the
 Chinese government continued to jam most Chinese-language
 broadcasts of the Voice of America and British Broadcasting
 Corporation. The leadership has attacked VOA, claiming that
 it is part of a Western conspiracy to malign or subvert
 China. Close surveillance and harassment of foreign
 reporters--most notably when seven were beaten on the first
 anniversary of the Beijing massacre--were also part of the
 Government's effort to control" the flow of information into
 and out of China.
 Restrictions on the publication of books and other printed
 material, which had generally eased during the 1980's,
 increased under the crackdown. The Government has ordered the
 press to support the party line and not to question the "four
 cardinal principles." A number of Chinese journalists
 remained under detention, and the ranks and leadership of many
 newspapers and journals were purged. Tightened distribution,
 moreover, enabled authorities to control foreign language
 material more effectively.
 The campaign against pornography continued intermittently iii
 tandem with an effort to curb publications advocating
 "bourgeois liberalization" (Western social, political, and
 cultural ideas). Numerous publications were closed,
 heavy-handed ideological controls were reimposed, and
 ideologically suspect journalists were replaced. The
 Government also banned publications by authors considered
 politically unacceptable such as Liu Binyan, Su Xiaokang, Su
 Shaozhi, Bao Tong, Liu Xiaobo, Yan Jiaqi, and Fang Lizhi and
 his wife Li Shuxian.
 The party also continued to impose tight controls on colleges,
 universities, and research institutes. After suppressing the
 1989 demonstrations, the Government reimposed tighter
 ideological controls over the entire school system. The
 
 
 855
 CHINA
 entering freshmen classes at Beijing University and Shanghai's
 Fudan University, both of which had experienced demonstrations
 on the first anniversary of the June 4, 1989 Beijing massacre,
 were sent to military camps for a year of training and
 ideological dndoctrination. In colleges and universities, the
 quotient of political study has increased. Numerous textbooks
 and scholarly works were either censored or prohibited by the
 State Education Commission.
 The heavy ideological control of academic institutions and the
 censorship of the media forced many journalists and scholars
 to keep a low profile. Many scholars, including some of
 China's most prominent, declined opportunities to publish or
 present papers on subjects which could be construed as
 sensitive. Limited public debate was permitted on some
 subjects, such as economic policy and family planning.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In practice, freedom of peaceful assembly and association are
 severely restricted. The Constitution guarantees the right
 "of assembly, of association, of procession, and of
 demonstration," but such activities may not infringe "upon the
 interests of the State."
 A new, more stringent "Law Governing Assemblies, Parades, and
 Demonstrations" was implemented in January. This law in
 theory guarantees the right to assemble and demonstrate, but
 it stipulates that parades and demonstrations may not
 "infringe on the interests of the State, society, and
 collectives or the legitimate freedoms and rights of other
 citizens." This provision would proscribe any protests
 against socialism or the leadership. It could be used to ban
 protests that disrupt traffic, interfere with business, or
 occupy public places, and could also prohibit all acts that
 could be interpreted as "infringing" on the freedoms of other
 citizens. Procedures for obtaining a parade permit are such
 as to discourage and effectively prevent the exercise of the
 right of assembly. Since no demonstrations were permitted
 under the new law, even though there were credible reports
 that workers at some factories and students at a number of
 universities applied for permission to demonstrate in 1990,
 the practical effect of the law has been to deny the right to
 demonstrate. Several unauthorized demonstrations in Tibet
 were dispersed in 1990, and hundreds of Buddhist monks and
 nuns were expelled from monasteries and nunneries for
 proindependence activities. The law does not apply to
 "traditional cultural, recreational, or sports activities" and
 "normal religious activities." Local authorities, however,
 retain the power to determine what are legitimate
 "traditional" or "normal" religious activities.
 Professional and other mass associations are for the most part
 organized and controlled by the Communist Party. Regulations
 implemented in early 1990 require all organizations to be
 officially registered and approved. Ostensibly aimed at
 secret societies and criminal gangs, the regulations may also
 be used to prevent the formation of unauthorized political or
 labor organizations, such as the student and worker groups
 that emerged before and during the 1989 democracy movement.
 They have also been used to disband groups, such as
 unregistered house churches, deemed potentially subversive.
 Security forces maintain a close watch on groups formed
 outside the party establishment, particularly unauthorized
 religious groups and other associations. Associations
 
 
 856
 CHINA
 recognized by the State are permitted to maintain relations
 with recognized international bodies, but these contacts are
 carefully monitored and limited.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom in China is subject to restrictions of
 varying severity. While the Constitution affirms toleration
 of religious beliefs, the Government places restrictions on
 religious practice outside of officially recognized and
 government-controlled religious organizations. Rerigious
 proselytizing is officially restricted to government
 registered and sanctioned places of worship. The management
 and control of religion is the responsibility of religious
 affairs bureaus across China, staffed primarily by party
 members.
 By far the largest body of religious believers in
 China--estimated by one government official at 100
 million--are Buddhists belonging to the dominant Han ethnic
 group. Han Buddhist leaders generally cooperate with the
 Government and have experienced few reported difficulties.
 Daoism, widely practiced in southern coastal provinces, is
 officially respected as an important part of traditional
 Chinese culture, but some of its practices conflicting with
 government strictures against superstition and waste of arable
 land have been sharply criticized.
 China has permitted Muslim citizens to make the hajj to Mecca
 each year since 1979. In 1990, however, the number attending
 dropped precipitously; Xinjiang religious affairs officials
 stated that the number of Xinjiang Muslim pilgrims in 1990 was
 less than half the number participating the preceding year,
 reportedly because of difficulties in obtaining exit permits
 from the Government. Only those Christian churches affiliated
 with either the Catholic Patriotic Association or the
 (Protestant) Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which were
 established by the Government in the 1950's to eliminate
 perceived foreign domination of Christian groups, may operate
 openly.
 Officially sanctioned religious organizations are permitted to
 maintain international contacts as long as these do not entail
 foreign control, but proselytizing by foreign groups is
 forbidden. One American was expelled in 1990 for
 proselytizing. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement and its
 Buddhist and Muslim counterparts have established extensive
 networks of international support. While the Catholic-
 Patriotic Association has no official ties to Catholic
 churches outside China, its leaders frequently visit Catholic
 and other religious leaders abroad. The Association ordains
 its own bishops and priests, generally follows pre-Vatican II
 practices, and rejects Papal authority. After forcefully
 suppressing all religious observance during the 1966-76
 Cultural Revolution, the Government began in the late 1970's
 to restore or replace confiscated churches, temples, mosques,
 and monasteries. The official religious organizations
 administer more than a dozen Catholic and Protestant
 seminaries, nine institutes to train imams and Islamic
 scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist monks. Students
 who attend these institutes must demonstrate "political
 reliability," and all graduates must pass an examination of
 theological and political knowledge to qualify for the
 clergy   The Government supervises the publication of
 
 
 CHINA
 religious material for distribution to ensure religious and
 political conformity.
 Active unofficial religious movements pose an alternative to
 the state-regulated churches and temples. The unofficial
 Catholic Church claims a membership far larger than the 3.6
 million registered with the official church, though actual
 figures are unknown. It has its own bishops and priests and
 conducts its own services. A large number of Protestants
 worship privately in "house churches" that are independent of
 government control. There is a dynamic house church movement
 in many cities and, like their unofficial Catholic
 counterparts, house churches often attract more followers than
 the official Three-Self Patriotic Movement churches.
 The Government generally tolerates the existence of unofficial
 Catholic and Protestant churches as long as they remain small
 and discreet. However in 1990 PRC authorities continued
 efforts begun in 1989 to rein in activities of the unapproved
 Catholic and Protestant movements, raiding and closing a
 number of unregistered churches. This was in part a response
 to the rapidly growing membership in these two movements. The
 Government suspects many leaders of unofficial churches of
 harboring criminal or dissident intentions and has imprisoned
 scores of them in recent years. On February 22, security
 forces raided and ransacked Damazhan house church in Guangzhou
 and briefly detained and questioned its minister, Pastor
 Samuel Lamb (Lin Xiangao), because of his refusal to register
 with the official Protestant organization. There were
 numerous other credible reports of raids on house churches and
 detentions of members, particularly in southern and coastal
 provinces and in Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Henan provinces.
 Unofficial Catholic Bishop Joseph Li Side, Father Shi Wande,
 and lay leader Wang Tongshan were arrested in December
 1989-January 1990. In May Bishop Peter Liu Guandong and
 Father Su Zhimin were administratively sentenced to 3 years'
 reeducatio- through labor. Some 15 unofficial priests
 reportedly were detained in Fujian in July, including Bishop
 Xie Shiguang and Auxiliary Bishop Huang Shoucheng. Bishops
 Casimir Wang Milu, Jiang Liren, Phillip Yang Lipo, Bartholomew
 Yu Chengdi and a number of priests in the unofficial Catholic
 Church reportedly remained incarcerated in 1990. Others were
 released but have had restrictions placed on their movements
 or activities, including Bishops Julius Jia Guozhi of Hebei
 and Joseph Fan Xueyan of Hebei who are reportedly under police
 surveillance and not free to function as clergy. Father
 Joseph Wang Ziyang and Father Xu Zhemin died in prison in
 1990. As many as 30 Protestant leaders are reportedly in
 detention or reeducation for their refusal to join the
 Three-Self Patriotic Movement. These include Reverend Xu
 Yongze, Reverend Song Yude, and Reverend Xu Guoxing.
 Many Tibetan Buddhists and Xinjiang Muslims continue to oppose
 Chinese rule over what they perceive as their homelands, and
 Chinese authorities have taken a harsh attitude toward both.
 The Government tightly controls and monitors Tibetan Buddhism
 and does not tolerate religious manifestations that advocate
 Tibetan independence. It recognizes the Dalai Lama as a major
 religious figure but condemns his political activities and his
 leadership of a "government in exile." A new law in May
 sharply limited religious freedom for Tibetan Buddhists. The
 law provided for government regulation of many religious
 activities, from burning incense to holding ceremonies. The
 1988 Xinjiang religion law places sharp restrictions on the
 
 
 858
 CHINA
 building of mosques and religious education of youths under
 18. Frustration over these restrictions was a major cause of
 the Islamic uprising in Xinjiang in April. After suppressing
 the uprising, authorities stopped construction of 153 mosques
 and closed 50 existing mosques and schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government uses an identification card system to control
 and restrict residence patterns within the country. Citizens
 are required to carry their cards at all times when out of
 doors (though many appparently ignore this rule) and must
 present them to authorities on demand. They are registered as
 residents of a particular jurisdiction and assigned to a
 specific work unit. Change of residence or workplace is very
 difficult and can, in most cases, be done only with government
 permission and agreement by the work unit. The Government has
 placed travel restrictions on several released detainees and
 religious figures. Authorities are trying to limit
 unauthorized migration to urban areas, but they estimate there
 are at least a million unregistered persons each in Shanghai,
 Guangzhou, and Beijing. Official tolerance of this "floating"
 population has varied with the economic need for a marginal
 work force in the big cities. Prior to the September Asian
 Games in Beijing, authorities cracked down on the capital's
 "floating" population, sending many of them back to the
 countryside and driving others deeper underground. Roadside
 security checks were also used at various times to control
 movement.
 Foreign travel continued to be strictly controlled, although
 the right to emigrate is generally observed. Some dissidents
 and religious figures have been denied permission to travel
 abroad. Authorities limited the number of Xinjiang Muslims
 permitted to attend the hajj in Saudi Arabia and, according to
 credible reports, the number of Tibetan Buddhists permitted to
 attend a major religious ceremony in northern India in
 December. The State Education Commission has stated on a
 number of occasions that a proper political attitude would be
 a major criterion in selecting people to go abroad for
 government-sponsored study.
 The State Education Commission also made efforts to restrict
 the number of privately sponsored students going abroad. On
 February 10, new regulations were implemented requiring those
 college and university graduates who received free
 postsecondary education to repay the cost of their education
 to the State by working for 5 years or more before being
 eligible for passports to go abroad to study. For'those who
 have not yet graduated and those with relatives overseas, the
 regulations provide a sliding scale of tuition reimbursement
 exempting them from the work requirement. Implementation of
 these regulations has varied from place to place, and many
 students are still managing to obtain passports. Moreover,
 persons who are subject to the regulations on study abroad
 appear to have little trouble obtaining passports to visit
 relatives overseas.
 The Government continued to relax restrictions on internal
 travel by foreigners. It increased the number of cities open
 to foreign visitors without special permission from 626 to
 664. Tibet and Xinjiang are again allowing tourists and
 diplomats to visit, although with significant restrictions.
 
 
 859
 CHINA
 Senior officials stated that students and scholars returning
 from overseas have not been and will not be punished for
 participation in prodemocracy activities while abroad. It is
 not clear whether this guarantee would apply to leaders of
 student dissident organizations. Officials state that at
 least 21,000 students and scholars have returned to China
 temporarily or permanently since June 1989, that over 17,000
 of them have since returned to their studies abroad, and that
 none has been punished or refused permission to leave the
 country again. No instance to the contrary has been
 reported. However, Chinese diplomatic posts have refused to
 renew or extend the passports of several dissident student
 leaders, and some Chinese students and scholars in the United
 States have asserted that they or their families have been
 subject to threats of reprisals by Chinese officials if they
 do not cease political activities.
 The Government accepts repatriation of citizens who. have
 entered other countries or territories illegally, in most
 cases apparently without punishing them. However, credible
 reports indicate that some Tibetans forcefully repatriated
 from Nepal were detained and beaten.
 Though China accepted more than 280,000 refugees, mostly
 ethnic Han Chinese, from Vietnam and Laos between 1978 and
 1982, in recent years it has adopted a stricter policy of "no
 new admissions." Recent reports state that China has
 cooperated with Hong Kong to reduce the flow of Vietnamese
 refugees into the colony. Although China signed the
 Comprehensive Plan of Action negotiated at the International
 Conference on Indochinese Refugees held in Geneva in June
 1989, it is unclear whether China considers itself a
 "participating state." Credible reports suggest the PRC has
 repatriated persons of other nationalities seeking refugee
 status. One refugee from North Korea reportedly was executed
 after repatriation from China.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right or the ability peacefully and
 legally to change their government. Chinese citizens can
 neither freely choose nor change the laws and officials which
 govern them. China is ruled by the Communist Party, the
 paramount source of political authority. Within the party, a
 closed inner circle of a few senior leaders exercises ultimate
 power over the nation. Some hold key positions within the
 six-member Standing Committee of the Politburo, the Central
 Military Commission, or other organs. Others are nominally
 retired but continue to exercise great political influence
 despite holding no formal positions in party or government.
 Deng Xiaoping remains first among equals in this latter
 group. These senior party leaders broadly determine policy,
 which is then implemented by the Government.
 According to the 1982 Constitution, the National People's
 Congress (NPC) is the highest organ of state power. It
 nominally selects the president and vice president, decides on
 the choice of the premier, and elects the chairman of the
 Central Military Commission. During the 1980's, the NPC had
 been granted, and had begun to exercise, increasing
 independence and influence. Debates had become much more
 open, and several important government proposals were sent
 back for revisions. After June 1989, however, the NPC
 reverted to its previous role of ratifying decisions already
 
 
 860
 CHINA
 made by the senior leadership. There is no longer any real
 debate in NPC public sessions, though debate in closed-door
 committee sessions on certain issues (i.e., the copyright law)
 is reportedly still fairly vigorous.
 The NPC is the highest of several levels of people's
 congresses. All but the lowest (township or municipal
 district level) are elected by the next lower level
 congresses. Grassroots elections since 1987 have featured
 multiple candidates and encouraged nominations from outside
 the CCP, though all candidacies must be approved by a local
 committee with strong CCP representation. In the 1990
 elections, many voters indicated that they knew little about
 the candidates and assumed that the people's congresses had
 little real power. The degree of CCP influence over election
 results is generally considered to increase at each higher
 level of people's congress.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no organizations within China which monitor or
 comment on human rights conditions. The Government has made
 it clear that it will not tolerate the existence of such
 groups.
 China rejects the concept of universal human rights despite
 its adherence to the United Nations Charter, which mandates
 respect for and promotion of human rights. Officials strongly
 reject any criticism of China's human rights situation by
 other nations or international organizations, and they argue
 that this use of human rights constitutes interference in
 China's internal affairs. They rejected reports on torture
 and other human rights violations by AI, Asia Watch, and other
 international human rights monitoring groups, and they
 protested publication of the Department of State's Country
 Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1989 as interference in
 the internal affairs of China. China's criticism of practices
 in other countries, such as Israel and South Africa, they
 insist, is different and does not constitute interference.
 While denying that human rights are universal, they repeatedly
 assert that the principle of noninterference in the internal
 affairs of other nations is universal.
 In 1990 Chinese officials organized several large conferences
 to discuss the concept of human rights. These conferences and
 official media commentaries asserted that "Marxist human
 rights," which emphasize collective rights and economic
 entitlements, are superior to "capitalist human rights" that
 stress individual civil and political liberties.
 Nevertheless, authorities were significantly more willing in
 1990 to engage in dialog with the United States and other
 governments on certain human rights issues, including China's
 family planning program, its judicial and penal systems,
 amnesties, and accounting for prisoners. In December, the
 Department of State's Assistant Secretary for Human Rights and
 Humanitarian Affairs visited Beijing and Shanghai at the
 invitation of the Chinese government for a series of
 substantive discussions on a wide range of human rights
 issues. Ministry of Justice officials facilitated visits by
 foreign diplomats to several penal institutions. Authorities
 in Tibet engaged in a dialog on human rights issues, were more
 accommodating in providing information and permitted a U.S.
 
 
 861
 CHINA
 official to visit Lhasa Prison in October. The impact, if
 any, of this nascent dialog was not yet clear at year's end.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While laws exist to protect minorities and women, in practice
 discrimination persists in housing, jobs, education, and other
 aspects of life based on ethnicity, sex, and religion.
 The economic progress of minorities is viewed by the
 Government as one of its significant achievements. Minorities
 benefit from a policy of "'privileged treatment" in marriage,
 family planning, university admission and employment, as well
 as disproportionate infrastructure investment in some minority
 areas. In practice, however, discrimination based on ethnic
 origin persists. The concept of a largely homogeneous Chinese
 people pervades the general thinking of the Han ethnic
 majority. The 55 designated ethnic minorities constitute just
 over 8 percent of the PRC's total population. Most minority
 groups reside in areas they have traditionally inhabited with
 standards of living far below the national average.
 Despite the CCP's avowed policy of increasing minority
 representation in the Government and in the CCP, ethnic
 minorities are effectively shut out of all but a few
 leadership positions and play a minor role in-decisionmaking.
 Some minorities resent Han officials holding key positions in
 minority autonomous regions. Ethnic minorities in Tibet,
 Xinjiang, and elsewhere have demonstrated against Han Chinese
 authority, and the underlying causes of unrest continue to
 fester. While martial law in Lhasa was lifted in May,
 authorities in both Tibet and Xinjiang have made it clear that
 they will not tolerate opposition to Beijing's rule in those
 minority regions.
 China has adopted some policies responsive to minority
 sensitivities. In Tibet and Xinjiang, there are two-track
 school systems using standard Chinese and minority languages.
 Students can choose which system to attend. One side effect
 of this policy, which was designed to protect and maintain
 minority cultures, has been a reinforcement of a highly
 segregated society. Under this separate educational system,
 those graduating from minority schools are at a disadvantage
 in competing for jobs in government and business, which
 require good spoken Chinese. These graduates must take
 remedial language instruction before attending universities
 and colleges.
 The 1982 Constitution states that "women in the People's
 Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres
 of life," and promises, among other things, equal pay for
 equal work. In fact, however, most women employed in industry
 work in lower skilled and lower paid jobs, and there was no
 significant improvement in upholding women's rights or in the
 working conditions of women in 1990. There is a significant
 wage gap between men and women performing the same tasks.
 Women who graduate from college are less likely than men to be
 placed in prestigious positions. Women hold relatively few
 positions of significant influence within the party or
 government structure. None of the current members of the
 party's ruling Politburo is a woman, and few women occupy key
 managerial and supervisory positions within the Government
 structure.
 
 
 862
 CHINA
 By some standards, the status of women has regressed in recent
 years. Women have often been the unintended victims of
 economic reforms designed to streamline enterprises and give
 workers greater job mobility; for women, these reforms have
 often translated into job insecurity and cutbacks in welfare
 programs. Many employers prefer to hire men to avoid the
 expense of maternity leave and child care. Complaints from
 women of discrimination, unfair dismissal, demotion, or wage
 cuts when they needed maternity leave have risen
 significantly. According to the Chinese press, a substantial
 majority of the those laid off in the course of economic
 streamlining have been women.
 While the gap in the education levels of men and women is
 narrowing, men continue to constitute the majority of the
 educated, particularly the highly educated. Women now make up
 over one-third of both high school and university students. A
 disproportionate number of government-funded scholarships for
 overseas study go to men. Women reportedly need higher scores
 than men to gain admission to select universities.
 The Government strongly condemns and is working hard to curb
 traditional abhorrent practices against women such as the
 abduction and selling of women for wives, abuse of female
 children, violence against women, and female infanticide.
 These problems persist, however, despite government efforts to
 eradicate them.
 Many of these discriminatory practices are rooted in
 traditional rural attitudes and values. Rural parents tend to
 view girls as liabilities because they are less productive
 income earners and leave home without providing assistance for
 their parents' retirement; boys are more highly valued as
 prospective income earners and as future caretakers for
 elderly parents. A number of provinces have sought to reduce
 the perceived higher economic value of boys in providing
 old-age support by establishing more retirement homes and
 improving the quality of those homes already in existence.
 Finally, there is evidence of discrimination in China on the
 basis of religion. Communist Party officials state that party
 membership and religious belief are incompatible. This places
 a serious limitation on religious believers, since party
 membership is required for almost all high positions in
 government and commerce. While there are some religious
 believers in the party, especially in minority autonomous
 regions, few hold substantial leadership positions. Most
 government officials responsible for religious affairs work
 are not religious believers.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The PRC's 1982 Constitution provides for "freedom of
 association," but the guarantee is heavily qualified by
 references to the interest of the State and the leadership of
 the CCP. Though trade union officials recognize that workers'
 interests may not always coincide with those of the party,
 they believe their role encompasses both passing CCP demands
 and propaganda down to the workers and channeling worker
 demands upward to the enterprise, the party, and the
 Government.
 While union membership is voluntary for individual employees,
 
 
 863
 CHINA
 it is compulsory for each enterprise, including joint
 ventures, to have a union. The All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions (ACFTU), nominally an independent organization, is in
 fact closely controlled by the Communist Party. Virtually all
 state sector workers and nearly 90 percent of all urban
 workers belong to ACFTU chapters. Unemployed workers are not
 considered union members.
 There are no independent trade unions in China. In 1983 the
 ACFTU added a new clause to its Constitution requiring that
 any attempt to set up or dissolve a union be endorsed by its
 membership and approved by higher bodies in the national trade
 union structure. Thus, workers are allowed to organize worker
 groups independently, but once they have decided to form a
 union, they are forced to affiliate with, and accept the
 leadership of, the official trade union authorities. Several
 workers who attempted to form unions independent of the ACFTU
 in 1989 remained in detention throughout 1990.
 ACFTU international activities are subject to policy guidance
 from the CCP, as reflected in its break with the Soviet-
 controlled World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in the late
 1950's, following which there were no known contacts with
 Soviet trade unions until the recent Sino-Soviet thaw. The
 ACFTU currently claims to have contacts with trade unions in
 over 120 countries, without regard to whether the foreign
 union is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the WFTU, or other organizations-.
 China is a member of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) and has recently ratified two ILO conventions, one on
 equal pay and equal work for women and another on tripartite
 consultations, bringing the total China has ratified to 17.
 However, it has not ratified either Convention 87 on freedom
 of association or Convention 98 on the right to organize and
 collective bargaining. The ILO's Governing Body and Committee
 on Freedom of Association in 1990 extensively examined an
 ICFTU complaint stemming from China's suppression of the
 independent Workers.' Autonomous Federations in June 1989.
 They noted China's unprecedented provision of information on
 91 of the 130 persons named in the complaint but expressed
 deep concern about severity of sentences and restrictions on
 union activity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the labor contract system that now covers approximately
 10 percent of China's work force, individual workers may
 negotiate with management over contract terms. In practice,
 however, only the very few workers with highly technical
 skills are able to negotiate effectively on salary and fringe
 benefits issues.
 The Government does not permit collective bargaining. Without
 legal status as a collective bargaining body, the ACFTU's role
 has been restricted to a consultative one in the
 decisionmaking process over wages and regulations affecting
 labor. At present the terms and conditions of employment,
 including wages, are unilaterally determined through
 administrative regulations. Trade unions have limited
 themselves to-channeling workers' complaints to the management
 of individual enterprises or municipal government labor
 bureaus.
 A 1988 law states that trade unions in private enterprises
 have the right to represent employees and to sign collective
 
 
 864
 CHINA
 agreements with the enterprises. The significance of this is
 muted by the fact that the work force of private enterprises
 now accounts for less than 1 percent of Chinese urban workers.
 Moreover, there have been no reports of instances in which
 unions in private enterprises have undertaken collective
 bargaining over wage, contract, or safety issues.
 Worker congresses, organized in most Chinese enterprises,
 technically have the authority to remove incompetent managers
 and approve major decisions affecting the enterprise (notably
 wage and bonus distribution systems). Worker congresses
 generally meet only once a year, however, and appear to act
 primarily as rubber stamps on agreements worked out among
 factory managers, party secretaries, and union representatives.
 In addition, a dispute settlement procedure has been in effect
 since 1987. According to the procedure, workers who wish to
 grieve a dismissal or other unfair practice must first appeal
 to an arbitration committee within the factory. If they are
 not satisfied with the committee's decision they can appeal to
 a local arbitration committee, chaired by a local labor bureau
 official with representatives from the union and the
 enterprise. If not satisfied with this committee's decision,
 the worker can bring the matter to court. In practice this
 has rarely, if ever, been done.
 The right to strike, which had been included in China's 1975
 and 1978 constitutions, was removed from the 1982
 Constitution. However, in 1983 the chairman of the ACFTU
 stated that, if a trade union and its labor protection safety
 officers found that a workplace was too dangerous, the union
 should organize the workers to leave the hazardous areas.
 Thus, Chinese authorities usually view strikes as justified
 only when they respond to problems such as a sudden
 deterioration in safety conditions.
 Ministry of Labor officials have stated that there had been no
 strikes for the past 3 years.' Chinese labor officials admit,
 however, that in 1990 there were many work stoppages or
 slowdowns which were quickly resolved at the factory level.
 There have been reports of slowdowns and demonstrations held
 in Shanghai, Chongqing, and several other cities over the
 issue of wages and benefits paid during temporary layoffs.
 Incidents are usually resolved without the need for
 intervention from outside the enterprise.
 Laws governing working conditions in China's special economic
 zones are not significantly different from those in the
 country at large. However, the Ministry of Labor recently
 issued a regulation which stipulates that wages paid to
 workers in foreign joint ventures may not exceed by more than
 120 percent the wages paid to workers in state-run
 enterprises. If profits are high, the joint ventures may pay
 up to 150 percent more than state-run enterprises, but higher
 salaries must be approved by local labor bureaus. In
 addition, there are many reports of joint venture managers
 being pressured to appoint party members or the unit's party
 secretary to management positions. Joint ventures, like their
 state enterprise counterparts, are required to have unions
 affiliated with the ACFTU.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While China has generally abandoned its traditional use of
 massive corvee labor for construction of infrastructure
 
 
 865
 CHINA
 projects and public facilities, workers are still frequently
 "mobilized" to augment public security forces and for public
 works projects. In 1990 many Beijing residents were required
 to work on projects in preparation for the Asian Games, and
 peasants in some rural areas were required to work on large
 irrigation projects.
 Imprisonment in China, except for those in detention centers,
 generally entails compulsory labor. Almost all those
 sentenced by the courts to prison or labor reform camps are
 required to work, usually for little compensation. In
 addition, China maintains a network of reeducation through
 labor camps (see Section l.e.), with an officially reported
 inmate population of 160,000.
 Under the "staying at prison employment" system, some
 prisoners are denied permission to return to their homes after
 release- and instead are forced to remain and work in the
 vicinity of the prison. For those assigned to camps far from
 their residences, this constitutes a form of internal exile.
 Ministry of Justice officials stated that while this system
 was extensively used during the Cultural Revolution, fewer
 than 2,000 foimer prisoners had lived and worked under this
 program since 1980, and only 546 were involved at the end of
 August. Some researchers outside China believe these official
 statistics understate reality by several orders of magnitude;
 independent verification of the numbers has not been possible.
 Chinese penal policy emphasizes "reform first, production
 second," but labor is an integral part of the system both for
 rehabilitation and in order to help support the facilities.
 Prisoners in both labor reform and labor reeducation normally
 spend a maximum of 6 hours per day working and 3 hours per day
 studying. Chinese officials state that export of prison labor
 products is not authorized, but reliable reports indicate that
 some such products are sold on the international market.
 China has not ratified ILO Conventions 29 and 105 on forced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Regulations promulgated in 1987 prohibit the employment of
 school-age minors who have not completed the compulsory 9
 years of education. The employment of child labor is fairly
 common, however, particularly in rural areas. One indication
 of the problem is the percentage of school-age children
 enrolled in school. A recent survey of 1,062 villages and
 neighborhoods supported by the United Nations Children's Fund
 revealed that only 77 percent of children between the ages of
 6 and 14 were in school. In some cases, even where schools
 are available, children and their families are lured by the
 promise of cash wages. The Guangdong province labor bureau
 has resorted in some cases to paying monthly subsidies to
 parents of students to encourage them to keep their children
 in school.
 In September 1988, the Ministry of Labor issued a circular
 designed to curb child labor problems. It imposed severe
 fines, withdrawal of business licenses, or jail for employers
 who hire child laborers under 16 years old. However,
 enforcement has been haphazard. Provincial officials in
 Guangdong, where the problem of child labor is particularly
 serious, were unable to say how many enterprises have been
 prosecuted for child labor violations.

 CHINA
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 China does not have a labor code, and there appears to have
 been little or no progress in 1990 on the drafting of a code
 under consideration for several years.
 There is no minimum wage in China, although administrative
 regulations reportedly fix the minimum "living wage" for an
 urban worker at around $9 monthly. The Government required
 enterprises to guarantee this basic wage when many enterprises
 temporarily laid off workers during production stoppages in
 the first half of 1990.
 A large proportion of workers' incomes come from bonuses or
 subsidies added to a basic wage rate. According to official
 estimates, 54 percent of the average worker's income derives
 from basic salary, while 26 percent comes as a bonus, and 20
 percent consists of health, food, heating, or transportation
 subsidies. For the last 2 years, however, Chinese workers
 have been pressured to buy government bonds at their work
 units. In many cases, bond purchases total as much as 15
 percent of a worker's income. In addition, there have been
 widespread reports that workers in Beijing and elsewhere were
 required to donate as much as 5 percent of their salaries to
 support the Asian games, held in Beijing in September and
 October.
 The legal maximum workweek excluding overtime is 48 hours, of
 which 3 to 12 hours are generally spent in political study or
 "education" on current social issues.
 At factories and construction sites, occupational health and
 safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns. Every
 work unit must designate a health and safety officer; the ILO
 has established a training program for these officials.
 Despite this, general health and safety conditions in the
 workplace are poor. The safety consciousness of both workers
 and managers is generally low.' State procurators deal
 annually with thousands of negligence and accident cases
 involving criminal or civil liability. The absence of a
 national labor code, however, makes enforcement of safety
 regulations by labor bureaus extremely difficult.

 EDITORIAL NOTE
 
 This volume continues the series first published in a reprinted
 edition in 1982 and containing Country Reports on Human Rights
 Practices from 1977 through 1980 (except 1978 when no such report
 was prepared), and the less regular Reports on Human Rights Prac-
 tices in Countries Receiving United States Aid for 1976 and 1978.
 The practice of the Department of State to submit to Congress the
 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices on an annual basis has
 continued through the 1980s an&into the 1990s. This does not seem
 to be the case with the Reports on Human Rights in Countries
 Receiving United States Aid. The last of these reports was submitted
 by the Department of State to Congress in 1979.
 This reprint series continues to publish these reports for the later
 years as they become available.
